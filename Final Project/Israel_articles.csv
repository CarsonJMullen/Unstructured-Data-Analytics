Some Indian American Democrats see themselves in Harris. Others see the limits,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5131223/some-indian-american-democrats-see-themselves-in-harris-others-see-the-limits,2024-10-08T21:57:10Z,"In the warm Georgia heat, Kannan Udayarajan is sipping chai and talking politics at an Indian restaurant in a small strip mall in suburban Atlanta.

There used to be only one Indian restaurant here, Udayarajan says, in this corner of adjoining suburbs at the edge of Forsyth County.

""Now in a 10 mile radius we probably have 40 to 50 at a minimum.""

The exponential rise in Indian restaurants follows a wave of Desi immigrants here. Desi is a term many people from the South Asian diaspora use to describe themselves. These immigrants are no longer primarily landing in traditional South Asian strongholds, like California and New York, but are also reshaping states like Texas and Georgia, helping transform metropolitan suburbs into some of the most diverse spaces in American life. Indian Americans now make up the second largest immigrant population in the United States.

Udayarajan says he's been a political junkie ever since he came to America for work in 2007. He hadn't planned to stay, but he got married and had kids, and in 2018 he became a citizen. Still, he didn't get involved in local politics until 2020, when former President Donald Trump was running for his second term. Udayarajan organized in his own community, helping register Indian Americans to vote, sometimes teaching them about American democracy.

""Joe Biden won Georgia by 11,780 votes,"" he says. ""And Forsyth County polled16,000 brand new Democratic votes in that election. So we made an impact.""

South Asians are one of the most progressive Asian American communities, a realignment that dates back to 9/11 and the policies and racial animus that followed. A recent Pew Research Center study found that 68 percent of Indian registered voters identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning.

Two years ago, Udayarajan became the head of the Forsyth County Democratic Party. He says this year, he believes Desis could again make the difference in a battleground state like Georgia.

Udayarajan is joined at the restaurant by Ashwin Ramaswami, a 25-year-old who was born and raised just a few blocks away in Johns Creek. Udayarajan asks Ramaswami if he thinks the South Asians here are excited about Vice President Kamala Harris' nomination for president.

""I see a huge amount of excitement,"" Ramaswami tells him. Udayarajan asks if it's more among the immigrant community or among folks who were born here?

""I think everyone,"" Ramaswami says. ""It's so different to have a presidential nominee called Kamala, right? Kamala is a Sanskrit word.""

A meme circulating on messaging apps and other social media has been hard to miss. The meme goes that in Sanskrit, Kamala means ""lotus,"" but in America Kamala means POTUS -- President of the United States.

""The ticket's been supercharged for the Desi community,"" Ramaswami says. He points out a personal overlap: Harris' mother is from the same village as his mother in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

""People can see the connections, they can see their own stories in her, because politics -- a lot of it is about the policy, but it's also about can you trust the person you're going to be electing.""

Ramaswami left John's Creek to go off to school, and then work. Now he's returned and is making a run for Georgia state Senate. He's part of another growing group -- young South Asian Americans running for office.

At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this past summer, South Asians gathered everywhere: Delegate meetups and happy hours and networking lunches.

""For all the years that I've been involved in politics, I've been part of the broader Asian American community,"" says Ann Lata Kalayil, co-founder of the South Asian American Policy and Research Institute. ""But more recently, we've started talking about South Asian Americans."" She points out the number of times she heard ""Indian American"" mentioned on the DNC stage and in the media to describe Harris. ""There's a real sense of pride, you know?""

Deep Singh Badhesha grew up in predominantly white Colorado Springs, Colo.

""I was the only South Asian there,"" he says. ""I was always trying to find my identity, but it was hard,"" he says, because no one at school looked like him. He describes experiencing a classic Asian American childhood experience -- the lunchbox moment. ""Your mother will make you a deliciously cooked Indian dish"" Badhesha explains, ""and you'll bring it to school and you open it up and everyone's like, oh, what the hell is that gross food?""

He says when it happened to him he felt like an outsider, so he broke off parts of himself to fit in.

""I used to actually be a super Republican and libertarian person because I used to look for folks like Bobby Jindal or Nikki Haley. And I'm like -- 'oh this is where South Asians look like they're having acceptance, right?'""

Then he went to college and met South Asian peers.

""They instilled a lot more pride in who I was,"" he says.

Badhesha believes things are different now.

""Being in this moment and seeing a lot of young folks in particular who see themselves in the Democratic Party -- who see themselves in Ro Khanna or Pramila Jayapal -- and of course Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, you know, it's like a huge moment for South Asians.""

Back in the Atlanta suburbs, another group of South Asians are meeting to talk politics, but there is no celebration over Harris' nomination.

""It stings, right?"" says Anjali Enjeti. ""I mean, boy, would I love to celebrate a Black, Jamaican, Indian woman.""

Enjeti says she cannot support Harris because of the Democratic party's political, military and financial support for Israel, and what is happening in Gaza and in other parts of the Middle East.

""It feels like a betrayal that when we finally get somebody who we can relate to in some way, to have them support and enforce a genocide is -- it's just devastating.""

Israel stands accused of war crimes and genocide in front of the International Criminal Court, whose preliminary finding is that it is plausible Israel has violated the convention against genocide. Israel and the Biden administration strongly deny the charges.

Enjeti and Harris are both half Indian, and they can each trace their roots back to southern India. Enjeti says that is where the similarities to Harris end.

""I think identity politics is a trap,"" she says. ""It is a trap to think that somebody's shared demographics or community has anything to do with your values.""

Enjeti is sitting with Farhana Rahman, remembering 2020. They registered voters and knocked on doors and drove people to the polls.

""We were screamed at,"" Enjeti says. ""We faced very real physical threats. We risked it all for Biden to win in Georgia.""

""That same me has done nothing this election cycle,"" Rahman adds.

Rahman says as an Indian American Muslim, she believes another Trump presidency is a ""existential threat to democracy,"" even potentially to her own safety. But she says she doesn't feel safe now. She says she's afraid to speak out against the conflict in Gaza and she's reluctant to tell colleagues and acquaintances that she is Muslim.

""I feel like I have to hide my identity,"" she says. ""It's unfortunate, but the level of Islamophobia, just making it so prevalent -- people can say horrible things to Muslims, and it's completely okay.""

She believes she has faced more Islamophobia and repression in the past year than she did after 9/11.

""After October 7th, it has become extremely dividing to the point where being a Muslim automatically means you are pro-Hamas and [an] anti-Semite.""

Rahman says she still doesn't know who she will vote for on Election Day, but she says the options only fill her with sadness and fear."
Two Jewish Democrats reflect on Congressional efforts to combat surge in antisemitism,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5125793/jewish-democrats-antisemitism-congress,2024-10-08T20:41:44Z,"Reps. Jared Moskowitz, Kathy Manning, Josh Gottheimer, and Dan Goldman speak at a press conference in April about allegations of harassment and antisemitism against Jewish students at Columbia University.

As Congress continues to deal with the policy and political implications of Hamas' attack on southern Israel one year ago, lawmakers are also reflecting on the rise of antisemitism in the United States.

Jewish Americans represent about 2 percent of the population and were the target of 16 percent of hate crimes in 2023 - a surge of over 60 percent from the year before, according to the FBI's hate crime statistics report. Current figures are likely higher, given reports that anti-Jewish animus has been higher since Oct. 7 and the report only captures a few months of data post-attack.

North Carolina Rep. Kathy Manning and Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz, two Jewish Democratic lawmakers, are working to address the issue despite political divisions within Congress and their own party.

""There's been a change in this country from, you know, the swastika on a wall that happened once in a while or someone being accosted on the street once in a while to the point where you can't even keep up with all the antisemitic attacks that are going on,"" Moskowitz said.

Manning, who co-chairs the House bipartisan task force for combatting antisemitism, said she's been tracking the rise in anti-Jewish hate over the last year.

""I think it's important to remember the attacks began before Israel had any response, before they sent any troops into Gaza,"" she said. ""We saw people being threatened. We saw violent language used against Jews. And, of course, we've seen the eruption of antisemitic behavior on college campuses across the country.""

The rise in demonstrations on college campuses last spring was the subject of various committee hearings in the halls of Congress. House Speaker Mike Johnson brought a Republican delegation to visit Columbia University. Manning and Moskowitz were part of a separate visit with Jewish Democratic lawmakers.

""We didn't go to Columbia because we had a problem with students protesting. They have every right to protest,"" said Moskowitz. ""We went to Columbia because Jewish students were afraid to go to school.""

Protesters on campuses maintained their aim was to show public support for the people in Gaza and to demand their universities divest from companies with ties to Israel.

""We've always been told that you can be anti-Zionist without being antisemitic. And I would say that you could. As it turns out, they're just not,"" Moskowitz said. ""And the reason why is they're not surrounding Israeli students going to class. They're surrounding a kid wearing a Jewish star going to class. They don't know his position on Israel. Maybe he's anti-Israel, but he's Jewish.""

He said the protests highlighted the need for Congress to step in.

""If what was happening on college campuses were not about Jews, if people in hoods were encircling Black kids, blocking them from class, or some right-wing extremist group was targeting the LGBT kids, we don't believe it would have gotten past lunchtime on the first day,"" Moskowitz said. ""We believe Congress would have acted.""

Congress has taken steps over the last year in response to rising antisemitism but there are ongoing divisions about what elements are most important to address at the federal level and which policies will actually lead to solutions.

In May, the House passed the Antisemitism Awareness Act, which would see the adoption of the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance's definition of antisemitism when reviewing complaints of discrimination in programs that receive federal financial assistance. The bill goes further than an executive order former President Donald Trump signed in 2019 and opponents say it could restrict free speech. The measure has not been taken up by the Senate.

Manning spent nine months with House colleagues and counterparts in the Senate negotiating what she calls the ""most comprehensive bill"" on antisemitism that incorporates the guidance outlined in the Biden administration's national strategy to counter antisemitism. The result is the Countering Antisemitism Act, which would establish a position in the White House to coordinate federal efforts to counter antisemitism across various agencies and to conduct a study that analyzes the prevalence of online antisemitic content. The bill would also appoint a senior official within the Department of Education to be responsible for addressing antisemitism on college campuses.

That bill has yet to be brought to the floor for a vote by Republican leadership.

Moskowitz says the issue more broadly has highlighted what he calls schisms within his own party.

""It was real easy for Democrats, right, when it was just [GOP Rep.] Marjorie Taylor Greene talking about Jewish space lasers to go call her out, or easy when Tucker Carlson has a Holocaust denier on his show to call him out,"" Moskowitz said. ""I didn't see the same level of interest on calling out the antisemitism when it was within your own tent.""

He said Democratic lawmakers weren't unified in their condemnation of some of the violent language being used on campuses.

""As soon as they saw there was division in our party, the Republicans jumped right in from a political issue, from a fundraising issue, and wanted to drive that wedge. We made it easy for them to do that, by the way, when there are people protesting in front of college campuses saying, 'go back to Poland, kill all the Zionists.' And like several of my progressive members are like, 'Oh, look, it's raining today.'

Manning said the events of the past year have brought Jewish members in the House closer together but support from colleagues has been uneven.

""What I have experienced is not antisemitism from my colleagues, but willful ignorance of what so many of us are experiencing,"" she said.

Moskowitz agreed.

""A lot of other members are scared to step out because they don't want to get targeted,"" he said. ""They don't want to get protested in their district and don't want police in front of their house, which I have 24-hours a day.""

He said that police protection began within weeks of October 7, based on death threats against him and his children, ages 7 and 10.

""It's not a pleasant time to be Jewish at the moment,"" he said. ""Almost every Jewish member has this story. My grandparents were Holocaust survivors. And there are bits and pieces of stories my grandmother's told me that are repeating themselves. Different - not the same, but similar threats. And Jews see and feel that. So we'll have to see what the new Congress wants to do. The schisms that exist on this issue are still going to exist.""

Manning adds she hears from Jews across the country worrying about what the future holds, and asking if Congress can help.

""I think so many Jews, particularly of my generation and older, carry all of those stories on their shoulders -- the history of the Crusades, and the Inquisition, and the pogroms and the Holocaust. When I talk to people about what the difference is today is all those other disasters that happened to the Jews were perpetrated by the governments of those countries. What's happening today in the United States, not only is it not perpetrated by our government, our government is trying to put into place structures to combat that antisemitism,"" she said. ""And that's the thing that gives me hope moving forward."""

As Hurricane Milton intensifies and heads toward Florida's Gulf Coast, residents are not only preparing for weather impacts but also dealing with misinformation about FEMA. The disaster relief agency has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in aid so far to help those affected by Hurricane Helene. Former President Donald Trump claims FEMA is running out of money after spending it on undocumented migrants. However, FEMA's administrator says those false claims are discouraging people from applying for the federal funds they desperately need.

Israelis yesterday observed a day of grief and reflection to mark one year since the Hamas-led attacks on communities near the country's border. Multiple memorials took place, partly due to disagreements over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence on continuing the war in Gaza. Families of hostages and their supporters boycotted the official government memorial service. They're seeking an immediate cease-fire deal to end the war and secure the release of the remaining 101 hostages.

In a wide-ranging interview with 60 Minutes yesterday, Vice President Harris was pressed for specifics on how she would pay for her economic plans and work to end the war in Ukraine. Her appearance on the show is part of a long tradition of presidential candidates sitting for interviews with 60 Minutes, dating back to 1968. Trump has criticized Harris for being unwilling to sit for difficult interviews with the press. The show says Trump was scheduled to appear for an interview as well, but his campaign canceled last week. Here's a deeper dive into Harris' responses during the interview.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Michigan to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

In 2017, Trump introduced ""Opportunity Zones,"" a tax incentive program aimed at encouraging investment in low-income and distressed communities like Detroit. Some were concerned at the time that investors would benefit more from the program than residents. Detroit Public Radio's Russ McNamara says it's a ""firm maybe"" that the program has reached its goal. Listen to hear more about what the program has achieved so far and how development in Opportunity Zones can be measured.

One boy's story shows the impact of rising Israeli settler violence in the West Bank,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/the-picture-show/2024/10/08/g-s1-22630/photos-palestinian-family-impact-israeli-settler-violence-occupied-west-bank,2024-10-08T11:33:53Z,"Noor Assi, 15, sits on his bed while watched by his 5-year-old sister Jenna in the village of Qarawat Bani Hassan, Israeli-occupied West Bank, on Feb. 23. Ayman Oghanna for NPR hide caption

In a carpentry shop in the village of Qarawat Bani Hassan, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Noor Assi is at work packaging a wooden table. He tears off strips of tape, tying it to padded cardboard, before flipping the table on its side.

He says he is 15 ""and a half,"" a measurement in age split between the innocence of youth and a desire for manhood.

The war in Gaza has caused tensions to flare across the Middle East, especially in places like the West Bank. The Israeli-occupied territory is the most violent it has been in decades. United Nations figures say that almost 700 Palestinians in the area have been killed, either by Israeli forces or settlers, in the past year. Noor's father was among those fatally shot.

""My childhood is gone,"" Noor says. He was forced to grow up by a grim rite of passage.

On Dec. 2, Israeli settlers raided his village in the central West Bank and shot his father, Ahmed Assi, dead, according to the family, residents and local officials.

The Israeli military told NPR that they responded to a physical confrontation between Palestinians and Israeli citizens in Qarawat Bani Hassan with riot disposal means and live fire and that the circumstances of Assi's death were still under review.

Ahmed Assi's mother, Noor's grandmother, shows bloodied clothes and a sweatshirt with a single bullet hole in the back. Assi's 5-year-old daughter, Jenna, looks on, wearing a necklace with a picture of her dead dad.

""When my father was martyred, I started to work, I took over my father's profession, I started working and spending on the house. I was smart and managed things, meaning I became responsible for the house,"" Noor says.

Noor dropped out of school, working full time in the family's carpentry warehouse, sometimes for 13 hours a day, to provide for his five siblings.

""I am responsible for them now. I take care of them and whatever they want, I get them. I don't let them want for anything.""

Noor looks young, is shy and has a boyish haircut -- long on top, a fade on the sides and back. He maintains his look with regular visits to the village barbershop.

In the Middle East, the barbershop is not just a place to cut your hair. It's also a place to socialize, hang out and talk about everything from family to sports and politics. Not long after Noor gets his trim, the village's mayor, Ibrahim Assi, enters. He is a distant relative of Noor's. It's a small community and family ties are strong. A poster of Noor's deceased father is plastered outside.

The mayor explains that Qarawat Bani Hassan is surrounded by an ever-expanding network of Israeli settlements and outposts. About 500,000 Israeli settlers live in the occupied West Bank, according to the United Nations. The settlements they live in are deemed illegal by the international community. Israeli politicians like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, have promoted their expansion, and they're growing through a web of smaller outposts.

The mayor says that violence from the settlers is terrorizing the Palestinians who live here.

""The West Bank is currently living in a nightmare, a nightmare that has lost its security and safety due to the violence of the Ministry of Settlers, who are -- on a daily basis -- assaulting, killing and harassing and stealing. They are committing real crimes against citizens and farmers that are present on their own land,"" the mayor says.

On Dec. 2, he says, settlers entered the village, damaging property, burning cars, wounding one man and shooting Noor's father dead. His lifeless body was found hours later in an olive grove on the outskirts of Qarawat Bani Hassan.

Noor may maintain his teenage haircut. But he has the hardened hands of an older working man, no longer hanging out with friends, devoting himself, instead, to work, faith and family.

At home, he helps out with the household chores, learning to cook from his mother. He sometimes feels pangs of envy for other teenagers.

""I do get jealous, I sometimes feel like playing, like them, but it doesn't work. I have a family to take care of,"" Noor says.

On Friday, the holiest day of the week in Islam, Noor prays at the village mosque before his weekly ritual of visiting his father's grave, draped in a Palestinian flag.

Prayer is important to Noor, from morning to night. Fighting back tears, he says the Islamic funeral prayer for his father on the porch outside his home.

""O God, forgive him and have mercy on him, and heal him, and pardon him, and grant him an honorable reception.""

Noor says that each night, after prayer, he speaks to his father.

""I tell him what is happening, what we are doing, and who is coming over, for example,"" he says. ""Last time, he came to me in a dream and told me, 'Take care of your family and your brothers.' """

Harris and Trump marked 1 year since the Oct. 7 attacks with tributes to the victims,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144699/kamala-harris-donald-trump-october-7,2024-10-07T22:25:41Z,"One year after Hamas attacked Israel, both major-party presidential candidates marked the date on Monday with promises of continued support for the Jewish state.

Vice President Harris remembered the victims of the Oct. 7 attack by planting a memorial tree at her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., while former President Trump visited a sacred site for Hasidic Jews in Queens, N.Y.

""I will never forget October 7, and the world must never forget,"" Harris said during a tree-planting ceremony on the grounds of the vice president's residence. ""We must work to ensure nothing like the horrors of October 7 can ever happen again.""

Hamas, which controls Gaza, killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7 and took some 250 hostage in Gaza, according to Israel. A year later, more than 100 hostages are still unaccounted for. Israel's response to the attack has killed at least 41,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials.

Harris reiterated her support for Israel's defense, and promised the Biden administration would continue working to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. She then read the names of seven missing American citizens.

Harris also called for efforts to ""relieve the immense suffering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza who have experienced so much pain and loss over the year.""

She appeared alongside her husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish and and who has led White House efforts to fight antisemitism.

Trump met with members of an Orthodox Jewish community in New York on Monday morning, and visited the grave of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, an influential orthodox rabbi who died in 1994. Trump was then scheduled to attend an Oct. 7 remembrance event Monday evening with Jewish leaders, according to Trump campaign officials.

Hamas' stated goal is the elimination of Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel says the objective of the war in Gaza is to eliminate Hamas.

The war has exposed rifts within the Democratic Party over the Biden-Harris administration's support for Israel. Those divides are particularly pronounced among younger voters -- a key voting bloc for Democrats and a group more likely than older voters to express sympathy for the Palestinian people. According to the Pew Research Center, voters ages 18-29 also are less supportive of U.S. military aid to Israel.

Trump has sought to capitalize on those tensions within his rival's party, saying recently that any Jewish voter who supports a Democrat is a ""fool."" Those remarks drew widespread criticism from Jewish organizations across the ideological spectrum.

He continued emphasizing the message in an interview Monday with radio host Hugh Hewitt. ""I did more for Israel than anybody, I did more for the Jewish people than anybody, and it's not a reciprocal, as they say,"" Trump said."

For Palestinian civilians caught in the middle of the ongoing conflict between Israeli forces and the Hamas militant group, the consequences have been unremittingly difficult, and deadly.

The death toll from Israel's offensive in Gaza is now approaching 42,000 Palestinians, with another 39 deaths recorded Monday at local hospitals, according to Gaza's health authorities.

Hamas, designated a terrorist group by the United States and several other nations, has seen its control over territory in Gaza diminish over the past 12 months, leaving a political and logistical vacuum that international aid groups have struggled to fill.

Cease-fire talks between Hamas and Israel, brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, are on hold, so for civilians in Gaza, the forced displacement that for many began last October, still has no end in sight.

In the Deir al-Balah region of central Gaza, 58-year-old Abu Nidal Musleh lives in a makeshift tent, wearing mismatched shoes.

The father of seven comes from the same area of northern Gaza were civilians were once again ordered to evacuate Monday, and he's been displaced four times in the last year.

When Hamas-led fighters attacked communities in southern Israel a year ago, they killed more than 1,200 and seized about 250 hostages, according to Israeli officials. Musleh was a teacher on his way to school that day.

He told NPR on Monday he feels empathy for the Israeli hostages held by Hamas -- but he blames Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the suffering both sides have endured, and he insists peace will only be possible if Israeli citizens oust their premier.

""Rise up against Netanyahu,"" he said. ""Rise up -- so we can have normal relations.""

Meanwhile, in the West Bank, violence has worsened in the past year between Palestinian militants belonging to Hamas and other armed groups, and Israeli settlers and the Israeli military, which oversees the occupied territory with a vast network of checkpoints and military outposts.

Over the past few months, some of the heaviest Israeli airstrikes in decades have rocked Palestinian communities in the West Bank, killing dozens, alongside large-scale raids into cities including Jenin.

In Ramallah, the Israeli-occupied West Bank's biggest city, dozens of Palestinians gathered in the main square Monday, waving Palestinian flags and carrying anti-occupation signs.

Basma Abu Sway said she had come to mark one year since the war in Gaza began, and called last Oct. 7 one of the most important days in Palestinian history.

She said she hopes the sacrifices made by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank will not be for nothing.

""All this blood, all this death is bringing peace to Palestine,"" she said. ""We deserve as Palestinian people to live in complete liberation.""

Settler violence and Israeli military raids into towns and villages in the West Bank have killed more than 730 Palestinians since the beginning of the war, according to a combined count of data from the United Nations and Palestinian health authorities.

On Monday the Palestinian advocacy group, Palestinian Prisoners' Club,, announced that Israeli military forces had arrested 45 people through Sunday night into Monday morning across the West Bank.

Rima Nazzal was also in Ramallah's Manara Square Monday, and said she felt concern and fear -- worried that Israel's occupation of Palestinians would grow stronger as a result of the its military's actions after Oct. 7 last year.

""The world says Israel has a right to defend itself,"" she said. ""As if it says Israel has a right to defend its occupation."""

This story is a part of an NPR series reflecting on Oct. 7, a year of war and how it has changed life across Israel, the Gaza Strip, the region and the world.

NPR journalists have spent the past year witnessing, capturing and documenting the suffering and pain that war has inflicted on people in the Gaza Strip, Israel, the occupied West Bank and Lebanon.

For Israelis, it began when Hamas militants stormed out of the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7 last year, attacking soldiers, families in their homes and a rave packed with young people. The attacks killed around 1,200 people and took 250 hostage, according to Israeli authorities.

Israelis have been divided since: Many have spent the past year in rallies demanding a cease-fire that frees the hostages. Others have pressed their government to continue fighting Hamas, even blocking aid crossing into Gaza.

In Gaza, nothing looks the same a year into the war. Among the more than 41,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire this past year are hundreds of families, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. More than half of those killed are women and children. Around 100,000 others in Gaza have been wounded, thousands of them children who have lost limbs.

A year on, nearly everyone in Gaza is displaced, huddling in bombed out schools and under makeshift tents without electricity, running water or safety.

Below is a collection of moments from the past 365 days of this war, captured by NPR photographers and others across the region."
"'If You Can Keep It': The War In Gaza, One Year Later : 1A",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/1210935852/1a-10-07-2024,2024-10-07T19:10:16Z,"Israeli army soldiers stand by as a yellow ribbon along with the number 365, signifying the number of days since the October 7, 2023 attacks.

Today is Oct. 7, marking one year since the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel.

Hamas fighters killed over 1,200 people. In response, the Israeli government launched airstrikes and a ground invasion in Gaza, killing almost 42,000 people so far according to Palestinian health authorities.

Despite repeated attempts, the United States has failed to broker a ceasefire - in both Gaza and now at Israel's northern border as its military targets the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Last week, Israel said it secured $8.7 billion from the U.S. for its ongoing military efforts.

Typically, each week leading up to Nov. 5, we focus on the stakes of this election, for people, our country and our democracy.

Today's ""If You Can Keep It"" discussion will sound a little different.

What are the stakes of the U.S. election for the people of a Middle East in conflict?"

Thousands breached a border fence. Others arrived in speedboats. Some even came by paraglider in a dawn attack by Hamas fighters a year ago that caught Israel by surprise, leaving 1,200 people dead and another 250 as hostages. It also set in motion events that now threaten to turn Israel's long-running conflict with Iran's proxies into a direct and dangerous war with Tehran.

Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023, marked the deadliest day in the history of modern Israel, triggering a devastating attack on Palestinians. The result has been a humanitarian catastrophe for Gaza. Beginning in the days after the Hamas attack, Israeli warplanes began punishing airstrikes inside the narrow strip of Palestinian territory that also lies adjacent to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. By the end of the month, Israeli forces had launched a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza.

At the one-year mark in the Israel-Hamas war, here are four things that are key to where things stand today.

In the aftermath of the Hamas attack, as Israelis mourned those killed, they also feared for the safety of the hostages. A central plaza in downtown Tel Aviv, unofficially dubbed Hostages Square, was quickly transformed into a gathering place for the families, friends and supporters of the captives. ""Bring them home now!"" emerged as a potent rallying cry, and posters showing the faces and names of the hostages became ubiquitous. Many Israelis began wearing special necklaces, bracelets and T-shirts to show their support for the captives. Daily vigils in Hostages Square drew large crowds.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- already weathering intense criticism for intelligence failures in the lead-up to the surprise attack -- came under intense pressure to halt the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages.

Although Israel and Hamas managed a brief cease-fire in November that allowed for the exchange of more than 100 hostages for nearly 250 Palestinian prisoners, the truce lasted just a week. Hamas did unilaterally release four hostages, and eight others were rescued by Israeli forces. Israel's military also recovered the bodies of several hostages.

The fate of the remaining captives in Gaza has remained an open wound for many Israelis. Netanyahu's office believes that of the 101 hostages still unaccounted for in Gaza, about a third are likely dead.

The hostages question continues to shape Israel's public response to the conflict.

Since the start of Israel's military response, the country's attacks have killed at least 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 16,500 children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Another 95,000 people have been injured, the ministry says.

Israel's military began its assault on Hamas in the north of Gaza, and as Palestinian civilians sought to escape the fighting, most of them fled southward, displacing them from their homes and cutting them off from critical infrastructure needed for daily survival.

Recent data from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization and Palestinian officials in Gaza indicate the attacks have damaged or destroyed more than half of Gaza's homes, 80% of its commercial facilities and 85% of the territory's schools.

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has called the humanitarian situation in Gaza a ""moral stain on us all,"" and the aid group Refugees International has said that Israel's military response ""has wrought disproportionate death and suffering among civilians in Gaza, generating famine-like conditions while obstructing and undermining the humanitarian response.""

Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, which Israeli authorities considered to be a Hamas stronghold, experienced some of the most intense bombardment of the conflict.

In the first few months of fighting, Rafah, near the border with Egypt in southern Gaza, was designated as a ""safe zone"" by the Israeli military -- meant as a place where civilians could shelter and get access to desperately needed international humanitarian aid. Even so, Israel continued to carry out airstrikes on Rafah, some targeted at Hamas fighters or facilities, while others aimed to free Israeli hostages, according to the Israeli military. Some of those airstrikes hit homes, killing and injuring dozens of civilians, and others destroyed food distribution sites. More than half of Gaza's prewar population of 2.2 million was believed to be sheltering in Rafah. In May, Israel issued evacuation orders for the city and launched an offensive that sealed the border with Egypt, which until then was one of the main entry points for humanitarian aid.

Food, drinking water and materials for temporary shelters are in short supply and are being carried in by trucks operated by international relief organizations. People in Gaza are down to one meal every other day, and an estimated 50,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are in urgent need of treatment for malnutrition.

U.S. efforts to speed aid to Gaza have also floundered. A special $230 million temporary floating pier known as the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore system (JLOTS) operated only intermittently as damage from high winds and rough seas in the eastern Mediterranean repeatedly rendered it inoperable.

Besides the brief cease-fire to facilitate a hostages-for-prisoners swap, repeated rounds of peace talks -- some mediated by Qatar -- have failed to make much progress. Deep-seated animosities and the fragmented nature of the Palestinian leadership have played a part in preventing any lasting peace deal.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has tried to walk a fine line between diplomatic and military support for its long-term ally, Israel, and a desire to mitigate the suffering in Gaza while trying to contain a wider war that increasingly has dragged Iran and Israel into direct conflict and could engulf the rest of the Middle East.

For the moment, cease-fire talks that at times sparked optimism have fallen silent.

In late September, Secretary of State Antony Blinken summed up the U.S. position, saying, ""Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorism. The way it does so matters.""

Meanwhile, public opinion in the U.S. has been split largely along partisan lines, with conservatives showing support for Israel, but some people, younger and more liberal, turning out for pro-Palestinian rallies on college campuses.

Among Democrats, more than half say that Israel bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war in Gaza, while only about 4 in 10 Republicans do, according to a Pearson Institute/AP-NORC poll published last week.

That political dichotomy could influence the outcome of a likely tight U.S. presidential race, with some Democrats suggesting that Netanyahu is ignoring the Biden administration's peace entreaties in an effort to tip the election toward former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, voters in key battleground states give Trump higher marks than his opponent, Vice President Harris, on foreign policy matters, according to a recent poll by the New York-based Institute for Global Affairs.

From the opening days of the conflict in Gaza, the Biden administration warned against allowing the Hamas attack to morph into a war that could bring in Hezbollah -- the Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant group -- as a primary combatant and could eventually lead to a direct conflict with Tehran.

But increasingly in recent weeks, that's exactly what seems to be happening.

On Oct. 8, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets against Israel in support of the Palestinian militants fighting in Gaza. Israel hit back, and for months, low-level conflict simmered along the Lebanon-Israel border. Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, mostly stayed out of the conflict. But an Israeli attack in April against an Iranian diplomatic base in Syria that killed several of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers changed the dynamic. Less than two weeks later, Iran retaliated with a large-scale drone and missile strike on Israel. The attack, heavily telegraphed by Tehran in an apparent effort to contain the fallout, was easily repulsed by Israeli air defenses, assisted by the United States.

Fast-forward to last month: In an operation credited to Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, in synchronized attacks over two days, electronic pagers belonging to members of Hezbollah suddenly exploded across Lebanon, killing more than a dozen people -- including two children -- and wounding thousands more, according to Lebanese health authorities.

Soon after, Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes against southern Lebanon that it said were aimed at Hezbollah targets. One that hit a residential building in downtown Beirut killed a top Hezbollah commander.

As Israeli airstrikes continued days later, multiple residential buildings in southern Beirut were demolished. On Sept. 27, Israel announced that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who led the militant group for more than three decades, was killed in one of the strikes. Hezbollah later confirmed his death.

Israel also hit ports and power stations in Yemen operated by another Iran-backed group, the Houthis.

The United Nations says about 1 million Lebanese have fled their homes amid the Israeli airstrikes. Israeli authorities say about 63,000 Israelis remain displaced from the border area with Lebanon due to Hezbollah rocket fire.

On Oct. 1, Israel opened a ground offensive in southern Lebanon, a move that hearkened back to a similar 1982 invasion of the country's south by Israeli forces, which led to an 18-year occupation and to a monthlong war that Israel fought against Hezbollah in 2006. Less than 24 hours later, Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack on Israel. The country's extensive defenses -- bolstered by two U.S. destroyers deployed in the region -- intercepted most of the Iranian missiles. However, Israeli officials acknowledge that some of the Iranian missiles did hit an air base."

One year ago today, Hamas launched an ambush attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking hostages. This unleashed the deadliest war in Palestinian history. According to the Gaza health ministry, at least 41,000 people in Gaza have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and fire. Now, Israel is bombing Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Hear directly from people in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank as they describe how one year of this war has upended their lives. For more coverage marking this anniversary, check out NPR's special series page.

The war in the Middle East is personal in the swing state of Michigan. The GOP and Democrats are focused on the Arab and Muslim American voting bloc, and the state has the largest Lebanese American population in the country. Many in the state have families living in the areas of Lebanon that are being bombed right now.

A new report has found that both Harris' and Trump's economic plans would increase the national debt. According to the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, Trump's plan would add an estimated $7.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, while Harris' proposals would cost the government an estimated $3.5 trillion. The committee has cautioned that there could be a future fiscal crisis if politicians do not take more decisive action on the national debt. Let's take a closer look at the details of both economic plans.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Michigan to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

Michigan, a ""blue wall"" state, is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House. But the victory won't be easy. Harris and former President Donald Trump remain in a close battle. Here are key factors that could decide which way Michigan swings:

This essay was written by Daniel Estrin, NPR's international correspondent in Jerusalem.

""The day still keeps surprising us,"" my colleague Anas Baba in Gaza texted me last Oct. 7, close to midnight.

I was at a hospital in southern Israel. The waiting room was full of parents in a daze, waiting for word about their children who had come under attack at an outdoor techno rave near the Gaza border. In Gaza, our producer Anas was taking photos of families fleeing their homes as Israeli airstrikes rained down.

It was the deadliest day in Israeli history. It sparked the deadliest war in Palestinian history. One year later, it has grown into a regional war. Every day keeps surprising us.

A year later, I find myself thinking about where the survivors and witnesses of this war draw strength.

I think about Batya Ofir, a woman my colleague Itay Stern and I met the other day at Kibbutz Be'eri, the Israeli village that suffered the greatest loss -- 102 people there were killed. Her brother was killed along with his family. She felt survivor's guilt, and she told us she asked herself whether she wanted to keep on living.

""I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she said. Today, she is learning how to kayak in the sea to help her face her fears. ""I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

Our colleague Anas Baba in Gaza has been reporting for NPR in Gaza all year. Again and again, he has videotaped bodies brought into the morgue after Israeli airstrikes. He always trains his camera on young children, sheltering near the morgue, standing alone and watching silently as bodies are laid out.

What gives him strength, he said, is collecting biscuits and fruit to give to the children he meets. ""I can help them survive,"" he told me.

He often meets a young girl named Habiba at the hospital in central Gaza. She's been colorblind since birth. One day, she told Anas she saw a man drowning with water coming out of his nose. It wasn't water; it was blood.

""This girl does not know the color of blood,"" Anas told me. ""I wish all the children in Gaza were colorblind now."""

Vigils and protests mark one year since Hamas attacks on Israel as fighting rages on,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/g-s1-26634/october-7-israel-gaza-lebanon,2024-10-07T09:59:01Z,"Two people embrace as relatives and supporters of Israelis killed in the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack attend a ceremony at the Nova memorial near Kibbutz Reim in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2024.

Memorial services across Israel are taking place Monday, a year on since Hamas' attacks on communities close to the country's border with Gaza, and as the Israeli military extends its retaliation against the group in Gaza as well as on Hezbollah targets to the north in Lebanon.

Twelve months ago, fighters from Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and several other nations, killed around 1,200 people and seized more than 200 hostages from inside Israel, according to the Israeli government.

The ensuing war in Gaza has killed at least 41,900 Palestinians and wounded more than 97,300, according to Gaza's health ministry on Monday.

In Lebanon, where Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets on Israel in support of Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza, the death toll has risen above 2,000, according to Lebanese officials. Israeli airstrikes continued to pound parts of the capital Beirut overnight into Monday, after rockets launched from Lebanon hit the Israeli port city of Haifa Sunday. The United Nations says more than 1 million Lebanese have been displaced from their homes, including tens of thousands who have fled across the border into neighboring Syria.

Across the world, candlelight vigils are taking place Monday to commemorate those killed in the surprise Hamas attacks one year ago, with thousands planning to gather, from Tel Aviv to Paris to New York, as well as marches and protests to demand a cease-fire, particularly in Gaza.

Talks to produce a cease-fire, which many Israelis hope would see the estimated remaining 101 hostages released by Hamas, are on hold.

Across Israel, memorial events will mark the deadliest day in the country's history. The government has organized one, another is being led by the family members of Israeli taken hostage or killed, and more are being held in locations close to Gaza where the attacks happened last year.

One of those is at the Nova music festival site, where Israelis gathered Monday to listen to the last track of music played there before Hamas fighters ambushed festival-goers.

A wail in the crowd pierced a moment of silence, as attendees remembered the more than 360 people killed at the site a year ago.

""We tried to wake up from this nightmare, but we cannot,"" said Ofir Duchovne, who was there to mourn his 26-year-old friend. ""I did not imagine that the war would be so long in Gaza. And now we have another front on the north and with Iran,"" Duchovne said. ""And we're stuck. Nothing has changed.""

Nearby, frequent Israeli artillery fire into Gaza was audible, and the Israeli military said it had responded with airstrikes to rockets had been launched out of Gaza at almost the same moment they had done a year ago, at the start of the current war.

At another rally in nearby Kibbutz Be'eri, a community close to Gaza where almost 100 residents were killed and more than two dozen hostages seized, the plight of those still held inside Gaza was central to the event.

""Wars do not end in absolute victory or a clear decision, wars end in agreements,"" said Merav Svirsky, whose brother Itay Svirsky was taken hostage and then killed in January in Gaza. ""The question is, with how many human lives will we pay by then? The lives of soldiers, the lives of civilians and the lives of civilians including our people who are currently hostage in Gaza and have been in immediate life-threatening danger for a year."""
It's a close race for Michigan.

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."

They survived the Oct. 7 attack locked in their home's safe room. Cohen's goal is to rehabilitate the kibbutz and bring all the survivors back within two and a half years. Maya Levin for NPR hide caption

This story is a part of an NPR series reflecting on Oct. 7, a year of war and how it has changed life across Israel, the Gaza Strip, the region and the world.

KIBBUTZ BE'ERI, Israel -- The natural course of grieving is distorted here, a year after the Oct. 7 attacks.

This tight-knit Israeli community near the Gaza border is digging up its dead from temporary graves further away and reburying them back home, where it is safer to gather now, a year into the Gaza war.

""I'm so exhausted after every funeral that we have to deal with again,"" said Gal Cohen, the head of the kibbutz. ""Because it brings [back] everything, and we cry again.""

Israeli authorities say about 1,200 people were killed last Oct. 7, as Hamas led thousands of attackers bursting out of Gaza, ambushing Israeli towns and communities. Kibbutz Be'eri suffered the biggest loss of any single village: 102 people killed -- about one out of every 13 people living there.

The deadliest single attack in Israeli history led to the deadliest war in Palestinian history, with more than 41,000 Palestinians killed in the Gaza Strip this past year, according to health officials there.

This year, Kibbutz Be'eri has grappled with questions of death, memory, guilt and vengeance.

""Questions from [the] inferno, really,"" says Merav Roth, a prominent Israeli psychologist, and the sister of former Israeli prime minister Yair Lapid, who has counseled the kibbutz members all year long.

This is the story of some of their answers.

Silence is what helped keep the survivors of this small community alive the day of the attack. Silence is what they carried out of hiding from their safe rooms along the Gaza border to a hotel on the Dead Sea that took them in.

""It was the most quiet place I've ever seen,"" says Roth, who met them there. ""Everybody were quiet, defeated. Their bodies were, like, no air inside.""

She had heard their whispers on Oct. 7, carried live on the news.

""The Israelis, we all were on the radio, hearing them whispering to the radio people: 'Why doesn't anyone come? Where are everybody? Where's the army? They're in my house, they're shooting at me.' We will remember this for the rest of our lives, all of us,"" Roth says.

When the Israeli military eventually published its investigation into the attack on Kibbutz Be'eri, it found about 340 attackers had infiltrated the community and that it had taken about seven hours for significant numbers of Israeli forces to arrive to fight off the invasion there.

It took many weeks to account for everyone: who was dead, who was captive in Gaza. Roth sat with the survivors of Kibbutz Be'eri in the Dead Sea hotel basement as the village secretary read the names of 27 identified bodies and 108 people unaccounted for.

""It's just name by name by name,"" Roth said. ""Everybody are, again, quiet, dead quiet.""

This year, Roth has helped the kibbutz make agonizing decisions.

""For instance, there is a boy in the kibbutz who lost four members of his family, two parents and two siblings. So do we tell him about each separately or do we tell him about all of them together?"" she says.

Roth has also counseled former hostages who returned from Hamas captivity in Gaza, families whose loved ones were killed in captivity, and Israelis who didn't experience a personal loss but still suffer from sleeping difficulties, anxiety attacks and depression.

""They are extremely anxious about the future of this place. Many of them leave the country. Because their parents told them that in the Holocaust, those who didn't leave, died,"" she says. ""Hopelessness and helplessness are so strong. The trauma is national.""

From the very first days after the Oct. 7 attack, Roth coached other therapists how to respond.

""When I gave guidelines to the therapists in Be'eri at the beginning, I said, smile and say, how are you? Because these people don't know that it still matters. You have to show them that their wellbeing is still relevant. The life instinct wants to see that someone calls him back.""

At Kibbutz Be'eri, one recent afternoon, teens and parents walked quietly out of the neighborhood cemetery after a funeral for a mother and her 15-year-old son -- two of the many reburials of recent months.

Reburied with the boy was his surfboard: his dying wish as he bled out in his home Oct. 7.

Batya Ofir attended the funeral. She recently reburied her own brother and his family in the kibbutz cemetery, after viewing his partially decomposed body be exhumed from its temporary grave.

""It was not easy,"" she says, ""but I had to see him.""

She wanted to be with his body at the moment it was unearthed. She had not lived on the kibbutz any longer and felt guilty she wasn't with her brother and family in their worst moment on Oct. 7.

Ofir says she made a decision, after her brother was killed.

""I said to myself, what do you want? To continue living? I can also not. I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she says. ""I have a family, I have children, I have grandchildren. I draw. I'm learning to kayak, to deal with all my fears. I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

A couple hundred families have moved back to Kibbutz Be'eri. Cohen, the head of the community, is overseeing an ambitious project to bring the residents back within two and a half years.

The kibbutz has broken ground on a new neighborhood of 52 homes.

A short walk away, though, are the homes that were attacked last year. Bullet holes, shattered windows, a pair of children's shoes in the debris: Oct. 7 frozen in time.

There's a debate in the community about what to do with these broken homes. Cohen says it will be put up for a vote.

""Some of the people say, let's make it like Auschwitz. Okay? And it'll be open for people to come and see what happened here,"" he says.

But he says others who survived the attack are taking sleeping pills to cope with the trauma and cannot bear seeing the destroyed homes. ""I believe we'll have to take them all down in the end.""

He doesn't want one person moving back to the kibbutz to see the remnants and relive the nightmare.

Yasmin Raanan, 56, waters her new plants on her patio. She and her husband moved back home to the kibbutz from the Dead Sea hotel a few months ago.

On Oct. 7, she grabbed her personal firearm, and she and her husband locked themselves inside their reinforced shelter room at home. They survived the attack because they had installed a sliding bolt on the safe room. The attackers tried but failed to open the door. Her neighbors' safe rooms only had the standard locks and were breached.

When she was finally rescued that night, and led out of her safe room, she found her living room floor covered in rows of grenades, gas canisters, explosives, rocket-propelled grenades and rifles. She understood: Her home had been transformed into the attack headquarters. Neighbors all around her were gunned down.

Then she saw the man she had heard all day loading gun cartridges in her home. He was sitting outside, she says, stripped naked by orders of the military, and guarded by an Israeli soldier.

""I came with my gun to kill him,"" she recalls. ""A commando soldier said, 'Ma'am, we are a moral people.' I said, 'I have no more morals anymore.'""

The commando took away her weapon, and she says she took the attacker's face in her hands and demanded to know his name. He gave it.

One year later, the Israeli military has left much of Gaza in ruins. That gives her a measure of comfort.

And one year on, the passage of time has taken some of the edge off her anger.

""A year later, things sink in a bit,"" she says. ""Time heals."""
Israeli strike on Gaza mosque kills 19 as conflict widens in Lebanon,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5142440/israeli-gaza-lebanon-oct-7,2024-10-06T19:40:29Z,"Smoke billows from the site of an Israeli air strike that targeted a neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs on Oct. 6, 2024.

Israel has intensified its strikes in Gaza and Lebanon, as the expanding conflict in the Mideast approaches one full year since the Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7.

Israeli airstrikes this weekend have killed scores of people, according to health officials in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israel's government continues to mull a response to nearly 200 Iranian missiles targeting Israel last week.

In northern Gaza, the Israeli military dropped leaflets warning of a ""new phase of war,"" as commanders issued fresh evacuation orders for the several hundred thousand residents that remain in the northern part of the strip.

In the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza, Israeli ground troops have encircled a sizeable swathe of territory, where they say they have launched a large-scale assault against Hamas fighters for the first time in months, forcing civilians once more to flee.

Meanwhile, just days after sending soldiers into southern Lebanon, the Israeli military has struck buildings and other targets it links to Hezbollah across Lebanon overnight.

Israel says its recent operations inside Lebanon are part of an attempt to prevent Hezbollah rockets that have landed in northern Israel for the past year, forcing tens of thousands of Israeli civilians to evacuate towns and cities in the region.

At least 56 people have been killed in Gaza this weekend, according to the local health authorities there, prompting a seemingly endless series of funerals after a strike on a mosque Sunday. The building was so close to a nearby hospital morgue that no ambulances were required, with bodies of the at least 19 dead simply carried by hand from one compound to the next.

Israel said it had been a ""precision strike"" on the mosque, targeting Hamas militants inside, but mourners said the approaching one-year mark of the fighting in Gaza was a horrible reminder of the costs families there have faced, with more than 41,000 deaths recorded in the past 12 months.

""Enough, world, enough, tomorrow will be a complete year,"" said Hakima Al Jamal, as she watched her dying father be carried out of the mosque. ""We are tired. By God, we're so tired.""

More Israeli troops are being moved to the border with Gaza to protect one-year commemoration ceremonies in communities affected by Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks last year that killed some 1,200 people and saw more than 200 hostages taken into Gaza.

On the eve of those ceremonies, a knife and gun attack in the southern city of Beersheba has left one person dead and 10 others wounded, according to Israeli emergency services.

Police have not yet identified the attacker, who launched the rampage at the city's central bus station. But officials said they were treating it as a terror incident, with the country currently on high alert after several stabbing, shooting and ramming attacks in the past year, including one in Tel Aviv last week that saw seven shot inside and around a transportation hub.

In southern Lebanon, the Israeli military says it has lost as least nine of its troops and killed more than 400 Hezbollah fighters, as it ramped up destructive strikes on the capital Beirut. The strikes were concentrated in the city's southern suburbs that have historically served as a hub for Hebzollah, an Iran-backed militant group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and other nations.

Israel says its latest strikes targeted ""weapons storage facilities and infrastructure sites,"" but in the past two weeks similar strikes have also killed civilians, including children. The total death toll in Lebanon has now topped 1,000, and the Israeli assault has displaced more than a million people -- around a fifth of the country's population.

In the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, new arrivals from the country's south -- some of them refugees from Syria forced to move on once more by another round of conflict -- have seen their lives shattered in a short period of time.

While local residents sit on blue plastic benches -- young men sharing videos on their phones, older couples whiling away the time -- the Israeli airstrikes penetrate further north into the country, leaving few secure locations for civilians.

One man, Riqad, who only gave his first name out of concerns for his safety, had arrived four days ago with his family from the southern suburbs of Beirut, after earlier fleeing Israeli attacks near their home in the southern city of Tyre.

""There is no safe place"" Riqad said Saturday. ""The Israelis are bombing everywhere."" As he spoke, two young children in his family asked an adult relative if the bombs would reach them at the hotel where a politician affiliated with Hezbollah had granted shelter to them and other displaced families.

A few hours earlier, Israeli jets had fired on a nearby refugee camp for Palestinians, close to Tripoli. The attack targeted a commander linked to the militant group Hamas, as well as members of his family, and represented the most northerly attack by Israel since the conflict began in Gaza, 200 miles to the south.

The devastating impact on Lebanese society has been shockingly swift. One pre-med student, who gave only her first name Yasmin, had started college only a month earlier.

""I thought it would be one of the best years of my life. I've worked so much to get to the university I am in,"" she said. ""Now, all I miss is my university days ... the coffee there, my friends, studying in the library. That's all I want now."""
A strike on a mosque kills 19 as Israel bombards northern Gaza and southern Beirut,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/g-s1-26576/israel-bombards-northern-gaza-and-southern-beirut,2024-10-06T12:14:54Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike on a mosque in the Gaza Strip early Sunday killed at least 19 people, Palestinian officials said, as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Beirut in a widening war with Iran-allied militant groups across the region.

Displaced people were sheltering at the mosque that was struck near the main hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah. A further four people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering displaced people near the town.

The Israeli military said both strikes targeted militants, without providing evidence.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead from the strike on the mosque were all men.

Israel is still battling Hamas in Gaza a year after the group's attack on Israel, and has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has been trading fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel has also vowed to strike Iran itself after Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week.

The widening conflict risks drawing in the United States, which has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel, as well as U.S.-allied Arab countries that host American forces. Iran-allied militant groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have already joined in with long-distance strikes on Israel.

The Israeli military, meanwhile, announced a new air and ground offensive in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, home to a densely populated refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. It circulated photos and video footage showing a column of tanks heading toward the area.

Israeli forces encircled Jabaliya as warplanes struck militant sites inside, the military said. Over the course of the war, Israel has carried out several large operations there, only to see militants regroup.

Israel reiterated its call, from the opening weeks of the war, for the complete evacuation of northern Gaza. Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained in the heavily destroyed north after earlier Israeli warnings that sent around a million fleeing to the south.

""We are in a new phase of the war,"" the military said in leaflets dropped over the area. ""These areas are considered dangerous combat zones.""

Palestinian residents reported heavy Israeli strikes across northern Gaza. The Civil Defense -- first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government -- said several homes and buildings had been hit and they were not able to reach them because of the bombardment.

Residents posted about the airstrikes and mourned their relatives on social media. Imad Alarabid said in a Facebook post that an airstrike on his home in Jabaliya killed a dozen family members, including his parents. Saeed Abu Elaish, a Health Ministry medic, said he was wounded and bleeding.

""Pray for us,"" he wrote on Facebook.

Hassan Hamd, a freelance TV journalist whose footage had aired on Al Jazeera and othr networks, was killed in artillery shelling on his home in Jabaliya. Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera reporter in northern Gaza, confirmed his death.

The military says it has expanded the so-called humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, urging people to head there. Hundreds of thousands of people have already sought refuge in sprawling tent camps there with little in the way of food, water or toilets. Israel has carried out strikes in the humanitarian zone against what it says are militants hiding among civilians.

Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says a little more than half were women and children.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack and took another 250 hostage. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

In Beirut, airstrikes lit up the skyline and loud explosions echoed across the southern suburbs, known as the Dahiyeh, throughout the night, as Israel struck what it said were Hezbollah militant sites.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said the area was hit by more than 30 strikes overnight, the heaviest bombardment since Sept. 23 when Israel escalated its air campaign.

The targets included a gas station on the main highway leading to the Beirut airport and a warehouse for medical supplies, the agency said. Some of the overnight strikes set off a long series of explosions, suggesting that ammunition stores may have been hit.

Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted.

Hezbollah said it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers in northern Israel ""with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately."" It was not possible to confirm the claim.

At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from its border so that tens of thousands of Israeli citizens can return to their homes.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily.

Last week, Israel launched what it said was a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters.

It is not possible to verify battlefield reports from either side."
Israel expands its bombardment in Lebanon as thousands flee widening war,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/g-s1-26567/israel-expands-its-bombardment-in-lebanon-as-thousands-flee-widening-war,2024-10-06T07:14:31Z,"MASNAA BORDER CROSSING, Lebanon -- Powerful new explosions rocked Beirut's southern suburbs late Saturday as Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon, also striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in the north for the first time as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters.

Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza.

The strong explosions began near midnight and continued into Sunday after Israel's military urged residents to evacuate areas in Dahiyeh, the predominantly Shiite collection of suburbs on Beirut's southern edge. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. They followed a day of sporadic strikes and the nearly continuous buzz of reconnaissance drones.

Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted.

The strikes reportedly targeted a building near a road leading to Lebanon's only international airport, and another building formerly used by the Hezbollah-run broadcaster Al-Manar. Social media reports claimed that one of the strikes hit an oxygen tank storage facility, but this was later denied by the owner of the company Khaled Kaddouha.

Shortly thereafter, Hezbollah claimed in a statement that it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers near the Manara settlement in northern Israel ""with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately.""

On Saturday, Israel's attack on the northern Beddawi camp killed an official with Hamas' military wing along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palestinian militant group said. Hamas later said another military wing member was killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley. The aftermath showed smashed buildings, scattered bricks and stairways to nowhere.

Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began , in addition to most of the top leadership of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah as fighting has sharply escalated.

At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from shared borders so displaced Israelis can return to their homes.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily.

Last week, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a brief war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters.

Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters in Damascus that ""we are trying to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon."" The minister said the unnamed countries putting forward initiatives include regional states and some outside the Middle East.

Araghchi spoke a day after the supreme leader of Iran praised its recent missile strikes on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary.

On Saturday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ""Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and respond to these attacks, and it will do so."" On Lebanon, he said ""we are not done yet.""

Fleeing Lebanon on foot

Israel's military earlier Saturday said about 90 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Most were intercepted, but several fell in the northern Arab town of Deir al-Asad, where police said three people were lightly injured.

At least six people in Lebanon were killed in more than a dozen Israeli airstrikes overnight and into Saturday, according to the Lebanese state-run National News Agency.

Nearly 375,000 people have fled from Lebanon into Syria in less than two weeks, according to a Lebanese government committee.

Associated Press journalists saw hundreds continuing to cross the Masnaa Border Crossing on foot, crunching over the rubble after Israeli airstrikes left huge craters in the road leading to it on Thursday. Much of Hezbollah's weaponry is believed to come from Iran through Syria.

""We were on the road for two days,"" said Issa Hilal, one of many Syrian refugees in Lebanon who are now heading back. ""The roads were very crowded ... it was very difficult. We almost died getting here."" Some children whimpered or cried.

Other displaced families now shelter alongside Beirut's famous seaside Corniche, their wind-flapped tents just steps from luxury homes. ""We don't care if we die, but we don't want to die at the hands of Netanyahu,"" said Om Ali Mcheik.

The Israeli military said special forces were carrying out ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon. It said troops dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border.

More evacuation orders in Gaza

Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the Health Ministry there, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. Almost 90% of Gaza's residents are displaced, amid widespread destruction.

Palestinian medical officials said Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza on Saturday killed at least nine people. One in the northern town of Beit Hanoun killed at least five, including two children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Another hit a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four, Awda hospital said.

Israel's military did not have any immediate comment but has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas.

An Israeli airstrike killed two children in Gaza City's Zaytoun neighborhood, according to the civil defense first responders' group that operates under the Hamas-run government.

Israel's military warned Palestinians to evacuate along the strategic Netzarim corridor in central Gaza that was at the heart of obstacles to a cease-fire deal. The military told people in parts of the Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps to evacuate to Muwasi, a coastal area it has designated a humanitarian zone.

It's unclear how many Palestinians are in those areas. Israeli forces have often returned to areas in Gaza to target Hamas fighters as they regroup."
"As Oct. 7 approaches, synagogues and mosques bolster security",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5137188/mosques-synagogues-security-october-7,2024-10-05T09:04:16Z,"A member of the New York Police Department patrols in front of the synagogue Congregation Bais Yaakov Nechamia Dsatmar on Oct. 13, 2023 in the Williamsburg neighborhood in the borough of Brooklyn in New York City.

Making one's way into the Chicago Loop Synagogue isn't merely a matter of opening the front door.

First, visitors must ring a doorbell and talk to a receptionist at an office desk. After making their way into the foyer, they buzz another doorbell for entrance. Then, they have to pass through a metal detector scan.

""We have people from all over the world who come here. When they're downtown and they want a place to pray, they come to us,"" synagogue President Lee Zoldan said. ""You never know who's going to show up. That's why we're here, is to serve them.""

In order for the synagogue to focus on that mission of service and remain a spot of refuge in this city's busy downtown, Zoldan said she has to keep a watchful eye.

Jewish, Muslim and Arab American communities have experienced increased threats since the beginning of the war in Gaza. As the one-year mark since the Hamas-led attack on Israel approaches, American Jews and Muslims are preparing special services and memorials to honor lives lost and pray for an end to the violence. Across the country, mosques and synagogues are paying special attention to ways they can strengthen security for their members heading into Oct. 7.

""Virtually every synagogue has been in touch with local police,"" said Nathan Diament, public policy director of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations of America. ""They're going to have increased patrols, both by police and also by volunteers. We just want to make sure that everybody's safe.""

On Oct. 4, the FBI issued an alert, warning that ""violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators"" may view Oct. 7 ""as an opportunity to conduct an attack or other high-profile, illegal activity.""

""Online messaging associated with (foreign terrorist organizations) and other violent extremists highlighting the one-year anniversary of the October 7 attacks could motivate threat actors across ideologies, including those who espouse violent anti-Semitism and Islamophobia, to engage in violence,"" the FBI warned.

The Chicago Loop Synagogue has experienced hate crimes before. It was attacked in 2017, when vandals smashed the building's front window and pasted swastikas on the entrance.

""We've always been very security conscious,"" Zoldan said. ""I mean, we have to be.""

In addition to the front entrance setup, the synagogue requires guests to call in advance before visiting. Beyond these safety measures, Zoldan declined to fully flesh out the Chicago Loop Synagogue's security measures.

""There are numerous other systems that we have that would be considered best practices for any synagogue,"" Zoldan said. ""We're always looking at what are best practices for security, but I think we do everything that we possibly can. I'm comfortable that we're doing the right thing.""

Zoldan stays in regular contact with local and federal agencies like the Cook County Sheriff Police, Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Department of Justice to update the synagogue's security strategies.

After the Oct. 7 attack and war in Gaza that followed, the Department of Homeland Security offered resources and information for faith leaders to help keep their communities safe.

Among them were recommendations like training greeters on deescalation techniques, evaluating vulnerabilities in their buildings and pursuing grants to provide new resources for security.

In 2005, Congress authorized the federal Nonprofit Security Grant Program. This year, they allocated $675 million to the program -- more than 20 times the amount they gave originally.

Mosques in the Chicago area are also taking precautionary steps ahead of Oct 7. In September, the Council on American-Islamic Relations called for an investigation after the discovery of what appeared to be bullet holes at the Muslim Community Center, one of the city's oldest mosques.

""Other suburbs of Chicago are a little bit luckier just because they might have really large Muslim populations or have sometimes better relationships with police,"" said Maggie Slavin, operations manager at CAIR-Chicago. ""But I know in the city of Chicago, getting CPD to work with us has been extremely challenging.""

CAIR works with more than 30 mosques in the Chicago area. According to Slavin, local Muslims generally do not feel that police follow through on their requests for extra help.

""A lot of people would like to see some added layer, and so we're kind of turning to private security because we were not able to always get in with local police departments and get them to take us seriously,"" Slavin said.

The Chicago Police Department declined a request for an interview. In a statement, the CPD told NPR, ""As always, we are monitoring all activity and while there is no actionable intelligence at this time, we will have an increased police presence to ensure the city's faith communities are not only safe, but feel safe.""

As the conflict in the Middle East escalates, the Orthodox Union's Diament said he sees the safety of all faith communities as connected.

""Every group has to enjoy that religious freedom and be able to exercise their faith without fear,"" Diament said. ""If one group has their religious freedom threatened, then it's really undermining the principle of religious freedom for people."""

Researchers have used commercial satellite imagery to identify more than 30 points where Iranian missiles appear to have impacted an airbase in southern Israel.

The imagery, taken the day after the strike by the company Planet, shows damaged hangers, buildings, taxiways, and a crater on one of the runways at Nevatim Airbase. Videos posted to social media showed multiple warheads striking the base during the October 1 attack by Iran.

Israel and the U.S. have downplayed the attack, which Israel says consisted of roughly 180 ballistic missiles. Israel said that many were intercepted by its missile defenses. Two U.S. destroyers also fired around a dozen interceptors to try and blunt the strike.

""This attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said shortly after the missiles fell.

""Our air force and air force bases remain operational,"" an Israeli military spokesperson, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said in a briefing on the social media platform X.

The Israeli military says no planes were destroyed in the attack.

But Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey who led the analysis, says his work ""complicates the picture a lot.""

""We see more than 30 craters and damaged buildings,"" Lewis says, ""suggesting that more than 30 missiles hit the base.""

Iranian missiles also struck another base, Tel Nof Airbase in central Israel, and a smaller number of missiles fell near the headquarters of Israeli's intelligence agency, known as Mossad.

Based on preliminary calculations of what happened at Nevatim, Lewis believes a substantial number of Iranian missiles may have reached their targets.

""If Nevatim is representative that would suggest that more than half got through,"" he says.

Their are several reasons why so many Iranian missiles may have penetrated Israel's air defenses. Israel's vaunted Iron Dome missile defense system can only intercept low flying, short range missiles of the type used by Hezbollah and Hamas. To intercept Iran's medium-range ballistic missiles requires Israel's more powerful and expensive Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 missile defense systems.

It is possible that the Arrow system failed to preform as expected Lewis says, but he thinks it's more likely that Israel may have decided not to defend Nevatim, in order to save its interceptors to protect population centers like Tel Aviv.

""It may be that they just don't have that many Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 missiles,"" Lewis says. If that were true, then ""the Iranians have succeeded in overwhelming the system and the Israelis have had to pick and choose.""

""That would be my guess,"" Lewis adds. ""It did not look like they were trying to defend this base.""

Lewis notes that although over 30 missiles landed inside the base perimeter, the damage caused was still somewhat limited. That's notable because Iran is believed to have used some of its most advanced Fattah missiles.

The October surprise: Harris is navigating a pair of them,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5137967/kamala-harris-hurricane-israel-iran-october-surprise,2024-10-04T09:09:19Z,"Vice President Harris hands out food to people at the Henry Brigham Community Center in Augusta, Ga., on Oct. 2, during a tour of hurricane damage in the area.

With only a month left until Election Day, Vice President Harris is navigating a pair of external challenges in the month of October that pose risk to her campaign.

At home, there's the recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Helene -- including in the vital swing states of North Carolina and Georgia. And abroad, there's the real risk of escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The twin crises present a unique challenge for the Biden administration and, by extension, Harris -- who is a key part of that team. So her campaign and the White House are pulling out the stops to try to show voters they're on top of things, even as Harris pushes ahead on the campaign trail.

For Harris, there's the fear that these ""October surprises"" go sideways and she gets some blame. In a race this close, every vote matters.

But these kinds of high-profile crises also present an opportunity to demonstrate leadership, said Democratic political strategist Ian Russell.

""What she has to do, and what she is doing, is showing up and showing that she's engaged, showing that she's capable of stepping up to the challenges that the country and the world face and I think she's doing that very well,"" Russell said.

Harris took a break from the campaign on Wednesday to visit a Georgia neighborhood ravaged by Hurricane Helene where more than half of residents don't have power and many don't have running water.

""The president and I have been paying close attention from the beginning to what we need to do to make sure the federal resources hit the ground as quickly as possible,"" Harris said. ""That includes what was necessary to make sure that we provided direct federal assistance. And that work has been happening.""

President Biden also surveyed Asheville, N.C., where some of the most severe storm damage occurred, as he and Harris try to reassure voters in the critical state that their administration is up to the task. Harris' campaign has said she plans to tour storm damage in North Carolina soon, too.

Her opponent, former President Donald Trump, is slated to be it the state on Friday for a town hall.

The International Longshoremen's Association decision to go on strike on Tuesday had been another challenge for Harris, threatening to upend the economy heading into the election.

But on Thursday, the union dockworkers and port operators reached a tentative agreement on wages and agreed to extend their contract to Jan. 15. Harris and Biden had sided firmly with the union, and on Thursday Biden said both sides had acted ""patriotically"" to reopen the ports to ensure supplies were available for hurricane rebuilding efforts.

The Trump campaign is on the lookout for anything they can use against Harris in the closely contested race -- including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

On Tuesday, Trump told his supporters that he was the person to take on Iran after it attacked Israel. ""We have a nonexistent president and a nonexistent vice president, who should be in charge, but nobody knows what's going on,"" Trump said.

Harris made sure to get out in front of cameras this week to reaffirm her support for Israel. ""As I have said, I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias,"" she said.

""And let us be clear: Iran is not only a threat to Israel; Iran is also a threat to American personnel in the region, American interests, and innocent civilians across the region who suffer at the hands of Iran-based and -backed terrorist proxies.""

How the White House, Harris and her campaign are able to navigate these ""October surprises"" is critical in a race this close, with only a month left.

""There's always going to be something that could go wrong at home or abroad,"" Russell said. ""And our leaders need to be able to step up and deliver while also being politicians."""
Israeli airstrikes cut off a key crossing between Lebanon and Syria,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/g-s1-26287/israeli-airstrikes-lebanon-syria-crossing,2024-10-04T07:56:14Z,"BEIRUT -- Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria.

The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates.

Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The blasts overnight rocked Beirut's southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers (miles) away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday.

The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details.

The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon's Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing.

Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces.

Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous.

It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between Sept. 23 -- when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon -- and Sept. 30.

There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there.

Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence.

Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their Oct. 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry."
"Tensions are rising in the Middle East, but the rise in oil prices is muted - so far",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5137118/israel-iran-conflict-oil-price-risks,2024-10-03T23:50:09Z,"The sun shines behind a refinery in the South Pars Gas-Condensate field in Asalouyeh Seaport in Iran. Iran's oil and natural gas infrastructure is a possible target for Israeli attacks as tensions in the Mideast mount. Oil prices have risen as a result -- but remain relatively low, compared to most of 2024. SAEID ARABZADEH/Middle East Images/AFP via Getty hide caption

Global crude oil prices rose by more than 4% on Wednesday, surging after President Biden told reporters he was ""discussing"" the question of whether the U.S. would support an Israeli attack on Iranian oil facilities.

""We're discussing that,"" Biden said. ""I think that would be a little ... anyway.""

The cryptic remark sent oil up significantly - but even so, prices are not particularly high by historical standards.

Brent, the global benchmark for crude, closed at $77.62, still lower than it was for most of 2024.

""In the past, if we're talking about any kind of conflict in the Middle East that concerned Iran, prices would probably be above $100"" a barrel, said Amrita Sen, the founder of the energy research firm Energy Aspects. ""People were talking about, like, $120, $130 crude.""

Although tensions between Israel and Iran are currently as serious as they have been for decades, said Sen, ""the market has been completely brushing it aside.""

Why are markets so sanguine? The biggest reason, analysts say, is that the OPEC+ alliance could make a lot more oil -- if it wanted.

As a group, OPEC+, a coalition of oil-producing countries, has an incentive to make less oil; lower supply means higher prices. But individual countries have a strong incentive to produce more oil, which funds their national budgets. Balancing those two competing motivations is the central diplomatic challenge of the cartel.

And for a few years now, the group - and particularly Saudi Arabia - have cut production significantly, trying to hold up prices. That means OPEC+ could, hypothetically, easily make up for missing Iranian oil.

Rystad Energy, an energy research company, estimates that Iran produces about 4 million barrels of crude per day, and exports about 2 million. OPEC+'s spare capacity - the amount of oil the group could make, but is choosing not to - ""currently sits at more than 5 million barrels per day, which could be deployed relatively quickly,"" Claudio Galimberti, the chief economist of Rystad Energy, wrote in a research note.

Whether the alliance would choose to deploy that production is another question.

Rebecca Babin, a senior energy trader with CIBC Private Wealth, notes that OPEC+ kept a tight lid on production even after Russia invaded Ukraine and prices spiked. She thinks this time, they'd choose to sell more barrels. Probably.

""Do we know that they will? Nope,"" she said. ""And they love to make surprises."" But the possibility is helping to keep prices from skyrocketing.

There are a few other reasons for the lack of alarm.

Oil prices slid dramatically in September, thanks in part to lower-than-expected demand from China's slowing economy. China has just launched a massive stimulus program, but it's not yet clear how much that will translate into oil consumption.

Meanwhile, the geopolitics of oil have shifted dramatically, shaped in large part by the shale boom, when new drilling methods like fracking unlocked vast oil reserves. The U.S. is now the largest oil producer in history, and a net oil exporter. (Crude exports have not been affected by the port strike this week on the East and Gulf coasts of the U.S.)

And because the U.S. is far less reliant on oil from the Mideast than it used to be, traders think Iran has less incentive to shut down the Strait of Hormuz than it did a few decades ago.

More than a quarter of the world's seaborne crude travels through that waterway, which lies between Iran and the United Arab Emirates. Any blockage would cause ""runaway"" oil prices, Galimberti of Rystad Energy says.

But it would cause less pain to the U.S. than it once would have - and more pain to Iran and its primary customer, China.

Sen thinks markets are currently underestimating how much this conflict could upend markets, and that if an attack on oil infrastructure does happen, the price response will be dramatic. ""This is the biggest short the market has ever had,"" she said.

Babin thinks the market's factoring in the risks just about right. After all, oil markets aren't waving off these risks entirely. Prices are up more than $6 this week, a significant jump. Babin notes in the options market, some traders are placing bets that would only pay off if prices spike more.

But overall, she said, when she looks at the price of oil, ""I see this as very measured: a market that's not panicking, not running away with itself. We're not at $90."""

How Iran's missile strike on Israel appears to have hit some targets,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5135646/iran-missile-strike-israel-appears-to-hit-some-targets,2024-10-02T16:37:05Z,"Projectiles above Jerusalem, on October 1, 2024. Israel says Iran launched more than 180 missiles but that the assault did little damage. MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images/AFP hide caption

Iran's strike on Israel appears to have been more effective at reaching its targets than an attack in April of this year.

Videos posted to social media and geolocated by NPR and the online investigations group Bellingcat show multiple warheads landing around two Israeli air bases: Nevatim Airbase in the south of the country and Tel Nof Airbase in central Israel. One video filmed near Tel Nof also appeared to show possible secondary explosions, indicating that ammunition or fuel may have been struck by a missile.

Videos also showed warheads landing in northern Tel Aviv, near the headquarters of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad. Those warheads appear to have missed their target, and did not inflict any real damage. One video showed a large crater around 500 yards from the spy agency's headquarters.

Experts say the attack was somewhat more successful than the one in April of this year, which was almost completely neutralized by Israeli and American air defenses.

""It looks like more missiles seem to be hitting targets in Israel this time around,"" says Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. That could be in part because ""the Iranians seem to be using newer, more sophisticated missiles.""

US Calls Strikes ""Ineffective""

Both the U.S. and Israel downplayed the strikes. ""This attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a briefing Tuesday. The U.S. said it had fired about a dozen interceptors from warships in an effort to blunt the Iranian assault.

According to reports in the Israeli media, the military acknowledged that the strike had damaged ""several"" airbases. However it said that no aircraft had been destroyed. Israeli media reported that the attacks had mainly damaged maintenance areas and office buildings.

An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson declined to comment to NPR on casualties or damage resulting from the strike. The Israeli military spokesperson, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said in a briefing on the social media platform X that, ""We don't want to tip off Iran... Our air force and air force bases remain operational.""

Although the strike may have been limited in the damage it caused, it was a clear challenge to Israel's much-vaunted air defense systems. Israel's main system, called Iron Dome, has proven incredibly effective rockets from nearby adversaries like the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Iron Dome uses relatively cheap interceptor missiles together with state-of-the-art radars and high-speed computing to quickly determine which incoming missiles pose a threat. It only takes shots at the ones it determines are falling in populated areas.

Better missiles and more of them

But ballistic missiles from Iran travel much higher and faster than those fired from nearby Lebanon and Gaza. The missiles fly briefly into space before coming down on their targets near or at hypersonic speeds. Israel has a separate missile defense system known as Arrow, which is capable of intercepting missiles near or in space, but Arrow has fewer interceptors than Iron Dome.

When Iran attacked Israel in April, it used around 100 ballistic missiles in conjunction with roughly 200 low flying drones and cruise missiles, according to Yehoshua Kalisky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv, Israel. The drones and cruise missiles were shot down easily by fighter jets, leaving the missiles for Arrow, he says.

This time, Iran launched around 180 ballistic missiles, putting more strain on the Arrow system. ""The job for the Arrow was much easier [in April],"" he says.

Moreover, images of the missiles being fired out of Iran, together with pictures of debris that fell in Israel, suggests more sophisticated ballistic missiles were used, Lewis says.

In the April attack, Lewis says Iran used primarily liquid-fueled missiles that were relatively inaccurate. Half of the missiles fell more than a half mile from their targets. ""It's pretty hard to destroy something with that level of accuracy,"" he says.

In this latest attack, Iran used new solid-propellant missiles that are more accurate, he says. Lewis and other researchers say at least some of the missiles used appear to be Iran's newest design, the Fattah, a medium-range ballistic missile that may have a degree of maneuverability as it enters the atmosphere, allowing it to alter course and avoid interceptor missiles.

Lewis says he believes Iran's latest strike was designed to show some restraint. The warheads fell primarily on air bases which may have been used in last week's attacks on Hezbollah's leadership, he points out. ""It's very typical to see Iranians pick military targets that are linked to the military strike that they're responding to,"" he says.

The strike also appeared to largely avoid civilian areas. The only publicly acknowledged death from the attack so far was a Palestinian man in the West Bank who was apparently struck by a falling missile body. A school in central Israel was also hit, though no casualties were reported.

Despite the attempt to control escalation, Israel is likely to respond with force, says Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Following the April attack, Israel knocked out an air defense radar near Iran's nuclear facilities in Natanz, he points out. That limited attack was designed to send a message: ""The Israelis can penetrate Iranian airspace, they've demonstrated that time and time again,"" he says. ""They can bring the hurt to Iran.""

Israel's military spokesperson Peter Lerner suggested that it would only be a matter of time before the nation struck back directly against Iran. ""One ballistic missile is an unacceptable reality for any sovereign state,"" he told reporters. ""One hundred and eighty means there will be consequences."""

Hassan Ammar/AP hide caption

Israel says it is sending more troops into southern Lebanon to fight Hezbollah, as Israel also promised a ""painful"" response after Iran fired nearly 200 missiles at Israel Tuesday night.

The Israeli military said it is deploying more soldiers and an armored tank brigade to assist in what it called a ""limited, localized"" ground offensive against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon.

On social media, the Israeli military's Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, warned residents of an additional 24 villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate immediately. ""For your safety, you must leave your homes immediately,"" he said, adding that any civilian near Hezbollah fighters, facilities or weapons risks their lives.

Residents were advised to evacuate north of the Awali River, about 30 miles from the Lebanese border with Israel.

Also on Wednesday, sirens went off across Israel's north after the Israeli military said around 100 rockets were fired from Lebanon. The military issues alerts to communities around the port city of Haifa and Western Galilee, both near the Israel-Lebanon border.

The Israeli military announced a soldier killed in combat in Lebanon, according to The Associated Press, which said Hezbollah claimed to have killed and wounded an unspecified number of Israeli troops.

Iran fired about 180 ballistic missiles toward Israel late Tuesday. The Israeli military said most were intercepted, but there were several hits.

The Pentagon said two U.S. destroyers also fired a dozen interceptors at the Iranian missiles headed to Israel.

The only confirmed death from the Iranian attack was in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where a 38-year-old Palestinian man was killed after a missile fell on the city of Jericho, according to Palestinian civil defense.

Video footage shared on social media showed a large crater where a missile had landed near Israel's Mossad spy agency headquarters.

Officials in Jordan said two people were lightly injured from falling shrapnel.

Now, the region is bracing for Israel's response and the risk of a wider war.

""This evening, Iran made a big mistake -- and it will pay for it,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said hours after the attack.

Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari called Iran's attack ""a severe and dangerous escalation,"" and promised, ""We will respond wherever, whenever and however we choose.""

And on Wednesday, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said Israel's response will be ""decisive and painful.""

Iran's Revolutionary Guard said late Tuesday that the missile attack was in response to several recent killings, including the assassination of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah late Friday in Beirut; the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran in July in a strike widely assumed to be carried out by Israel; and an Iranian commander.

Iran's mission at the United Nations said the attack was a ""legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime."""

October 7th anniversary weighs heavy as Jews enter the High Holy Days,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5108867/october-7th-anniversary-jewish-high-holy-days,2024-10-02T09:03:56Z,"A table covered with a cloth featuring the Loyola Marymount Hillel logo in the front, and six portraits of hostages who were killed sitting on top of it. Jason DeRose/NPR hide caption

On the table outside Rabbi Zachary Zysman's office at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, six portraits of hostages killed by Hamas are weighed down by a small stone, placed there as an act of remembrance.

Nearby, a stack of brochures for a Krav Maga self-defense class leans against a pad of paper on which people can write prayers, eventually to be tucked into the Western Wall in Jerusalem.

Zysman, the chaplain for Jewish life at Loyola Marymount, has carefully prepared for the Jewish new year, Rosh Hashanah, which begins at sunset on Wednesday and Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, later this month. In the middle of the Jewish High Holy Days comes the anniversary of October 7, the deadliest attack against Jews since the Holocaust.

No matter when the one-year anniversary fell, it would have been difficult, but Zysman said it's particularly poignant ""at a time when we're thinking about repentance, renewal and hope.""

His flock is small but close-knit. Loyola Marymount is a Jesuit university with about 10,000 students, 375 of whom are Jewish.

""One of the messages I've repeated over and over to my students is: What is our responsibility to each other?""

Along with other chaplains on campus, Zysman has hosted speaker series, workshops and roundtables discussions on anti-Semitism and Islamophobia during this past year, but the days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur will be less about education and more about personal and communal religious devotion for students.

The motif of death is frequent during High Holy Days liturgies, and Zysman said The phrases ""Who shall live? and 'Who shall die?"" take on a deeper resonance this year.

More than 1,200 Israelis, not all of whom were Jewish, died in the Hamas attacks of October 7, and 100 Israelis remain held hostage by Hamas, according to the Israeli government. More than 41,500 people in Gaza have been killed during the Israeli bombardment that followed, according to Palestinian health authorities.

Loyola Marymount senior Maya Golban says she has been reflecting on the lives - and deaths - of so many people since October 7.

""I can't personally change the politics of the Middle East, but what I can do is honor the people who've lost their lives.""

Golban said she's become considerably more active in Jewish groups on campus over the last year, where she's sometimes felt on the defensive, having to repeatedly justify her beliefs.

As she enters the High Holy Days, she said she continues to pray for ""the peace and safety of everyone in the region: Israeli, Palestinian and Bedouin.""

During the weeks leading up to the High Holy Days, Rabbi Jocee Hudson has been teaching a lunchtime class on the University of Southern California campus in Los Angeles. She's the rabbi at the Hillel Jewish Center, just across the street.

""Welcome everyone. Let's put our feet on the ground,"" Hudson said as students finished the vegan enchiladas Hillel provides, while others snuck in at the last minute. ""As we gather, the question for today is 'What's on your heart?'""

Hudson opened the class by leading the group of about ten through a centering exercise.

""We root ourselves in presence."" she said, ""We root ourselves in the right here right now. As we say the blessing for Torah study.""

Together, the class recited the Hebrew prayer which translates, ""Blessed are you, oh Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hallows us and commands us to study the words of Torah.""

Among those taking this class is senior Dylan Julia Cooper.

""Right in the aftermath of October seventh,"" she said, ""we held a memorial on campus, which was so beautiful. And it was also really hard because people came to protest. And it was really difficult in my grief to hold my friends crying in my arms and know that people were protesting 20 feet away.""

Cooper, who's majoring in anthropology and theater, said it's been a year of perseverance and that October 7 coming in the middle of the High Holy Days ""serves as a reminder of how much we can endure as a community, as a universe.""

Cooper said he's used the weeks leading up to Rosh Hashanah to figure out how to let go of disillusionment over protests.

""My Jewish friends, my Muslim friends, my Palestinian Friends, my Israeli friends,"" says Cooper, ""I want them all to feel supported and loved by me. And I don't think that holding on to my anger or holding grudges is a good way to do that.""

Sitting next to Cooper in class was Matan Marder Friedgood, a junior at USC. He described this past year as one on edge.

""I have a friend who's not Jewish who's taking a Jewish studies course"" he said. ""She goes, 'Oh, Matan, you're Jewish!' And I feel myself tense up. I'm like 'What is this going to be about? What's going to happen?""

But in this story, it turns out he was more worried than he needed to be.

""She's like 'What's a Shabbat morning service?' It's the most benign question,"" he said. ""That was the year in a nutshell: 'You're Jewish.' Uh oh.""

But for Marder Friedgood, that intensity has meant the discovery of something about himself that he finds surprising.

""My connection to Judaism has grown stronger,"" he said, ""because of the pressure that's been put on it. And my connection to other Jews has grown stronger because of the pressure. And I am much more willing to embrace it publicly.""

Marder Friedgood's been asking himself how he and his community can put aside the fear and apprehension of the past year and welcome the Jewish New Year with sweetness.

""How do we bring back the Jewish Joy?"" he wondered. ""How do we just reincorporate all the positive -- all of what it means to be Jewish, all of the great things, all of the reasons we love it -- and hold the sadness and the grief at the same time?""

These are questions many Jews are asking themselves in the lead-up to both the High Holy Days and the October 7th anniversary. They're questions with no easy answers.

""It is only through experiences of very real grief that I have come to understand the capacity for very real joy,"" said Hillel Rabbi Jocee Hudson. ""It comes in the context of time, following Oct. 7th where all of us in the Jewish community have experienced deep anguish.""

""As we have seen tens of thousands of Palestinians also killed, we have ongoing anguish,"" she said. ""And there are students who have deep reactions to that -- deep moral outrage.""

That outrage is also why preparing for the High Holy Days this year has been so intense.

""When our hearts are broken open in grief,"" Hudson said, ""there are two possibilities: One is pulling back. The other is reaching out. And that's the spiritual work.""

It's spiritual work that asks a lot of 19 or 20 or 21-year-olds. But it's spiritual work that college junior Matan Marder Friedgood wants to help his community do together, even on October 7 itself. He and a housemate are planning a vigil on the University of Southern California campus that day.

""We're both musicians and so we're trying to uplift the space through creating -- I think we have a 10-piece band to try and play Israeli and Jewish music -- an atmosphere that is holding all the sadness and holding all the grief and all the anger. And we're looking toward the future.""

It's a future - a new year - marked by the hope for peace rather than the carnage of war. Marder Friedgood plans to end the vigil by teaching those gathered to sing in Hebrew a prayer for peace.

It's the closing line from the Medieval prayer known as the Kaddish. One translation reads, ""He who makes peace in the heavens -- may He bring peace to us and all the people of Israel. Let us say, 'Amen.'"""

Conflict in the Middle East is spreading. Is a wider regional war imminent? : Consider This from NPR,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/1202891566/iran-missile-attack-israel-hezbollah,2024-10-01T21:42:56Z,"Fire erupts between Ben Gurion International Airport near Tel Aviv and the city of Modiin following an Iranian missile attack, on October 1, 2024. Iran's Revolutionary Guards said a missile attack under way against Israel on October 1 was in response to the killing of Hezbollah chief Hassan Nasrallah last week as well as that of the Hamas leader.

The war in the Middle East appears to be widening, almost one year after Hamas launched its attack on Israel.

This comes after Iran launched a major missile strike that targeted sites across Israel, while Israel's air defenses attempted to shoot down the incoming fire, Israeli officials said.

NPR's Hadeel Al-Shalchi and Greg Myre reported that Iran has claimed the missile attack was in response to the assassination of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike in Beirut Friday, which killed 39 people, according to Lebanese health officials.

There was no immediate word on casualties or the amount of damage caused by the Iranian attack on Tuesday night.

Al-Shalchi and Myre also reported that Israeli airstrikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people in the past two weeks and forced many civilians to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing Nasrallah and several other top officials, as well as many civilians.

For more on what might unfold from here, Consider This host Ailsa Chang spoke with General Frank McKenzie, the retired Commander of United States Central Command.

Chang asked him if he had a sense of Iran's calculations, in launching Tuesday's attacks, and what it all might mean for the wider region.

""The long term goal of all Iranian foreign policy is regime preservation. They want to preserve the clerical regime. They don't get themselves into a situation where that regime is actually subject to direct attack by Israel or the United States or anyone else,"" he said.

McKenzie expressed his surprise towards the action taken by Iran.

""To be honest with you, I doubt their ability to have genuine success in this attack. And now the Israelis will have the option to retaliate and the Israelis possess far more retaliatory options against Iran than Iran does against Israel.""

The assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah is a major factor, but even then, McKenzie says that this will likely not bode well for Iran.

""Things did not go well for them in April when they launched the last attack on Israel. So you could see that Iranian thinking could be that they need to do something now. You've got to be very careful if you're going to do something, it needs to have a meaningful effect. If it doesn't have a meaningful, meaningful effect, you're going to be in worse shape than you were when you began.""

As to whether or not McKenzie believes this will lead to more U.S. involvement in the Middle East, he says precedent will likely predict that outcome.

""Well, I think we did last time. I would assume we're doing it this time. So I don't know, it's certainly very likely, I'd be very surprised if that's not the case.""

His top concerns on what might come next?

""I think the thing that people's minds will turn to next, [is] what will be the Israeli response? It will be scoped to what happens in this attack, which is not yet complete. So if there's significant damage done in this attack, then I would look for a very large Israeli response, and they've demonstrated that they have the ability to do it.""

McKenzie says Israel has already demonstrated it has the ability to operate ""almost with impunity over Tehran,"" and that will likely factor into whatever their response may be."

Writer Ta-Nehisi Coates says he long felt the pull to visit Africa -- and yet it was a trip he kept putting off.

""When you're Black in this country, Africa -- or the story that's told about Africa -- is a weight,"" Coates says. ""I always knew it was a trip that I had to take. But I think, in the back of my mind, I knew that I would have to confront some things, that it would not be a vacation.""

When Coates did finally travel to Senegal, he says it felt like a pilgrimage. As the plane descended into Dakar, he was so overcome with emotion that he uttered a profanity.

""It came out of nowhere, and I was shocked at myself,"" he says. ""But I think it was evidence of some things that I really had been burying that had to be confronted.""

While in Dakar, Coates visited the the island of Gorée, and the fort in which people were held before being forced onto ships that would take them to enslavement in the United States. There he says, ""What I imagined was my many, many, many, many, many grandmothers who were taken in that way. That was what I saw. ... That hit hard.""

Coates won the 2015 National Book Award for Between the World and Me, which was written in the form of a letter to his 15-year-old son about what it means to be a Black teenager and a Black man in America. In his new book, The Message, he reflects on his time in Senegal, as well as trips he took to South Carolina and to Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He describes it as a book about nationalism and belonging.

""It is about the nationalisms of people who are told that they are nothing, that they are not a nation, that they are not a people ... that the only place in the world that is fit for them is as an underclass or maybe not in the world at all,"" he says. ""And the stories that we construct to fight back against that.""

On staying on a beach in Senegal, contemplating the people who were taken to enslavement in America

There were people very clearly vacationing with their kids and frolicking in the water. And there was one of those really fancy pools that was kind of level with the ground and people serving drinks. And there was a DJ. And I went and I sat down in the restaurant ... and where I was seated, I could look out onto the Atlantic Ocean. And I knew that what I was feeling at that moment was not what everybody else there was feeling. It was like I was at a funeral. And everybody else was at a wedding. That's what it felt like.

On his parents naming him Ta-Nehisi as a way of connecting with their African roots

I think what my parents sought to do from the moment I was born was inure me against the racism of culture that pervades American life and really takes Africa and the story of Africa as its root. And what they sought to do was throw it back. And what they picked for me was an ancient Egyptian name that refers to the ancient kingdom of Nubia in the south, the place of ostensibly Black kings and Black kingdoms and Black queens and great deeds that were done by Black people. And to root me in that as a counter to the racist narrative that I would undoubtedly hear as I went through my life.

On being stopped by a guard while traveling to the old city of Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank

There are both Palestinians who live in Hebron and also there are Jewish settlers on the West Bank who live in Hebron also. They are not accorded the same rights. And this was made viscerally clear to me as I walked through Hebron with the group that I was with. There were streets that we would encounter where we were allowed as non-Palestinians to walk and Palestinians were not allowed to walk. ...

I was on my way to support a vendor, and a guard came out and he stopped me and he said, ""What's your religion, bro?"" And I said, ""I don't really have a religion. I'm not a particularly religious person."" He said, ""Come on, don't play. What is your religion? ... What is your parents' religion? ... What was your grandmother's religion?"" I said, ""Well, my grandmother was a Christian."" And he said, ""Ok, you can go past."" And it was so blatant. It was so clear. ... I wouldn't have been allowed to pass [if I was Muslim]. That was clear.

On differences he observed between the ways that Palestinians and Israelis are treated in the Israeli-occupied West Bank

I was being made aware of the fact that if a Palestinian is arrested on the West Bank, they are subject to the military system of justice, whereas if a Jewish settler is arrested on the West Bank, they're subjected to the civil system. ... I was made aware of the differing water laws that govern [access] depending on who you are, an entire separate system of justice that was ... separate and unequal. As a descendant of someone who was, or peoples who are, born into a system of governance that was separate and unequal, it was very hard for me to not be struck by that emotionally.

On the ways in which victims can become victimizers

I am part of a community that fought in the Civil War to free themselves as members of the Union Army, and we praise that effort, and we talk about that effort. And some of those soldiers went West and fought wars against the indigenous people of this country. They became victimizers. I'm part of a community that in an effort to to free itself and liberate itself from white racism in this country, bought into the dream of Liberia, which meant going over to Africa and subjecting Africans to Western civilization ... and ""Christianizing"" them and ""civilizing"" them. That is victims becoming victimizers.

What is uncomfortable is for us to see that the victimization and oppression, even at its highest point, may not necessarily be ennobling. ... In the most cliché terms -- I'm sorry to use this -- but to be a hurt person who hurts people [is] certainly possible. And that's a dark thought, ... because I think we want to believe that having that oppression is some sort of card, you know, a moral high ground that is automatically conferred. But the fact of the matter is that sometimes that's true. Sometimes it's not. And I think as much as I saw the connection between Black people and Palestinians when I was over there, it was not so hard for me to see myself in the Israelis.

On the need for more Palestinian voices to be heard

We need more Palestinians to be enshrined to tell their story and to tell their perspective. ... The people who are enduring, from my perspective, this system of apartheid have not been enshrined to speak about what future they would envision. ... It would be as if we were trying to figure out segregation ... and we completely sidelined Black people and deprived them of the ability to articulate what they felt the world should look like. Imagine a world where there can't be an ""I Have a Dream"" speech because nobody will cover it, and nobody will give the opportunity for that message to get out in the first place."

Lebanese politicians urgently called on the international community to pressure Israel to stop its advance into Lebanese territory on Tuesday, as Israeli troops crossed into southern Lebanon in an operation targeting Hezbollah outposts.

Lebanon's caretaker prime minister, Najib Mikati, warned on Tuesday that his country was facing ""one of the most dangerous phases of its history,"" urging the United Nations for emergency funding for civilians impacted by the conflict.

Imran Riza, the U.N's deputy special coordinator in Lebanon, said the country was seeking $426 million in U.N. assistance.

""As violence escalates, we call on the global community to provide this much needed support and to ensure protection of civilians,"" Riza said. ""Without sufficient resources, humanitarians risk leaving the population of an entire country without the support they urgently require.""

Israeli airstrikes have killed more than 1,000 people in Lebanon over the last two weeks, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The U.N. says around 1 million people -- nearly a fifth of the country -- have been displaced from their homes while fleeing this bombardment.

Israel's offensive follows days of intensifying fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, an Iran-backed Lebanese militant group.

The conflict entered a dramatic new phase over the weekend, following Israel's killing of Hezbollah's longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah, as well as several other top officials.

And now Israel says it is running a ""limited"" incursion of ""targeted ground raids"" in southern Lebanon aimed at Hezbollah militants that pose a threat to communities in northern Israel. Israeli authorities say about 63,000 Israelis remain displaced from the border area with Lebanon due to Hezbollah rocket fire.

Israel used similar wording about limited raids at the start of its invasion of the Gaza Strip following the Oct. 7 Hamas-led attack on Israel, and the Israeli invasion of Gaza has since expanded and continued to grind on one year later. So Israel's latest comments have raised skepticism in Lebanon about the actual scope of the operation.

""This is not an incursion, this is an invasion,"" Najat Aoun Saliba, a Lebanese member of parliament, told NPR. ""We've been invaded by another country and we have to call on the international community to call it as such.""

Saliba urged world leaders to call on Israel to put an immediate end to its military offensive in Lebanon.

""We definitely keep saying violence cannot stop violence. We need diplomatic efforts to stop the violence,"" Saliba said. ""We don't want Lebanon to also turn into another Gaza.""

Israel and Hezbollah began trading attacks back and forth across the Israel-Lebanon border after the Oct. 7 assault on Israel led by the Palestinian militant group Hamas.

In support of Hamas, Hezbollah says it will continue firing rockets into northern Israel until there's a cease-fire in Israel's military campaign in Gaza."

""We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack. A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran,"" the official said.

Israel begins ground offensive in Lebanon,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25657/israel-ground-offensive-lebanon,2024-10-01T10:06:47Z,"Tanks and troops gather in northern Israel on Monday in preparation for a ground invasion. Maya Levin/NPR hide caption

The Israeli military pressed its ground incursion into southern Lebanon on Tuesday, calling the operations ""limited incursions"" targeting Hezbollah militants.

The military said late Monday when it began its operations that it is aimed at Hezbollah targets that pose an immediate threat to communities in northern Israel. The incursion follows Friday's airstrike that killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The operation, approved by political and security officials, involves ground raids by Israeli commandos against Hezbollah targets and infrastructure in villages in southern Lebanon. The Israeli air force and artillery troops are providing back up to the ground forces.

The Israeli military has closed off the area of three Israeli towns near the border with southeast Lebanon. Israeli authorities say about 63,000 Israelis remain displaced from the border area with Lebanon due to Hezbollah rocket fire, and the U.N. says about one million Lebanese have been displaced from their homes fleeing Israeli airstrikes.

An Israeli security official, speaking anonymously, told NPR that Israeli troops have entered Lebanon targeting Hezbollah military compounds close to the border. The official said the military is ""acting in a limited area focusing on the villages right by the border. Some homes are 100 meters from the border, some dozens of meters from the border, and some hundreds of meters from the border."" The official said that a ground incursion into Beirut is ""not on the table.""

On Tuesday an IDF spokesperson asked residents of a number of villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate and move north of the Awali river.

On Monday, Hezbollah's deputy leader, Naim Kassem, said in a televised address that ""the resistance forces are ready for a ground engagement."" That was despite a series of devastating Israeli attacks on Hezbollah leaders and members in recent weeks.

The Lebanese army had moved back from some checkpoints at the southern border with Israel amid intense artillery shelling by Israeli forces. A Lebanese army official, who asked not to be identified because he was not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR this was a ""redeployment"" from forward positions vulnerable to an Israeli incursion.

A White House official told NPR the U.S. supports the incursion but is warning Israel about ""mission creep."" The Israeli ambassador to the U.S. told Israeli public radio the U.S. has not restricted the duration of Israel's incursion but that it is concerned about a regional escalation.

A senior U.S. official told NPR that the Pentagon will send a ""few thousand"" more troops to the Middle East, focused on air defense capabilities.

The Israeli offensive follows days of intensifying fighting between Israel and Hezbollah. Israeli strikes across Lebanon have killed more than 1,000 people in less than two weeks and forced many to flee their homes, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry. The strikes have targeted Hezbollah and its weapons, killing leader Hassan Nasrallah and several top officials, but they have also killed many civilians.

Israel and Hezbollah began trading attacks back and forth across the Israel-Lebanon border after the Oct. 7 assault on Israel led by the Palestinian militant group Hamas. In support of Hamas, Hezbollah says it will continue firing rockets into northern Israel until there's a cease-fire in Israel's military campaign in Gaza.

Israeli officials say that the goal of this incursion is to push Hezbollah back from the border, to create what they call a ""buffer zone."" Israel says it will keep targeting Hezbollah until Israeli residents can safely return to their homes in northern Israel after fleeing attacks from militants on the Lebanese side of the border.

The Israeli military is now engaged in warfare on multiple fronts. Israel's operation in Gaza continues with deadly strikes. On Sunday, Israel's military said it sent dozens of fighter jets more than 1,000 miles away to Yemen, where it said it bombed power plants and a seaport used by the Houthis to import oil for military purposes. The Houthis said the areas hit were civilian targets and that at least four people were killed and dozens wounded in the Israeli strikes.

Israeli security analysts said Israel's bombing campaign in Yemen was a message to Iran, showing Israel's long-range flight capability as a tacit warning to Iran that it, too, was within Israel's reach.

Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu issued a warning Monday to Iran, which backs Hezbollah and Hamas: ""There is nowhere in the Middle East Israel cannot reach.""

On Monday, U.S. Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin spoke with Israel's defense minister about the ""serious consequences for Iran"" if it launched a strike against Israel. The U.S. is concerned about Iran-backed groups threatening U.S. troops in Iraq and Syria as the conflict between Israel and Iran-backed groups intensifies. Defense secretary Austin said the U.S. supports Israel dismantling Hezbollah infrastructure along the Lebanon Israel border so Hezbollah cannot threaten Israeli border towns. But he called on Israel to ultimately pivot to diplomacy."
"Trump says Gaza 'could be better than Monaco,' but 'they never took advantage of it'",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-gaza-better-than-monaco-israel-hugh-hewitt-rcna174475,2024-10-08T20:25:45Z,"Trump also claimed he has been to Gaza. An aide later suggested that visiting Israel counted because ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Donald Trump said that Gaza ""could be one of the best places in the world"" -- better even, he said, ""than Monaco"" and lamented that people ""never took advantage of it.""

In an interview with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, Trump said: ""It could be better than Monaco. It has the best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything,"" referring to the Palestinian territory, which has been bombarded relentlessly by the Israeli military for the past 12 months, creating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.

""They never took advantage of it. You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place -- the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate,"" he said.

Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Jewish Democrats and denigrated Palestinians while claiming to be Israel's staunchest ally, said that Gaza was ""a rough place ... before all of the attacks and before the back-and-forth of what's happened over the last couple of years."" The Republican presidential nominee also claimed that he had visited Gaza, despite there being no record of him doing so, as president or otherwise.

Afterward, a Trump campaign official given anonymity by The New York Times said that Trump has been to Israel, stating incorrectly that ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Trump's estimation of the real estate potential of the Gaza Strip echoes that of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who said in an interview with the faculty chair of Harvard's Middle East Initiative in February that ""Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable."" Kushner also suggested that, if he were in charge, he would ""try to move people"" from Rafah, in the south of Gaza, into the Negev desert, ""so you can go in and finish the job"" of eliminating Hamas.

Trump's comments speak to how he might approach the fraught and widening tensions in the Middle East if he wins the election. They are also deeply disconnected from the realities of life in Gaza under Israel's extensive blockade and what human rights experts have called the illegal Israeli occupation of the West Bank. After Hamas assumed governance of Gaza in 2007, Israel removed its military presence and swiftly imposed an air, sea and land blockade. Israel has largely controlled who enters and leaves the Strip; severely limited the import and export of food, medical supplies, infrastructure materials and commercial goods; violently restricted access along the coast of Gaza; and cut off access to farmland. Before the current war, two-thirds of the population in Gaza was supported by food assistance.

Multiple conflicts between Hamas and Israel over the years have exacerbated those issues. Israel's current war in Gaza, launched after Hamas' attack killed 1,200 people in October 2023, has displaced more than 90% of the population in the Strip, according to the United Nations. Gaza health officials say at least 41,000 people have been killed."
Opinion | A tit-for-tat war with Israel will not turn out well for Iran,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/iran-regret-attack-israel-missiles-hezbollah-rcna174375,2024-10-08T18:37:58Z,"Last week, and for the second time this year, Iran launched a missile strike against Israel. This one, however, the military equivalent of poking a sleeping bear, is likely to provoke a fearsome Israeli response.

Iran's first direct attack in April, which targeted non-civilian areas and was telegraphed in advance, looked more like a demonstration project than a serious strike. It was Tehran's response to Israel assassinating a top Iranian general in Syria, but it appears to have been purposely narrowed to prevent a significant Israeli retaliation. Israel delivered a token response (attacking a single long-range air defense system) and, at least for a time, the threat of greater escalation diminished.

Last week's strike, a response to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah (a close ally of Iran) in a southern suburb of Beirut was qualitatively different. Iran fired missiles directly at civilian areas of Tel Aviv -- and sent millions of terrified Israelis into their safe rooms.

From a military standpoint, the Iranian attack accomplished little. While it caused some damage to targeted intelligence and military bases, there were few civilian casualties (A Palestinian man in Jericho died in the attacks, and two people were injured in Tel Aviv). More important, it barely put a dent in Israel's military capabilities.

According to Yonatan Touval, a foreign policy analyst at Mitvim, an Israeli think tank, ""Iran might have thought this was a measured strike it could get away with, and that at worst would provoke a symbolic counter-strike. But Israel perceives this differently and will likely launch a major retaliatory strike.""

As a geographically small country, deterrence has long been an essential element of Israel's strategic mindset. It has generally responded with disproportionate military force to acts of war. The response to Iran's missile attack will likely be no different. Touval said, ""Israel cannot let this pass if it is to reestablish deterrence and convey the message that it is not a sitting duck waiting to be hit at will.""

As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday, Oct. 8, ""Iran made a big mistake tonight -- and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to retaliate against our enemies.""

But there's another consideration for Israel's leaders. For years, Israel has wanted to launch a military strike on Iran to diminish or even out wipe out the country's nuclear program. Successive U.S. administrations have consistently discouraged Israel from doing so. Indeed, the attention devoted to the Iranian nuclear program -- and the signing of the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 by the Obama administration -- was motivated, in large measure, by a desire to avoid a conflict between Israel and Iran that could potentially drag in the United States.

But with last week's strike, Iran handed Israel a casus belli and legal basis for an attack, and the U.S. will be hard-pressed to stop Israel from responding. While it will be difficult for Israel to hit Iran's nuclear targets without direct U.S. involvement, one can imagine significant Israeli attacks on Iran's military and even economic infrastructure in an effort to humiliate the regime in Tehran.

So why did Iran do it?

Iran's decision-making seems to have been influenced not by military considerations but by reputational ones. Nayyera Haq noted last week in an MSNBC column that ""despite new leadership in Iran, there remains the long-standing need to appear strong in the Middle East and also on the world stage.""

To be sure, Iran was in a difficult situation, but it was one it created. For a year, Iran has supported Hezbollah as it, unprovoked, sent thousands of rockets and missiles into Northern Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. Perhaps Hezbollah and its patrons in Iran believed that Israel would not aggressively respond (yet another deadly miscalculation). But once Israel launched a major military attack, taking out Nasrallah and most of Hezbollah's leadership, and employed an audacious attack in which it blew up pagers that killed and wounded thousands of Hezbollah fighters, Iran's choices went from bad to worse.

""Doing nothing"" in response to the killing of Nasrallah would send a message that Israel could bloody its nose with no repercussions. But ""doing something"" risked unleashing another Israeli military strike. Iran chose the latter course -- and by doing so likely made a huge strategic error. Provoking a much stronger military rival is never a good idea. Iran has now opened the door to a military retaliation that will likely cause significant physical damage and could, ironically, undermine the regime in the eyes of Iranian civilians. What has Iran's expansionist foreign policy, support for terrorist networks and nuclear program brought the country other than economic devastation -- and now likely physical pain?

Iran's leaders likely believed they had no choice but to ""do something,"" but their apparent failure to fully consider how the missile strike would be viewed in Israel -- and the potential ramifications -- has put a target squarely on the country's back.

The same is true of Israel, it must be said. Any military response to last week's attack will need to be calibrated in order to prevent significant escalation. Ever since then-President Donald Trump foolishly pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, there has been no international monitoring of Iran's nuclear program. So it's impossible to know how far along Iran is in producing the fissile material necessary to construct a nuclear weapon. While it's highly unlikely that Iran is close to having a nuke that it can actually deliver, Israel may still want to tread lightly for fear of pushing Iran's leader into a desperate position.

Still, that doesn't mean Israel will sit this one out. Iran has provoked a far stronger military rival that has been itching at the chance to attack them. The consquences will be dire."
Trump picks an odd time to ignore the GOP's antisemitism problem,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-picks-odd-time-ignore-gops-antisemitism-problem-rcna174455,2024-10-08T13:57:55Z,"The presidential candidate wasn't just wrong to pretend the Republican Party doesn't have an antisemitism problem. He also had incredibly bad timing.

Like many prominent political figures, Donald Trump recognized the anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel. What was notable, however, was the Trumpian way in which he honored the day. The New York Times reported:

""The anti-Jewish hatred has returned even here in America, in our streets, our media and our college campuses and within the ranks of the Democrat [sic] Party in particular, not in the Republican Party, I will tell you,"" the former president said at an event held at one of his resorts.

Trump added: ""The Republican Party has not been infected by this horrible disease. And hopefully it won't be. It won't be as long as I'm in charge, I can tell you that.""

The rhetoric was obviously ugly and false, but it was also poorly timed.

As Trump pretended that the GOP doesn't have an antisemitism problem, Republican Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia continued to insist, over and over again, that ""they"" have a secret ability to ""control the weather"" -- and as my MSNBC colleague Ja'han Jones explained, ""Greene didn't specify whether 'they' are Jewish in this weather control scenario, but such claims about people nefariously controlling the weather have documented links to antisemitic conspiracy theories.""

A few days earlier, Republican Rep. Tim Burchett of Tennessee thought it'd be a good idea to condemn George Soros as a ""money changer of the worst kind.""

It came against a backdrop in which the public learned that North Carolina's Republican gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, allegedly described himself as a ""Nazi"" and praised Adolf Hitler's ""Mein Kampf.""

Let's not forget far-right media personality Tucker Carlson, who received a prominent speaking slot at the Republican National Convention, who recently interviewed and praised a Holocaust revisionist, and who nevertheless remains close with the party's presidential ticket.

And then, of course, there's Trump himself, who, just a few weeks ago, publicly suggested that he intends to blame Jews, at least in part, if he loses the 2024 race. A month earlier, after seeing Gov. Josh Shapiro's remarks at the Democratic National Convention, the former president decided to take a rhetorical shot at his critic. The Pennsylvania Democrat, the former president wrote online, is a ""highly overrated Jewish Governor.""

In context, there was no reason for the Republican to reference Shapiro's faith. Trump did it anyway.

It was not an isolated incident. As regular readers might recall, it was earlier this year when Trump also invoked a familiar dual loyalty trope by claiming that Jewish voters who support Democrats hate Israel.

It was part of a larger pattern. During his 2016 campaign, for example, Trump spoke to the Republican Jewish Coalition and said, ""You're not gonna support me because I don't want your money. You want to control your politicians."" He added, ""I'm a negotiator -- like you folks.""

Several months later, in the run-up to Election Day 2016, the Republican promoted antisemitic imagery through social media. In the closing days of the campaign, Trump again faced accusations of antisemitism, claiming Hillary Clinton met ""in secret with international banks to plot the destruction of U.S. sovereignty in order to enrich these global financial powers.""

While in office, the then-president used some highly provocative rhetoric about Jews and what he expected about their ""loyalties."" Trump also spoke at the Israeli American Council's national summit, where he suggested Jewish people are primarily focused on wealth, which is why he expected them to support his re-election campaign.

There was also his ugly reaction to a racist event in Charlottesville in 2017, in response to torch-wielding bigots chanting, ""Jews will not replace us.""

After his defeat, Trump kept this going, whining that Jewish voters ""don't love Israel enough,"" dining with prominent antisemites at Mar-a-Lago, and arguing that Jews need to ""get their act together"" and ""appreciate"" Israel ""before it is too late.""

In late 2022, the former president went so far as to declare that Jewish leaders ""should be ashamed of themselves"" over their ""lack of loyalty."" Around the same time, he added to the list, using related rhetoric about Jews with a documentary filmmaker.

And yet, there was Trump on the anniversary of Oct. 7, boasting that he'll ensure that his party isn't ""infected"" by antisemitism. What a relief that must be to the Jewish community."
"Opinion | Biden pledged to restore order as president. In the Middle East, he's failing.",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-iran-war-biden-hezbollah-election-rcna174262,2024-10-08T10:47:49Z,"The president's poor leadership has brought us closer to a regional war that could cause enormous suffering and hurt his own party.

One of Joe Biden's promises in his 2020 presidential campaign was that he would restore strong U.S. leadership abroad and rein in the chaos that Donald Trump had unleashed in the international order.

But if you take a look at the Middle East right now, Biden hasn't done a very good job of fulfilling that pledge.

Under Biden's watch, the Middle East is growing less stable. In the past few weeks, Israel has begun a new war with its invasion of Lebanon, against the public wishes of the Biden administration. Iran has fired around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, the second time it has ever launched such a direct assault on Israel from its own land. Israel has since promised it will retaliate against Iran -- and that if the tit-for-tat continues for an additional round, strikes on Iran's nuclear sites are on the table. Meanwhile Israel's war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks continues to rage with no end in sight. As a result of the instability, the price of oil is rising, and attacks on oil production in the region could cause it to surge more.

In other words, the Middle East is slowly inching toward breaking out into a full-scale regional war that could shake up the global economy, create a gigantic crisis in U.S. foreign policy and result in the deaths of countless civilians.

This is not good news for the Democrats as Election Day approaches: Just the rumblings of an imminent crisis or potentially surging gas prices could hurt the electoral appeal of Democrats, who are already suffering from their association with inflation.

The growing specter of wide-scale war in the Middle East is not some kind of approaching weather event or natural disaster. It is the product of choices. And our president has made some terrible ones that helped us get to this point. After Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, it was inevitable that Israel was going to retaliate. What was not inevitable was that the Biden administration would give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a far-right leader with neocolonial extremists in his Cabinet, carte blanche to retaliate against the entire population of the Gaza Strip however he wished to.

The Biden administration has appeared to use leaks and statements to suggest that it believes Netanyahu has gone too far in his brutality toward the civilians of Gaza, but in practice it has greenlighted all of Israel's actions. The Biden administration has been a staunch defender of Israel at the United Nations, shielding it from legally binding Security Council resolutions. It has given Israel billions in military aid. Aside from a brief, temporary and ultimately symbolic pause in arms transfers, Biden has not threatened to cut off aid, or even condition aid on Israel's compliance with international or U.S. law. The Biden administration, to keep weapons shipments intact under U.S. law, has reportedly ignored findings from the State Department and USAID that Israel had blocked U.S. humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Netanyahu's takeaway from Biden's support is that he can take U.S. backing as unconditional and do whatever he wants not only toward Palestinian civilians, but in the region more broadly. Netanyahu has embraced a ""shoot first, notify Biden later"" attitude toward many high-stakes and escalatory actions against adversaries in the Middle East, such as when Israel struck the Syrian headquarters of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, or when Israel leveled several buildings in Beirut in a bombing that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's operations in Lebanon -- against Biden's public wishes -- have already displaced close to a quarter of Lebanon's population and killed hundreds of civilians, according to PBS' NewsHour. And Netanyahu has demonstrated he feels no obligation to listen to U.S. calls to wind down the bloody military operation in Gaza, which is why Israel and Hezbollah have locked horns in the last year.

As Atlantic Council fellow Nicholas Blanford explained to me, Israel's escalation with its adversaries in the region increases the likelihood of a regional war. If, for example, Israel decides to entrench itself in a more wide-scale war in Lebanon, it could nudge Hezbollah to unleash its most destructive firepower, such as its precision-guided missiles that it has so far refrained from using. And if Iran were to fear that Israel is about to wipe out Hezbollah at some point, it could ""activate all [its] proxies across the region"" against Israel, dragging several other countries directly into the conflict.

We don't know exactly how Netanyahu would act if Biden were to condition or cut off aid to Israel. But given that U.S. military support is vital to Israel's national security and military operations, Netanyahu would be far more likely to behave conservatively in his military campaigns and targeted strikes across the region.

Netanyahu is aware that the timing of his more aggressive maneuvering comes at an acutely sensitive time for Biden politically. Biden is likely in the weeks before Election Day to be particularly hesitant to initiate an upheaval in U.S.-Israeli relations by cutting off weapons shipments or demanding that Netanyahu act like more of a cooperative U.S. ally. But at the same time Biden looks rudderless and weak by not doing anything.

When asked at a press conference Friday if he believed Netanyahu was trying to influence the U.S. election, Biden said, ""I don't know."" And when asked by another reporter, ""How long are you OK with Israel bombing Lebanon? What is acceptable to you?"" he smiled and walked away from the podium.

Biden has gotten himself into this bind through his record of unconditional support for Israel, no matter how badly it deviates from basic morality in warfare, international law or U.S. interests. One can't help but wonder if Biden's poor leadership in the Middle East might just mark a historic first: a president inadvertently springing an October surprise on his own party."
"Opinion | Here's how Israel, Iran and Hezbollah can avoid an all-out war",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/how-israel-iran-hezbollah-can-avoid-war-rcna174123,2024-10-07T19:40:18Z,"By Hussein Ibish, senior resident scholar at the Arab Gulf States Institute

The conflict between Israel and Hezbollah, as well as its sponsors in Tehran, appears to be spiraling completely out of control. An all-out war is looming with Israel, whose government is flush with victory and triumphalism and in little mood to suspend its attacks as Iran and Hezbollah vow to fight on.

The Biden administration sought to limit the post-Oct. 7 crisis to a war in the Gaza Strip, and especially prevent it from spreading into Lebanon. The policy has fallen apart, with Israel having invaded Lebanon, continuing to batter Hezbollah with air attacks and, most dangerously of all, tit-for-tat missile attacks between Iran and Israel. At the time of writing, the region is bracing for Israel's inevitable retaliation against Iran.

Yet, an all-out war on multiple fronts could still be avoided since there is an off-ramp for the warring parties.

A mutual drawdown could center on the implementation of United Nations Security Council resolution 1701, adopted in the aftermath of the last major Israel-Hezbollah war in 2006. The resolution holds that Hezbollah should withdraw its fighters and heavy equipment from the south of Lebanon up to the Litani River, about 25 km (roughly 15.5 miles) into the country.

The resolution was accepted by Israel and the Lebanese government, but not formally by Hezbollah. Israel and Hezbollah settled into a ""new normal"" of routine clashes on both sides of the border limited to about a mile on either side, aimed at military targets and producing limited casualties.

This understanding persisted until last Oct. 7, when both sides' attitudes changed. While it didn't want a war with Israel, Hezbollah couldn't remain completely passive and preserve its reputation as a ""resistance"" organization. So it increased rocket fire, initially within the accepted understanding. But for Israel, that was no longer acceptable. Oct. 7 prompted a new border security doctrine, rendering the presence of an Iranian-backed militia to its north strategically and, especially, politically intolerable.

Israeli leaders needed to inflict strategic costs on Iran and its network, which had benefited while paying almost no price from the Oct. 7 attack and its aftermath. They also sought to recuperate the legitimacy of Israeli security institutions through a clear-cut victory over a major enemy, which was not available in Gaza. Hezbollah was a more strategically significant and conventional target, offering credible metrics of victory.

Discussion about an invasion of Lebanon began as early as Oct. 12, 2023, pushed by Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant. It was prevented by the Biden administration and the need to focus on Hamas. But as Israel began to run out of targets in Gaza, and Hezbollah's cross-border attacks had intensified over time, attention began to turn north.

While Hezbollah and Iran definitely did not want a war to defend Hamas (an unreliable ally) or Gaza (a place of no strategic significance), even ambivalent Israelis could see potential advantages to expanding the conflict. This gave them near-absolute escalation dominance, and the ability to control the scope and pace of the conflict.

As the U.S. election loomed, with Israel enjoying maximum freedom of action and impunity from U.S. pushback, it began a series of major attacks designed to cripple Hezbollah. Targets included the assassination of many of its key leaders, including Hassan Nasrallah, battlefield commanders, fighters and operatives, and heavy equipment including missiles and rocket launchers. Ignoring a week of U.S. efforts to organize a cease-fire, Israel suggested it would accept, it launched a major invasion of Lebanon's south.

Throughout this process, Hezbollah pulled its punches, never unleashing its most powerful precision-guided missiles at the most sensitive and strategic Israeli targets, avoiding the Dimona nuclear reactor and population centers such as Haifa. Iran remained passive, with the exception of a failed drone response to an Israeli strike on the Iranian Embassy annex in Damascus that killed several high-ranking Iranian generals. That all changed Oct. 1 -- when Iran unleashed its second significant missile barrage against Israel.

The ball is now firmly in Israel's court, as heavy fighting continues in southern Lebanon and the air campaign against Hezbollah proceeds apace. Israel will certainly respond militarily to Iran's attack, but much will depend on whether it attacks redline Iranian targets such as oil installations or nuclear facilities.

Many fear that Israel will seize the opportunity to launch a protracted air war against Iran that is intended to draw the U.S. into conducting a bombing campaign sufficient to knock Iran's nuclear program back by a decade or more.

Virtually no one in the United States wants to be drawn into a major war with Iran, even on behalf of Israel, but the Israelis probably lack the conventional firepower to do the job for themselves.

Fortunately, there is an offramp.

The Lebanese government, obviously acting pursuant to consultations with Hezbollah, is offering to implement 1701, with the militia pulling back and being replaced in the south by the Lebanese armed forces and U.N. observers.

Riding a wave of wins, Israel's ruling coalition may be in no mood to compromise. But sensible Israelis must realize that they are on the brink of being drawn into another prolonged occupation in southern Lebanon which would be the ideal context for Hezbollah to eventually rebuild its organization, power and legitimacy. Hezbollah would like nothing more than a return to the fight against Israel that began in 1982 when the organization was founded to combat Israeli occupation and culminated with Israel's retreat in May 2000.

In his final speech, Nasrallah said he would welcome an Israeli invasion of Lebanon. Many dismissed it as bluster but Nasrallah was almost certainly serious, given Hezbollah's urgent need to recover and rebuild. Israel may be unwittingly handing them the opportunity to do that on their own terms.

Moreover, a war with Iran carries enormous risks, including the development of potentially serious resentment against Israel in the United States. It could sentence Washington to a prolonged pattern of routine bombing runs against Iran, just as occurred in the 1990s against Iraq. And Iran and Hezbollah both retain options, including more powerful missiles and the use of other proxies and even terrorists around the world to strike back. The danger of Israeli overreach, especially pursuing open-ended insurgencies to the north and south -- and potentially one that appears to be brewing to the east in the occupied West Bank -- is considerable.

The deal would look like this: Hezbollah agrees to pull back fighters and heavy equipment to beyond the Litani River, to be replaced by Lebanese and U.N. troops. Hezbollah also ceases rocket fire against Israel, with both parties agreeing to decouple the Lebanon conflict from the Gaza war. This agreement would also allow Israel and Iran to stop their extraordinarily dangerous tit-for-tat exchanges and spare the region, and the U.S., from a multifront regional war and a direct U.S. military confrontation with Iran.

Lebanon and Hezbollah seem willing to take this deal, and Washington is pushing it enthusiastically. Iran would surely welcome it to, as Hezbollah would not have greenlighted the Lebanese acting prime minister to make the offer without approval from Tehran. The main question is whether Israel's government, with the wind at its sails, is in any mood to compromise.

The Biden administration needs to remind Israel of the dangers of overreach, and potential for serious damage to bilateral relations if Israel is viewed as dragging the U.S. into another catastrophic ""forever war"" in the Middle East. Biden has already warned Israel not to make ""the mistakes we made"" after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. The parallels are unnerving. A national trauma followed by deceptively easy early victories, as the U.S. experienced in Afghanistan and Israel thinks it has accomplished in Gaza, is the perfect setup for catastrophic overreach.

Given the existence of an off-ramp, Iran and Hezbollah's apparent willingness to take it, and the urgent need for Washington to avoid getting dragged into another madcap Middle East adventure, one of Biden's most important final missions is to convince Israel to take a deep breath, and the deal, before it's too late."
Opinion | Our son is still being held by Hamas. Bring him home now.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-hamas-hostages-october-7-anniversary-itay-chen-rcna173383,2024-10-07T10:15:04Z,"As the anniversary of the worst day of our lives approaches, we ask everyone to think of their own families.

We often think about the days before Oct. 7, 2023. Looking back now, we realize our lives were so simple and our problems were trivial. Our son Itay was just starting his adult life. While our lives have greatly changed over the past year, the tragedy we wake up to every morning has not. There are still 101 hostages, including our son, who remain captive in Gaza. Now, we spend each day in government meetings, protesting in the streets and running to the ends of the Earth to bring Itay and the rest of the hostages home.

Itay is an American citizen and Israel Defense Forces soldier who was stationed on the Israeli border with Gaza on Oct. 7. He bravely fought to protect Israeli civilians and was abducted and kidnapped into Gaza.

On March 12, we heard a knock on our front door that still rings loud in our ears. Our stomachs dropped as we opened the door and were told our precious son had been murdered by Hamas terrorists. With so much misinformation swirling around this conflict, we still don't know what to believe. We question whether or not he survived. We are holding out hope that Itay is still alive.

A year after Oct. 7, we wonder how much longer we have to beg world leaders to do their jobs and secure a hostage release deal. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government have failed our son and all the hostages. Each day a deal is delayed -- and our children, parents, brothers and sisters remain in the hands of ruthless terrorists -- is another second they are closer to death.

Prime Minister Netanyahu promised a deal was imminent when he addressed Congress back in July. His lies erode our sense of hope. Qatar and Egypt have failed to effectively pressure Hamas to accept a deal, and each time we are close, Hamas pushes the goalpost.

Will one year turn into two? Or three? Will this unimaginable nightmare continue forever?

Our family is deeply appreciative of the Biden administration's tireless efforts to secure an immediate and total release. But it is not enough.

Last week in Washington, we met with national security adviser Jake Sullivan for our 13th in-person meeting. We met with CIA Director William Burns and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. Although our meetings have been productive, we ask that key assumptions be challenged, methods be re-evaluated and new tactics be considered.

Itay and the 100 other hostages are depending on us. This administration is running out of time before the election and a changing of the guard. Nothing should hold them back from securing a deal to release the hostages -- who include seven U.S. citizens.

We just observed Rosh Hashanah -- the Jewish New Year. This holiday is a moment for serious introspection and anticipation for what is to come. We traditionally eat apples and honey to signify a ""sweet"" start. What could possibly be ""sweet"" about this new year? How many more holidays will there be an empty chair at our table? Our Rosh Hashanah wishes were simple: Do everything to bring the hostages home now. Before it is too late.

Our family forever broke on Oct. 7. Since then, we wear tape on our clothes reminding the world of how many days we have endured life without Itay.

As we prepare to write ""365"" days and tape that number to our chests, we ask: How much longer? The remaining hostages are being executed, and we are on borrowed time. As the anniversary of the worst day of our lives approaches, we ask everyone to think of their own families.

What would you do to bring your loved one home? Imagine the ends of the Earth to which you'd run to see them maybe just once more. Enough is enough. Our world leaders must get the deal done now."
"Opinion | On a grim Oct. 7 anniversary, the potential for wider war has never felt greater",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-october-7-anniversary-biden-netanyahus-iran-rcna174175,2024-10-07T10:14:59Z,"By Andrea Mitchell, NBC Chief Foreign Affairs Correspondent; Host, 'Andrea Mitchell Reports'

A year ago, Israel and Saudi Arabia were talking with the U.S. at the United Nations meetings in New York about an agreement that could end hostilities between Israel and its Arab neighbors, reshaping the Middle East. Then Hamas terrorists attacked Israel, taking hostages and slaughtering around 1,200 Israelis. A year after the Oct. 7 massacre, most of the surviving hostages have not been released, more than 40,000 Gazans have died according to according to local health authorities, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's popularity at home is soaring because of his military successes against Hezbollah, and the Biden administration has less influence than ever over Israel's decision-making.

With Israel and Iran now teetering on the verge of all-out war, administration officials fear these escalating retaliatory exchanges could explode into a regional conflict -- exactly what President Joe Biden has been trying to prevent since the day after Hamas' surprise attack, when Hezbollah joined in and started sending rockets toward Israel.

Asked why the U.S. -- Israel's largest provider of weapons -- has so little leverage over its closest ally, a senior official told me, ""We have leverage, we haven't always used it."" And administration officials say Netanyahu now sees a brief window before the U.S. election to try to eliminate what he says is an existential threat to Israel's survival: Iran and its terrorist proxies' determination to eliminate Israel as an independent state.

So how did Netanyahu resurrect his political support at home, which had all but collapsed after his military and intelligence agencies failed to detect the Hamas attack? It's been a long and dangerous 12 months.

In the immediate aftermath of the massacre, there was worldwide horror and sympathy. But a few weeks later, when Israel bombed the Jabalia refugee camp in northern Gaza in an effort to kill a Hamas commander, the videos went viral. Analysis from satellite images suggested Israel had used 2,000-pound ""bunker buster"" bombs, capable of causing massive damage to anyone within hundreds of feet of impact.

The Arab world, the European public and protesters in the U.S. were outraged. Leading Democratic senators and lifelong supporters of Israel told me privately they were horrified at what they saw as a disproportionate use of force. Foreign service officers at the State Department complained about the use of an American-made bomb in the strike, a potential violation of congressionally mandated restrictions on the use of U.S. weapons. Meanwhile Israel's initial siege of Gaza, which had cut off food, water and fuel, was creating a desperate humanitarian crisis.

For 11 months, CIA Director William Burns and Secretary of State Tony Blinken shuttled around the Middle East, negotiating with Israel, Egypt and Qatar -- which represents Hamas -- for a cease-fire and hostage release. There was one brief cease-fire in November, and more than 100 hostages from all over the world returned home. But every time Blinken anticipated or announced another imminent breakthrough, Netanyahu or Hamas -- or both -- would raise the stakes. On his 10th mission to the region, Blinken didn't even stop in Israel. There was no deal to be had.

And then Hamas executed American Hersh Goldberg-Polin and five other hostages, a devastating blow to their courageous families.

The dominos continued to fall. In April, Iran retaliated for Israel's bombing of an Iranian consulate in Damascus. Israel intercepted all but one of the drones and missiles with the help of the U.S. and other allies. Then, a rocket believed to have been fired by Hezbollah hit a soccer field in the Israeli-controlled Golan Heights, killing 12 youngsters. Israel again upped the ante, assassinating the Hamas political director in Iran's capital -- a dramatic display of Israel's ability to penetrate Iranian defenses.

Arguably Israel's most stunning demonstration of its reach was a coordinated operation that resulted in thousands of pagers used by Hezbollah members exploding, often in public. Dozens died and thousands were injured, according to Lebanese health officials. This was followed by the targeted assassination of the veteran Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a killing Netanyahu approved from New York, just after addressing the United Nations General Assembly. Briefing reporters a few hours later, a senior Israeli official told us Israel would continue trying to eliminate Hezbollah, saying when your enemy is down, you don't let him up.

But today, as Israel commemorates the grim anniversary of Oct. 7, hostage families live in dread of their loved ones being killed. Meanwhile, Biden seems paralyzed. As one U.S. official told me, Netanyahu knows Biden is in a political straightjacket. An emboldened Netanyahu will yet again likely ignore the president's calls for a proportionate response; the Israeli leader may even take this moment to deal a decisive blow to Iran. A Saudi deal with Israel seems dead, for now. And the potential for a wider war involving the U.S. has never been greater."
Opinion | How Israel's invasion of Lebanon could spiral into a massive regional war,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-lebanon-war-iran-hezbollah-biden-rcna173364,2024-10-04T16:30:43Z,"An expert explains why Israel's intensifying war on Hezbollah is risky for the region.

Israel moved military forces into southern Lebanese territory Monday, an invasion that marks a major new level of intensity in about a year of conflict with Hezbollah. The paramilitary organization fired rockets at Israeli positions in the Shebaa Farms the day after Oct. 7 ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people after Hamas' attacks on Israel. (That area is a disputed territory which Lebanon and Syria say belongs to Lebanon, and Israel controls and says belongs to Syria.) Hezbollah, sometimes called a state within a state, is backed by Iran and does not have widespread support in Lebanon.

Then Tuesday, Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, citing last week's assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and, this summer, the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

The Biden administration has long opposed an Israeli incursion into Lebanon. But in the past year, the administration has also been unwilling to take any meaningful steps to rein in Israel's behavior, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acting boldly to assert more dominance in the region and degrade Israel's adversaries -- with a continued disregard for civilian lives. Israeli airstrikes have struck medical facilities and already killed hundreds of civilians in Lebanon. The probability of a regional war seems to be growing by the day.

To better understand the unfolding conflict, I called Nick Blanford, a Beirut-based fellow at the Atlantic Council and the author of ""Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel.""

Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Zeeshan Aleem: What is happening right now and how do we know when to say whether this is a new war?

Nicholas Blanford: I think you have to put the developments of the last few weeks into some context. One day after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Hezbollah staged a pro forma attack against Israeli positions along the Lebanon-Israel border, and it dedicated this attack to its allies -- Hamas in Gaza. But very quickly it turned into a kind of a tit-for-tat, daily attacks. The Hezbollah guys would attack Israeli military positions along the border; the Israelis would retaliate with artillery fire airstrikes into south Lebanon. And this really continued from October almost uninterrupted.

There was a clear moment in September when Israel's patience ran out. And they escalated in a very dramatic fashion, by detonating thousands of pagers which they'd been able, apparently, to booby trap. The following day, they detonated hundreds of walkie-talkies. That was followed up by intense airstrikes across areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a presence. And those attacks have intensified over the past two weeks, climaxing on Sept. 27 with the massive airstrike on Hezbollah's underground headquarters in south Beirut, which killed the veteran Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who has led the group for 32 years. The latest development is the advance of some elite Israeli army units into southern Lebanon where they have reportedly already taken some casualties.

So I would say we are in a war but it is not yet full scale. Both sides are mainly hitting military targets, not infrastructure as well, although hundreds of civilians have been killed in Lebanon.

Could you give us a brief primer on Hezbollah? How it emerged, what it is, what it believes in and its social function in Lebanon?

Blanford: Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organization that follows the Iranian, theocratic system of rule. Hezbollah has a secretary general -- most recently the late Nasrallah -- but the true leader of Hezbollah is the spiritual leader of Iran, currently, Ali Khamenei. He's the ultimate authority and, in general, the Iranians will set the strategic agenda.

Hezbollah emerged after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to kick out the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was deployed in strength in south Lebanon. The Israelis in '82 reached all the way to Beirut and then they gradually withdrew. By 1985, they were occupying a border strip along the Lebanon-Israel border and Hezbollah became the main resistance force against that Israeli occupation. Particularly during the 1990s, Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran but also supported by neighboring Syria, was able to deal blow after blow to the Israeli occupation forces, and that culminated in May 2000 with Israel pulling out of south Lebanon.

Hezbollah refused to put down its arms after the Israelis left. They said, 'We need to keep our arms, our military force, to deter Israel from coming back into south Lebanon.' But there was also another unspoken reason, which is that Hezbollah gradually became a source of deterrence for Iran -- especially after the war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 when it expanded very quickly and acquired a great deal of weaponry from Iran, Syria and elsewhere. So, for Iran, Hezbollah has now become a major force multiplier.

Hezbollah has a slightly schizophrenic character, because it is ideologically beholden to the Islamic leadership of Iran, but of course it is a Lebanese organization. It survives or falls depending on the support it gets from the Lebanese Shia community, which is why, since the beginning, Hezbollah has invested a lot in social welfare organizations.

The Shia population of Lebanon tends to be traditionally fairly downtrodden. They live in the poorer areas of the country, traditionally neglected by central governments. And Hezbollah really stepped in with schools, with hospitals, with repairing war damaged houses, even things like helping farmers with agricultural aid. It's become an indispensable organization for the Lebanese Shia community. So they've been able to maintain that support since the early 1980s.

Other communities: the Christians and Sunnis, in particular, the Druze, to an extent, [say] 'Well, hang on a minute. We do have a national army. Why do we need a Shia militia, armed to the teeth, stronger than many armies around the world, to defend Lebanon?' So there have been growing calls for Hezbollah to disarm, and this is why Hezbollah has moved deeper into Lebanese politics, particularly over the last 19 years, since the 2005 parliamentary elections.

What are the fundamental dynamics driving how Hezbollah and Israel's government see each other, both in terms of geopolitical interests and domestic political interests?

Blanford: Ideologically, Hezbollah and Iran want to see the end of Israel, and the restitution of Palestine to the Palestinians. They have in the past assisted Palestinians during the Al Aqsa Intifada. They would help the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza fight the Israelis. But in the past, they didn't get directly involved. When they kicked the Israelis out of Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah didn't immediately rush across the border into Israel and say, ""We're going to go and liberate Jerusalem now."" There's an acknowledgment that it's up to the Palestinians to liberate themselves, but Hezbollah is definitely there to help.

When you look at it more realistically, the reason why Hezbollah is so powerful now is because the Iranians want them to be. We go back to this notion of Hezbollah forming a key role in Iran's deterrence architecture: The stronger Hezbollah becomes, the safer Iran feels.

The Institute for National Security Studies, a leading think tank in Israel, has for the past few years described Hezbollah as Israel's greatest threat, which is quite remarkable in itself, because we're not talking about a country, we're talking about an organization, albeit one that is backed by a powerful regional country.

The Israelis have watched Hezbollah grow stronger and stronger. What the Israelis are doing now is something they haven't dared to do before, and that is to really go for broke with Hezbollah. What's interesting is I think the Israelis are gambling that Hezbollah and the Iranians do not want a full-scale war with Israel right now. Why? Because if there is a full-scale war, whatever the outcome, Hezbollah will take a huge battering, as indeed we're seeing now, and there's no guarantee that Hezbollah will be able to rebuild, rearm and re-equip as quickly as it did after the 2006 war to continue serving as a deterrence for Iran. In other words, if Hezbollah gets engaged in a full-scale war now, Iran could lose its major deterrence factor in that war, and all this would be for the sake of coming to the support of Hamas in Gaza. Hamas is small fry compared to Hezbollah -- Hezbollah is much, much, much more important to Iran than Hamas. Which is why Hezbollah is still acting with a certain amount of restraint despite Israel's escalated action against it. Hezbollah still has not used its arsenal of precision-guided missiles.

It's a dangerous gamble. It could go wrong. Especially now that Israeli troops are operating on the ground in south Lebanon, Hezbollah's home turf. The current conflict could spill into a major war. We're still below that threshold moment, but if it happens, it has a potential to go regional, dragging in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Can you walk us through the different scenarios you see unfolding here?

Blanford: The least likely one is that a cease-fire comes in. The Americans and the French had an idea for a 21-day cease-fire to calm things down along the Lebanon-Israel border. Netanyahu has rejected it. So that's not going to happen..

A second scenario is that what we're seeing now continues. The Israelis haven't started hitting Lebanese infrastructure, power stations, bridges, roads, the airports, seaports; they are focusing on Hezbollah military targets by using air power and now ground forces, albeit in a limited manner. Hezbollah, by the same token, is striking back at Israeli military targets. They haven't been hitting Israeli infrastructure. Now this could go on even at this heightened rate. But under current circumstances, I suspect that Hezbollah will continue doing what it's doing -- in other words, absorb these blows that the Israelis have inflicted, and keep firing rockets into Israel.

In some respects, the Israeli ground maneuver could play right into Hezbollah's hands, as the Israelis are entering terrain that Hezbollah has had for 18 years [and Hezbollah has been able] to prepare for exactly this eventuality. When the Israelis did move into Lebanon in 2006 after two weeks of aerial bombing, they came in for a big surprise. They didn't understand Hezbollah's underground bunker networks, its ambush positions, firing positions.

You could have a similar scenario this time round, albeit on a larger scale, where the Israelis, who have a better understanding of what Hezbollah is about these days, could come in in force for what they would describe perhaps as a limited incursion to basically rubble-ize and depopulate this broad strip of south Lebanon. But they risk losing a lot of troops because they're going to be operating in Hezbollah's environment. And at the end of it, if the mission is successful, what do you do then? Do you reoccupy south Lebanon? If so, you've gone back to the situation between 1978 and 2000 and that didn't end too well for the Israelis. But if you pull back to the border, then what is to stop Hezbollah basically moving back into the border district and beginning to rebuild?

There could come a point when the Israelis say, 'We've hit all the targets from the air and our soldiers are fighting on the ground but Hezbollah is still firing rockets across the border.' And this is where perhaps a third scenario can kick in: The Israelis conclude that, well, we're going to have to escalate this even further by deploying a larger number of troops into Lebanon to expand the target set to include Lebanese infrastructure as well. It could be at that point that Hezbollah, with Iranian blessing, feels it has no choice but to launch its precision-guided systems at Israeli military and infrastructure targets. This is where the conflict could go regional.

What role does the U.S. have in all this, and what advice would you give to the Biden administration on how to prevent a full-scale regional war from breaking out?

Blanford: Yes, a regional war potentially could happen. If the Iranians assess that Hezbollah is about to get bludgeoned by Israel, they may conclude, 'We've got nothing left to lose. We're about to lose Hezbollah. Let's go large. We'll activate all our proxies across the region, and we'll give it a go and see what happens to Israel.'

I think the Biden administration is in a difficult position. President Biden is enormously frustrated with Netanyahu, partly because of the Gaza conflict going on for so long. But he has been urging Netanyahu since the get-go to not open a second front with Hezbollah. Now you could argue that a second front was open anyway, because of these simmering tit-for-tat attacks that have been going on across the Lebanon-Israel border since October. But these attacks were containable. Hezbollah has said, 'Look, this is a support front that we're doing. Once the war in Gaza ends, we're going to stop.' So the emphasis has been very much on trying to conclude a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which will then have a trickle-down effect and should stabilize the Lebanon-Israel border. But of course, we haven't had a Gaza cease-fire. The conflict continues, and now the Israelis clearly have lost patience with Hezbollah and have gone large.

There's very little that the Biden administration feels it can do, particularly when you've got a very close election coming up in just over a month now. So the Biden administration could do what it's done before, and then suspend arms shipments to Israel, but this time do it properly. Cut off all military support to Israel. That would put a lot of pressure on Netanyahu to start picking up the phone and listening when Biden calls. But I don't think they're going to do that because there'll be a political backlash in the United States, and that could affect Kamala Harris' chances against Donald Trump. I think Netanyahu is taking advantage of this and is going for it."

Suspended Cornell student faces a potential exit from U.S. after pro-Palestinian demonstration,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/cornell-suspended-student-visa-israel-protest-boeing-rcna173914,2024-10-03T21:33:28Z,"International doctoral student Momodou Taal could lose his F-1 visa after he was suspended a second time by his university over his role in a protest against companies that provide weapons to Israel.

Cornell University student Momodou Taal fears he may have to leave the U.S. following his involvement in a pro-Palestinian demonstration last month.

Taal, an international doctoral student from the United Kingdom, teaches a course called ""What Is Blackness?"" at Cornell and has been active in pro-Palestinian advocacy on campus.

But under a new -- and controversial -- university policy governing protests, Taal was one of four students suspended in April after he participated in a pro-Palestinian encampment. And two weeks ago, he joined more than 100 demonstrators at a campus career fair in protest of Boeing and L3Harris being allowed to participate. The two defense contractors have been criticized for providing weapons to Israel.

Taal admits that he joined a crowd of people who entered the career fair, but says that he left after five minutes. Some of the activists reportedly confronted Boeing representatives at the fair.

The university released a statement condemning the demonstration, writing in part:

A university official overseeing student conduct informed Taal in an email last week that he had been suspended again -- after his purported display of ""escalating, egregious behavior and a disregard for the University policies"" -- and was given a no-trespass order that bars him from campus. The official also told Taal that his F-1 student visa would be terminated, which can happen to foreign students who are suspended multiple times, and referred him to an immigration adviser.

Taal alleges that he has been targeted because he is Black and Muslim. The university's interim president, Michael Kotlikoff, has denied any targeting. In a statement Monday, Kotlikoff said that nearly 20 participants in the career fair protest had been identfied and added:

Taal has been granted two shots at appeal. The first -- to Cornell's vice president for student and campus life -- was denied. The second -- to the university provost -- is under review.

In an interview with The ReidOut Blog, Taal said his Black identity has inspired his activism.

""When I think of the best of the Black radical tradition, it always has centered movements in America and beyond,"" he said. ""Wherever they perceive injustice, I have found Black figures at the forefront. Many of the Black figures that I study, they also focus and spoke about Palestine as well in their time.""

Taal, who counts Malcolm X as one of his inspirations, said his situation is indicative of a broader crackdown on free speech on college campuses. And as he awaits word on his appeal and potentially imminent removal from the country, Taal has received an outpouring of liberal support -- including from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

Taal's destiny is in the hands of the university at this point. And an email he received from his immigration adviser last week warned him that things could move quickly if his appeal is denied.

""There is no grace period for departure from the US once your F-1 record is closed,"" the adviser wrote. ""You should leave either before the end date of your F-1 record or right away after the record is closed."""
Opinion | The House GOP's problems have only multiplied in the year since ousting McCarthy,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/house-gop-kevin-mcarthy-2024-election-rcna173269,2024-10-03T10:27:07Z,"GOP members of Congress are trying to pitch voters on another term in the majority. There's not much for them to sell.

Thursday marks the first anniversary of House Republicans' defining moment this term: removing the speaker they'd spent 15 rounds of voting to install just nine months earlier. The decision to oust Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., wasn't something that makes for a great campaign ad -- not for GOP members trying to earn second terms. But there's not much on the books from the last two years that makes a great case for granting Republicans another shot at the majority next year.

And yet, that's exactly what House Republicans are doing right now, taking a break from the hard work of failure to spend the next few weeks campaigning. Irrespective of what an abject catastrophe the last two years have been, roughly two dozen swing-seat Republicans are trying to convince Americans that they deserve to be the majority in the 119th Congress, as well. It's a level of audacity that should be disqualifying, not rewarded with another two years of, at best, mediocrity and, at worst, enabling the end of democracy in a second Trump administration.

While McCarthy's undignified boot from the speakership was a lowlight, the House majority hasn't exactly spent the rest of the time covering itself in glory. With only a lame-duck session awaiting after the election and another spending fight along with it, no major legislative push is planned to take advantage of those final weeks. Accordingly, the 118th Congress will go down in history as having enacted the fewest laws in modern history.

The best thing you could say for the House the last two years is that it kept the lights on in Washington -- barely. There have been five shutdown threats in that time as Republicans spent more time arguing among themselves about spending levels than debating with Democrats in the Senate and President Joe Biden in the White House. That total includes the one that got McCarthy booted after agreeing to a short-term spending bill his right flank opposed. He was on thin ice already with it, though, thanks to his decision to avoid a default by agreeing to raise the debt ceiling in April 2023.

The outrage over protecting the full faith and credit of the United States was centered in a cluster of far-right MAGA members I've dubbed the ""chaos caucus."" Their maximalist posturing was a headache for both McCarthy and his successor as speaker, Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who both have tried to appease their capricious whims. As a result, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., was at times left struggling to pass even routine measures to clear the path for what were essentially messaging bills.

In fact, most of the credit for even the simplest tasks belongs to the minority Democrats, who were willing to swoop in and save the GOP from itself. One of the few major pieces of legislation to pass this term was a funding package providing aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. It was brought across the finishing line without a majority of the GOP caucus' support to even have the bills be debated. It also lacked the immigration bill that Republicans first insisted be included in any aid package, then it tanked at the urging of former President Donald Trump.

Even things that were nominally in Republicans' control failed to coalesce into anything substantive. Their promise to restore ""regular order"" and pass all of the 12 annual spending bills on time has once again hit a wall, without any real effort from Democrats to hinder them. Likewise, their efforts to find some sliver of pretense to impeach Biden ended with a sad fizzle, in the form of a lackluster report released after he'd ended his campaign. But, seemingly lacking anything better to do, the House Oversight Committee has pivoted to trying to find dirt on Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

This new fishing expedition against the Democratic ticket is taking place in a leaky boat with nothing but frayed lines and almost no bait to dangle. If something truly damaging does turn up as a result, it will be more due to coincidence than cunning on the part of Oversight Committee Chair Rep. James Comer, R-Ky. That said, the House did manage to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on bogus charges, but he remains in place. The same can't be said for former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., whom the House did manage to expel after considering the multiple crimes he committed in the process of running for his seat.

This is the absolute mess that Republicans slunk back to their districts to sell to voters when the House recessed last week. It's only thanks to partisan gerrymandering and the rightward drift of the GOP primaries that most of those who chose to run for re-election will find themselves back in Washington next year. Those few who represent swing districts are essentially on their own to figure out what messaging to offer old-fashioned voters who expect their members of Congress to show results.

Beyond their general lack of interest in governing, Republicans have good reason to feel comfortable in their audacity. As The New York Times recently noted, ""lawmakers benefit from the bar being very low: For years, the vast majority of voters have said they hold a dim view of Congress and think it is already broken, according to polls."" It stands to reason then that the GOP's core voters not only are OK with the current state of play but want members who continue to enact the same fumbling playbook. How fortunate for the House Republican caucus -- and how unfortunate for anyone hoping to see Congress get anything done next year."
"Trump, who has insulted Jewish voters who don't support him, to attend Oct. 7 memorial event",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-october-7-memorial-event-golf-club-rcna173678,2024-10-02T21:46:48Z,"The Republican presidential nominee intends to speak at the event, which is scheduled to be held at the Trump National Doral Miami, one of his golf courses. (It's unclear if the Trump campaign is also organizing the event; the campaign did not respond immediately to a request for comment.)

""President Trump has always condemned antisemitism and will continue to do so once he is back in the Oval Office,"" his campaign said in a statement. ""He will hold accountable those who perpetuate violence against the Jewish people, and as such, America will be safe and patriotic again.""

Trump has long claimed to be the most pro-Israel U.S. president in history. He has accused the Biden administration of not being supportive enough of Israel, even as the White House has provided unconditional military and financial support to its ally despite the soaring death toll in Gaza. (Trump's anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian beliefs are also well documented.)

Yet Trump himself also has a history of invoking antisemitic tropes and has rubbed shoulders with white nationalists and Holocaust deniers. He singled out Jewish Democratic lawmakers, like Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, for attacks. In a radio interview in July, Trump claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris ""doesn't like Jewish people"" and appeared to agree when the host called Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, a ""crappy Jew.""

Trump has also repeatedly denigrated Jewish Democrats in remarks about the election, even at events focused on combating antisemitism. He said that any Jewish person who votes for a Democrat ""hates their religion"" and that ""they should be ashamed of themselves."" He claimed that Jewish and Black people vote for Democrats out of ""habit"" and said that if he loses the 2024 election, Jewish voters ""would have a lot to do"" with it -- a line that drew outrage from Jewish groups."
Trump downplays importance of troops with brain injuries (again),MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-downplays-importance-troops-brain-injuries-rcna173596,2024-10-02T15:16:18Z,"After an Iranian missile attack injured U.S. troops in 2020, Trump downplayed their brain injuries as ""headaches."" Nearly four years later, he did it again.

Tensions in the Middle East reached a new level when Iran targeted Israel with a ballistic missile attack. Asked about the developments, Donald Trump thought largely about himself.

The former president not only claimed that the violence ""would have never happened"" were he still in office -- a baseless assertion, to be sure -- the Republican added there were no similar events during his White House term.

That, of course, was problematic in important ways. After all, many of us still remember the fact that Iran was responsible for a January 2020 missile attack that targeted U.S. forces stationed in Iraq. It was in response to a drone attack that killed Iranian general Quasem Soleimani.

The attack injured several dozen American servicemembers, many of whom were diagnosed with traumatic brain injuries. The Pentagon ultimately approved Purple Hearts for 39 U.S. soldiers wounded in the attack.

Trump, the then-president, dismissed the importance of the injuries to his own country's troops -- he called them little more than ""headaches"" -- prompting the Veterans of Foreign Wars to ask the Republican to apologize for minimizing the service members' injuries. Trump ignored the request.

Nearly four years later, he did it again. The Washington Post reported:

As difficult as this was to believe, five weeks before Election Day, the Republican Party's presidential nominee downplayed the importance of American troops who had traumatic brain injuries in response to an Iranian missile attack. Trump did this out loud, on camera, on purpose, and on the record.

""So, first of all, 'injured.' What does 'injured' mean?"" the GOP candidate asked rhetorically. ""Injured means -- you mean because they had a headache? Because the bombs never hit the fort. So just so you understand, there was nobody ever tougher on Iraq."" (Yes, he confused Iran and Iraq.)

The first time Trump made comments like these, the VFW called the ""headache"" comments ""misguided."" Nearly four years later, they have not improved with age.

But making matters worse is the larger context. It was, after all, just six weeks ago when the former president, hoping to impress a party megadonor, downplayed the significance of the Medal of Honor -- comments the Veterans of Foreign Wars described as ""asinine"" -- before sparking a related controversy with a political appearance at Arlington National Cemetery.

As regular readers know, Trump has also reportedly denigrated those who serve in the military and condemned fallen American heroes as ""suckers."" (He denies doing so.) Trump has also complained bitterly about American military leaders, reportedly disparaged wounded veterans, blamed military leaders for failed missions he approved, feuded with Gold Star families, and famously declared in reference to American prisoners of war, ""I like people that weren't captured, okay?""

What's more, as a candidate, Trump liked to say he ""felt"" like he had served in the military because his parents sent him to a military-themed boarding school as a teenager. He went so far as to boast that his expensive prep school gave him ""more training militarily than a lot of the guys that go into the military,"" which was a precursor to Trump pointing to bone spurs as part of an apparent effort to dodge the draft.

It was implausible that the Republican candidate could make matters worse -- right up until he expressed indifference to troops with traumatic brain injuries."

Opinion | Iran's president just called for diplomacy. Then he launched missiles at Israel.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/iran-missile-attack-israel-iron-dome-mehsoud-pezeshkian-rcna173548,2024-10-02T00:44:16Z,"This is no longer a proxy conflict where Israel and Iran can plausibly hide behind the language of diplomacy.

Barely one week after calling for diplomacy at the United Nations General Assembly, Iran's new president, Masoud Pezeshkian, launched his own October surprise -- about 180 missiles aimed at Israel. Iran can now claim it has responded forcefully to what it sees as Israel's incursions on its turf.

It's no surprise that Iran responded to Israel assassinating a Hezbollah leader in Lebanon last week. The surprise is that the response came, not from proxies, but with a state-on-state attack targeting Israeli civilians. Tuesday marks the second state-on-state attack Iran has launched this year, both aimed at Israel and both predictably blocked by the American-funded Iron Dome defense system. The Israeli military said it was not aware of any casualties in this strike. In the before times, after Iran conducted a dramatic, terrifying, but less impactful face-saving operation, both sides would retreat to their corners. But, for reasons explained below, today's actions are unlikely to be an end. To the contrary, we're likely to see Israel and Iran continue to raise the stakes further, dragging their allies into deeper conflict.

Iran has been embarrassed twice now by Israeli leadership: the targeted assassination of a Hamas leader inside Iran this summer and the current ground invasion of turf run by Hezbollah in Lebanon. These actions, which Netanyahu's government argues are meant to de-escalate further war by eliminating Iranian-backed militants for good, are a strike at the heart of Iran's power in the region. Indeed, the Israeli prime minister has underscored that his statement at the U.N. that ""there is no place in Iran the long arm of Israel cannot reach"" was not a rhetorical flourish, but a promise he means to keep.

At the same time, despite new leadership in Iran, there remains the long-standing need to appear strong in the Middle East and also on the world stage. Masoud Pezeshkian is a cardiac surgeon who in July beat out hard-liners and who told the world at last week's United Nations General Assembly, ""We're willing to have peace. We do not want to fight. We do not want war. In what other language do we need to express this to everyone?"" But even he must give way to the Revolutionary Guard in the wake of the decimation of Iran's ""forward defense system"" in recent weeks, that is, the armed militias operating near Israel's borders in Syria and elsewhere.

This is no longer a proxy conflict where Israel and Iran can plausibly hide behind the language of diplomacy to claim a degree of remove from military action and violence. In fact, Israel's ground invasion of Lebanon on Monday intended to eliminate the threat of Hezbollah and Iran, but it has also united the Israeli factions that have disagreed with one another about the treatment of Gazans. The United States has already followed through on its promised defense of Israel and moved warplanes and troops into position in the Arabian Sea. With Iran and Israel's leader both promising ""consequences"" and ""crushing attacks"" after each incident, this is no longer a game of chicken. It's a race toward disaster."
Ayman Mohyeldin: We're inching closer to a full-scale Middle East war. Can the U.S. stop it?,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/lebanon-strikes-hezbollah-israel-hamas-middle-east-war-rcna173317,2024-10-01T21:46:19Z,"Tensions are rising in the Middle East following the assassination of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah in an Israeli airstrike on Friday. After days of anticipation of a possible Iranian response to Nasrallah's killing, Iran fired ballistic missiles into Israel on Tuesday. No fatalities have been reported. Israel is expected to retaliate imminently.

Israel has also continued its strikes on southern Lebanon, where they claimed to have killed another senior Hezbollah figure. On Monday, Israel's military forces pressed forward with a ground incursion to conduct what the government described as ""limited, localized and targeted ground raids"" against Hezbollah.

According to Lebanon's prime minister, as many as 1 million residents have been displaced already, with many forced to sleep on the streets. The Lebanese government says Israel's two-week aerial campaign has now killed more than 1,000 people, including women and children. Hezbollah has launched retaliatory attacks across northern Israel, which were mostly intercepted.

Meanwhile, Americans in Lebanon are feeling confused and anxious amid the bombardment, with many scrambling to find a way out. On Sunday, White House national security spokesperson John Kirby told ABC News that the State Department does ""not feel a need"" to evacuate Americans from the country, instead suggesting those worried about their safety use ""commercial air traffic."" This comes as Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin ordered U.S. forces to remain on standby as tensions flare up. And on Monday, NBC News reported that ""the Pentagon said it was sending a 'few thousand' additional troops to bolster the roughly 40,000 American forces in the area.""

With the threat of a full-scale regional war seemingly rising by the hour, many are now asking how we got here. For nearly a year, U.S. officials have urged actors in the region to lower the temperature and prevent the conflict from escalating. But those warnings apparently fell on deaf ears.

U.S. officials are growing increasingly concerned as strikes ramp up in Lebanon. Just two days before Nasrallah was killed, a handful of Western nations led by the U.S. put forward a 21-day cease-fire plan, expecting Israel to accept it. In fact, Kirby told reporters the cease-fire plan was published after consulting with Israel and that the Israelis ""were aware of every word"" in the statement. Kirby said he thought the Israelis were ""on board"" with the proposal and said the allies would not have made it public otherwise.

Despite that, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu reportedly rejected the deal on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in New York last week. The massive strike that killed Nasrallah went down just hours later.

Now, the fact that Israel agreed to a cease-fire deal in bad faith should surprise absolutely no one, especially U.S. officials, who have been strung along for months. The truth is, the situation playing out right now in the Middle East is being orchestrated entirely on the terms of one person and one person alone: Netanyahu.

As NBC News has reported:

In the absence of an arms embargo, America's leverage over Israel has been whittled down to nothing. By sacrificing its seat at the table, the U.S. has ensured that those deciding the next steps in this conflict are Netanyahu and the leaders of Iran, Hamas and Hezbollah -- not the American president."

Man charged with terroristic threats after saying he would 'shoot up' a synagogue,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/minneapolis-synagogue-shooting-threat-408c137395bc0a9e5a99c0403627b111,2024-10-08T23:27:58Z,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A Minnesota man was charged with making terroristic threats for allegedly saying he would ""shoot up"" a Minneapolis synagogue.

The 21 year old was charged Monday with misdemeanor assault and three felony counts of threatening violence. His public defender didn't immediately return an Associated Press email and voice message requesting comment Tuesday.

Temple Israel and police said they do not believe he was motivated by antisemitism. Minneapolis police said synagogue security knew the man, who lived at a nearby center for homeless teens and young adults.

Security told police that the man tossed an empty beer bottle in the synagogue's parking lot in September. When security confronted him, he allegedly tossed the bottle at the guard, who then used pepper spray on him.

Later that day, police said the man used a phone app to mask his voice as he made repeated calls threatening the synagogue, prompting a lockdown. He allegedly referenced the pepper-spray incident.

A special police detail was later assigned to provide extra security ahead of the Jewish new year and the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel.

An officer from that detail was notified of a man outside with a firearm Thursday. He fled the area, but officers arrested the 21 year old man the next day.

Officers did not recover a gun.

Police said the man told them he ""has no issue with the Jewish community or faith but does with the security guards,"" according to a probable cause statement."
"US scrambled to urge Putin not to use nuclear weapons in Ukraine, Woodward book says",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-war-putin-biden-nuclear-weapons-90cb3bb3499a5e211095b3f93173a575,2024-10-08T20:33:08Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Months into Russia's war in Ukraine, the United States had intelligence pointing to ""highly sensitive, credible conversations inside the Kremlin"" that President Vladimir Putin was seriously considering using nuclear weapons to avoid major battlefield losses, journalist Bob Woodward reported in his new book, ""War.""

The U.S. intelligence pointed to a 50% chance that Putin would use tactical nukes if Ukrainian forces surrounded 30,000 Russian troops in the southern city of Kherson, the book says. Just months before, in the far northeast, Ukrainian troops had stunned the Russians by recapturing Kharkiv, Ukraine's second-largest city, and were pivoting to liberate Kherson, strategically located on the Dnieper River not far from the Black Sea.

National security adviser Jake Sullivan stared ""with dread"" at the intelligence assessment -- described as coming from the best sources and methods -- in late September 2022, seven months after Russia's invasion, the book says. It caused alarm across the Biden administration, moving the chance of Russia using nukes up from 5% to 10% to now 50%.

According to Woodward's account, President Joe Biden told Sullivan to ""get on the line with the Russians. Tell them what we will do in response.""

He said to use language that was threatening but not too strong, the book says. Biden also reached out to Putin directly in a message, warning of the ""catastrophic consequences"" if Russia used nuclear weapons.

The famed Watergate reporter's latest book also details Donald Trump's conversations with Putin since leaving office, Biden's frustrations with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and more. The Associated Press obtained an early copy of Woodward's book, which is due out next week.

The book provides intriguing inside details about the U.S. assessment of the possibility of Putin deploying nukes, but the Biden administration's concerns that Russia might use tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine were not secret. From the president on down, numerous officials warned Putin against it.

Putin and other Kremlin voices also have frequently threatened the West with Russia's nuclear arsenal. In a strong, new warning to the West late last month, Putin said any nation's conventional attack on Russia that is supported by a nuclear power will be considered a joint attack on his country.

The threat was aimed at discouraging the West from allowing Ukraine to strike deep into Russia with longer-range weapons and appears to significantly lower the threshold for the possible use of Russia's nuclear arsenal. Biden has held off on allowing Ukraine to hit military targets deeper inside Russia with U.S.-provided missiles over fears of escalating the war, even as Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy pleads for permission.

In another heated conversation laid out in Woodward's book, Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin confronted his Russian counterpart, Sergei Shoigu, in October 2022.

""We know you are contemplating the use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine,"" Austin said, according to Woodward. ""Any use of nuclear weapons on any scale against anybody would be seen by the United States and the world as a world-changing event. There is no scale of nuclear weapons that we could overlook or that the world could overlook.""

As Shoigu listened, Austin pressed on, noting that the U.S. had not given Ukraine certain weapons and had restricted the use of some of those it had provided. He warned that those constraints would be reconsidered. He also noted that China, India, Turkey and Israel would isolate Russia if it used nuclear weapons.

""I don't take kindly to being threatened,"" Shoigu responded, the book says.

""Mr. Minister,"" Austin said. ""I am the leader of the most powerful military in the history of the world. I don't make threats.""

The Pentagon noted a call between Austin and Shoigu on Oct. 21, 2022. During the call, Austin ""emphasized the importance of maintaining lines of communication amid the ongoing war against Ukraine,"" according to a readout provided at the time.

U.S. intelligence officials saw China as having the most influence over Russia, and Biden called Chinese President Xi Jinping about the need for deterrence, Woodward wrote.

Xi agreed to warn Putin, according to the book. Biden and Xi met and agreed in November 2022 that ""a nuclear war should never be fought"" and noted their opposition to the use or threat to deploy nuclear weapons in Ukraine, a White House statement said at the time.

In terms of the war starting at all, the book details Biden's criticism late last year of President Barack Obama's handling of Russia seizing Crimea and a section of the Donbas in 2014, at a time when Biden was serving as the Democrat's vice president.

""They f----- up in 2014,"" Woodward wrote that Biden said to a close friend in December, blaming the lack of action for Putin's aggression in Ukraine. ""Barack never took Putin seriously.""

Biden was angry while speaking to the friend and said they ""never should have let Putin just walk in there"" in 2014 and that the U.S. ""did nothing.""

White House spokeswoman Emilie Simons told reporters that ""there are plenty of books that are being written about this administration and others"" and that ""we're not going to comment on each anecdote that may come out of different reporting."""
"As Israel plots to strike Iran, its choices range from symbolic to severe",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-iran-nuclear-hezbollah-hamas-missile-retaliation-0184e79d4ee5ec012960e0b24ddae102,2024-10-08T19:54:06Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel has promised to retaliate for Iran's massive missile attack last week. How it does so involves great risk, and could have major repercussions for the archenemies, the Middle East and the world.

Israel's options range from symbolic strikes on military targets to crippling attacks on Iran's vital oil industry or its secretive and heavily fortified nuclear program.

The intensity and timing of any retaliatory strike was expected to top the agenda of a planned meeting this week at the Pentagon between Israel's defense minister and his U.S. counterpart. But late Tuesday, the Pentagon said the meeting was abruptly postponed.

In a sign of possible disagreement over the right approach, President Joe Biden has already urged Israel not to hit Iran's nuclear program and discouraged it from hitting the oil industry.

The Associated Press spoke to two former Israeli prime ministers and other experts to explore Israel's options. There is broad consensus that Israel must strike back, but deep disagreement over the best way to do so.

""The question is not whether Israel will retaliate or respond,"" former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert told AP. ""The question is which way.""

Israel and Iran have been involved in a bitter shadow war for years -- primarily through Israel's battles against Iranian-backed militant groups across the region. Israel also has been suspected of killing Iranian nuclear scientists and carrying out attacks on Iranian nuclear facilities, but it rarely acknowledges involvement.

Direct clashes have been rare. But things changed after Hamas attacked Israel from the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7, 2023, and Hezbollah began firing rockets at Israel the following day. Both groups receive support from Iran.

In April, Iran fired over 300 drones and missiles toward Israel after accusing it of killing two Iranian generals in a diplomatic compound in Syria. Nearly all of the missiles malfunctioned or were intercepted, and Israel responded with a limited strike that signaled it did not want any further escalation.

After last week's Iranian attack, Israel signaled its next response would be different.

Iran said the barrage of at least 180 ballistic missiles was to avenge a series of Israeli strikes against its close allies, Hamas and Hezbollah, including the assassination of the group's longtime leader. Although the missiles caused little damage or casualties, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had made a ""big mistake and it will pay for it."" Members of his hard-line coalition have called for a harsh response.

Israel has a broad range of choices of targets - from Iranian government buildings and military bases to sensitive oil installations to heavily fortified nuclear facilities hidden deep below ground. Israel accuses Iran of developing nuclear weapons -- a charge Iran denies.

Striking anywhere in Iran is a logistical challenge for Israel. Warplanes would need to fly over 1,500 kilometers (about 1,000 miles) to their target, requiring a complicated midair refueling operation, potentially over hostile skies. Any strike would also mean confronting Iran's Russian-made air-defense systems.

""Remember that Iran is 1,500, 1,600 kilometers (about 1,000 miles) away from Israel, and you have countries in between -- Jordan, Iraq, Saudi Arabia. Some are friends. Some are foes,"" said Yoel Guzansky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv and a former adviser on Iranian affairs on Israel's National Security Council.

""You don't want to embarrass your friends. You don't want to get hostile fire from other countries,"" he said.

Olmert, who served as prime minister from 2006 to 2009, said Israel is more than capable of coping with these challenges.

""We have the capabilities,"" he said. ""I'm not certain it would be wise and responsible to expose them.""

Even if Israel has the means, there are diplomatic considerations. A strike on the oil sector, Iran's economic backbone, or on the nuclear program would almost certainly guarantee an Iranian response and raise the risk of further escalation.

Such strikes could rattle global oil markets and shake the U.S. economy on the eve of a presidential election. They also could risk Iranian retaliation not only against Israel, but against American troops stationed in the region or Gulf Arab countries aligned with the West.

""Unlike Lebanon and Gaza, every Israeli attack on Iran has international and global repercussions,"" said Menahem Merhavy, an Iran expert at Hebrew University in Jerusalem.

Former leaders are divided on what path Israel should choose.

Olmert said a strike on multiple military targets, spread across Iran's vast territory, would be more than enough to send a message. The goal, he said, is to show that Israel can strike anywhere and anytime.

""That's precisely what deterrence is all about,"" he said.

Olmert said hitting Iran's oil sector would be an unnecessary escalation that invites a response, and that striking the nuclear program is not worth the risk. Not only would it trigger Iranian retaliation, but the odds of success are uncertain, he said.

""Trying to attack the nuclear program will be a mistake,"" he said.

Another former prime minister, Yair Lapid, believes Israel should strike Iran's oil industry infrastructure.

""That is the most painful target for the Iranian regime,"" Lapid, who served as premier in 2022, said in a written response to a question from The Associated Press.

""Iran's ballistic missile attack against Israel must be met with a forceful response,"" he said, adding that Iran must understand ""there is a high cost to its regional aggression.""

In an interview with the Israeli news site Ynet, Lapid said a strike on Iran's nuclear facilities should only be done as part of an international coalition in coordination with the United States.

Lapid's predecessor as prime minister and former governing partner, Naftali Bennett, takes an even tougher line, saying now is the time for Israel to bomb the Iranian nuclear project.

Bennett said in a video posted on social media Tuesday that Iran and its allies have been weakened, and that Israel has a rare chance to deliver a decisive blow to Iran's leadership, economy and nuclear program.

""We must not settle for Iranian military bases or noisy-yet-meaningless actions that are meant only to deliver a message,"" Bennett said. ""The time for messages is over.""

Olmert, however, said he hopes cooler heads will prevail.

""What do we want to achieve and how far do we want to go and how arrogant do we want to be?"" he said. His advice: ""Try to be smart."""
When is an interview too tough? CBS News grappling with question after Dokoupil interview,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/cbs-news-dokoupil-israel-coates-interview-tone-01035b94b1a824c1589555def1a52c6b,2024-10-08T19:43:47Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Television morning show interviews often don't stray beyond dinner recipes or celebrity hijinks. Yet a week after it took place, CBS News host Tony Dokoupil's pointed interview with author Ta-Nehisi Coates about Israel remains the subject of heated conversations at the network and beyond.

CBS management took the unusual step of scolding Dokoupil before his colleagues for not living up to network standards, in a private meeting Monday that quickly became public, and ""CBS Mornings"" staff continued to discuss it on Tuesday.

The seven-minute interview on Sept. 30 was about Coates' new book of essays, and Dokoupil zeroed in right away on a section about Israel and Palestinians in the West Bank in an exchange the Washington Post last week called ""unusually tense and substantive.""

For all of Coates' honors as a writer, Dokoupil said that the essay ""would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist."" He wondered why Coates' writing did not include references to Israel being surrounded by enemies that want to eliminate the country.

""Is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?"" he asked.

Coates said there was no shortage of places where Israel's viewpoint is represented, and that he wanted to speak for those who don't have a voice.

""I wrote a 260-page book,"" Coates said. ""It is not a treatise on the entirety of the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.""

Dokoupil later asked Coates about what offended him about the existence of a Jewish state, and he said that Palestinians ""exist in your narrative merely as victims of Israel,"" as if they had not been offered peace in any juncture.

Coates said that he was offended when anyone -- including the Palestinians who talked to him for his book -- are treated as second-class citizens in the country where they live, comparing it to the Jim Crow-era United States where his ancestors grew up.

In the staff call on Monday, CBS News chief Wendy McMahon and her deputy, Adrienne Roark, said several journalists in the company had reached out to them about the interview.

""There are times we have not met our editorial standards,"" Roark said, citing Dokoupil's interviews and other comments made by CBS personnel that she did not identify.

CBS News is built on a ""foundation of neutrality,"" she said. ""Our job is to serve our audience without bias or perceived bias.""

She said that the problems had been addressed, but neither she nor CBS explained what this meant.

McMahon told staff members on the call that she expected its contents would remain confidential. But a tape of it was posted within hours on The Free Press news site.

Dokoupil did not immediately return messages seeking comment. A spokesman for Coates did not return a message.

Dokoupil is one of three ""CBS Mornings"" hosts, along with Gayle King and Nate Burleson. All three participated in the interview with Coates, but with the exception of an opening question by Burleson and a brief one at the end by King, it was dominated by Dokoupil.

Dokoupil is married to NBC News journalist Katy Tur. He has two children from a previous marriage who both live with their mother in Israel. In the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack, Dokoupil said on the show that, ""as a father, I think people can understand if somebody, anybody, is firing rockets in the direction of your children without regard to whether they are struck or not, you're going to feel a thing or two.""

The rebuke by CBS management Monday came on the first anniversary of the Hamas attack.

Management received immediate pushback on the call from Jan Crawford, CBS News' chief legal correspondent, who said that it's a journalist's obligation to ask tough questions when somebody comes on the air to present a one-sided view.

""I don't see how we can say that failed to meet our editorial standards,"" Crawford said. She said she worried that it would make her think twice when conducting interviews.

"Rusia e Irán están detrás del aumento de complots en Reino Unido, dice jefe del MI5",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-27824cebad99a0d7a83b1d2cbc33cd1c,2024-10-08T16:43:39Z,"LONDRES (AP) -- Reino Unido enfrenta un ""sorprendente aumento"" de intentos de asesinato, sabotaje y otros delitos en territorio británico realizados por Rusia e Irán, ya que ambos estados reclutan criminales para ""hacerles el trabajo sucio"" dijo el martes el director de la agencia nacional de inteligencia británica.

El director del MI5, general Ken McCallum, dijo que sus agentes y la policía han enfrentado 20 planes ""potencialmente letales"" respaldados por Irán desde 2022, y advirtió que ese país podría ampliar sus objetivos en el Reino Unido si se profundizan los conflictos en Oriente Medio.

El jefe de espionaje dijo que si la crisis aumenta e Israel lanza un ataque a gran escala en respuesta a la andanada de misiles lanzados por Irán, existe el riesgo ""de un incremento, o ampliación, de la agresión del Estado iraní en el Reino Unido"".

En un iusual discurso público para hablar de las principales amenazas al Reino Unido por parte de estados y grupos de milicianos, McCallum afirmó que Estados hostiles, individuos radicalizados y un revivido grupo Estado Islámico se han combinado para crear ""el entorno de amenazas más complejo e interconectado que yo haya visto"".

McCallum dijo que también existe el riesgo de que los conflictos de Israel con los grupos armados respaldados por Irán -- Hamás en Gaza, Hezbollah en Líbano y los hutíes en Yemen -- puedan provocar ataques en el Reino Unido, aunque hasta ahora, la crisis no se ha traducido ""a gran escala en violencia terrorista"", en ese país.

El número de investigaciones de amenazas para el Estado emprendidas por el MI5 aumentó 48% en el último año, siendo Irán, Rusia y China los principales perpetradores, dijo McCallum a periodistas en el centro de comando antiterrorista del Reino Unido, en Londres.

McCallum señaló que, desde la muerte de Mahsa Amini, una mujer que falleció tras ser arrestada por la policía iraní en septiembre de 2022 por presuntamente violar la ley del uso obligatorio del velo islámico en ese país, ""hemos visto un plan tras otro en el Reino Unido, con un ritmo y una escala sin precedentes""."
The Latest: Harris continues media blitz with 3 more national interviews,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-831fd5c5a53476639c664234b1dafe3b,2024-10-08T15:27:46Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris is continuing her media tour Tuesday with three more interviews for national audiences, with Election Day now just four weeks away.

The Democratic presidential nominee was scheduled to appear in New York with the women of ""The View,"" speak with radio host Howard Stern, and tape a show with late-night comedian Stephen Colbert. The trio of appearances comes after Harris granted interviews to CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" which aired Monday night, and Anderson's Cooper's podcast, which was released Sunday.

The blitz comes after Harris has largely avoided interviews since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. Long past the midway point of her unexpected presidential campaign and with voting already underway, Harris is still introducing herself to Americans who will determine her fate in this year's presidential election.

Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Vice President Kamala Harris, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

About 7 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, with few differences between Black men and women voters on how they view the Democratic candidate.

Black voters' opinions of former President Donald Trump, by contrast, were overwhelmingly negative, underscoring the challenges he faces as he seeks to erode Harris' support among Black men.

But the poll also found that despite this dramatic gap in views, many Black voters don't see Harris as a candidate who will set the country on a better trajectory or make a substantial difference in their own lives.

Jill Biden will return to the campaign trail this week on a tour of battleground states to help boost Vice President Kamala Harris.

Harris' campaign and the White House announced Tuesday that the first lady will depart Friday on a five-day, five-state swing with stops in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

The appearances will mark the first lady's return to campaigning. She had campaigned extensively for her husband, President Joe Biden, when he was running for reelection. But she pulled back after Biden folded his campaign and endorsed Harris to replace him on the Democratic ticket.

With four weeks to go until Election Day, Harris' campaign said the first lady will be urging people to get out and vote. The campaign noted that early voting is set to start Wednesday in Arizona and that mail ballots are going out in the five states that Jill Biden will be visiting.

President Joe Biden is campaigning through two key swing states, but two Democratic senators locked in competitive reelection battles are taking markedly different approaches to the the outgoing president.

Biden will be fully embraced by Democratic Sen. Bob Casey when he participates in a private campaign fundraiser in suburban Philadelphia for the senior Pennsylvania senator.

But in Milwaukee, where Biden is spotlighting his administration's efforts to replace the nation's toxic lead pipes, incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin will be conspicuously absent.

Biden has spent scant time on the campaign trail since ending his reelection effort in July. That makes his stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- two tightly contested states that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump see as crucial -- all the more notable.

But as Biden makes a quick swing through the key states, two Democratic senators locked in competitive reelection battles are taking markedly different approaches to the outgoing president, whose approval ratings in a significant swath of the country remain in the pits.

Casey's and Baldwin's races are also seen as must-wins for Democrats who are trying to maintain their razor-tight control of the Senate.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is speaking at Trump International Doral in Miami, headlining a memorial service for the attack on Oct. 7, 2023, against Israel, telling his audience the threat of Hurricane Milton wouldn't have kept him away.

""I think I'm the only person who flew into Florida today,"" Trump said at the outset of his remarks. ""I wouldn't have missed it, regardless.""

Milton, a Category 5 hurricane, could come ashore Wednesday in the Tampa Bay region.

Trump said he had never heard of a Category 5 hurricane hitting land. However, hurricanes Andrew and Michael in Florida were Category 5, the latter of which struck during his administration.

President Joe Biden has spoken with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to discuss preparations in Florida for the approaching Hurricane Milton and ongoing recovery efforts from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene.

The White House confirmed the president's call with the governor after Vice President Kamala Harris earlier on Monday accused DeSantis of ""playing political games"" and engaging in ""political gamesmanship"" over the federal response to Helene.

Biden, according to the White House, asked DeSantis ""to call him directly if there is anything that can be done to further support the response and recovery efforts.""

Harris' office suggested earlier that DeSantis was dodging Harris, saying she reached out to the governor last week but the two never spoke.

DeSantis said that he ""didn't know that she had called"" and ""they didn't call me.""

Biden also spoke on Monday with Tampa Mayor Jane Castor and received a detailed briefing from National Weather Service Director Ken Graham on the expected impact Milton will cause.

Graham stressed during the briefing that people in the storm's path should evacuate now while there's time to do so.

Vice President Kamala Harris says she owns a Glock pistol and that she has fired it at a shooting range.

""I've had it for quite some time,"" said Harris, during an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" aired on Monday evening.

Harris last month at a campaign event with Oprah Winfrey noted that she was a gun owner. She caused a stir when she told Winfrey, ""If somebody breaks into my house, they're getting shot.""

Harris has advocated for stricter gun safety laws, while also underscoring that she and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are gun owners.

Harris laughed when asked by ""60 Minutes"" journalist Bill Whitaker if she had ever shot her weapon."
Ataques israelíes están trastocando el equilibrio de poder en Oriente Medio,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-b4a473447c9923bc9d7e5db222346f7b,2024-10-08T14:36:27Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israel está atacando a milicias respaldadas por Irán en una franja de casi 3.200 kilómetros (2.000 millas) y ha amenazado al mismo Irán, una gestión que podría poner fin a dos décadas de ascendencia iraní en la región inadvertidamente provocada por la invasión estadounidense de Irak en el 2003.

En Washington, Tel Aviv, Jerusalén y en las capitales árabes, los opositores y partidarios de la ofensiva israelí están ofreciendo ideas encontradas sobre qué debería hacer Estados Unidos a medida que su aliado se anota éxitos tácticos contra Hezbollah en el Lïbano y contra los hutíes en Yemen, y avanza en su campaña por aplastar al grupo Hamás en la Franja de Gaza.

Israel debe recibir todo el apoyo que necesita de Estados Unidos hasta que el gobierno iraní ""caiga en el basural de la historia como lo han hecho tantas dictaduras del pasado"", estimó Richard Goldberg, asesor sénior de la Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, una institución de inclinación conservadora en Washington. Es una postura que comparten algunos políticos israelíes.

Yendo aun más lejos, Yoel Guzansky, ex integrante del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional israelí, se manifestó a favor de que Estados Unidos se suma a Israel en un ataque conjunto contra Irán. Ello ""le enviaría un mensaje bien claro a los iraníes: no se metan con nosotros"", dijo Guzansky.

Sin embargo, hay quienes apuntan a lecciones de la campaña norteamericana en Irak y el derrocamiento de Saddam Hussein, cuando el entonces presidente George W. Bush ignoró advertencias árabes de que el dictador iraquí era un contrapeso indispensable contra la influencia iraní. Advierten que Estados Unidos no debe depender en victorias militares sin considerar los riesgos, objetivos y planes para siguientes etapas, y sobre la posibilidad de consecuencias indeseadas.

Al final Israel ""podría terminar en una situación en que sólo se puede proteger mediante una guerra perpetua"", dice Vali Nasr, quien fue asesor a la administración de Barack Obama y quien es hoy profesor en la Escuela de Estudios Internacionales Avanzados Johns Hopkins (SAIS) y ha sido uno de los principales estudiosos del ascenso de la influencia iraní desde la invasión estadounidense de Irak.

En momentos en que el primer ministro israelí Benjamin Netanyahu le presta limitada atención a los llamados de mesura que le hace el gobierno estadounidense, Washington y sus aliados en el Medio Oriente ""están a merced de cuán lejos quiere Netanyahu llevar las cosas"", dice Nasr.

""Es como si no hemos aprendido las lecciones del error de ese experimento ... en Irak en el 2003, sobre la idea de reestructurar el orden político del Medio Oriente"", sostiene Randa Slim, profesora en SAIS e investigadora del Middle East Institute, una institución en Washington.

Los partidarios de Israel están a favor de debilitar a Irán y las milicias que controla, las cuales atacan a Estados Unidos, Israel y sus aliados, reprimen a la sociedad civil y se ponen del lado de Rusia y otros adversarios de Occidente.

Los opositores advierten que acciones militares sin resolver los agravios de los palestinos y otros grupos podrían dejar al Medio Oriente en un espiral de guerra, insurgencias, violencia y la represión de regímenes que tratan de controlar la situación.

Está además la posibilidad de que Irán desarrolle armas nucleares en un intento por asegurar su supervivencia. Antes de los ataques israelíes contra Hezbollah, los líderes iraníes habían mostrado interés en regresar a la mesa de negociaciones sobre su programa nuclear y en general, en mejorar relaciones con Occidente.

En apenas semanas, los ataques y operaciones encubiertas israelíes han devastado la conducción, las filas y los arsenales de Hezbollah -- milicia libanesa que se había erguido como una de las fuerzas más potentes del Medio Oriente y una herramienta de Irán para defenderse de ataques contra su territorio -- y han golpeado instalaciones petroleras de los hutíes yemeníes.

Un año de ataques aéreos israelíes en Gaza parecen haber reducido la cúpula del grupo proiraní Hamás a unos pocos sobrevivientes escondidos en túneles. Sin embargo, las fuerzas israelíes nuevamente se vieron enfrascadas en combates allí esta semana y Hamás logró disparar cohetes contra Tel Aviv en el aniversario de los ataques que ese grupo perpetró contra Israel el 7 de octubre, hecho que desencadenó la actual guerra.

La anticipada represalia israelí contra Irán podría acelerar el cambio en el equilibrio de poder regional, luego que Irán lanzó misiles balísticos contra Israel la semana pasada en respuesta a los asesinatos de líderes de Hezbollah y Hamás. Podría también aumentar el riesgo de una conflagración regional más amplia, algo que el presidente Joe Biden y muchos gobiernos anteriores han tratado de evitar desde hace décadas.

El aumento de los ataques israelíes desde fines del mes pasado ha frustrado los intentos de Estados Unidos, Egipto y Qatar por lograr un cese al fuego y una liberación de rehenes en Gaza. Líderes estadounidenses dicen que Israel no les avisó antes de atacar a los líderes del Hezbollah en el Líbano, pero han defendido los asaltos israelíes aunque perseveran en sus intentos por lograr una tregua.

La vicepresidenta y candidata presidencial demócrata Kamala Harris dijo en una entrevista el lunes con el programa ""60 Minutes"" de CBS que Estados Unidos está decidido a darle a Israel las armas que necesite para su defensa, pero que al mismo tiempo seguirá con sus esfuerzos por poner fin al conflicto.

""No vamos a dejar de ejercer presión sobre Israel y sobre otros en la región, incluyendo los líderes árabes"", manifestó Harris.

Los ataques israelíes, para algunos, asoman la tentadora posibilidad de debilitar la alianza antioccidental y antiisraelí entre Irán y grupos afines en el Líbano, Irak, Siria y Yemen, y gobiernos como el de Rusia y Corea del Norte.

Las alianzas militares iraníes - apodadas ""El eje de la resistencia"" - crecieron primero a nivel regional y luego a nivel global luego que la invasión estadounidense de Irak derrocó a Saddam, quien había librado una guerra de ocho años contra el ambicioso régimen teocrático iraní.

Los partidarios de la invasión estadounidense de Irak y del derrocamiento de Saddam acertaron en cuanto a que la democracia iraquí se afianzaría, pero las consecuencias indeseadas fueron aun mayores, como el surgimiento del ""Eje de la resistencia"" y de nuevos grupos extremistas, como el Estado Islámico.

""Un Irán envalentonado y expansionista parece ser el único ganador"" de la guerra del 2003, dice una evaluación del ejército norteamericano sobre las lecciones derivadas de ese conflicto.

""Hace dos décadas, ¿quién se hubiera imaginado que Irán le estaría dando armas a Rusia? La explicación está en el aumento de su influencia tras el derrocamiento de Saddam"", dijo Ihsan Alshimary, profesor de ciencias políticas de la Universidad de Bagdad.

Aun más que en el 2003, los líderes globales están ofreciendo pocos vaticinios de cómo terminarán los cambios que están generando las acciones militares israelíes, ya sea para Irán, Israel, el Medio Oriente en general y Estados Unidos.

Irán y sus aliados están siendo debilitados, dijo Goldberg, de la Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. Pero también está disminuyendo la influencia estadounidense, al ser arrastrada por Israel, sostuvo Nasr.

El conflicto podría terminar perjudicando a Israel si se estanca, por ejemplo, en una guerra terrestre en el Líbano, dijo Mehran Kamrava, profesor y experto en temas del Medio Oriente en la Universidad de Georgetown en Qatar.

Tras cuatro décadas de intensa animosidad entre Israel y los líderes iraníes, ""la guerra fría entre ellos se ha convertido una guerra caliente. Y ello está cambiando, y sin duda cambiará, el panorama estratégico en el Medio Oriente"", afirmó Kamrava.

""Estamos sin duda en el precipicio de un cambio"", dijo Kamrava, pero ""la dirección y la naturaleza de ese cambio es muy difícil de predecir en estos momentos"".

"Who is Naim Kassem, the acting leader of Hezbollah?",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/naim-kassem-hezbollah-hassan-nasrallah-90b79db6df55ff3cb77877a7c65790fd,2024-10-08T13:34:52Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Sheikh Naim Kassem has been the acting head of Hezbollah since its longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed as part of an Israeli offensive that has taken out many of the Lebanese militant group's senior officials.

Kassem made a defiant televised speech Tuesday, claiming that the group's military capabilities are intact and Israelis will only suffer further as fighting continues.

Like Nasrallah, Kassem is one of the founding members of the Shiite political party and armed group, but he is widely seen as lacking the former leader's charisma and oratory skills.

Still, the white-turbaned cleric with a gray beard has often been the public face of the group. After Nasrallah went underground out of fear of being assassinated by Israel, appearing only in televised speeches, Kassem continued to show up at rallies and ceremonies, and he has sat for interviews with foreign journalists.

Mohanad Hage Ali, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Middle East Center think tank who researches Hezbollah, said that Kassem is perceived by many as ""more extreme"" than Nasrallah, at least in his public statements.

In practice, however, his power within the group was limited under Nasrallah. Hashem Safieddine, a cousin of Nasrallah who oversees the group's political affairs -- not Kassem -- was generally regarded as the leader's heir apparent. But no announcement has been made, and Safieddine has not appeared publicly or made any public statements since Nasrallah's death.

Kassem has been sanctioned by the United States, which considers Hezbollah a terrorist group.

He was born in the town of Kfar Fila in southern Lebanon and studied chemistry at the Lebanese University before working for several years as a chemistry teacher.

At the same time, he pursued religious studies and participated in founding the Lebanese Union for Muslim Students, an organization that aimed to promote religious adherence among students.

In the 1970s, Kassem joined the Movement of the Dispossessed, a political organization founded by Imam Moussa Sadr that pushed for greater representation for Lebanon's historically overlooked and impoverished Shiite community. The group morphed into the Amal movement, one of the main armed groups in Lebanon's civil war, and now a powerful political party.

He then joined the nascent Hezbollah, formed with support from Iran after Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982 and occupied the country's southern region.

From 1991, he served as deputy secretary-general of the group, initially under Nasrallah's predecessor, Abbas Mousawi, who was killed by an Israeli helicopter attack in 1992."
MI5 spy chief says Russia and Iran are behind a 'staggering' rise in deadly plots,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/uk-intelligence-mi5-threats-russia-iran-936d7c24d303ffea41f6b1cef7c7b814,2024-10-08T12:46:14Z,"LONDON (AP) -- Britain is facing a ""staggering rise"" in assassination attempts on U.K. soil by Russia and Iran, as the hostile states recruit criminals to ""do their dirty work"" for them, the head of the U.K.'s domestic intelligence agency said Tuesday.

MI5 director Ken McCallum said his agents and police have tackled 20 Tehran-backed plots since 2022 and warned that Iran could expand its targets in the U.K. if Israel attacks in response to Iran's missile barrage. The spy chief said the widening conflicts in the Middle East raise the risk ""of an increase in - or broadening of - Iranian state aggression in the U.K.""

In a rare public speech setting out the major threats to the U.K. from both hostile states and terror groups, McCallum said there also is a risk that Israel's conflicts with Iran-backed militant groups -- Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen - could trigger terror attacks in the U.K.

The Middle East crisis has not translated ""at scale into terrorist violence"" in Britain, he said, but hostile states, individual attackers and a revived Islamic State group combine to create ""the most complex and interconnected threat environment we've ever seen.""

The number of state-threat investigations undertaken by MI5 has risen by 48% in the past year, with Iran, Russia and, China the main perpetrators, McCallum told journalists at the U.K.'s counterterrorism command center in London

McCallum said that since the death of Mahsa Amini, who died in Iranian police custody in September 2022 after being detained for allegedly violating the Islamic republic's mandatory headscarf law, ""we've seen plot after plot here in the U.K., at an unprecedented pace and scale.""

He said MI5 and the police have responded to 20 potentially lethal Iran-backed plots since January 2022, an increase of a third on the figure of 15 the government gave at the end of January.

McCallum said Russia's military intelligence agency was trying to use ""arson, sabotage and more"" to create ""mayhem"" on the streets of Britain and other European countries.

Both Russia and Iran often turn to criminals, ""from international drug traffickers to low-level crooks,"" to carry out attacks, he said,

The U.K.'s official terror threat level stands at ""substantial,"" the middle of a five-point scale, meaning an attack is likely, and since 2017 MI5 and the police have disrupted 43 late-stage terror plots.

While about three-quarters of terror plots stem from Islamic extremist ideology and a quarter from the extreme right, he said those labels ""don't fully reflect the dizzying range of beliefs and ideologies we see,"" drawn from a soup of ""online hatred, conspiracy theories and disinformation,"" McCallum said.

He also said there was worrying signs that the Islamic State group is back, despite the collapse of its self-declared caliphate in Iraq and Syria.

McCallum said that ""after a few years of being pinned well back, they've resumed efforts to export terrorism.""

""The first 20 years of my career here were crammed full of terrorist threats,"" McCallum said. ""We now face those alongside state-backed assassination and sabotage plots, against the backdrop of a major European land war."""

Ejército de Israel dice que mató a un alto mando de Hezbollah en un ataque en Beirut,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-615a6e7731f0d9f18baeba464b60b34d,2024-10-08T06:29:45Z,"JERUSALÉN (AP) -- El ejército de Israel dijo el martes que en la víspera mató a un alto comandante de Hezbollah en un ataque sobre Beirut, un día después de que el luto y las manifestaciones en todo el mundo marcaron el primer aniversario de los ataques del 7 de octubre.

Según el ejército, el ataque mató a Suhail Husseini, a quien presentó como responsable de supervisión logística, presupuestos y gestión del grupo político-paramilitar.

Hezbollah no realizó comentarios de inmediato.

Husseini estaría involucrado en la transferencia de armas avanzadas desde Irán y en su distribución a distintas unidades de Hezbollah, además de formar parte de su consejo militar, añadió el ejército.

En las últimas semanas, los ataques israelíes han eliminado al líder de Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, y a varios de sus principales comandantes. Israel lanzó la semana pasada lo que dice que es una incursión terrestre limitada en el sur de Líbano.

Hezbollah afirma que ya ha sustituido a los comandantes asesinados y se comprometió a seguir lanzando cohetes, misiles y drones contra Israel hasta que se alcance un alto el fuego en Gaza, donde su aliado Hamás lleva un año en guerra con Israel.

Insurgentes palestinos en la Franja dispararon el lunes una andanada de cohetes hacia Israel, subrayando su resistencia frente a la devastadora ofensiva rival sobre el sitiado enclave, que se ha cobrado la vida de alrededor de 42.000 palestinos, según las autoridades sanitarias locales, destruyó amplias zonas y desplazó a cerca del 90% de su población.

Hace un año, insurgentes encabezados por Hamás abrieron agujeros en la cerca fronteriza de seguridad y asaltaron bases del ejército y comunidades agrícolas, mataron a unas 1.200 personas, en su mayoría civiles, y tomaron a otras 250 como rehenes. Siguen teniendo cerca de 100 cautivos en Gaza, pero se cree que un tercio de ellos estarían muertos.

Israel está en guerra ahora con Hamás en Gaza y con Hezbollah en Líbano, que comenzó a disparar cohetes al norte de Israel el 8 de octubre. El Ministerio de Salud libanés dijo el lunes que un ataque israelí sobre el sur del país, que formó parte de un operativo más amplio, mató a al menos 10 bomberos."

The military said the strike killed Suhail Husseini, who it said was responsible for overseeing logistics, budget and management of the militant group.

Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday, underscoring militants' resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive in Gaza that has killed about 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials, destroyed large areas and displaced around 90% of its population.

A year ago, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023. On Monday, Lebanon's Health Ministry said an Israeli strike in the country's south, part of a wider bombardment, killed at least 10 firefighters. Hezbollah fired new barrages despite its recent losses.

Here is the latest:

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says it killed a senior Hezbollah commander in a strike on Beirut.

The military said Tuesday that it killed Suhail Husseini, who it said was responsible for overseeing logistics, budget and management of the militant group.

There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah.

The military said Husseini was involved in the transfer of advanced weapons from Iran and their distribution to different Hezbollah units, and that he was a member of the group's military council.

Israeli strikes have killed Hezbollah's overall leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several of his top commanders in recent weeks. Last week, Israel launched what it says is a limited ground incursion into southern Lebanon.

Hezbollah says it has already replaced its slain commanders. It has vowed to keep firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel until there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, where its ally Hamas has been at war with Israel for a year."
"Israel's strikes are shifting the power balance in the Middle East, with US support",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-middle-east-war-united-states-36d7c0bbc35964ed6ac9d21de17c632a,2024-10-08T04:13:11Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israeli military strikes are targeting Iran's armed allies across a nearly 2,000-mile stretch of the Middle East and threatening Iran itself. The efforts raise the possibility of an end to two decades of Iranian ascendancy in the region, to which the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq inadvertently gave rise.

In Washington, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and Arab capitals, opponents and supporters of Israel's offensive are offering clashing ideas about what the U.S. should do next, as its ally racks up tactical successes against Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen and presses its yearlong campaign to crush Hamas in Gaza.

Israel should get all the support it needs from the United States until Iran's government ""follows other dictatorships of the past into the dustbin of history,"" said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at Washington's conservative-leaning Foundation for the Defense of Democracies -- calls echoed by some Israeli political figures.

Going further, Yoel Guzansky, a former senior staffer at Israel's National Security Council, called for the Biden administration to join Israel in direct attacks in Iran. That would send ""the right message to the Iranians -- 'Don't mess with us,''' Guzansky said.

Critics, however, highlight lessons from the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and toppling of Saddam Hussein, when President George W. Bush ignored Arab warnings that the Iraqi dictator was the region's indispensable counterbalance to Iranian influence. They caution against racking up military victories without adequately considering the risks, end goals or plans for what comes next, and warn of unintended consequences.

Ultimately, Israel ""will be in a situation where it can only protect itself by perpetual war,"" said Vali Nasr, who was an adviser to the Obama administration. Now a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, or SAIS, he has been one of the leading documenters of the rise of Iranian regional influence since the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu giving limited weight to Biden administration calls for restraint, the United States and its partners in the Middle East are ""at the mercy of how far Bibi Netanyahu will push it,"" Nasr said, referring to the Israeli leader by his nickname.

""It's as if we hadn't learned the lessons, or the folly, of that experiment ... in Iraq in 2003 about reshaping the Middle East order,"" said Randa Slim, a fellow at SAIS and researcher at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

Advocates of Israel's campaign hope for the weakening of Iran and its armed proxies that attack the U.S., Israel and their partners, oppress civil society and increasingly are teaming up with Russia and other Western adversaries.

Opponents warn that military action without resolving the grievances of Palestinians and others risks endless and destabilizing cycles of war, insurgency and extremist violence, and Middle East governments growing more repressive to try to control the situation.

And there's the threat that Iran develops nuclear weapons to try to ensure its survival. Before the Israeli strikes on Hezbollah, Iranian leaders concerned about Israel's offensives had made clear that they were interested in returning to negotiations with the U.S. on their nuclear program and claimed interest in improved relations overall.

In just weeks, Israeli airstrikes and intelligence operations have devastated the leadership, ranks and arsenals of Lebanon-based Hezbollah -- which had been one of the Middle East's most powerful fighting forces and Iran's overseas bulwark against attacks on Iranian territory -- and hit oil infrastructure of Yemen's Iran-allied Houthis.

A year of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza appears to have reduced the leadership of Iranian-allied Hamas to a few survivors hiding in underground tunnels. However, Israeli forces again engaged in heavy fighting there this week, and Hamas was able to fire rockets at Tel Aviv in a surprising show of enduring strength on the Oct. 7 anniversary of the militant group's attack on Israel, which started the war.

Anticipated Israeli counterstrikes on Iran could accelerate regional shifts in power. The response would follow Iran launching ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for killings of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

It also could escalate the risk of all-out regional war that U.S. President Joe Biden -- and decades of previous administrations -- worked to avert.

The expansion of Israeli attacks since late last month has sidelined mediation by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar for a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. U.S. leaders say Israel did not warn them before striking Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon but have defended the surge in attacks, while still pressing for peace.

Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" aired Monday that the U.S. was dedicated to supplying Israel with the military aid needed to protect itself but would keep pushing to end the conflict.

""We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders,"" she said.

Israel's expanded strikes raise for many what is the tempting prospect of weakening Iran's anti-Western, anti-Israel alliance with like-minded armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen to governments in Russia and North Korea.

Called the ""Axis of Resistance,"" Iran's military alliances grew -- regionally, then globally -- after the U.S. invasion of Iraq removed Saddam, who had fought an eight-year war against Iran's ambitious clerical regime.

Advocates of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and overthrow of Saddam, said correctly that an Iraqi democracy would take hold.

But the unintended effects of the U.S. intervention were even bigger, including the rise of Iran's Axis of Resistance and new extremist groups, including the Islamic State.

""An emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor"" of the 2003 Iraq war, notes a U.S. Army review of lessons learned.

""Two decades ago, who could have seen a day when Iran was supporting Russia with arms? The reason is because of its increased influence"" after the U.S. overthrow of Saddam, said Ihsan Alshimary, professor of political science at Baghdad University.

Even more than in 2003, global leaders are offering little clear idea on how the shifts in power that Israel's military is putting in motion will end -- for Iran, Israel, the Middle East at large, and the United States.

Iran and its allies are being weakened, said Goldberg, at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. So is U.S. influence as it appears to be dragged along by Israel, Nasr said.

The conflict could end up hurting Israel if it bogs down in a ground war in Lebanon, for example, said Mehran Kamrava, a professor and Middle East expert at Georgetown University in Qatar.

After four decades of deep animosity between Israeli and Iranian leaders, ""the cold war between them has turned into a hot war. And this is significantly changing -- is bound to change -- the strategic landscape in the Middle East,"" he said.

""We are certainly at the precipice of change,"" Kamrava said. But ""the direction and nature of that change is very hard to predict at this stage.""

Michigan university president's home painted with anti-Israel messages,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/michigan-university-president-vandalism-8f523c277762107708c155faa3a443d6,2024-10-07T21:32:52Z,"WEST BLOOMFIELD, Mich. (AP) -- A suburban Detroit house owned by the University of Michigan president and the sidewalk were spray-painted Monday with the words ""intifada"" and ""coward"" on the first anniversary of the attack on Israel by Hamas.

West Bloomfield police didn't identify the owner, but the university acknowledged that the house belongs to Santa Ono. The house is separate from his official campus residence. ""Intifada"" is an Arabic term for the Palestinian uprising against Israel.

The home of Erik Lundberg, the university's chief investment officer, also was vandalized, The Detroit News reported.

Ono and the university's governing board have been criticized by pro-Palestinian activists for not taking steps to eliminate any investment linked to Israel. The university insists it has no direct investments and less than $15 million placed with funds that might include companies in Israel. That's less than 0.1% of the total endowment.

Mark Bernstein, a member of the Board of Regents, said the vandalism was ""yet another assaultive act of intimidation by the antisemitic mob.""

Protesters wearing masks pitched tents and placed fake bloody corpses outside the home of a regent last spring.

A pro-Palestinian camp on university grounds was cleared by police in May. Some people have been charged with trespassing or resisting police at the site."
A Michigan Senate candidate aims to achieve what no Republican has done in three decades,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/senate-michigan-rogers-slotkin-4d193fdb4043982c7d8b39354b07fb8f,2024-10-07T18:37:53Z,"ROCHESTER, Mich. (AP) -- As canvassers for U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers navigate the manicured lawns and gated communities of some of Detroit's wealthiest suburbs, they walk a fine line in their efforts to convince Republicans disillusioned with Donald Trump to back other GOP candidates next month.

Nowhere else in Michigan reflects the state's recent shift toward Democrats more than Oakland County just north of Detroit, home to the state's largest Republican base. Democrats have won decisively here in recent elections, and winning back voters in a county once dominated by traditional country club Republicans could be crucial to Rogers' chances to achieve what no Republican has done in more than three decades: win a U.S. Senate race in Michigan.

""We created a large, probably the best ground game, I would argue, in the country right now,"" Rogers said in a recent interview. ""And we are firing on all cylinders.""

With control of the Senate on the line, the race for Michigan's open seat could be pivotal. Democrats currently maintain a narrow margin in the Senate but are defending far more seats in this year's elections than Republicans.

Rogers and his Democratic opponent, Rep. Elissa Slotkin, are set to meet Tuesday for their first debate. Neither participated in debates during party primaries, making this event the first opportunity for voters to compare their dramatically different policy views.

Republicans have become increasingly confident that Rogers, who served in the U.S. House from 2001 to 2015, can flip a seat held for over two decades by Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who is retiring at the end of her fourth term. Standing in their way is Slotkin, long viewed as a rising star in the Democratic Party, with a fundraising advantage and an established track record in a competitive House district.

""Where I see Michigan as well as our races around the country is exactly as I would have predicted them last year,"" said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ""These are going to come down to very close races.""

Slotkin entered the Senate race shortly after Stabenow's retirement announcement, effectively clearing the Democratic primary field and building a campaign war chest that dwarfed her potential Republican opponents. She had raised $42 million through the end of September, according to her campaign.

With a big boost from national GOP fundraising groups, Rogers and the Republicans have been hustling to catch up. He entered the race over six months later and faced the challenge of navigating a state GOP divided by internal strife between grassroots activists fired up by Trump's brand of conservative populism and the party's old guard.

Rogers also had to contend with a crowded Republican primary field that included two other former congressmen. Trump's endorsement in March had a coalescing effect and made Rogers the clear frontrunner, prompting many of his rivals to drop out and allowing him to coast to the GOP nomination in August.

Whether Rogers can hold the fractious GOP coalition together could go a long way toward deciding the race.

By mid-July, Rogers had raised just over $5 million, the most recent figure reported by his campaign. While he has seen a recent influx of outside funding, including $22.5 million from Sen. Mitch McConnell's Senate Leadership Fund announced last week, it hasn't given him the same opportunity to define his candidacy as Slotkin. She was already airing ads in May to highlight her background.

Ultimately, the outcome of the Senate race could turn on how the presidential candidates perform in Michigan. Some Democrats, including Slotkin, have expressed concerns about Vice President Kamala Harris' standing in Michigan with less than a month to go in a state considered crucial to the presidential race.

Republicans think they see an opening in both contests.

""Michigan will be a state where our outcome in the Michigan Senate race will be probably very closely tied to President Trump's outcome in Michigan,"" Montana Sen. Steve Daines, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said during a press roundtable in Las Vegas. ""Trump's number and Mike Rogers' number will be very close.""

Rogers' team is working hard to close the gap. His campaign has 36 paid staffers statewide, leading volunteer groups that Rogers' campaign says have knocked on 50,000 doors a week.

Slotkin's campaign says her field operation is integrated into One Campaign, a coordinated effort involving Democratic candidates at all levels. That initiative includes 52 field offices and nearly 400 staff members across Michigan.

Oakland, the state's second-largest county, was once a Republican stronghold, but President Joe Biden won it by over 14 percentage points, largely due to a shift among suburban women in a state where reproductive rights have been on voters' minds since the U.S. Supreme Court turned those matters back to the states in 2022. Rogers' team is now focused on winning those voters back.

On a crisp October morning, his canvassers knocked on doors in the Oakland County suburb of Rochester, where lawn signs and other indicators of the fierce political battle unfolding there were rare. Although Rogers' campaign materials highlight Trump's endorsement, canvassers in neighborhoods like this typically mention the former president's name only if voters bring it up first.

""Mike just seems like a genuinely good guy and someone I'd want to represent Oakland,"" said Donnell Green, a longtime Rochester resident. After speaking with canvassers on Oct. 4, she added, ""I like that he works across the aisle.""

Green declined to share her views on Trump. However, in a region where noted anti-Trump Republican Sen. Mitt Romney grew up, Trump remains a polarizing figure, and many Republicans in the county continue to be turned off by his combative brand of politics.

Slotkin believes reproductive rights are still on voters' minds in Oakland County, where in 2022, a ballot proposal enshrining abortion rights passed by a 28-point margin, helping secure its statewide approval. She continues to campaign on the issue, warning that Republicans could push for a nationwide ban.

Rogers, however, calls it a nonissue after the 2022 vote and has said that he would not support a federal ban.

Slotkin currently represents a mid-Michigan district that was expected to be one of the most competitive and expensive races of the 2022 cycle. She won reelection by over five percentage points, using a strategy she has replicated in her Senate campaign. This approach, she says, involves ""going to places where maybe Democrats haven't shown up in 40 years.""

""I'm a Democrat that represents a Republican-leaning district,"" Slotkin told reporters last month in Grand Rapids. ""I wouldn't have won if I hadn't engaged all kinds of different voters.""

Slotkin could be most vulnerable in metro Detroit, where divisions within the Democratic Party over the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war are intensifying. The region has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the country, and frustration with Biden is spilling over to other Democratic candidates, including Slotkin, who is Jewish. She has remained a supporter of Israel, although she has been critical of the country's leader, Benjamin Netanyahu.

The growing discontent in metro Detroit could impact Slotkin's campaign.

""It is something that we have been spending a lot of time on and I think it's important for folks to know that our Democratic candidates, incumbents care deeply about listening to the Arab American community,"" said Peters.

Gaza está en ruinas tras un año de ofensiva israelí. La reconstrucción podría tomar décadas,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-domestic-news-b79a673b1fc3b067d91af0455a4ad182,2024-10-07T18:24:31Z,"Hay montañas de escombros donde antes había bloques de apartamentos y charcos de agua contaminada con aguas residuales que propagan enfermedades. Las calles de las ciudades se han convertido en cañones de tierra y, en muchos lugares, el aire está impregnado del hedor de cadáveres no recuperados.

La ofensiva israelí contra Hamás, una de las más mortíferas y destructivas en la historia reciente, ha matado a más de 41.000 personas, un poco más de la mitad de ellas mujeres y niños, según los funcionarios de salud locales. Sin un final a la vista para la guerra, y sin un plan para el día después, es imposible decir cuándo -- o hasta si -- algo será reconstruido.

Incluso después de que cesen los combates, cientos de miles de personas podrían quedar atrapadas y vivir en campamentos de tiendas de campaña durante años. Los expertos dicen que la reconstrucción podría tomar décadas.

""Esta guerra es destrucción y miseria. Haría que las piedras clamaran"", dijo Shifaa Hejjo, un ama de casa de 60 años, quien vive en una tienda de campaña instalada en el terreno donde antes estuvo su casa. ""Quienquiera que vea Gaza ... lo hará llorar"".

Israel culpa a Hamás por la destrucción. El ataque de ese grupo palestino contra Israel el 7 de octubredel año pasado -- en el que murieron unas 1.200 personas y unas 250 fueron tomadas como rehenes -- provocó la guerra. Israel dice que Hamás incrustó gran parte de su infraestructura militar, incluidos cientos de kilómetros (millas) de túneles, en áreas densamente pobladas donde se libraron algunas de las batallas más duras.

Los combates dejaron aproximadamente una cuarta parte de todas las estructuras en Gaza destruidas o gravemente dañadas, según una evaluación de la ONU en septiembre con base en videos satelitales. Dijo que alrededor del 66% de las estructuras, incluidas más de 227.000 unidades de vivienda, habían sufrido al menos algún daño.

Si hay un alto al fuego, alrededor de la mitad de las familias ""no tendrán a dónde regresar"", dijo Alison Ely, coordinadora en Gaza del Shelter Cluster, una coalición internacional de proveedores de ayuda liderada por el Consejo Noruego para los Refugiados.

Casi tantos edificios han sido destruidos o dañados en Gaza como en toda Ucrania después de sus primeros dos años de guerra con Rusia, según Corey Scher y Jamon Van Den Hoek, investigadores con sede en Estados Unidos que utilizan radares satelitales para documentar la devastación de las guerras.

Para poner eso en perspectiva: Gaza tiene menos de la mitad del tamaño de Kiev, la capital de Ucrania.

La cantidad de destrucción solo en el centro y sur de Gaza, dijo Scher, es aproximadamente equivalente a lo que se perdió en la ciudad de primera línea de Bajmut, escenario de una de las batallas más mortíferas en la guerra de Ucrania y donde las fuerzas rusas destruyeron casi todos los edificios a su paso para obligar a las tropas ucranianas a retirarse. La destrucción en el norte de Gaza es aún peor, agregó.

El sistema de agua y saneamiento de Gaza ha colapsado. Más del 80% de sus instalaciones sanitarias -- y un porcentaje mayor de sus carreteras -- están dañadas o destruidas.

""No puedo pensar en ningún paralelo, en términos de la severidad de los daños, para un enclave, un país o un pueblo"", manifestó Scher.

A finales de enero, el Banco Mundial estimó que los daños ascendían a 18.500 millones de dólares: casi la producción económica combinada de Cisjordania y Gaza en 2022. Eso fue antes de algunas operaciones terrestres israelíes intensamente destructivas, incluso en la ciudad sureña fronteriza de Rafah.

En enero, cuando las fuerzas terrestres israelíes avanzaron hacia la ciudad de Jan Yunis, en el sur, Shifaa Hejjo y su familia huyeron de su casa de cuatro pisos con solo la ropa que vestían.

Pasaron meses en varios campamentos de tiendas de campaña antes de que ella decidiera regresar. Y lo que vio la hizo llorar.

Todo su vecindario había sido destruido: su antigua casa y los caminos que conducían a ella estaban hundidos en un mar de escombros.

""No la reconocí"", dijo. ""No sabía dónde estaban las casas de la gente"".

Alrededor del 90% de los 2,3 millones de habitantes de Gaza han sido desplazados por la guerra, a menudo varias veces, según estimaciones de la ONU. Cientos de miles se han apiñado en campamentos de tiendas de campaña en expansión cerca de la costa sin electricidad, agua corriente ni baños. El hambre está extendida.

Hejjo vivió en una tienda de campaña en el patio de un hospital. Antes de eso, estuvo en Muwasi, el principal campamento de tiendas de campaña en el sur de Gaza.

""Olía mal"", reportó. ""Había enfermedades que se propagaban"".

Agregó que su esposo, quien sufría una enfermedad hepática, se sintió destrozado cuando escuchó que su casa había sido destruida y murió poco después.

Ella fue una de las primeras en regresar después de que las fuerzas israelíes se retiraran en abril. Sus vecinos se mantuvieron alejados, temerosos de encontrar cuerpos o bombas sin explotar.

Pero para ella, ese todavía era su hogar.

""Es mejor vivir en mi casa, donde viví durante 37 años, aunque esté destruida"", dijo.

Hejjo y sus hijos cavaron entre los escombros con palas y con las manos, ladrillo por ladrillo, para rescatar todo lo que se pudiera reutilizar. Usaron ropa rasgada para alimentar el fuego de la cocina.

Las ratas se habían colado y enjambres de mosquitos revoloteaban sobre las ruinas. Había vidrios rotos por todas partes. Montaron una tienda de campaña fortificada con láminas de metal corrugado y algunos ladrillos rescatados de su casa destruida. Una ligera llovizna mojó sus ropas mientras dormían.

Las agencias de la ONU dicen que el desempleo se ha disparado a alrededor del 80%, en comparación con casi el 50% antes de la guerra y que casi toda la población vive en la pobreza. Incluso a quienes tienen medios les resultaría casi imposible importar materiales de construcción debido a las restricciones israelíes, los combates en curso y el colapso de la ley y el orden.

El primer obstáculo para cualquier reconstrucción significativa son los escombros: montañas de ellos.

Donde antes había casas, tiendas y edificios de oficinas, ahora hay enormes montones de escombros con restos humanos, sustancias peligrosas y municiones sin explotar.

La ONU estima que la guerra ha dejado unas 40 millones de toneladas de escombros en Gaza, suficientes para llenar el Central Park de Nueva York a una profundidad de ocho metros (unos 25 pies). Podría tomar hasta 15 años y casi 650 millones de dólares limpiarlo todo, dijo.

También está la cuestión de dónde deshacerse de ellos: la ONU calcula que se necesitarían unos cinco kilómetros cuadrados (unas dos millas cuadradas) de terreno, que será difícil de conseguir en el territorio pequeño y densamente poblado.

No sólo se destruyeron viviendas, sino también infraestructura crítica.

La ONU estima que casi el 70% de las plantas de agua y saneamiento de Gaza han sido destruidas o dañadas. Eso incluye las cinco instalaciones de tratamiento de aguas residuales del territorio, además de plantas de desalinización, estaciones de bombeo de aguas residuales, pozos y embalses.

Los empleados que antes gestionaban los sistemas municipales de agua y de residuos han sido desplazados y algunos han muerto. Y la escasez de combustible ha dificultado el mantenimiento de instalaciones que siguen intactas.

La organización benéfica internacional Oxfam dijo que solicitó un permiso para traer unidades de desalinización y tuberías para reparar la infraestructura hídrica en diciembre. Israel tardó tres meses en aprobar el envío, que aún no entra en Gaza, agregó Oxfam.

La destrucción de las redes de alcantarillado ha dejado las calles inundadas de agua pútrida, lo que acelera la propagación de enfermedades.

No ha habido energía central en Gaza desde los primeros días de la guerra, cuando su única planta eléctrica se vio obligada a cerrar por falta de combustible, y más de la mitad de la red eléctrica del territorio ha sido destruida, según el Banco Mundial.

Los países árabes ricos, como Arabia Saudí y Emiratos Árabes Unidos, han dicho que están dispuestos a contribuir a la reconstrucción de Gaza sólo como parte de un acuerdo de posguerra que cree una ruta hacia un estado palestino.

Benjamin Netanyahu, el primer ministro israelí, ha descartado esa posibilidad y ha dicho que no permitirá que Hamás o incluso la Autoridad Palestina, apoyada por Occidente, gobiernen Gaza. Ha informado que Israel mantendrá un control de seguridad ilimitado y delegará los asuntos civiles a los palestinos locales. Pero hasta donde se sabe, nadie se ha ofrecido como voluntario y Hamás ha amenazado con matar a cualquiera que ayude a la ocupación.

La reconstrucción de Gaza también requeriría la importación de cantidades masivas de materiales de construcción y equipo pesado, algo que es poco probable que Israel permita mientras exista la posibilidad de que Hamás reconstruya su infraestructura bélica. En cualquier caso, Gaza sólo tiene un pequeño número de cruces con capacidad limitada.

El organismo militar israelí que coordina los asuntos civiles en Gaza dice que no restringe la entrada de suministros civiles y permite los llamados artículos de doble uso que también podrían utilizarse con fines militares. Israel autorizó la entrada de algunos materiales de construcción antes de la guerra bajo lo que se conocía como el Mecanismo de Reconstrucción de Gaza, pero estaban sujeto a fuertes restricciones y retrasos.

La coalición Shelter Cluster estima que se necesitarían 40 años para reconstruir todas las casas destruidas en Gaza bajo esas condiciones.

Por ahora, los proveedores de asistencia tienen dificultades para traer suficientes tiendas de campaña básicas debido al número limitado de camiones que entran en Gaza y a las dificultades para entregar la ayuda. Los esfuerzos para traer viviendas temporales más sólidas todavía están en las primeras etapas, y nadie ha intentado traer materiales de construcción, según Ely.

En septiembre, Shelter Cluster estimó que 900.000 personas todavía necesitaban tiendas de campaña, ropa de cama y otros artículos para prepararse para los inviernos típicamente fríos y lluviosos de la región.

Países de todo el mundo conmemoran aniversario de ataques de 7 de octubre,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-6532e68218f1d799153128395777e026,2024-10-07T17:41:23Z,"BUDAPEST (AP) -- Vigilias, conmemoraciones y actos de recordación se planearon en todo el mundo el lunes por el primer aniversario de los ataques de Hamás contra Israel, pidiendo el fin del antisemitismo y la liberación de los rehenes israelíes.

El sorpresivo ataque transfronterizo del año pasado, en que murieron unas 1.200 personas, tomó desprevenido a Israel durante una importante festividad judía, quebrantando el sentido de seguridad de los israelíes y dejando a muchos países, que de antemano estaban nerviosos por la invasión rusa de Ucrania, enfrentando la posibilidad de otra conflagración bélica en el Oriente Medio.

Las naciones de Europa, hogar de muchas comunidades judías y musulmanas, han tratado de sofocar los ánimos antisemitas y antiislámicos luego del ataque del grupo Hamás y la subsiguiente represalia israelí en Gaza, que ha matado a unas 41.000 personas y ha desplazado a unas 1,9 millones.

El Vaticano conmemoró el aniversario recaudando fondos para el pueblo de Gaza y publicando una carta del papa Francisco en que expresa su solidaridad con los católicos de la región.

Francisco no mencionó a Israel, a Hamás ni a los rehenes en la carta fechada el 7 de octubre. Mencionó que el año pasado fue prendida ""la mecha del odio"" y la subsiguiente espiral de violencia, insistiendo en que lo que se necesita es diálogo y paz.

""Estoy con ustedes, pueblo de Gaza, desde hace tiempo atribulado y en dificultades. Están en mis pensamientos y mis oraciones a diario"", escribió el pontífice.

Luego de unos comentarios que enojaron a Israel a inicios del conflicto, el papa ha tratado de mantener un tono equilibrado. Pero recientemente ha sugerido que Israel ha estado usando una fuerza desproporcionada e ""inmoral"" en Líbano y Gaza.

Dijo que particularmente está cerca de quienes se han visto obligados a huir de sus hogares y refugiarse de las bombas, y de las madres que lloran a sus hijos muertos y los que ""temen alzar la mirada por temor al fuego que llueve del cielo"".

La cancillería alemana en Berlín estaba adornada con una cinta amarilla, símbolo del deseo de que sean liberados los rehenes israelíes tomados por Hamás, de los cuales unos 100 siguen en cautiverio y muchos de los cuales podrían estar muertos.

Se leyeron en voz alta los nombres de cada una de las personas asesinadas y tomadas como rehenes en el ataque, frente a la Puerta de Brandeburgo en Alemania a partir de las 5:29 de la mañana hora local, la hora exacta que empezó el ataque un año atrás.

El canciller alemán Olaf Scholz, dirigiéndose a ""nuestros queridos amigos en Israel"", declaró: ""Los acompañamos en su sentimiento ... nos plantamos a su lado"".

Pero también mencionó el sufrimiento de los palestinos en Gaza y expresó que ""la experiencia diaria de violencia y hambre no es una base sobre la cual pueden crecer cosas buenas"".

Scholz, ante una conferencia en Hamburgo, dijo que Alemania está tratando de lograr un cese al fuego y la liberación de los rehenes y ""un proceso político, aunque esté hoy más lejos que nunca"". Afirmó que el objetivo debe ser una solución de dos Estados y que ello es sólo posible si es evitada una conflagración regional más amplia, añadiendo que Hezbollah e Irán deben cesar sus ataques contra Israel.

Vandals deface a mural in Italy depicting a survivor of Oct. 7 attack,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/italy-antisemitism-mural-oct7-bbdeecda5a9f98498a9c3ffbebd371fc,2024-10-07T15:43:00Z,"MILAN (AP) -- The vandalism Monday of a mural depicting a survivor of last year's Oct. 7 Hamas attacks that killed some 1,200 people in Israel is an example of rising antisemitism in Italy over the last year, according to the Antisemitism Observatory in Milan.

Incidence of antisemitism has increased to about 80 or 90 a week in the last year, from about 30 a week before, said Stefano Gatti, a researcher at the observatory. He called the increase ""overpowering.""

""While before October 7, the incidents were mostly on internet websites, now they consist of acts in the real world,'' he said. ""Antisemitism has also become more socially acceptable.""

It includes graffiti, insults, acts of intimidation and aggression that so far have not translated into cases of bodily harm. He cited one incident during which a rabbi was followed in the port city of Genoa by someone brandishing a screwdriver; and another incident when a restaurant owner casually told a pair of diners he did not realize were Jewish that Hitler was right for seeking to wipe out Europe's Jews.

""We have not seen a situation like this since 1945,"" Gatti said, citing the end of World War II and the Nazi Holocaust that killed 6 million European Jews. ""Not even in 1982,"" during Lebanon's war when Israel invaded southern Lebanon. He said local mayors and university officials have not been clear in their condemnation of such events, ""which has helped the phenomenon grow.""

The mural vandalized on Monday, ""October 7th, Escape"" by AleXsandro Palombo, depicted Vlada Patapov escaping the Hamas attack. Vandals erased the figure's head and legs from the mural near Milan's state university.

Palombo said in a statement that whoever ""decapitated"" the image ""is not fighting for the liberation of Palestine. These extremist movements that are increasingly radicalizing our society have the sole purpose of defending terrorist belief in our Western democracy.""

The artist said that images of the Hamas massacre ""have been removed from the collective memory too soon, and instead need to be circulated more until they are imprinted and become a warning against the threat of Islamist terrorism and religious fundamentalism."""
EEUU ha gastado cifra récord en ayuda a Israel desde inicio de guerra en Gaza,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/general-news-49f2e56e58227c28dc174d0d1959a00e,2024-10-07T15:00:39Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Estados Unidos ha gastado un récord de al menos 17.900 millones de dólares en ayuda militar a Israel desde que comenzó la guerra en Gaza y llevó a una escalada del conflicto en todo Oriente Medio, según un informe del proyecto Costos de la Guerra de la Universidad de Brown, publicado el lunes al cumplirse un año de los ataques del grupo armado palestino Hamás contra Israel.

Se han destinado 4.860 millones de dólares adicionales a la intensificación de las operaciones militares estadounidenses en la región desde los ataques del 7 de octubre de 2023, dijeron los investigadores. Eso incluye los costos de una campaña liderada por la Armada para sofocar los ataques contra el transporte marítimo comercial por parte de los hutíes de Yemen, aliados de Hamás y respaldados por Irán.

El informe -- completado antes que Israel abriera un segundo frente, esta vez contra el grupo político-paramilitar Hezbollah, también respaldado por Irán, en el Líbano, a fines de septiembre -- es uno de los primeros recuentos de los costos estimados de Estados Unidos, mientras el gobierno del presidente Joe Biden respalda a Israel en sus conflictos en Gaza y Líbano y busca contener las hostilidades de los grupos armados aliados de Irán en la región.

El costo financiero se suma al costo en vidas humanas: los milicianos de Hamás mataron a más de 1.200 personas en Israel hace un año y tomaron a unos 250 como rehenes. La ofensiva de represalia de Israel ha cobrado la vida de casi 42.000 personas en Gaza, según el Ministerio de Salud palestino, que no distingue entre civiles y combatientes en su recuento.

Al menos 1.400 personas en Líbano, incluidos combatientes de Hezbollah y civiles, han muerto desde que Israel amplió sus ataques en ese país a fines de septiembre.

Los costos financieros fueron calculados por Linda J. Bilmes, profesora de la Facultad de Gobierno John F. Kennedy de Harvard, quien ha evaluado los costos totales de las guerras estadounidenses desde los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001, y sus colegas investigadores William D. Hartung y Stephen Semler.

Entre otros datos, se destaca que Israel es el mayor receptor de ayuda militar estadounidense en la historia, con 251.200 millones de dólares ajustados a la inflación desde 1959, según el informe.

Aun así, los 17.900 millones de dólares gastados desde el 7 de octubre de 2023 en dólares ajustados a la inflación son, con mucho, la mayor cantidad de ayuda militar enviada a Israel en un año.

Gran parte de las armas estadounidenses entregadas en el año fueron municiones, desde proyectiles de artillería hasta destructores de búnkeres de 2.000 libras y bombas guiadas de precisión.

Los gastos van desde los 4.000 millones de dólares para reponer los sistemas de defensa antimisiles Cúpula de Hierro y Honda, de Israel, hasta dinero en efectivo para fusiles y combustible para aviones, según el estudio."

"Traumatizados y con varios frentes abiertos, los israelíes enfrentan el aniversario del 7 de octubre",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-186845afb2973da28c3c4c70cf2d6ee6,2024-10-07T14:18:08Z,"RE'IM, Israel (AP) -- Los israelíes celebraban el lunes ceremonias solemnes para conmemorar el primer aniversario del ataque más letal en la historia del país, un asalto liderado por Hamás que hizo añicos su sensación de seguridad y abrió guerras en dos frentes que no dan visos de terminar.

Por su parte, Hamás dedicó el aniversario de su ataque del 7 de octubre de 2023 lanzando un aluvión de cohetes a Tel Aviv, lo que subrayaba su resiliencia tras un año de guerra y devastación en Gaza. El grupo político y militar libanés Hezbollah, que comenzó a lanzar cohetes a Israel el 8 de octubre en apoyo de su aliado Hamás, prometió mantener los ataques pese a sus recientes pérdidas.

El inesperado ataque transfronterizo, que tomó desprevenidos a los israelíes en un importante feriado judío, remeció su fe en sus líderes y su ejército, y sus consecuencias aún continúan un año más tarde. Unos 100 rehenes capturados ese día -- de lo que se cree que un tercio ha muerto -- siguen sin regresar, y los esfuerzos de buscar un cese el fuego están paralizados.

La guerra en Gaza sigue en marcha, Israel libra una nueva guerra contra Hezbollah, que comenzó a atacar Israel el 8 de octubre, y un conflicto creciente con Irán -- que respalda tanto a Hamás como a Hezbollah -- amenaza con hundir la región en una conflagración mucho más peligrosa.

No había actos conmemorativos programados en la Franja de Gaza, donde continúan los combates, hay enormes zonas destruidas por completo y la mayor parte de la población ha sido expulsada de sus hogares.

En Líbano, mientras tanto, al menos 10 bomberos murieron en un ataque israelí, dentro de una serie de bombardeos que han matado a docenas de trabajadores de emergencias, según el Ministerio libanés de Salud. Los bomberos estaban en un edificio municipal en la localidad sureña de Baraachit que fue alcanzado cuando se preparaban para salir en una misión de rescate.

El Ejército israelí no hizo comentarios en un primer momento.

Los israelíes acudieron a ceremonias, cementerios y monumentos en todo el país en recuerdo de los cientos de víctimas, las docenas de rehenes que siguen cautivos y los soldados heridos o caídos cuando intentaban salvarlos. También había actos conmemorativos planificados en Europa y otros lugares.

Los milicianos liderados por Hamás mataron a unas 1.200 personas, en su mayoría civiles, en el ataque del 7 de octubre y secuestraron a otras 250.

Antes del amanecer, cientos de familiares de los fallecidos en el festival de música Nova, junto con el presidente de Israel, Isaac Herzog, se reunieron en el lugar donde al menos 364 asistentes murieron baleados y muchos otros fueron capturados. Al salir el sol, los organizadores reprodujeron la misma pieza de música trance que se interrumpió de pronto cuando comenzó la andanada de cohetes.

A las 6:29 de la mañana, justo cuando comenzó el ataque de Hamás, los asistentes se pusieron en pie y guardaron un momento de silencio. El llanto de una mujer rompió el silencio mientras se oían explosiones de los combates en Gaza, apenas a unos kilómetros de distancia.

""Cuando estamos aquí, estamos cerca de nuestros seres queridos, este es el momento en el que bailaban y huían"", dijo Sigal Bar-On, cuya sobrina, Yuval Bar-On, de 25 años, y su prometido, Moshe Shuva, de 34, planeaban casarse en diciembre de 2023.

""No podemos entender cómo ha pasado un año"", dijo Shimon Busika, padre de Yarden Busika, de 25 años y que fue asesinado en el festival. ""Es el lugar más natural donde estar, estar aquí para este momento de silencio"".

A las 6:31 de la mañana, cuatro proyectiles se lanzaron desde Gaza hacia las mismas poblaciones israelíes que sufrieron el duro asalto el año pasado, según el ejército israelí. La ceremonia no se vio interrumpida.

El Ejército dijo que otros cinco cohetes salieron de la ciudad sureña gazatí de Jan Yunis hacia el centro de Israel e hicieron sonar las sirenas antiaéreas en Tel Aviv. Dos mujeres sufrieron heridas leves, según personal de emergencia, y se reportaron daños menores. El Ejército dijo que había alcanzado los lugares desde donde se habían lanzado los proyectiles.

Familiares de rehenes que siguen en Gaza se congregaron por la mañana cerca de la residencia en Jerusalén del primer ministro, Benjamin Netanyahu, y se mantuvieron en pie durante dos minutos mientras sonaba una sirena, una costumbre de los días más solemnes en el calendario israelí: el Recuerdo del Holocausto y el Día de los Caídos.

""Estamos aquí para recordar (a los rehenes), que no nos hemos olvidado de ellos"", dijo Shiri Albag, cuya hija, Liri, está entre los cautivos. Albag tenía un mensaje para Netanyahu, que ""no le dejaremos descansar hasta que todos ellos estén de vuelta, hasta el último"", dijo a la multitud, que mostraba carteles con los rostros de los rehenes.

Netanyahu emitió un comunicado que rendía homenaje a los muertos o capturados y dijo que ""hace un año pasamos por una masacre terrible y nos levantamos como nación como leones"".

Las banderas en el parlamento israelí, la Knéset, ondeaban a media asta. Estaba previsto que el lunes por la tarde se emitiera una ceremonia oficial de Estado centrada en actos de valor y esperanza. La ceremonia se grabó con antelación sin público, al parecer para evitar posibles interrupciones, en la ciudad sureña de Ofakim, donde fueron asesinados unas dos docenas de israelíes.

Pero la ira contra el gobierno por no evitar el ataque y la frustración persistente porque no ha recuperado a los rehenes que quedan hizo que las familias de varios de los fallecidos y capturados organizaran un acto separado en Tel Aviv.

Estaba previsto que el evento congregara a decenas de miles de personas, pero se vio reducido de forma drástica por las restricciones a las grandes aglomeraciones debido a la amenaza de ataques de misiles de Irán y Hezbollah.

La guerra en Gaza ha matado a más de 41.000 palestinos, desplazado a la mayoría de los 2,3 millones de habitantes del territorio e iniciado una crisis humanitaria que ha llevado a un hambre generalizada.

Pero Hamás sigue controlando el territorio y sus fuerzas se han reagrupado de forma reiterada en zonas donde Israel ha realizado grandes operaciones. Tropas israelíes rodearon el domingo la localidad norteña de Jabaliya y comenzaron otra gran operación allí que según el Ejército pretende expulsar a los milicianos.

En Líbano, Hezbollah ha seguido disparando cohetes, misiles y drones a Israel incluso después de una sucesión de ataques israelíes en las últimas semanas que mataron a la mayoría de su cúpula, incluido su veterano líder Hassan Nasrallah, y castigaron amplias zonas de Líbano. Israel emprendió la semana pasada lo que por ahora es una operación terrestre limitada al otro lado de la frontera.

Al menos 1.400 libaneses, incluidos civiles, médicos y combatientes de Hezbollah, han muerto y 1,2 millones han sido expulsados de sus hogares. Israel dice que intenta expulsar al grupo armado y político de su frontera para que decenas de miles de ciudadanos israelíes puedan regresar a casa.

Israel también ha prometido responder a un ataque de misiles balísticos de Irán la semana pasada que según Teherán respondía a los asesinatos de Nasrallah, el líder de Hamás Ismail Haniyeh y uno de los generales de su Guardia Revolucionaria.

En un comunicado el lunes, Hezbollah prometió seguir luchando hasta que haya un cese el fuego en Gaza y dijo que Israel ""era y seguirá siendo una glándula mortal, agresiva, cancerosa, que debe ser eliminada, sin importar cuánto tiempo tome"".

(AP) -- Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are marking the first anniversary of the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust as the presidential candidates approach the final weeks of the campaign during a widening conflict in the Middle East.

Trump will speak before Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in the Miami suburb of Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and plant a pomegranate tree with her husband on the grounds of the Vice President's residence in honor of the 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, who were killed by Hamas-led militants in the Oct. 7 attack last year.

Harris' husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, will recite a prayer at an event to commemorate the anniversary with the American Jewish Committee.

Trump has blamed both Harris and President Joe Biden for the war, arguing their administration empowered Iran, and tried to take advantage of some of the divisions within the Democratic Party with progressives protesting Israel's military campaign, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians.

Some of his statements on Israel overlook his association with people who spew antisemitic rhetoric such as far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.

Trump has also repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats ""should have their head examined"" and recently said that if he loses the presidential election to Harris on Nov. 5 ""the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that.""

In an excerpt released from an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air Monday night, Harris appeared to avoid answering a question about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered ""a real close ally,"" and said that ""The better question is: Do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.""

Trump's own relations with Netanyahu have been rocky. They soured after the Israeli prime minister became one of the first world leaders to congratulate President Joe Biden for his 2020 victory, which Trump continues to deny. A few days after the Oct. 7 attack last year, Trump publicly criticized Netanyahu and said he ""was not prepared"" for the deadly incursion from Gaza on Oct. 7. Trump said Netanyahu had let the U.S. down just before the U.S. killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020.

Since then, the two have met to talk about a cease-fire deal for Gaza.

Halie Soifer, head of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said the conflict in the Middle East -- including fighting with Hezbollah and Iran -- has left Jewish voters ""with a sense of vulnerability and concern for Israel's future."" Soifer previously advised Harris on national security issues.

But she says Harris has been consistent with the message of commitment to Israel's defense for the last year, and said Harris and Biden have directed U.S. forces to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel on multiple occasions."

Countries around the world commemorate the anniversary of Hamas attack on Israel,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hamas-attack-israel-anniversary-protests-b8f7428b707f2cf4300405feca0b570e,2024-10-07T11:25:07Z,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Vigils, commemorations and acts of remembrance were planned across the world on Monday to mark one year since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel as world leaders called for an end to antisemitism and the release of Israeli hostages.

Last year's surprise cross-border attack, which killed about 1,200 people, caught Israel unprepared on a major Jewish holiday, shattering Israelis' sense of security and putting many countries, already on edge over Russia's war in Ukraine, facing the prospect of another major conflict in the Middle East.

The nations of Europe, home to many Jewish and Muslim communities, have sought to tamp down both antisemitic and anti-Muslim sentiment in the wake of the Hamas attack and Israel's subsequent war against the militants in Gaza, which has killed over 41,000 people and displaced around 1.9 million in the embattled coastal territory.

The German chancellery in Berlin was adorned with a yellow ribbon commemorating the Israeli hostages taken by Hamas, around 100 of which remain in captivity, with many of them feared dead.

The names of the people killed and kidnapped in the attack on Israel were read out in front of the Brandenburg Gate starting at 5:29 a.m. local time in Germany, when Hamas' onslaught began a year ago.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a video message on Sunday that ""with its abhorrent attack on Israel, Hamas at the same time caused a catastrophe for the Palestinian people."" He stressed the need for a cease-fire in Gaza and international efforts to avoid an even wider Mideast conflagration.

""We will never accept antisemitism and blind hatred of Israel,"" he said. ""The full solidarity of our state goes to Jews here in Germany -- and the solidarity of all decent people in our country.""

An inter-religious service at a Berlin church, addressed by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was planned for later Monday. Scholz was to attend a memorial event at a synagogue in Hamburg.

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who has voiced strong support for Israel, commemorated the Oct. 7 anniversary by visiting the main synagogue in Rome and reaffirming Israel's right to defend itself.

She denounced the ""latent and rampant antisemitism"" she said has arisen since the Hamas attack, citing in particular pro-Palestinian protests in Italy this past weekend, some of which turned violent.

While asserting Israel's lights to live safely within its borders, Meloni insisted it respect international law and lamented the devastation unleashed by Israeli forces in Gaza. She said Palestinians in Gaza had been ""victims twice over: first of Hamas' cynicism, which uses them as human shields, and then of Israeli military operations.""

As the current president of the Group of Seven, Italy will continue to work for an immediate cease-fire, ""the release of Israeli hostages and the stabilization of the Israeli-Lebanese border through the full implementation of U.N. resolutions,"" she said.

French President Emmanuel Macron took to social media Monday to mark the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks. ""The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity,"" he said.

""We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts,"" Macron wrote on X.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot attended a memorial service at the site of the Nova music festival, in Re'im, Israel, where hundreds were killed. Speaking to the families of victims, he expressed France's support in the face of ""the worst antisemitic massacre in our history since the Holocaust.""

""The joyful dawn of what should have been a day of celebration was suddenly torn apart by unspeakable horror,"" he said. ""France mourns alongside Israel for our 48 compatriot victims of barbarism.""

Barrot, who will meet with his counterpart Israel Katz later Monday, said Macron will receive in Paris some of the family members of hostages held by Hamas.

Commemorations were planned in France, Belgium, Spain, Austria and Hungary, while leading European politicians were also expected to take part in remembering those killed and kidnapped.

The European Parliament is holding a plenary session in Strasbourg, France, marking the anniversary, with the parliament's president, Roberta Metsola, to address lawmakers. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is also expected to attend a ceremony at a synagogue in Brussels.

In Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attended a vigil in Melbourne, where he walked with members of the Jewish community and lawmakers from across party lines. Thousands attended the vigil.

Earlier in the morning, Albanese said the day carried ""terrible pain,"" and that his government ""unequivocally"" condemned Hamas' actions.

""Since the atrocities of October 7, Jewish Australians have felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day, and as a nation we say never again,"" he said. ""We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred.""

In Sydney, opposition leader Peter Dutton -- who has vehemently decried Australia's acceptance of Palestinian refugees -- arrived to cheers at a vigil also attended by thousands at which he reiterated his party's support for Israel.

Dutton's remarks to the crowd echoed those he made earlier Monday, in which he said the Oct. 7 attack ""awoke and exposed an antisemitic rot afflicting Western democracies.""

""Israel has every right to defend its territory and its people from existential threats,"" he said.

Hundreds of people gathered amid a heavy police presence Monday night at Sydney town hall for a vigil for Palestinian lives lost in the conflict. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters had rallied across Australia's cities on Sunday.

Middle East latest: Palestinian militants in Gaza fire 4 rockets into Israel as mourners mark Oct 7,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-7-october-2024-d3d272d83e70d420ba547dbd7e09ef52,2024-10-07T05:58:18Z,"Palestinian militants in Gaza fired four rockets into Israel on Monday as mourners marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, without disrupting a nearby ceremony.

Hamas also said it attacked Israeli forces in different parts of Gaza.

The Israeli military said three rockets were intercepted and a fourth fell in an open area. There were no reports of casualties or damage.

The military said it launched a wave of artillery and airstrikes overnight and into Monday to thwart what it said was an imminent attack. It said it targeted Hamas launch posts and underground militant infrastructure.

The fighting on the anniversary underscored the militants' resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive that has killed around 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials. It has also destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population.

Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's security fence and stormed into nearby army bases and farming communities in a surprise attack one year ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding around 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has also vowed to strike Iran in response to a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week.

Here is The Latest:

RE'IM, Israel -- Hundreds of families and friends of people killed at the Nova music festival gathered Monday at the site of the attack, where nearly 400 were gunned down during Hamas' Oct. 7 assault.

Families gathered around photos of their loved ones, which were arranged in a semicircle around what was the DJ stage. Many lit candles and added mementos or photos, crying and embracing. Overhead, army helicopters circled and constant booms echoed across the area, causing many to flinch.

""We can't understand how a year has passed,"" said Shimon Busika, whose son, Yarden, 25, was killed at the festival. ""It's the most natural place to be, to be here for this moment of silence,"" he said.

Busika said it took them a long time, piecing together testimony from other survivors, to understand what happened in Yarden's last moments. They now know he was killed around 9:20 near a yellow container at the festival where many others were killed, and they will hold a second minute of silence there at the moment he was killed.

The last sounds of the trance track that was playing at the Nova site on Oct. 7 one year ago stopped abruptly, as hundreds of family members and friends of the more than 300 victims stood in a moment of silence. One woman's piercing wail broke the silence as booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers (miles) away.

JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Twenty Indonesian nationals and a Lebanese evacuated from Lebanon arrived in Jakarta on a commercial flight early Monday and will likely be followed by 20 more in the afternoon, officials said.

President Joko Widodo has called to prioritize the evacuation of Indonesians in Lebanon as hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalate and fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East grow.

""I have directed the foreign affairs minister to take immediate action to ensure the safety and protection of our citizens and expedite their evacuation,"" Widodo said last week.

Indonesia's Embassy in Beirut had prepared evacuation procedures for citizens as part of its contingency planning since August. The Embassy evacuated 25 Indonesian citizens who returned safely to Indonesia last month, said Judha Nugraha, Director of Indonesian Citizen Protection at the Foreign Affairs Ministry.

There are 116 registered Indonesian citizens in Lebanon, most of them students, migrant workers and people married to Lebanese nationals. Many of them have chosen to remain there for various reasons, Nugraha said.

CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement Monday that the day carried ""terrible pain"" and his government ""unequivocally"" condemned Hamas' attack on Israel a year ago.

Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns on Oct. 7 a year ago, killing dozens and abducting others in an unprecedented surprise attack.

Albanese said that since the attack, Jewish Australians have ""felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day -- and as a nation we say never again.""

""We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred. There is no place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith,"" Albanese said.

He added that ""every innocent life matters"" and the number of civilians killed in the conflict was ""a devastating tragedy.""

""Today we reflect on the truth of our shared humanity, of the hope that peace is possible, and the belief that it belongs to all people,"" Albanese said.

BEIRUT -- A new round of airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs late Sunday as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon. Palestinian officials said a strike on a mosque in Gaza killed at least 19 people.

Rocket sirens and blasts were heard in Haifa in northern Israel late Sunday, and Hezbollah claimed the attack. Israel's military said at least five projectiles were identified coming from Lebanon and ""fallen projectiles"" were found in the area. The military showed what appeared to be rubble along a street. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating a teen with shrapnel injuries to the head and a man who fell from a window due to a blast.

A year after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Israel has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has traded fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel also has vowed to strike Iran after a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week."
Takeaways from AP's report on the Gaza war's destruction,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-anniversary-destruction-takeaways-a1ae8d316633fd7d1f3fe24cc527a2ee,2024-10-07T05:06:25Z,"Israel's yearlong offensive against Hamas, launched in response to the militant group's Oct. 7 attack into Israel, has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused staggering destruction across the Gaza Strip that could take decades to rebuild.

Hundreds of thousands of people are crammed into squalid tent camps with no homes to return to, even if there is a cease-fire. The mountains of rubble alone, laced with human remains, unexploded ordnance and other hazardous materials, could take years to remove.

Israel blames the destruction on Hamas. Its Oct. 7 attack on Israel -- in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage -- ignited the war. Hamas embedded much of its military infrastructure, including hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, in densely populated areas where some of the heaviest battles were fought.

The fighting left roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza destroyed or severely damaged, according to a U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage.

Here's a look at the main takeaways from an AP interactive report looking at the scope of the devastation.

Israel's offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 96,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says women and children make up more than half of those killed.

It also says the toll may be higher as thousands of bodies remain buried under rubble or in areas that are inaccessible to medical teams.

Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, but has not provided evidence. Over 720 Israeli soldiers have been killed since Oct. 7, including in the attack itself, the war in Gaza and the conflict with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.

The U.N. estimates that around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times. Israeli evacuation orders now cover around 90% of the territory.

Schools have been turned into shelters, and hundreds of thousands have crammed into sprawling tent camps along the coast.

The Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, says it has struggled to bring in basic supplies because of Israeli restrictions, the ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order in Gaza.

It estimates that some 900.000 people are in need of tents and bedding.

The war has gutted Gaza's infrastructure, which was already in bad shape after a 16-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt when Hamas seized power in 2007.

The U.N. says the war has damaged or destroyed over 92% of Gaza's main roads and more than 84% of its health facilities.

It estimates nearly 70% of Gaza's water and sanitation plants have been destroyed or damaged. That includes all five of the territory's wastewater treatment facilities, plus desalination plants, sewage pumping stations, wells and reservoirs.

The breakdown of water infrastructure has flooded the streets with sewage in many areas, contributing to the spread of disease among a population weakened by widespread hunger.

Where houses, shops and office buildings once stood, there are now giant drifts of rubble laced with human remains, hazardous substances and unexploded munitions.

The U.N. estimates the war has left some 40 million tons of debris and rubble in Gaza, enough to fill New York's Central Park to a depth of eight meters (about 25 feet). It could take up to 15 years and nearly $650 million to clear it all away, it said.

The World Bank estimated $18.5 billion in damage in Gaza from just the first three months of the war, before several major Israeli operations. That figure is nearly equivalent to the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022.

Wealthy Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they are only willing to contribute to Gaza's reconstruction as part of a postwar settlement that creates a path to a Palestinian state.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled that out, saying he won't allow Hamas or even the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza. He has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control and delegate civilian affairs to local Palestinians. But none are known to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened to kill anyone who aids the occupation.

Israel allowed construction materials in before the war, but the system was subject to heavy restrictions and delays.

The Shelter Cluster estimates that it would take 40 years to rebuild all of Gaza's destroyed homes under that system."

Mideast violence is spiraling a year since the Gaza war began,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-hezbollah-lebanon-anniversary-73916b17394f093f01ca5554cf26b528,2024-10-07T05:00:00Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- A year after Hamas' fateful attack on southern Israel, the Middle East is embroiled in a war that shows no signs of ending and seems to be getting worse.

Israel's retaliatory offensive was initially centered on the Gaza Strip. But the focus has shifted in recent weeks to Lebanon, where airstrikes have given way to a fast-expanding ground incursion against Hezbollah militants who have fired rockets into Israel since the Gaza war began.

Next in Israel's crosshairs is archenemy Iran, which supports Hamas, Hezbollah and other anti-Israel militants in the region. After withstanding a massive barrage of missiles from Iran last week, Israel has promised to respond. The escalating conflict risks drawing deeper involvement by the U.S., as well as Iran-backed militants in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

When Hamas launched its attack on Oct. 7, 2023, it called on the Arab world to join it in a concerted campaign against Israel. While the fighting has indeed spread, Hamas and its allies have paid a heavy price.

The group's army has been decimated, its Gaza stronghold has been reduced to a cauldron of death, destruction and misery and the top leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah have been killed in audacious attacks.

Although Israel appears to be gaining the edge militarily, the war has been problematic for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, too.

Dozens of Israeli hostages are languishing in Hamas captivity, and a year after Netanyahu pledged to crush the group in ""total victory,"" remnants of the militant group are still battling in pockets of Gaza. The offensive in Lebanon, initially described as ""limited,"" grows by the day. A full-on collision with Iran is a possibility.

At home, Netanyahu faces mass protests over his inability to bring home the hostages, and to many, he will be remembered as the man who led Israel into its darkest moment. Relations with the U.S. and other allies are strained. The economy is deteriorating.

Here are five takeaways from a yearlong war that has upended longstanding assumptions and turned conventional wisdom on its head.

A long list of previously unthinkable events have occurred in mind-boggling fashion.

The Oct. 7 attack was the bloodiest in Israel's history. Young partygoers were gunned down. Cowering families were killed in their homes. In all, about 1,200 people died and 250 were taken hostage. Some Israelis were raped or sexually assaulted.

The ensuing war in Gaza has been the longest, deadliest and most destructive in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Gaza health authorities say nearly 42,000 people have been killed -- roughly 2% of the territory's entire population. Although they do not give a breakdown between civilians and combatants, more than half of the dead have been women and children. Numerous top Hamas officials have been killed.

The damage and displacement in Gaza have reached unseen levels. Hospitals, schools and mosques - once thought to be insulated from violence - have repeatedly been targeted by Israel or caught in the crossfire. Scores of journalists and health workers have been killed, many of them while working in the line of duty.

Months of simmering tensions along Israel's northern border recently boiled over into war.

A growing list of Hezbollah officials - including the group's longtime leader -- have been killed by Israel. Hundreds of Hezbollah members were killed or maimed in explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies. Israel's ground offensive is its first in Lebanon since a monthlong war in 2006.

Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis and over 1 million Lebanese. Israel promises to keep pounding Hezbollah until its residents can return to homes near the Lebanese border; Hezbollah says it will keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza.

When the war erupted, the days appeared to be numbered for both Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.

Netanyahu's public standing plummeted as he faced calls to step aside. Sinwar fled into Gaza's labyrinth of tunnels as Israel declared him a ""dead man walking.""

Yet both men -- facing war crimes charges in international courts -- remain firmly in charge, and neither appears to be in a rush for a cease-fire.

The end of the war could mean the end of Netanyahu's government, which is dominated by hard-line partners opposed to a cease-fire. That would mean early elections, potentially pushing him into the opposition while he stands trial on corruption charges. Also looming is the prospect of an unflattering official inquiry into his government's failures before and during the Oct. 7 attack.

Fearing that, his coalition has hung together even through mass protests and repeated disagreements with top security officials pushing for a deal to bring home the hostages. After a brief period of post-Oct. 7 national unity, Israel has returned to its divided self -- torn between Netanyahu's religious, conservative, nationalist right-wing base and his more secular, middle-class opposition.

Sinwar, believed to be hiding in Gaza's tunnels, continues to drive a hard bargain in hopes of declaring some sort of victory. His demands for a full Israeli withdrawal, a lasting cease-fire and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for scores of hostages have been rejected by Israel -- even as much of the international community has embraced them.

With cease-fire efforts deadlocked and Netanyahu's far-right coalition firmly intact, the war could go on for some time. An estimated 1.9 million Palestinians remain displaced in Gaza while an estimated 68 hostages remain captive in Gaza, in addition to the bodies of 33 others held by Hamas.

Early in the war, Netanyahu promised to destroy Hamas' military and governing abilities.

Those goals have been achieved in many ways. Israel says it has dismantled Hamas' military structure, and its rocket barrages have been diminished to a trickle. With Israeli troops stationed indefinitely in Gaza, it is difficult to see how the group could return to governing the territory or pose a serious threat.

But in other ways, total victory is impossible. Despite Israel's overwhelming force, Hamas units have repeatedly regrouped to stage guerrilla-style ambushes from areas where Israel has withdrawn.

Across the Middle East, bitter enemies are witnessing the limits of force and deterrence.

Israel's deepening invasion of Lebanon and repeated strikes on Hezbollah have failed to halt the rockets and missiles. Missile and drone attacks by Iran and its allies have only deepened Israel's resolve. Israel is vowing to strike Iran hard after its latest missile barrage, raising the likelihood of a broader, regionwide war.

Without diplomatic solutions, the fighting is likely to persist.

Israel is still deeply traumatized as people try to come to terms with the worst day in its history.

The Oct. 7 killings and kidnappings had an outsized impact on a tiny country founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Israelis' sense of security was shattered, and their faith in the military was tested like never before.

Photos of Israeli hostages are everywhere, and mass demonstrations are held each week calling on the government to reach a deal to bring them home. The prospect of ongoing war looms over families and workplaces as reserve soldiers brace for repeated tours of duty.

The trauma is far more acute in Gaza - where an estimated 90% of the population remains displaced, many of them living in squalid tent camps.

The scenes have drawn comparisons to what the Palestinian call the Nakba, or catastrophe - the mass displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948. The Palestinians now find themselves looking at a tragedy of even greater scale.

It remains unclear when displaced Palestinians in Gaza will be able to return home and whether there will be anything to return to. The territory has suffered immense destruction and is littered with unexploded bombs. Children are missing a second consecutive school year, virtually every family has lost a relative in the fighting and basic needs like food and health care are lacking.

After a hellish year, the Palestinians of Gaza have no clear path forward, and it could take generations to recover.

The international community's response to this bloodiest of wars has been tepid and ineffective.

Repeated cease-fire calls have been ignored, and a U.S.-led plan to reinstate the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza has been rejected by Israel. It remains unclear who will run the territory in the future or who will pay for a cleanup and reconstruction effort that could take decades.

One thing that seems clear is that old formulas will no longer work. The international community's preferred peace formula - the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel - seems hopelessly unrealistic.

Israel's hard-line government opposes Palestinian statehood, says its troops will remain in Gaza for years to come and has further cemented its undeclared annexation of the West Bank. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority has been pushed to the brink of irrelevance.

For decades, the United States has acted as the key mediator and power broker in the region - calling for a two-state solution but showing little political will to promote that vision. Instead, it has often turned to conflict management, preventing any side from doing anything too extreme to destabilize the region.

This approach went up in smoke on Oct. 7. Since then, the U.S. has responded with a muddled message of criticizing Israel's wartime tactics as too harsh while arming the Israeli military and protecting Israel against diplomatic criticism. The result: The Biden administration has managed to antagonize both Israel and the Arab world while cease-fire efforts repeatedly sputter.

This approach has also alienated the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, complicating Kamala Harris' presidential aspirations. The warring sides appear to have given up on the Biden administration and are waiting for the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election before deciding their next moves.

Whoever wins the race will almost certainly have to find a new formula and recalibrate decades of American policy if they want to end the war."

U.S. futures slipped and oil prices also fell.

Japan's Nikkei 225 index gained 1.9% to 39,354.63 after the yen sank against the U.S. dollar. The Japanese currency has bounced on speculation over the central bank's plans for interest rates since Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba took office last week.

In a policy speech on Friday, Ishiba said he wants to see salary increases that outpace inflation and that he will promote investment to create ""a virtuous cycle of growth and distribution."" He promised economic support for low-income households and measures for regional revitalization and disaster resilience.

But he offered no major new initiatives, and his initial public support ratings are around 50% or lower, relatively low for a new leader, according to Japanese media. He plans to dissolve parliament on Wednesday for an election on Oct. 27.

Mainland Chinese markets reopen from a weeklong holiday on Tuesday, and the government said it plans to explain details of plans for economic stimulus at a morning news conference in Beijing. Before the Oct. 1 National Day holiday began, announcements of policies aimed at reviving the ailing property market pushed share benchmarks sharply higher and this week could bring more volatility.

Treasury yields soared Friday after the U.S. government said employers added 254,000 more jobs to their payrolls last month than they cut. That was an acceleration from August's hiring pace of 159,000 and blew past economists' forecasts.

Recent encouraging data on the economy have raised hopes that the job market will hold up after the Fed pressed the brakes on the economy through higher rates in order to stamp out high inflation.

The Fed has begun cutting interest rates and Friday's jobs report was so strong traders are now forecasting it will not deliver another half-point interest rate cut before the end of the year after doing so in September.

"A year after the Hamas attack shattered this Israeli community, going home still feels impossible",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-kibbutz-attack-anniversary-344b289751d8ee80d4909f15864f508c,2024-10-07T04:49:28Z,"KFAR AZA, Israel (AP) -- On a sun-dappled day in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, Liora Eilon stood at the spot where her son was killed. She stooped to pick a figurine from the pile of belongings scattered around an abandoned home nearby.

""Every time we come here, Tal leaves us a little message,"" the 71-year-old said, turning over the plastic soldier in her hands.

It has been a year since Hamas militants stormed into this community within sight of the border fence surrounding Gaza. Eilon's 46-year-old son, Tal, who was the Kfar Aza civilian defense commander, was killed in the early moments of the attack, as he ran to the kibbutz armory to grab a weapon.

Now living in a university dormitory in Israel's north, Liora Eilon wonders if she'll ever return home to this place, seared into Israeli history for that day of mass death, when the militants killed some 1,200 people in southern communities and took about 250 others hostage. The attack sparked an ongoing Israeli campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 41,600 Palestinians and laid waste to much of the territory.

""How can I trust the government who abandoned me here, who betrayed me, promised me that my family was safe here?"" she said. ""The government wants us to go back to Kfar Aza, but I need more to feel safe.""

Only about 50 of Kfar Aza's 1,000 residents have returned. They live among the skeletons of houses burned by explosives, riddled with bullet holes or reduced to rubble by tank shells during the battle that raged for days.

The others are scattered in dorms and hotels further north. The Associated Press spoke to a dozen residents who shared feelings of extreme vulnerability to future attack and deep misgivings about Israel's military and government, and the Palestinians on the other side of the fence.

Some wondered whether such a scarred place could ever be lived in at all.

""Are we going to live inside a memorial? Are we going to see a plaque every few meters, he was killed here and he was killed here?"" asked Zohar Shpack, 58, who has returned and serves in the civilian defense squad. ""I don't know yet.""

The seasons have spun by since Oct. 7. Relatively untended, Kfar Aza's orchards have borne new fruit. With few to harvest, soldiers guarding the community have their pick from loads of fresh avocadoes.

The land still holds traces of the day. On trees hung with fresh pomegranates, some of last year's fruit remains, charred and black like used grenades. Gardener Rafael Friedman says he still finds teeth and bones in the soil when he rakes back the overgrowth -- likely remnants of Hamas militants killed in the fighting.

Kfar Aza has always been a close-knit place. It takes just 15 minutes to walk from one end to the other, past neighborhoods, orchards and a soccer pitch. Many residents grew up here and raised families alongside each other.

Now photos of slain young people, couples killed together and hostages are posted everywhere. During the day, former residents like Eilon guide tours, hold memorials and see familiar faces. When night falls, most disappear to hotel rooms to the north.

Every Friday, survivors gather on Shachar Schnorman's porch for dinner, filling the kibbutz with the rare sound of laughter.

""It's the only place where people can talk about the seventh and all the people at the table understand exactly what they are talking about,"" Schnorman said.

""We do whatever we can to try to build community, to try to show ... that people can live here,"" he said.

The government says it will rebuild. Meanwhile, it's constructing pre-fabricated houses for residents in another kibbutz, Ruhama, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) away. After two years there, they say authorities want them to return to Kfar Aza.

About two-thirds of the community plan to move into the temporary housing. On a recent tour, some enthusiastically examined the box-like structures. It's a chance, they said, to live together and rebuild on the southern land they're accustomed to.

But some weren't convinced Kfar Aza will be rebuilt and not sure they'd ever feel safe returning.

They want to know why it took so many hours before soldiers arrived at the kibbutz. The military has launched an investigation into what happened, but has not yet released its results. An investigation into the military's failures at neighboring Kibbutz Be'eri found a ""lack of command and control, a lack of coordination and a lack of order"" among the units that fought there.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has brushed off calls for accountability, saying it will investigate at war's end.

Simona Steinbrecher feels too frozen in time to make a decision now about whether to return. Her daughter, Doron, a veterinary nurse who spent her girlhood in Kfar Aza, was dragged by militants into Gaza on Oct. 7. She is among 66 Israelis still held captive. Hamas is believed to hold the bodies of 35 others.

The 65-year-old Steinbrecher last saw her daughter in a Hamas propaganda video. Doron's skin was pale, her voice weak.

""Without Doron, it's still the seventh of October,"" her mother said. ""And we won't go home until she's home.""

Hostage families and many residents of southern communities are boycotting the government's ceremony commemorating Oct. 7. To them, as long as it fails to bring hostages home and refuses to investigate and take responsibility for its mistakes, it has blood on its hands. Instead, residents of Kfar Aza will hold a small tribute and lower the kibbutz flag to half-mast.

Residents said they have nothing but admiration for the troops who fought that day. But they are furious at the military higher-ups, blaming them for a command structure that collapsed when the kibbutz needed it most.

When she recounts the day, Eilon is gripped with fury and astonishment -- over 35 hours of horror her family endured and the military's response.

When the sirens began blaring that Saturday morning, Eilon thought it would take the army minutes to arrive, she told the AP as she toured the bullet-riddled remnants of her home.

It took hours.

Her family scrambled into their safe room. A son and daughter muscled the door shut against gunmen trying to get inside. Granddaughters, Gali and Mika, hid under the bed. Eilon got a message saying Tal had gone out to fight.

The five huddled in the saferoom, hearing the attackers' shouts and gunfire, not knowing whether Tal was dead or alive. Israeli troops finally gained control of their house, and Eilon said she saw how scared and confused the young soldiers looked.

Gali shared with them desperate texts from her friends across the kibbutz trying to escape the rampage.

""She became a 15-year-old commander of an IDF elite unit,"" said Eilon, using the acronym for the Israeli military.

Still, the troops didn't evacuate the family. It was only on Sunday afternoon, as militants were hiding out in the house again, that soldiers hustled them out.

As she ran into her backyard, Eilon saw a tank swivel its cannon at her house. It fired, collapsing her home on the militants inside.

Soon after being rescued, Eilon learned Tal was dead.

""I'd known it all along,"" she said. ""But some part of me was hoping that he was injured, that he was unconscious in some hospital.""

As the battle still raged, some residents were evacuated early and sped away in army jeeps. Hanan Dann, a young father, recounted passing a cluster of soldiers at a gas station just outside the kibbutz, who looked like they were waiting for orders.

""I wanted to say, there's fighting inside still, there're people dying,"" he said. ""They could have saved them.""

Soldiers and militants fought in Kfar Aza for days. By the end, militants had killed 64 civilians and 22 soldiers and dragged 19 hostages into Gaza.

Nearby, in the recesses of the Negev desert, stands a decrepit water tower. It's a remnant of Be'erot Yitzhak, a kibbutz abandoned after a deadly 1948 Egyptian attack during the war that led to Israel's creation.

""Will that be what Kfar Aza looks like 10 years from now?"" asked Dann. ""Just a stop on the highway I can point out to my kids?""

Even those who want to reinhabit it know Kfar Aza will never be the same.

Shpack, the civilian guard member, said he understands why no one would bring a child here now, pointing to the border fence. Every few minutes, an Israeli warplane drops a bomb on Gaza, puncturing the kibbutz's silence with a loud boom.

""And even once the bombs end, how can you raise him here?"" Shpack asked. ""How do you explain what happened here?""

Marcus Scharfstein, 29, who lives in the kibbutz, said he won't feel completely safe until Israel reestablishes Jewish settlements in Gaza. Israel unilaterally withdrew its soldiers and some 8,000 Jewish settlers from Gaza in 2005.

""If I will know that in Gaza right now, there are 10, 20 villages of Jewish people,"" he said, ""I will feel in control again,"" adding he did not feel that way before the Oct. 7 attack.

But others say as long as there is no peace agreement with Palestinians, they will again be on the front lines of another Oct. 7. Some of Gaza's Palestinians once lived in these same arid reaches of what is now southern Israel. Almost no trace is left of their villages after Israeli troops drove them out during the 1948 war.

""We've tried war enough times and it never led to anything good,"" Eilon said. She wants a new government that will talk to the Palestinians to find ""some arrangement for us to live together on the same land.""

""I'm dreaming for the day with an open fence from here to the sea, with two people living together."""
Gaza is in ruins after Israel's yearlong offensive. Rebuilding may take decades,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-anniversary-palestinians-gaza-destruction-6b41ad9f64887228e90793705dd379a7,2024-10-07T04:49:05Z,"There are hills of rubble where apartment blocks stood, and pools of sewage-tainted water spreading disease. City streets have been churned into dirt canyons and, in many places, the air is filled with the stench of unrecovered corpses.

Israel's yearlong offensive against Hamas, one of the deadliest and most destructive in recent history, has killed more than 41,000 people, a little over half of them women and children, according to local health officials. With no end in sight to the war and no plan for the day after, it is impossible to say when - or even if - anything will be rebuilt.

Even after the fighting stops, hundreds of thousands of people could be stuck living in squalid tent camps for years. Experts say reconstruction could take decades.

""This war is destruction and misery. It would make the stones cry out,"" said Shifaa Hejjo, a 60-year-old housewife living in a tent pitched on land where her home once stood. ""Whoever sees Gaza ... It will make them cry.""

Israel blames the destruction on Hamas. Its Oct. 7 attack on Israel -- in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage -- ignited the war. Israel says Hamas embedded much of its military infrastructure, including hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, in densely populated areas where some of the heaviest battles were fought.

The fighting left roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza destroyed or severely damaged, according to a U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage.

If there's a cease-fire, around half of all families ""have nowhere to go back to,"" said Alison Ely, a Gaza-based coordinator with the Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council.

Almost as many buildings have been destroyed or damaged in Gaza as in all of Ukraine after its first two years of war with Russia, according to Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek, U.S.-based researchers who use satellite radar to document the wars' devastation.

To put that into perspective: Gaza is less than half the size of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.

The amount of destruction in central and southern Gaza alone, Scher said, is roughly equivalent to what was lost in the front-line town of Bakhmut, the scene of one of the deadliest battles in the Ukraine war and where Russian forces destroyed nearly every building in their path to force Ukrainian troops to withdraw. The destruction in northern Gaza is even worse, he said.

Gaza's water and sanitation system has collapsed. More than 80% of its health facilities -- and even more of its roads -- are damaged or destroyed.

""I can't think of any parallel, in terms of the severity of damage, for an enclave or a country or a people,"" Scher said.

At the end of January, the World Bank estimated $18.5 billion of damage -- nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022. That was before some intensely destructive Israeli ground operations, including in the southern border city of Rafah.

When Israeli ground forces pushed into the southern city of Khan Younis in January, Shifaa Hejjo and her family fled their four-story home with only the clothes they were wearing.

They spent months in various tent camps before she decided to return - and the sight brought her to tears.

Her entire neighborhood had been destroyed, her former home and the roads leading to it lost in a sea of rubble.

""I didn't recognize it,"" she said. ""I couldn't tell where people's homes were.""

Around 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced by the war, often multiple times, according to U.N. estimates. Hundreds of thousands have crowded into sprawling tent camps near the coast with no electricity, running water or toilets. Hunger is widespread.

Hejjo lived in a tent in the courtyard of a hospital. Before that, she was in Muwasi, the main tent camp in southern Gaza.

""It smelled bad,"" she said. ""There were diseases spreading.""

She said her husband, who was suffering from liver disease, was broken-hearted when he heard their home had been destroyed and he died shortly thereafter.

She was among the first to return after Israeli forces withdrew in April. Her neighbors stayed away, fearful they would find bodies or unexploded bombs.

But for her it was still home.

""It is better to live in my home, where I lived for 37 years, even though it is destroyed,"" she said.

Hejjo and her children dug through the rubble with shovels and their bare hands, going brick by brick and saving whatever could be reused. Torn clothes were used to feed cooking fires.

Rats had crept in, and swarms of mosquitoes hovered over the ruins. There was broken glass everywhere. They set up a tent fortified by corrugated metal sheeting and some bricks salvaged from her destroyed home. A light drizzle wet their clothes as they slept.

U.N. agencies say unemployment has soared to around 80% -- up from nearly 50% before the war -- and that almost the entire population is living in poverty. Even those with means would find it nearly impossible to import construction materials because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order.

The first obstacle to any significant rebuilding is the rubble - mountains of it.

Where houses, shops and office buildings once stood, there are now giant drifts of rubble laced with human remains, hazardous substances and unexploded munitions.

The U.N. estimates the war has left some 40 million tons of debris and rubble in Gaza, enough to fill New York's Central Park to a depth of eight meters (about 25 feet). It could take up to 15 years and nearly $650 million to clear it all away, it said.

There's also the question of where to dispose of it: The U.N. estimates about five square kilometers (about two square miles) of land would be needed, which will be hard to come by in the small and densely populated territory.

It isn't just homes that were destroyed, but also critical infrastructure.

The U.N. estimates nearly 70% of Gaza's water and sanitation plants have been destroyed or damaged. That includes all five of the territory's wastewater treatment facilities, plus desalination plants, sewage pumping stations, wells and reservoirs.

The employees who once managed municipal water and waste systems have been displaced, and some killed. And fuel shortages have made it difficult to keep operating facilities that are still intact.

The international charity Oxfam said it applied in December for a permit to bring in desalination units, and pipes to repair water infrastructure. It took three months for Israel to approve the shipment, but it still has not entered Gaza, Oxfam said.

The destruction of sewage networks has left streets flooded with putrid water, hastening the spread of disease.

There has been no central power in Gaza since the opening days of the war, when its sole power plant was forced to shut down for lack of fuel, and more than half of the territory's electrical grid has been destroyed, according to the World Bank.

Wealthy Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they are only willing to contribute to Gaza's reconstruction as part of a postwar settlement that creates a path to a Palestinian state.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled that out, saying he won't allow Hamas or even the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza. He has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control and delegate civilian affairs to local Palestinians. But none are known to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened to kill anyone who aids the occupation.

Rebuilding Gaza would also require the import of massive amounts of construction supplies and heavy equipment, which Israel is unlikely to allow as long as there's a potential for Hamas to rebuild its militant infrastructure. In any case, Gaza has only a small number of crossings with limited capacity.

The Israeli military body that coordinates civilian affairs in Gaza says it does not restrict the entry of civilian supplies and allows so-called dual-use items that could also be used for military purposes. Israel allowed some construction materials in before the war under what was known as the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism, but it was subject to heavy restrictions and delays.

The Shelter Cluster estimates that it would take 40 years to rebuild all of Gaza's destroyed homes under that setup.

For now, aid providers are struggling just to bring in enough basic tents because of the limited number of trucks going into Gaza and the challenges of delivering aid. Efforts to bring in more robust temporary housing are still in the early stages, and no one has even tried to bring in construction materials, according to Ely.

In September, the Shelter Cluster estimated 900,000 people were still in need of tents, bedding and other items to prepare for the region's typically cold and rainy winters."
US spends a record $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel since last Oct. 7,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-us-military-spending-8e6e5033f7a1334bf6e35f86e7040e14,2024-10-07T04:14:59Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The United States has spent a record of at least $17.9 billion on military aid to Israel since the war in Gaza began and led to escalating conflict around the Middle East, according to a report for Brown University's Costs of War project, released on the anniversary of Hamas' attacks on Israel.

An additional $4.86 billion has gone into stepped-up U.S. military operations in the region since the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks, researchers said in findings first provided to The Associated Press. That includes the costs of a Navy-led campaign to quell strikes on commercial shipping by Yemen's Houthis, who are carrying them out in solidarity with the fellow Iranian-backed group Hamas.

The report -- completed before Israel opened a second front, this one against Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants in Lebanon, in late September -- is one of the first tallies of estimated U.S. costs as the Biden administration backs Israel in its conflicts in Gaza and Lebanon and seeks to contain hostilities by Iran-allied armed groups in the region.

The financial toll is on top of the cost in human lives: Hamas militants killed more than 1,200 people in Israel a year ago and took others hostage. Israel's retaliatory offensive has killed nearly 42,000 people in Gaza, according to the territory's Health Ministry, which does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.

At least 1,400 people in Lebanon, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed since Israel greatly expanded its strikes in that country in late September.

The financial costs were calculated by Linda J. Bilmes, a professor at Harvard's John F. Kennedy School of Government, who has assessed the full costs of U.S. wars since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, and fellow researchers William D. Hartung and Stephen Semler.

Here's a look at where some of the U.S. taxpayer money went:

Israel -- a protege of the United States since its 1948 founding -- is the biggest recipient of U.S. military aid in history, getting $251.2 billion in inflation-adjusted dollars since 1959, the report says.

Even so, the $17.9 billion spent since Oct. 7, 2023, in inflation-adjusted dollars, is by far the most military aid sent to Israel in one year. The U.S. committed to providing billions in military assistance to Israel and Egypt each year when they signed their 1979 U.S.-brokered peace treaty, and an agreement since the Obama administration set the annual amount for Israel at $3.8 billion through 2028.

The U.S. aid since the Gaza war started includes military financing, arms sales, at least $4.4 billion in drawdowns from U.S. stockpiles and hand-me-downs of used equipment.

Much of the U.S. weapons delivered in the year were munitions, from artillery shells to 2,000-pound bunker-busters and precision-guided bombs.

Expenditures range from $4 billion to replenish Israel's Iron Dome and David's Sling missile defense systems to cash for rifles and jet fuel, the study says.

Unlike the United States' publicly documented military aid to Ukraine, it was impossible to get the full details of what the U.S. has shipped Israel since last Oct. 7, so the $17.9 billion for the year is a partial figure, the researchers said.

They cited Biden administration ""efforts to hide the full amounts of aid and types of systems through bureaucratic maneuvering.""

Funding for the key U.S. ally during a war that has exacted a heavy toll on civilians has divided Americans during the presidential campaign. But support for Israel has long carried weight in U.S. politics, and Biden said Friday that ""no administration has helped Israel more than I have.""

The Biden administration has bolstered its military strength in the region since the war in Gaza started, aiming to deter and respond to any attacks on Israeli and American forces.

Those additional operations cost at least $4.86 billion, the report said, not including beefed-up U.S. military aid to Egypt and other partners in the region.

The U.S. had 34,000 forces in the Middle East the day that Hamas broke through Israeli barricades around Gaza to attack. That number rose to about 50,000 in August when two aircraft carriers were in the region, aiming to discourage retaliation after a strike attributed to Israel killed Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran. The total is now around 43,000.

The number of U.S. vessels and aircraft deployed -- aircraft carrier strike groups, an amphibious ready group, fighter squadrons, and air defense batteries -- in the Mediterranean, Red Sea and Gulf of Aden has varied during the year.

The Pentagon has said another aircraft carrier strike group is headed to Europe very soon and that could increase the troop total again if two carriers are again in the region at the same time.

The U.S. military has deployed since the start of the war to try to counter escalated strikes by the Houthis, an armed faction that controls Yemen's capital and northern areas, and has been firing on merchant ships in the Red Sea in solidarity with Gaza. The researchers called the $4.86 billion cost to the U.S. an ""unexpectedly complicated and asymmetrically expensive challenge.""

Houthis have kept launching attacks on ships traversing the critical trade route, drawing U.S. strikes on launch sites and other targets. The campaign has become the most intense running sea battle the Navy has faced since World War II.

""The U.S. has deployed multiple aircraft carriers, destroyers, cruisers and expensive multimillion-dollar missiles against cheap Iranian-made Houthi drones that cost $2,000,"" the authors said.

Just Friday, the U.S. military struck more than a dozen Houthi targets in Yemen, going after weapons systems, bases and other equipment, officials said.

The researchers' calculations included at least $55 million in additional combat pay from the intensified operations in the region."
"Israelis, scarred and battling on multiple fronts, mark a year since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-one-year-anniversary-cf123f95609051e8e8eaf6aebe661b6a,2024-10-07T04:07:59Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Israelis were holding vigils and somber ceremonies on Monday to mark a year since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack, the deadliest in the country's history, which sparked the war in Gaza and scarred Israelis indelibly.

The surprise cross-border attack, which caught Israel unprepared on a major Jewish holiday, shattered Israelis' sense of security and shook their faith in their leaders and their military.

Its aftershocks still ripple one year later. The war in Gaza rages on, Israel is fighting a new war against Hezbollah, which began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, and an escalating conflict with Iran -- which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah -- threatens to drag the region into a far more dangerous conflagration.

In Gaza, which is still buckling under the weight of the ongoing war, no formal commemorative event is planned. The massive destruction and displacement are a constant reminder of the retaliatory Israeli assault on the territory, which has no end in sight.

Israelis were expected to flock to ceremonies, cemeteries and memorial sites around the country, remembering the hundreds of victims, the dozens of hostages still in captivity and the soldiers wounded or killed trying to save them.

At 6:30 a.m. -- the exact hour Hamas launched its attack -- the families of those killed at the Nova music festival were gathering at the site where almost 400 revelers were gunned down and from where many others were taken hostage.

At that same time, the families of hostages still held in Gaza -- about 100, a third of whom are said to be dead -- were gathering outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence to stand during a two-minute siren, replicating a custom from the the most solemn dates on the Israeli calendar, Holocaust Remembrance and Memorial Day.

An official state ceremony focusing on acts of bravery and hope is set to be aired on Monday evening. The ceremony was prerecorded without an audience -- apparently to avoid potential disruptions -- in the southern city of Ofakim, where over two dozen Israelis were killed.

But anger at the government's failure to prevent the attack and enduring frustration that it has not returned the remaining hostages prompted the families of those killed and taken captive to hold a separate event in Tel Aviv.

That event had been set to draw tens of thousands of people but was scaled back drastically over prohibitions on large gatherings due to the threat of missile attacks from Iran and Hezbollah.

Hamas' attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and dragged some 250 into Gaza as hostages, continues to cast a shadow over daily life in Israel. Dozens of hostages remain in captivity, with no end in sight to their struggle. Border communities have been upended and tens of thousands were displaced. Soldiers are being killed in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel faces ongoing international criticism over its wartime conduct, with two world courts examining its actions.

The war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, displaced most of the territory's 2.3 million population and sparked a humanitarian crisis that has led to widespread hunger. It has also left the tiny coastal enclave ravaged beyond recognition as U.S.-led cease-fire efforts have repeatedly sputtered."

""It's really a shame that we're putting politics ahead of helping people, and that's what we're here to do. We have had the complete support of the state,"" she said, referring to North Carolina.

Republicans, led by the former president, have helped foster a frenzy of misinformation over the past week among the communities most devastated by Helene, promoting a number of false claims, including that Washington is intentionally withholding aid to people in Republican areas.

Trump accused FEMA of spending all its money to help immigrants who are in the United States illegally, while other critics assert that the government spends too much on Israel, Ukraine and other foreign countries.

""FEMA absolutely has enough money for Helene response right now,"" Keith Turi, acting director of FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery said. He noted that Congress recently replenished the agency with $20 billion, and about $8 billion of that is set aside for recovery from previous storms and mitigation projects.

There also are outlandish theories that include warnings from far-right extremist groups that officials plan to bulldoze storm-damaged communities and seize the land from residents. A falsehood pushed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., asserts that Washington used weather control technology to steer Helene toward Republican voters in order to tilt the presidential election toward Democrat Kamala Harris.

Criswell said on ABC's ""This Week"" that such baseless claims around the response to Helene, which caused catastrophic damage from Florida into the Appalachian mountains and a death toll that rose Sunday to at least 230, have created a sense of fear and mistrust from residents against the thousands of FEMA employees and volunteers on the ground.

""We've had the local officials helping to push back on this dangerous -- truly dangerous narrative that is creating this fear of trying to reach out and help us or to register for help,"" she said.

President Joe Biden said in a statement Sunday that his administration ""will continue working hand-in-hand with local and state leaders -- regardless of political party and no matter how long it takes.""

Meantime, FEMA is preparing for Hurricane Milton, which rapidly intensified into a Category 1 storm on Sunday as it heads toward Florida.

""We're working with the state there to understand what their requirements are going to be, so we can have those in place before it makes landfall,"" she said."
Minnesota man arrested after allegedly threatening to 'shoot up' synagogue,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/minneapolis-synagogue-shooting-threat-da711840fadd4c40377d20434af0bbf3,2024-10-06T17:24:54Z,"MINNEAPOLIS (AP) -- A Minnesota man was arrested after allegedly threatening to ""shoot up"" a Minneapolis synagogue, officials announced on Saturday.

Staff at Temple Israel reported to the Minneapolis Police Department on Sept. 11 that they had received several phone calls from a person threatening to ""shoot up"" the synagogue. Then on Thursday, a special police detail assigned provide extra patrols around Temple Israel ahead of the Jewish new year and the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel were notified of a man outside with a firearm. He fled the area, but officers arrested a 21-year-old man the next day.

""Everyone in Minneapolis has the right to feel safe in their communities, and we will ensure our Jewish neighbors are protected as they celebrate the holy days,"" Minneapolis Police Chief Brian Chief O'Hara said at a news conference. ""We take all threats made against our religious institutions seriously, and will continue to hold the individuals accountable who threaten any of our city's houses of worship.""

O'Hara said officers learned the man had used a phone app to mask his voice as he made repeated threats against the synagogue.

Officers did not recover a gun.

The man was arrested for making ""terroristic threats"" and charges will be referred to the Hennepin County Attorney's Office. O'Hara said officers had not found evidence the threat was motivated by antisemitism, but he said the timing of the threats was concerning.

""Since the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks, the worst terrorist attack on our Jewish community since the Holocaust, our police officers have been present where a whole lot of hateful rhetoric has been said against our residents, against members of our community, simply because they are Jewish,"" O'Hara said."
Walz says he'll 'own up' when he misspeaks as the Democratic ticket steps up media interviews,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/walz-harris-media-interview-presidential-campaign-83325184cd7f93ca505df590f7a27ede,2024-10-06T16:08:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a week after verbal stumbles in the only vice presidential debate, Democrat Tim Walz used his debut campaign appearance on a Sunday news show to try to fend off criticism of his stand on abortion rights and ""own up"" to past misstatements.

The interview on ""Fox News Sunday"" reflected a broader media blitz by presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate as the Democrats seek to garner public attention in the final 30 days of the campaign against Republicans Donald Trump and JD Vance.

Harris has taped an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air Monday night. She is booked Tuesday on Howard Stern's satellite radio show, ABC's ""The View"" and ""The Late Show"" with Stephen Colbert on CBS. Her interview on the podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" is scheduled to be released later Sunday. Walz will be on Jimmy Kimmel's ABC show on Monday.

Walz's Fox appearance also touched on the turmoil in the Middle East, with anchor Shannon Bream pressing the Minnesota governor on whether Israel has a right to preemptively attack Iran's nuclear and oil facilities in response to Tehran's firing of missiles against Israel. It was a question that Walz did not fully answer during his debate this past week with Vance, an Ohio senator.

Walz said Sunday that ""specific operations will be dealt with at the time."" He said Israel has a right to defend itself and that Harris worked with Israel this past week to repel the Iranian attack. President Joe Biden said last week he would not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran's nuclear program.

Walz defended a law that he signed as governor to ensure abortion protections, saying it ""puts this puts the decision with the woman and her health care providers."" He questioned the statement by Trump that he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

On the economy, Walz said Harris' proposals would make life more affordable for the middle class by helping with the construction of 3 million new homes and expanding tax credits for parents. He said tariffs floated by Trump could increase costs by an estimated $4,000 a year on a typical family.

Walz also faced questions in the interview about misstatements pertaining to his military service, drunken driving arrest, infertility treatment for his family and claims to have been in Hong Kong before the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China.

""I will own up when I misspeak,"" Walz said.

He said he believes voters are more concerned by the fact that Vance could not acknowledge during their debate that Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden and that there could restrictions on the infertility treatment of intrauterine insemination that his wife, Gwen, received.

""I think they're probably far more concerned with that than my wife and I used IUI to have our child and that Donald Trump would restrict that,"" Walz said. ""So I think folks know who I am.""

Bream noted that Trump has come out in support of fertility treatments, even as he has said that abortion questions should be decided by states."
Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli crowds rally across the world on the eve of Oct. 7 anniversary,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-gaza-war-protests-memorial-hostages-d1e8c03e14c28c64afa3fffe086c3e8f,2024-10-06T14:09:42Z,"PARIS (AP) -- Crowds were participating in pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protests and memorial events across the world on Sunday on the eve of the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel.

Sunday's events follow massive rallies that took place Saturday in several European cities, including London, Berlin, Paris and Rome. Other events are scheduled through the week, with an expected peak on Monday, the date of the anniversary.

In Australia, thousands of people on Sunday protested in support of Palestinians and Lebanon in various cities, while a pro-Israeli rally also took place in Melbourne.

Samantha Gazal, who came to the rally in Sydnay, said she was there ""because I can't believe our government is giving impunity to a violent extremist nation and has done nothing. ... We're watching the violence play out on livestream, and they're doing nothing.""

In Melbourne, supporters of Israel held up posters showing Israeli hostages who are still missing.

""We feel like we didn't do anything to deserve this,"" said Jeremy Wenstein, one of the participants. ""We're just supporting our brothers and sisters who are fighting a war that they didn't invite.""

At a rally in Berlin, near the Brandenburg Gate, hundreds of pro-Israeli demonstrators set off up the famed Unter den Linden behind a banner that read ""Against all antisemitism,"" accompanied by a police escort.

With many Israel flags waving over head, some Jewish leaders led a song about ""shalom"" -- peace -- while marchers chanted ""Free Gaza from Hamas!"" and ""Bring them home,"" referring to hostages still held in the Gaza strip.

Some in the crowd held up photos of hostages still held by Hamas. Photos of several women featured the word ""Kidnapped"" in German.

Memorial events organized by the Jewish community for those killed in the Oct. 7 attack and prayers for those still in captivity were also to be held in Paris and London on Sunday afternoon.

Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that some of the protests could turn violent.

On Sunday, Italy's Premier Giorgia Meloni expressed her ""full solidarity"" with police, the day after after security forces used tear gas and water cannons to disperse violent demonstrators in Rome.

Meloni firmly condemned clashes between a few pro-Palestinian demonstrators and law enforcement officers, saying it was ""intolerable that dozens of officers are injured during a demonstration.""

Thirty police officers and four protesters were hurt in clashes at the pro-Palestinian march in Rome Saturday, local media said. In Rome's central Piazzale Ostiense, hooded protesters threw stones, bottles and even a street sign at the police, who responded using water cannons and tear gas.

Pope Francis, celebrating his Sunday Angelus prayer from the Vatican, issued a new appeal for peace ""on every front."" Francis also urged his audience not to forget the many hostages still held in Gaza, asking for ""their immediate liberation.""

The pope called for a day of prayer and fasting on Monday, the first anniversary of the attack.

On Oct. 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.

More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. It says more than half were women and children.

Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks -- missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings -- as the region braces for further escalation.

In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which holds much of the power in parts of southern Lebanon and some other areas of the country, attacking the militants with exploding pagers, airstrikes and, eventually, incursions into Lebanon."
Middle East latest: Israel strikes Gaza and southern Beirut as attacks intensify,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-6-october-2024-19e665a4546e92d006d63a3073219513,2024-10-06T09:51:06Z,"An Israeli airstrike hit a mosque in central Gaza and Palestinian officials said at least 19 people were killed early Sunday. Israeli planes also lit up the skyline across the southern suburbs of Beirut, striking what the military said were Hezbollah targets.

The strike in Gaza hit a mosque where displaced people were sheltering near the main hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah. Another four people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering displaced people near the town.

The Israeli military said both strikes targeted militants, without providing evidence.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead from the strike on the mosque were all men, while another man was wounded.

In Beirut, the strikes reportedly targeted a building near a road leading to Lebanon's only international airport and another formerly used by the Hezbollah-run broadcaster Al-Manar.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. As the Israel-Hamas war reaches the one-year mark, nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials.

Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in the latest conflict, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

Here is the latest:

BEIRUT -- The southern suburbs of Beirut were hit by more than 30 strikes overnight, the heaviest bombardment since Sept. 23, when Israel began a significant escalation in its air campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported Sunday.

The targets included a gas station on the main highway leading to the Beirut airport and a warehouse for medical supplies, the agency said.

Some of the overnight strikes set off a long series of explosions, suggesting that ammunition stores may have been hit.

PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron called for ""a halt to arms exports for use in Gaza,"" saying it's urgent to avoid escalating tensions in the region, his office said.

Macron drew strong criticism from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by saying ""the priority is ... that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza."" He made the comments in an interview with France Inter radio, which was recorded on Tuesday and aired Saturday.

France doesn't deliver any weapons to Israel, Macron said.

Netanyahu released a video statement in which he called out the French president by name and referred to such calls as a ""disgrace.""

In a statement, Macron's office said ""France is Israel's unfailing friend. Mr. Netanyahu's words are excessive and irrelevant to the friendship between France and Israel.""

""We must return to diplomatic solutions,"" it added.

The statement also said that Macron had demonstrated his commitment to Israel's security when France mobilized its military resources in response to the Iranian attack. French authorities did not provided details about France's role.

Macron has called for an immediate cease-fire in both Gaza and Lebanon.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An apparent Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed at least 18 people in central Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said.

The strike hit a mosque sheltering displaced people near the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah, the hospital said in a statement.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead were all men. Another two men were critically wounded, the hospital said.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment about the strike on the mosque.

The latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is now nearing 42,000 according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but many of the dead were women and children.

BEIRUT -- Powerful new explosions rocked Beirut's southern suburbs late Saturday as Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon, also striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in the north for the first time as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters.

Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza.

The strong explosions began near midnight after Israel's military urged residents to evacuate areas in Beirut's Haret Hreik and Choueifat neighborhoods. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. They followed a day of sporadic strikes and the nearly continuous buzz of reconnaissance drones.

Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory."
A year of fleeing across Gaza,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/a-year-of-fleeing-across-gaza-000001925701d383a5925f8f807f0000,2024-10-06T08:00:35Z,"Ne'man Abu Jarad sat on a tarp on the ground. Around him, canvas sheets hung from cords, forming the walls of his tent. For the past year, Ne'man; his wife, Majida; and their six daughters have trekked the length of the Gaza Strip, trying to survive as Israeli forces wreaked destruction around them.

It's a far cry from their house in northern Gaza -- a place of comforting routine, of love, affection and safety. A place where loved ones gathered around the kitchen table or on the roof on summer evenings amid the scent of roses and jasmine flowers.

""Your house is your homeland. Everything good in our life was the home,"" Ne'man said. ""Everything in it, whether physical or intangible -- family, neighbors, my siblings who were all around me.

They did exactly as the Israelis ordered in the devastating weeks and months of war that followed. They obeyed evacuation calls. They moved where the military told them to move. Seven times they fled, and each time, their lives became more unrecognizable to them, crowding with strangers in a school classroom, searching for water in a vast tent camp or sleeping on the street.

The Associated Press traced the family's journey as they were driven from their home. Israel's campaign has displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza - 1.9 million of its 2.3 million Palestinians -- and killed more than 41,600 people. Like the Abu Jarads, most families have been uprooted multiple times.

For this family, the journey has taken them from a comfortable middle-class life to ruin.

Living at the northernmost end of Gaza, most days before the war in Beit Hanoun were simple. Ne'man headed out each morning to work as a taxi driver. Majida got their daughters off to school. Their youngest, Lana, had started first grade. Hoda, the 18-year-old, was in her first year at university. The eldest, Balsam, just had her first baby.

Majida spent much of her day doing housework -- her face lights up when she talks about her kitchen, the center of family life.

Ne'man had planted the garden with a grapevine and covered the roof with potted flowers. Watering them in the evenings was a soothing ritual. Then, the family and neighbors would sit on the front stoop or the roof to chat.

""The area would always smell nice,"" he said. ""People would say we have perfume because of how beautiful the flowers are.""

On the morning of Oct. 7, the family heard Hamas rockets firing and news of the militants' attack into southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped. The Abu Jarads knew that the Israeli response would be swift and that their house, only about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the border fence with Israel, would be on the front line.

By 9 a.m., Ne'man and Majida, their six daughters, and Ne'man's sister packed up what they could and fled, as the Israeli military issued one of its first evacuation orders.

""It makes no sense to be stubborn and stay,"" Majida said. ""It is not about one person. I am part of a family and have girls.""

Like many, the family tried, at first, to stay close to home. They went to stay with Majida's parents, nearby in the town of Beit Lahiya.

""The place was very comfortable, to be honest. I felt like I was at home,"" Majida said. ""But we were living in fear and terror.""

Already, Beit Lahiya was being heavily bombarded. Over the six days they were there, at least nine Israeli strikes hit the town, killing dozens, according to the conflict monitor Airwars. Entire families were killed or wounded under the rubble of their homes.

As the explosions got closer, shrapnel pierced water tanks at Majida's parents' home. Windows shattered as the family huddled inside.

The building and its grounds were packed with thousands of people. All around northern Gaza, families took refuge in hospitals, hoping they'd be safe.

The family found a small space on the floor, barely enough room to spread their blanket amid the frantic medical staff struggling with the wounded.

It was a black night and there were strikes, Majida remembers.

The day after they arrived, a strike smashed into a house a few hundred meters away, killing a prominent doctor and some two dozen members of his family, many of them children.

The Israeli military ordered all civilians to leave northern Gaza, setting in motion a wave of hundreds of thousands of people heading south across Wadi Gaza, the stream and wetlands that divide the north from the rest of the strip.

The family joined the exodus.

The family walked 10 kilometers (6 miles) until they reached the U.N.-run Girls' Preparatory School in the Nuseirat refugee camp.

Every classroom and corridor was packed with families from the north. Majida, the daughters and Ne'man's sister found a tiny space in a classroom already housing more than 100 women and children. For privacy in the cramped conditions, Ne'man moved in with the men in tents outside, in the schoolyard.

This was their home for more than 10 weeks. Majida and the girls slept curled up on the floor, without enough space even to extend their legs. As winter set in, there weren't enough blankets.

The bathrooms were the worst part, Majida said. Only a few toilets served thousands of people. Getting a shower was a miracle, she said. People went weeks unable to bathe. Skin diseases ran rampant.

Every day, the daughters went at dawn to wait in line at the few bakeries still working and came back in the afternoon, sometimes with only one flatbread. One day, Ne'man and his daughters walked 5 kilometers (3 miles) to the town of Deir al-Balah, looking for drinkable water.

""If it wasn't for the kind people in Deir al-Balah who took pity on us and gave us half a gallon, we could have returned with nothing,"" Ne'man said.

As strikes continued, the family decided to go as far as possible, trekking 20 kilometers (12 miles) to Rafah, at Gaza's southernmost end.

The Abu Jarads weren't the only ones: As Israeli evacuation orders ate away at more and more of Gaza, nearly half of the population crammed into Rafah.

Here, the family had their first taste of living in a tent.

They set up amid the massive sprawl of tens of thousands of tents on Rafah's outskirts, near U.N. aid warehouses known as ""the barracks.""

""In the winter, it was hell, water drenched us,"" Majida said. ""We slept on the ground, nothing under us, and no covers.""

They had no money to buy food in the markets, where prices soared. The youngest girls got sick with colds and diarrhea, and there was no nearby pharmacy to buy medicine. The family survived completely off U.N. handouts of flour and other basics.

""To buy one tomato or cucumber and find it in the tent was like a dream,"" Ne'man said.

Like so many others, they'd believed Rafah was the last safe place in Gaza.

It was not.

In the first week of May, Israel ordered the evacuation of all of Rafah. Then its troops pushed into the city. Bombardment intensified.

Ne'man and Majida tried to stay as long as possible. But an airstrike hit nearby, he said, killing four of Ne'man's cousins and a young girl.

Palestinians who'd packed into Rafah -- more than 1 million -- all streamed out again, fleeing the Israeli offensive.

They scattered across southern and central Gaza. New tent cities filled beaches, fields, empty lots, schoolyards, cemeteries, even dumpsites - any open space.

The Abu Jarads moved by foot and donkey cart until they reached a former amusement park known as Asdaa City. Now its Ferris wheel stood above a landscape of tents stretching as far as the eye could see.

Here, in Muwasi, a barren area of dunes and fields along the coast, Israel had declared a ""humanitarian zone"" - though there was little aid, food or water.

Every amenity once taken for granted was a distant memory. Now the kitchen was a pile of sticks for kindling and two rocks for setting a pot over the fire. No shower, only the occasional bucket of water. Soap was too expensive. Only a draped sheet separated them from their neighbors. Everything was filthy and sandy. Large spiders, cockroaches and other insects crept into the tent.

A raid by Israeli troops less than a kilometer (half-mile) away forced Majida and Ne'man to uproot their family once more. They headed toward the Mediterranean coast, not knowing where they'd stay.

Fortunately, they said, they found some acquaintances.

""God bless them, they opened their tent for us and let us live with them for 10 days,"" Ne'man said.

When they returned to Muwasi, the Abu Jarads found their tent had been robbed - their food and clothes, all gone.

Since then, the weeks blur together. The family finds survival itself loses meaning in a conflict that seems to have no end.

Food has become even harder to find as supplies entering Gaza drop to their lowest levels of the war.

Israeli drones buzz overhead constantly. The mental strain wears on everyone.

One day, Ne'man said, his youngest daughter, Lana, told him, ""You stopped loving me. Because now when I come near you, you say you are fed up and tell me to stay away.""

He kept telling her, ""No, darling, I love you. I just can't bear it all.""

They all dream of home. Ne'man said he learned that his brother's house next door was destroyed in a strike, and his own home was damaged. He wonders about his flowers. He hopes they survived -- even if the house is gone.

The difference between then and now, Majida said, is ""the difference between heaven and earth.""

Far from the warmth and affection of home, the Abu Jarads feel themselves surrendering to despair.

""We are jealous,"" Majida said. ""Jealous of who? Of the people who were killed. Because they found relief while we are still suffering, living horrors, torture and heartbreak.""

Lebanese worldwide fear for their homeland and loved ones as violence escalates,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-global-diaspora-violence-israel-hezbollah-12b4de400efafed84f665a0ea3045c9f,2024-10-06T05:36:19Z,"It was a year ago when Jomana Siddiqui visited Lebanon, where her father was born -- and is now buried. She planned to return there soon; this time, she thought, she would take her two teenage daughters.

Instead, Siddiqui, who lives in California, now worries about relatives there. As she watches from afar the violence and the recent escalation in Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Siddiqui thinks about the people she met during her visit, the kindness and generosity she encountered.

She thinks about her father's grave -- when, or if, she will get to visit it again. Her voice cracks with emotions. It's been gut-wrenching, she said.

""It's like the universal story of the Lebanese people,"" she said. ""They have to keep leaving and not knowing when they can come back.""

From the United States to South Africa, Cyprus, Brazil and beyond, many members of Lebanon's far-flung and large diaspora are contending with the ripples of the violence -- grieving, gripped by fear for loved ones and for their homeland, trying to find ways to help.

Some 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians and fighters of the militant group Hezbollah, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September, saying it aims to push Hezbollah away from the countries' shared border.

For Lina Kayat, who moved to South Africa almost 36 years ago but still has a big family in Lebanon, the violence and tensions there have echoes of earlier turbulent chapters.

""We lived through a civil war for a long time; I was like seven years old,"" she said. ""It feels like history repeating itself. ... It's the unknown of who is going to get killed next.""

Kayat, who lives in South Africa's coastal city of Durban, speaks daily to her family, including her mother and her sister.

""They are very scared and very worried about what is going to happen,"" she said.

Generations of Lebanese have grappled with whether to leave to seek better opportunities or escape various times of tumult -- from a 15-year-old civil war to military occupations, bombings and political assassinations -- or stay in a Lebanon that despite its numerous scars retains its allure for many. Lebanon -- home to multiple religious groups, including Christians and Sunni and Shiite Muslims -- takes pride in its large emigrant communities, which include successful businessmen and celebrities of Lebanese heritage.

The current military escalation unfolds amid fears that fighting could spread in the region and comes as the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza nears the grim one-year mark.

""It happening on top of Gaza is almost too much to bear,"" said James Zogby, president of the Washington D.C.-based Arab American Institute.

""It almost makes you physically ill just trying to fathom the extent of the trauma,"" added Zogby, whose father was born in Lebanon.

Already, Lebanon had been on edge and struggling under the weight of an economic meltdown, the fallout from a massive 2020 port explosion and other crises. It's been without a president for two years.

Against such a somber backdrop, Zogby wonders what will become of the displaced.

""Who's going to care for them? Where do the health services come from ... when the country is already as overstretched as it is and on the verge of collapse?"" he said. ""At what point does it finally collapse? And who will care?""

Fueling the pain, he said, is his anger at the U.S. response to the devastation in Gaza and now the escalation in Lebanon.

""There's a sense of powerlessness, a sense of almost despair that, you know, it can get out of control. And as long as nothing here happens to restrain it, it will get worse.""

Akram Khater, director of the Khayrallah Center for Lebanese Diaspora Studies at North Carolina State University, said that since the earliest diaspora, Lebanese who left have been contributing heavily to the economic well-being of Lebanon, sending large amounts of remittances.

Watching the escalation in Lebanon, where he was born and raised, has been re-traumatizing, he said.

""I find myself amidst a swirl of emotions that are unresolved and that derive from this recurring nightmare,"" he said. ""Yet, even amidst this our community comes together to create solidarity and provide solace and comfort for each other.""

Recently, hundreds of Lebanese flags filled the night sky in Dearborn, Michigan, as some attended a rally to support Lebanon and protest the Israeli offensive there.

At Sao Paulo's international airport, two Lebanese brothers who've been living in Brazil, recently had a solemn reunion. They said eight of their loved ones -- their sister, brother-in-law, four of their nephews and two of their nephews' children -- were killed in Lebanon in one of the attacks.

Hussein Zeineddine, one of the brothers, had been on vacation with his family in southern Lebanon when the area was hit by Israeli attacks, he told The Associated Press. He and his family moved to a safer location until they could book flights back to Brazil. ""My wife was crying and asking us to leave. We left just with basic items. And then, shortly after, my sister's house was bombed,"" he said after his arrival.

""It will be tough here. But it will be tougher for people there,"" he said.

In Cyprus, Rosaline Ghoukassian said the overwhelming majority of Lebanese don't want this war. She relocated to Cyprus with her husband Raffi Garabedian and their daughter Maria after the 2020 ammonium nitrate explosion in Beirut's port that killed more than 200 people. She said she'd been disenchanted with Lebanon's political leadership and also lamented Hezbollah's influence.

""We knew this was coming,"" she said. ""The problem is in Lebanon. ... Because we don't have a good government.""

Their decision to leave Lebanon was never about money but safety, as their daughter explained in a letter she wrote in class in Cyprus: ""I don't want to go there because I was saved in the explosion, and I don't want to go live there because I don't want to die.""

The family chose to stay.

""I'm not here to make thousands of euros. No. I'm here just to live. To be happy, to be safe. This is what I want. To live,"" Garabedian said.

Hezbollah began firing into Israel the day after Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. Since then, Israel's military response in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials.

Back in California, Siddiqui said coping with it all has been challenging.

The strike hit a mosque sheltering displaced people near the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah, the hospital said in a statement.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead were all men. Another two men were critically wounded, the hospital said.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment about the strike on the mosque.

The latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is now nearing 42,000 according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but many of the dead were women and children."
"A year into the Israel-Hamas war, students say a chill on free speech has reached college classrooms",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-palestinians-campus-protest-anniversary-46faa669edb6b8bf1da6f670f6186bbc,2024-10-06T04:41:05Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a junior at George Washington University, Ty Lindia meets new students every day. But with the shadow of the Israel-Hamas war hanging over the Washington, D.C., campus, where everyone has a political opinion, each new encounter is fraught.

""This idea that I might say the wrong thing kind of scares me,"" said Lindia, who studies political science. ""You have to tiptoe around politics until one person says something that signifies they lean a certain way on the issue.""

He has seen friendships -- including some of his own -- end over views about the war. In public, he keeps his stance to himself for fear that future employers could hold it against him.

""Before Oct. 7, there wasn't really a big fear,"" said Lindia, of Morristown, New Jersey.

A year after Hamas' attack in southern Israel, some students say they are reluctant to speak out because it could pit them against their peers, professors or even potential employers. Social bubbles have cemented along the divisions of the war. New protest rules on many campuses raise the risk of suspension or expulsion.

Tensions over the conflict burst wide open last year amid emotional demonstrations in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. In the spring, a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments led to some 3,200 arrests.

The atmosphere on U.S. campuses has calmed since those protests, yet lingering unease remains.

In a recent class discussion on gender and the military at Indiana University, sophomore Mikayla Kaplan said she thought about mentioning her female friends who serve in the Israeli military. But in a room full of politically progressive classmates, she decided to stay quiet.

""In the back of my head, I'm always thinking about things that I should or shouldn't say,"" Kaplan said.

Kaplan, who proudly wears a Star of David necklace, said that before college she had many friends of different faiths, but after Oct. 7, almost all of her friends are Jewish.

The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding about 100 hostages. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

At the University of Connecticut, some students said the conflict doesn't come up as much in classes. Ahmad Zoghol, an engineering student, said it remains a tense issue and he has heard of potential employers scrutinizing political statements students make in college.

""There's definitely that concern for a lot of people, including myself, that if we speak about it there's going to be some sort of repercussion,"" he said.

Compared with the much larger campus protests of the Vietnam War era, when few students openly supported the war, campuses today appear more divided, said Mark Yudof, a former president of the University of California system. For many, the issues are more personal.

""The faculty are at odds with each other. The student body is at odds with each other. There's a war of ideologies going on,"" he said.

Some universities are trying to bridge the divide with campus events on civil discourse, sometimes inviting Palestinian and Jewish speakers to share the stage. At Harvard University in Massachusetts, a recent survey found that many students and professors are reluctant to share views in the classroom. A panel suggested solutions including ""classroom confidentiality"" and teaching on constructive disagreement.

Meanwhile, many campuses are adding policies that clamp down on protests, often banning encampments and limiting demonstrations to certain hours or locations.

At Indiana University, a new policy forbids ""expressive activity"" after 11 p.m, among other restrictions. Doctoral student Bryce Greene, who helped lead a pro-Palestinian encampment last semester, said he was threatened with suspension after organizing an 11:30 p.m. vigil.

That's a startling contrast to past protests on campus, including a 2019 climate demonstration that drew hundreds of students without university interference, he said.

""There's definitely a chilling effect that occurs when speech is being restricted in this manner,"" said Greene, who is part of a lawsuit challenging the new policy. ""This is just one way for them to restrict people from speaking out for Palestine.""

The tense atmosphere has led some faculty members to rethink teaching certain subjects or entering certain debates, said Risa Lieberwitz, general counsel for the American Association of University Professors.

Lieberwitz, who teaches labor law at Cornell University, has been alarmed by the growing number of colleges requiring students to register demonstrations days in advance.

""It's so contradictory to the notion of how protests and demonstrations take place,"" she said. ""They're oftentimes spontaneous. They're not planned in the way that events are generally planned.""

Protests have continued on many campuses, but on a smaller scale and often under the confines of new rules.

At Wesleyan University in Connecticut, police removed a group of pro-Palestinian students from a campus building where they held a sit-in in September. Wesleyan President Michael Roth said he supports students' free speech rights, but they ""don't have a right to take over part of a building.""

Wesleyan is offering new courses on civil disagreement this year, and faculty are working to help foster discussion among students.

""It's challenging for students, as it is for adults -- most adults don't have conversations with people who disagree with them,"" Roth said. ""We're so segregated into our bubbles.""

American universities pride themselves as being places of open discourse where students can engage across their differences. Since Oct. 7, they have been under tremendous pressure to uphold free speech while also protecting students from discrimination.

The U.S. Education Department is investigating more than 70 colleges for reports of antisemitism or Islamophobia. Leaders of several prestigious colleges have been called before Congress by Republicans who accuse them of being soft on antisemitism.

Yet finding the line where protected speech ends is as hard as ever. Leaders grapple with whether to allow chants seen by some as calls of support for Palestinians and by others as a threat against Jews. It's especially complicated at public universities, which are bound by the First Amendment, while private colleges have flexibility to impose wider speech limits.

At George Washington University, Lindia said the war comes up often in his classes but sometimes after a warming-up period -- in one class, discussion loosened after the professor realized most students shared similar views. Even walking to class, there is a visible reminder of the tension. Tall fencing now surrounds University Yard, the grassy space where police broke up a tent encampment in May.

""It's a place for free expression, and now it's just completely blocked off,"" he said.

Some students say moderate voices are getting lost.

Nivriti Agaram, a junior at George Washington, said she believes Israel has a right to defend itself but questions America's spending on the war. That opinion puts her at odds with more liberal students, who have called her a ""genocide enabler"" and worse, she said.

""It's very stifling,"" she said. ""I think there's a silent majority who aren't speaking.""

A year of blood and anguish: The Mideast war in AP photos,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-photo-gallery-dc81e4fa104fa821ed74bd40fd9e56f5,2024-10-06T04:11:49Z,"A year after Hamas launched a cross-border attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7, the images of that day and its ongoing aftermath still defy belief.

No one thought they would see heavily armed Hamas gunmen going door-to-door on quiet Israeli streets or storming a crowded music festival, mowing people down for hours with no soldiers in sight.

No one thought they would see entire neighborhoods in the Gaza Strip turned into rubble-strewn wastelands, with high-rises leveled, paved roads turned to dirt and people fleeing on foot with only what they could carry. Few thought it would last this long, or claim so many lives.

Hamas' surprise attack and the war it triggered in Gaza have brought unprecedented death, destruction and anguish to both Israelis and Palestinians. Its ripples across the Middle East have raised the specter of an even larger conflict.

Associated Press photographers have tried to capture its impact on ordinary people.

They have photographed Israelis returning to the scenes of the killings, mobilizing for war and protesting their country's wartime leadership and its failure to return scores of hostages.

They have been there as Palestinians dig for survivors after airstrikes and as the wounded are treated on the floors of overwhelmed hospitals. They have photographed people huddling in tents and crowding around aid stations, reaching with empty pots for desperately needed food,

They have followed Palestinians from one end of Gaza to another as they flee airstrikes and evacuation orders, often traveling by foot or donkey cart with only what they can carry.

And they have been to funerals -- too many funerals -- on both sides.

As with all wars, civilians have paid the heaviest price. Young Israelis were killed by the hundreds at the music festival. Grandparents in their 70s and 80s were dragged into Gaza and held in tunnels, where many perished. Airstrikes killed Palestinian children in front of their parents and left thousands of orphans -- some with no living relatives.

Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, drawing retaliatory strikes in a cycle of escalation that has steadily worsened. In recent weeks, Israeli warplanes have pounded large areas of Lebanon, killing Hezbollah's leader and several of his top commanders, as well as many civilians. Ground operations commenced last week.

The bombings have brought more giant plumes of smoke, more blackened craters where buildings once stood, more screaming ambulances and more people -- by the hundreds of thousands -- taking to the roads to flee the war's widening vortex.

Through it all, there have been some moments of joy, however fleeting.

There were happy homecomings -- on both sides -- last November after more than 100 hostages were freed in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

But a year on, everyone still seems to be trapped in the violent reality unleashed in the early hours of Oct. 7, with no end in sight."

A displaced family's year of fleeing across the devastated Gaza Strip,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-displacement-families-moving-161d9ad8d07e12b22bfd41c79d174c70,2024-10-06T04:03:24Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Ne'man Abu Jarad sat on a tarp on the ground. Around him, canvas sheets hung from cords, forming the walls of his tent. For the past year, Ne'man; his wife, Majida; and their six daughters have trekked the length of the Gaza Strip, trying to survive as Israeli forceswreaked destruction around them.

It's a far cry from their house in northern Gaza -- a place of comforting routine, of love, affection and safety. A place where loved ones gathered around the kitchen table or on the roof on summer evenings amid the scent of roses and jasmine flowers.

""Your house is your homeland. Everything good in our life was the home,"" Ne'man said. ""Everything in it, whether physical or intangible -- family, neighbors, my siblings who were all around me.

They did exactly as the Israelis ordered in the devastating weeks and months of war that followed. They obeyed evacuation calls. They moved where the military told them to move. Seven times they fled, and each time, their lives became more unrecognizable to them, crowding with strangers in a school classroom, searching for water in a vast tent camp or sleeping on the street.

The Associated Press traced the family's journey as they were driven from their home. Israel's campaign has displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza -- 1.9 million of its 2.3 million Palestinians -- and killed more than 41,600 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Like the Abu Jarads, most families have been uprooted multiple times.

For this family, the journey has taken them from a comfortable middle-class life to ruin.

Living at the northernmost end of Gaza, most days before the war in Beit Hanoun were simple. Ne'man headed out each morning to work as a taxi driver. Majida got their daughters off to school. Their youngest, Lana, had started first grade. Hoda, the 18-year-old, was in her first year at university. The eldest, Balsam, just had her first baby.

Majida spent much of her day doing housework -- her face lights up when she talks about her kitchen, the center of family life.

Ne'man had planted the garden with a grapevine and covered the roof with potted flowers. Watering them in the evenings was a soothing ritual. Then, the family and neighbors would sit on the front stoop or the roof to chat.

""The area would always smell nice,"" he said. ""People would say we have perfume because of how beautiful the flowers are.""

On the morning of Oct. 7, the family heard Hamas rockets firing and news of the militants' attack into southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped.

The Abu Jarads knew that the Israeli response would be swift and that their house, only about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the border fence with Israel, would be on the front line.

By 9 a.m., Ne'man and Majida, their six daughters, and Ne'man's sister packed up what they could and fled, as the Israeli military issued one of its first evacuation orders.

""It makes no sense to be stubborn and stay,"" Majida said. ""It is not about one person. I am part of a family and have girls.""

Like many, the family tried, at first, to stay close to home. They went to stay with Majida's parents, in Beit Lahiya about a kilometer (.6 miles) away.

""The place was very comfortable, to be honest. I felt like I was at home,"" Majida said. ""But we were living in fear and terror.""

Already, Beit Lahiya was being heavily bombarded. Over the six days they were there, at least nine Israeli strikes hit the town, killing dozens, according to the conflict monitor Airwars. Entire families were killed or wounded under the rubble of their homes.

As the explosions got closer, shrapnel pierced water tanks at Majida's parents' home. Windows shattered as the family huddled inside.

The building and its grounds were packed with thousands of people. All around northern Gaza, families took refuge in hospitals, hoping they'd be safe.

The family found a small space on the floor, barely enough room to spread their blanket amid the frantic medical staff struggling with the wounded.

It was a black night and there were strikes, Majida remembers. ""The martyrs and wounded were strewn on the floor,"" she said.

The day after they arrived, a strike smashed into a house a few hundred meters away, killing a prominent doctor and some two dozen members of his family, many of them children.

The Israeli military ordered all civilians to leave northern Gaza, setting in motion a wave of hundreds of thousands of people heading south across Wadi Gaza, the stream and wetlands that divide the north from the rest of the strip.

The family joined the exodus.

The family walked 10 kilometers (6 miles) until they reached the U.N.-run Girls' Preparatory School in the Nuseirat refugee camp.

Every classroom and corridor was packed with families from the north. Majida, the daughters and Ne'man's sister found a tiny space in a classroom already housing more than 100 women and children. For privacy in the cramped conditions, Ne'man moved in with the men in tents outside, in the schoolyard.

This was their home for more than 10 weeks. Majida and the girls slept curled up on the floor, without enough space even to extend their legs. As winter set in, there weren't enough blankets.

The bathrooms were the worst part, Majida said. Only a few toilets served thousands of people. Getting a shower was a miracle, she said. People went weeks unable to bathe. Skin diseases ran rampant.

Every day, the daughters went at dawn to wait in line at the few bakeries still working and came back in the afternoon, sometimes with only one flatbread. One day, Ne'man and his daughters walked 5 kilometers (3 miles) to the town of Deir al-Balah, looking for drinkable water.

""If it wasn't for the kind people in Deir al-Balah who took pity on us and gave us half a gallon, we could have returned with nothing,"" Ne'man said.

As strikes continued, the family decided to go as far as possible, trekking 20 kilometers (12 miles) to Rafah, at Gaza's southernmost end.

The Abu Jarads weren't the only ones: As Israeli evacuation orders ate away at more and more of Gaza, nearly half of the population crammed into Rafah.

Here, the family had their first taste of living in a tent.

They set up amid the massive sprawl of tens of thousands of tents on Rafah's outskirts, near U.N. aid warehouses known as ""the barracks.""

""In the winter, it was hell, water drenched us,"" Majida said. ""We slept on the ground, nothing under us, and no covers.""

They had no money to buy food in the markets, where prices soared. The youngest girls got sick with colds and diarrhea, and there was no nearby pharmacy to buy medicine. The family survived completely off U.N. handouts of flour and other basics.

""To buy one tomato or cucumber and find it in the tent was like a dream,"" Ne'man said.

Like so many others, they'd believed Rafah was the last safe place in Gaza.

It was not.

In the first week of May, Israel ordered the evacuation of all of Rafah. Then its troops pushed into the city. Bombardment intensified.

Ne'man and Majida tried to stay as long as possible. But an airstrike hit nearby, he said, killing four of Ne'man's cousins and a young girl.

Palestinians who'd packed into Rafah -- more than 1 million -- all streamed out again, fleeing the Israeli offensive.

They scattered across southern and central Gaza. New tent cities filled beaches, fields, empty lots, schoolyards, cemeteries, even dumpsites - any open space.

The Abu Jarads moved by foot and donkey cart until they reached a former amusement park known as Asdaa City. Now its Ferris wheel stood above a landscape of tents stretching as far as the eye could see.

Here, in Muwasi, a barren area of dunes and fields along the coast, Israel had declared a ""humanitarian zone"" - though there was little aid, food or water.

Every amenity once taken for granted was a distant memory. Now the kitchen was a pile of sticks for kindling and two rocks for setting a pot over the fire. No shower, only the occasional bucket of water. Soap was too expensive. Only a draped sheet separated them from their neighbors. Everything was filthy and sandy. Large spiders, cockroaches and other insects crept into the tent.

Even the ""humanitarian zone"" was unsafe.

A raid by Israeli troops less than a kilometer (half-mile) away forced Majida and Ne'man to uproot their family once more. They headed toward the Mediterranean coast, not knowing where they'd stay.

Fortunately, they said, they found some acquaintances.

""God bless them, they opened their tent for us and let us live with them for 10 days,"" Ne'man said.

When they returned to Muwasi, the Abu Jarads found their tent had been robbed - their food and clothes, all gone.

Since then, the weeks blur together. The family finds survival itself loses meaning in a conflict that seems to have no end.

Food has become even harder to find as supplies entering Gaza drop to their lowest levels of the war.

Israeli drones buzz overhead constantly. The mental strain wears on everyone.

One day, Ne'man said, his youngest daughter, Lana, told him, ""You stopped loving me. Because now when I come near you, you say you are fed up and tell me to stay away.""

He kept telling her, ""No, darling, I love you. I just can't bear it all.""

They all dream of home. Ne'man said he learned that his brother's house next door was destroyed in a strike, and his own home was damaged. He wonders about his flowers. He hopes they survived -- even if the house is gone.

The difference between then and now, Majida said, is ""the difference between heaven and earth.""

Far from the warmth and affection of home, the Abu Jarads feel themselves surrendering to despair.

""We are jealous,"" Majida said. ""Jealous of who? Of the people who were killed. Because they found relief while we are still suffering, living horrors, torture and heartbreak.""

Mormon church leaders encourage civility as Trump and Harris rally religious voters,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mormon-voters-trump-harris-abortion-4b7d1b3fca00d341ba988d3390cfc3d5,2024-10-05T22:51:31Z,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- As both presidential campaigns have stepped up efforts to win over voters in western swing states who belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a top church official urged members on Saturday to ""avoid what is harsh and hateful"" in the heat of election season.

Dallin H. Oaks, the top adviser and likely successor to 100-year-old church president Russell M. Nelson, encouraged congregants at the faith's twice-annual general conference to steer clear of contention and be peacemakers in their communities one month out from the Nov. 5 election.

The devil is the father of contention, which can stir up anger and stall important policy changes, he told a room of 18,000 church members in Salt Lake City and thousands more watching on a livestream.

""As we pursue our preferred policies in public actions, let us qualify for his blessings by using the language and methods of peacemakers,"" said Oaks, the second-highest-ranking leader of the faith known widely as the Mormon church.

The faith's leaders strive to remain politically neutral. But they sometimes give general advice about how members should approach key elections. About 7 million of the faith's 17 million worldwide members live in the United States, many in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada, and in solidly red Utah and Idaho.

Latter-day Saints have been a reliably Republican voting bloc for decades, but many have half-heartedly embraced Donald Trump since his first run for the White House.

Some church members say the former president's demeaning rhetoric toward women, immigrants and refugees conflicts with their core values of humility, honesty and compassion. Others have raised concern about his felony convictions and his attempts to undermine the 2020 presidential election.

Vice President Kamala Harris is hoping to capitalize on her opponent's inability to lock down the Latter-day Saints vote. Her campaign formalized outreach efforts last month and enlisted prominent members of the faith to convince those in battleground Arizona, a state with nearly 450,000 church members, that Trump is not in alignment with the church's teachings.

Trump has also rallied influential church members at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida to help him convince swing voters that he will better protect their religious liberties.

Harris is unlikely to come close to winning a majority of Latter-day Saints. But by preventing Trump from running up big margins with a key demographic, she could tip the scales in Arizona and Nevada, which is home to upward of 180,000 Latter-day Saints.

One of Harris' greatest challenges is making her abortion policy palatable to members of a faith that has long opposed the procedure, with some exceptions.

It is a sticking point for Marilou Idos, a conference attendee from Herriman, Utah, who said she is not a fan of Trump's brash style but plans to vote for him because he opposes expanding abortion access. She also values Trump's support for Israel.

""He's the lesser of two evils,"" said Idos, 70. ""The basic things we believe in, Trump endorses. Abortion, that's kind of the main one, and the freedom to worship.""

The religion is also known for its belief in eternal families, tight-knit congregations and bans on alcohol, coffee, gambling and same-sex relationships.

Sammy Price, 38, of Las Vegas, said he is leaning toward voting for Harris because he thinks the nation needs her unifying rhetoric.

""Trump, he insults people, he makes people feel bad about who they are, and that's not something I think I can stand by,"" he said.

Undecided voters Jenna Winkel, 22, and her husband, Ben Winkel, 24, said just before the conference that they hoped church leaders would avoid addressing politics.

The couple from Draper, Utah, said there is room for a variety of political views under the Latter-day Saints umbrella. While Jenna said her religion doesn't really inform her politics, Ben said his does, but he wants to do more of his own research.

""The important thing about any general conference message is that it's general and then we're asked to take them and study them and apply them to our own lives, and maybe our politics,"" Jenna said. ""People will take what they need to hear from them and apply them in their lives."""
Health workers in Lebanon describe deadly Israeli attacks on colleagues and fear more,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-medics-hezbollah-hospitals-6c7f75c921c9deec0fa5c160ce639664,2024-10-05T20:59:45Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Israel's military struck outside the gates of a hospital in southern Lebanon without warning on Friday, killing seven paramedics and forcing the facility to close, the hospital director told The Associated Press a day after one of the most deadly attacks on health workers in the weeks since fighting escalated between Israel and Hezbollah.

The account of the Friday airstrikes that flung hospital doors off their hinges and shattered glass was the latest to detail attacks that Lebanon's health ministry says have killed dozens of health workers.

Marjayoun hospital director Mounes Kalakesh said that even before Friday's attack, ambulance crews in the area were so reluctant to operate that the facility had not received anyone wounded for days.

""We have not been able to work. There was fear and panic among the staff,"" he said.

Kalakesh said the government hospital didn't receive any warning from Israeli forces before the attack, even though nearby villages have received such warnings to evacuate.

Israel has not commented specifically on the incident. Friday's attack came hours before Israel's Arabic-language military spokesman accused the Hezbollah militant group, based in southern Lebanon, of using ambulances to transport weapons and fighters, and warned medical teams to stay clear of the group. The spokesman provided no evidence.

It is a charge that Lebanese officials and hospital directors, including Kalakesh, deny. Lebanon's health minister has accused Israel of committing ""a war crime"" by targeting medical teams and paramedics.

The health ministry on Thursday said 40 paramedics, firefighters and health care workers had been killed in Israeli attacks over three days, making it even more challenging to care for people wounded in the intense fighting.

The ministry has said more than 100 health workers have been killed in the year since the war in Gaza began and since Israel and Hezbollah stepped up exchanges of fire along the border.

The paramedics with the Islamic Health Committee are part of the coordinated health ministry response to crises in Lebanon. Other civil defense teams have expressed concern for their safety, with some saying they came under attack while clearly identified and operating in areas where they were transporting the wounded or putting out fires.

Israeli strikes have landed near the Marjayoun hospital before but never had come so close, Kalakesh said. He described the paramedics dying in their burning vehicles.

The 45-bed hospital is now shut down.

""I am responsible for this staff. I must protect them,"" Kalakesh said, explaining the decision to evacuate. At the time of the Friday attack, there were 30 staff in the hospital. His team was already exhausted after a year of working close to the front line.

Other groups have expressed concern.

A Lebanese Red Cross convoy, escorted by Lebanese troops and coordinated with the U.N. peacekeeping force in Lebanon, came under fire on Thursday. A Lebanese soldier was killed and four Red Cross volunteers were wounded.

Separately on Thursday, Israeli forces struck rescue teams with the Islamic Health Committee in Beirut's southern suburbs and the southern village of Odeissah, killing at least four.

In Odeissah, responding ambulances were hit by Israeli fire and three medics who were wounded in the initial attack were killed as rescuers tried to reach them, the health ministry said. In the Beirut suburbs, the team working to remove rubble from the initial airstrike was hit in a drone attack that killed a driver and wounded seven, said Islamic Health Committee spokesman Mahmoud Karaki.

Targeting the health sector undermines the safety net for the public, Karaki said, He said 145 of his team members have been wounded over the past year.

Lebanon's health ministry has said nine hospitals and 45 health care centers have been damaged during that time.

Hours after the Friday attack outside Marjayoun hospital, another hospital in the southern town of Bint Jbeil was shelled by Israeli forces after receiving a warning to evacuate. Nine members of the medical and nursing staff at Salah Ghandour Hospital were wounded, most of them seriously.

The hospital later shut down because of the damage."

""I had arranged another, very sweet life for him,"" Ali's mother, Amal Al-Taweel, told The Associated Press in an interview, ""The war has changed everything.""

When the war began on Oct. 7 of last year, Al-Taweel was being rushed to a hospital in central Gaza to give birth to a child she and her husband, Mustafa Al-Taweel, had sought for three years. Days after Ali's birth, his family returned to their home in the Zahrah neighborhood, just north of Wadi Gaza, but were forced to flee on Oct. 18, just a day before Israeli warplanes bombed the area, Al-Taweel said.

Since then, they have been living in relatives' homes and shelters across central and southern Gaza, including the city of Rafah before the Israeli military invaded it in May. They now shelter in the house of Al-Taweel's parents in the Nuseirat refugee camp, along with 15 other relatives.

""It was a very difficult year, bad in every way -- from a health perspective, from a psychological perspective,"" the 30-year-old said, adding that her child has been raised against the backdrop of daily bombing and killing.

The Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and took about 250 hostage, including children and a newborn. Israel responded with one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. The war has killed about 42,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants.

More than 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million have been forced to flee their homes and cram into a tent camp on Gaza's shore. A quarter of the strip's population faces starvation amid an Israel-imposed blockade, allowing only limited delivery of aid, according to the United Nations.

Al-Taweel said every stage of Ali's life has been difficult ""from the time he started crawling, to when his teeth came out, to when he started his first steps, to when he started walking."" And she worried constantly about his safety, recalling that he was slightly injured when a strike hit close to her sister's house in the camp, shattering the windows.

Al-Taweel counted multiple challenges she and her husband, who lost his job as a day laborer in a seaside restaurant in Gaza City, have faced since the war began. Ali didn't receive any vaccinations in his first six months, making him vulnerable to disease, his mother said. And, with the blockade in place, she has struggled to obtain formula and diapers.

""They do not exist, and if they exist, they are very expensive and we can't afford them,"" she said.

Israel has severely restricted aid deliveries of food, water, medicine and other supplies into Gaza during the war. U.N. agencies and aid groups working in the enclave have long complained about lack of access and crippling restrictions on aid delivery.

""There is no single word that can describe the past year,"" said Sondos Alashqar, who works with the Medical Aid for Palestine group. Alashqar said that the hardships Palestinians saw during this past year exceeded what their grandparents experienced during the 1948 Nakba -- or catastrophe -- when some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from what is now Israel.

""We witnessed numerous death-and-life situations,"" she said. ""It was one of the hardest years we've even lived -- harder than what our grandparents experienced.""

Al-Taweel said that constant bombing, displacement and destruction have made it difficult for her to raise her child as she had planned in his first year.

""It (the year) was full of tension, fear, anxiety, displacement, bombing and destruction,"" she said. ""He was not like any other child who lives in a safe, peaceful, and healthy (environment)."""
The Gaza war long felt personal for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. Now they're living it,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-gaza-palestinian-refugees-unrwa-b1261f29422c2fe60c7152f4025ad710,2024-10-05T14:53:49Z,"Many live in camps set up after 1948, when their parents or grandparents fled their homes in land that became Israel, and they have followed a year's worth of news of destruction and displacement in Gaza with dismay.

While Israeli air strikes in Lebanon have killed a few figures from Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups, the camps that house many of the country's approximately 200,000 refugees felt relatively safe for the general population.

That has changed.

Tens of thousands of refugees have fled as Israel has launched an offensive in Lebanon against Hezbollah amid an ongoing escalation in the war in the Middle East. For many, it feels as if they are living the horrors they witnessed on their screens.

Manal Sharari, from the Rashidiyeh refugee camp near the southern coastal city of Tyre, used to try to shield her three young daughters from images of the war in Gaza even as she followed the news ""minute by minute.""

In recent weeks, she couldn't shield them from the sounds of bombs dropping nearby.

""They were afraid and would get anxious every time they heard the sound of a strike,"" Sharari said.

Four days ago, the Israeli military issued a warning to residents of the camp to evacuate as it launched a ground incursion into southern Lebanon -- similar to the series of evacuation orders that have sent residents of Gaza fleeing back and forth across the enclave for months.

Sharari and her family also fled. They are now staying in a vocational training center-turned-displacement shelter run by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, in the town of Sebline, 55 km (34 mi) to the north. Some 1,400 people are staying there.

Mariam Moussa, from the Burj Shamali camp, also near Tyre, fled with her extended family about a week earlier when strikes began falling on the outskirts of the camp.

Before that, she said, ""we would see the scenes in Gaza and what was happening there, the destruction, the children and families. And in the end, we had to flee our houses, same as them.""

Israeli officials have said the ground offensive in Lebanon and the week of heavy bombardment that preceded it aim to push Hezbollah back from the border and allow residents of northern Israel to return to their homes.

The Lebanese militant group began launching rockets into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, one day after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel and ensuing Israeli offensive in Gaza.

Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling, and the two sides were quickly locked into a monthslong, low-level conflict that has escalated sharply in recent weeks.

Lebanese officials say that more than 1 million people have been displaced. Palestinian refugees are a relatively small but growing proportion. At least two camps -- Ein el Hilweh and el Buss -- have been directly hit by airstrikes, while others have received evacuation warnings or have seen strikes nearby.

Dorothee Klaus, UNRWA's director in Lebanon, said around 20,000 Palestinian refugees have been displaced from camps in the south.

UNRWA was hosting around 4,300 people -- including Lebanese citizens and Syrian refugees as well as Palestinians -- in 12 shelters as of Thursday, Klaus said, ""and this is a number that is now steadily going to increase.""

The agency is preparing to open three more shelters if needed, Klaus said.

""We have been preparing for this emergency for weeks and months,"" she said.

Outside of the center in Sebline, where he is staying, Lebanese citizen Abbas Ferdoun has set up a makeshift convenience store out of the back of a van. He had to leave his own store outside of the Burj Shemali camp behind and flee two weeks ago, eventually ending up at the shelter.

""Lebanese, Syrians, Palestinians, we're all in the same situation,"" Ferdoun said.

In Gaza, U.N. centers housing displaced people have themselves been targeted by strikes, with Israeli officials claiming that the centers were being used by militants. Some worry that pattern could play out again in Lebanon.

Hicham Kayed, deputy general coordinator with Al-Jana, the local NGO administering the shelter in Sebline, said he felt the international ""response to the destruction of these facilities in Gaza was weak, to be honest,"" so ""fear is present"" that they might be similarly targeted in Lebanon.

Sharari said she feels safe for now, but she remains anxious about her father and others who stayed behind in the camp despite the warnings -- and about whether she will have a home to return to.

She still follows the news obsessively but now, she said, ""I'm following what's happening in Gaza and what's happening in Lebanon."""
European cities brace for pro-Palestinian rallies amid high alert as Oct. 7 anniversary approaches,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-gaza-war-protests-rallies-propalestine-terror-alerts-b314ac9fc24ab91e3c0639405a15d5d0,2024-10-05T12:16:11Z,"ROME (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators were expected to take to the streets across Europe on Saturday calling for a cease-fire as the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel approached.

Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that some of the protests could turn violent.

Massive rallies are planned in several European cities, including London, Berlin, Paris and Rome through next week, with the largest gatherings expected from Saturday to Monday. Events will peak on Monday, the date of the anniversary.

By midday Saturday, thousands had gathered in central London's Russell Square amid a significant police presence. Some of the march's organizers had said they planned to target companies and institutions they claimed were ""complicit in Israel's crimes,"" including Barclays Bank and the British Museum.

Protests are also taking place in other parts of the world. In the Philippines on Saturday, dozens of left-wing activists protested near the U.S. Embassy in Manila, where police prevented them from getting closer to the seaside compound.

On Oct. 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.

More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. It says more than half were women and children.

Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks -- missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings -- as the region braces for further escalation.

In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which holds much of the power in parts of southern Lebanon and some other areas of the country, attacking the militants with exploding pagers, airstrikes and, eventually, incursions into Lebanon.

Pro-Palestinian protests calling for an immediate cease-fire have repeatedly taken place across Europe and around the globe in the past year and have often turned violent, with confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement officers.

In Rome, a rally was planned for Saturday afternoon -- with about 30,000 demonstrators expected -- in spite of a ban by local police chiefs who refused to authorize protests in the Italian capital, citing public security concerns.

Italian authorities believed that the timing of the planned rally risked the Oct. 7 attack being ""glorified,"" local media reported.

Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi also stressed that, ahead of the key anniversary, Europe is on high alert for potential terror attacks. ""This is not a normal situation ... We are already in a condition of maximum prevention,"" he said.

A large crowd was also expected to gather in central London on Saturday afternoon. Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign in Britain, said he and others will keep organizing marches until action against Israel is taken.

""We need to be out on the streets in even bigger numbers to stop this carnage and stop Britain being drawn into it,"" Jamal said.

In Berlin, a march is scheduled from the Brandenburg Gate to Bebelplatz on Sunday. Local media reported that security forces have warned of potential overload due to the scale of protests. German authorities pointed to increasing antisemitic and violent incidents in recent days.

France was also on alert for new protests on Saturday. Earlier this week, Interior minister Bruno Retailleau warned the country's regional prefects, expressing concern about possible tensions and saying that the terrorist threat was high."
"Israel strikes Lebanon, hitting Beirut suburbs and the north",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-5-october-2024-a8b70daeccc57a86fc6d939c604f2caf,2024-10-05T12:04:14Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon on Saturday, hitting Beirut's southern suburbs with 12 airstrikes and striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in northern Lebanon for the first time.

The attack on the Beddawi refugee camp near the northern city of Tripoli killed an official with Hamas's military wing, along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palesitnian militant group said in a statement. Tripoli is much farther north than the majority of Israel's strikes, which have been concentrated in southern Lebanon and Beirut.

Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began in October last year, in addition to most of the top leadership of Hezbollah.

At least six people were killed in more than a dozen Israeli airstrikes overnight and into Saturday, according to National News Agency, Lebanon's official news agency.

The Israeli military said special forces were carrying out targeted ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon, destroying missiles, launchpads, watchtowers and weapons storage facilities. The military said troops also dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border.

Some 1,400 Lebanese, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September aiming to cripple Hezbollah and push it away from the countries' shared border. On Tuesday, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon. Nine Israeli troops have been killed in close fighting in the area in the past few days, the military said.

Also on Saturday, Palestinian medical officials say Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza early Saturday have killed at least 9 people, including two children.

One strike hit a group of people in the northern town of Beit Hanoun, killing at least five people, including two children, according to the Health Ministry's Ambulance and Emergency service.

Another strike hit a house in the northern part of the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four people, the Awda hospital said. The strike also left a number of people wounded, it said.

The Israeli military did not have any immediate comment on the strikes, but it has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas.

The Israeli military warned Palestinians to evacuate along the strategic Netzarim corridor in central Gaza, which was at the heart of obstacles to a ceasefire deal earlier this summer. The military told people in parts of the Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps to evacuate to Muwasi, an area along Gaza's shore the military has designated a humanitarian zone.

It's unclear how many Palestinians are currently living in the areas ordered evacuated, parts of which were evacuated previously.

Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the nearly year-long war, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths."

The early morning strike came a day after another Israeli airstrike cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, leaving two huge craters on either side of the road.

Israel began a ground incursion Tuesday into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. As the Israel-Hamas war reaches the one-year mark, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials.

Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

Here is the latest:

BEIRUT -- An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed a Hamas official and his family, the militant group said Saturday.

Hamas said in a statement that the early Saturday strike on the Beddawi refugee camp struck the home of Saeed Atallah Ali, an official with Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades. Ali's wife, Shaymaa Azzam, and their two daughters, Zeinab and Fatima -- whom the statement described as children -- were also killed in the attack.

Beddawi camp is near the northern city of Tripoli. It was the first such strike on the camp in recent weeks that saw intensified exchanges between Israel and Hamas.

Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023.

SEOUL, South Korea -- A military plane evacuating 97 people from Lebanon arrived in South Korea on Saturday.

South Korea's Foreign Ministry said the group on the plane includes South Korean nationals and their family members. There are about 30 South Koreans left in Lebanon besides diplomats and embassy workers who are staying.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol instructed officials Wednesday to send military aircraft to conflict areas in the Middle East as he called a meeting to discuss the impact of the intensified fighting in the region. There are about 480 South Korean nationals living in Israel and 110 in Iran."
Alleged plots against US campaign are only the latest examples of Iran targeting adversaries,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iran-hacking-assassinations-plot-6cb2929fa7065ca8d8e21c6713087258,2024-10-05T04:15:22Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Iran has emerged as a twofold concern for the United States as it nears the end of the presidential campaign.

Prosecutors allege Tehran tried to hack figures associated with the election, stealing information from former President Donald Trump's campaign. And U.S. officials have accused it of plotting to kill Trump and other ex-officials.

For Iran, assassination plots and hacking aren't new strategies.

Iran saw the value and the danger of hacking in the early 2000s, when the Stuxnet virus, believed to have been deployed by Israel and the U.S., tried to damage Iran's nuclear program. Since then, hackers attributed to state-linked operations have targeted the Trump campaign, Iranian expatriates and government officials at home.

Its history of assassinations goes back further. After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, Iran killed or abducted perceived enemies living abroad.

A look at Iran's history of targeting opponents:

For many, Iran's behavior can be traced to the emergence of the Stuxnet computer virus. Released in the 2000s, Stuxnet wormed its way into control units for uranium-enriching centrifuges at Iran's Natanz nuclear facility, causing them to speed up, ultimately destroying themselves.

Iranian scientists initially believed mechanical errors caused the damage. Ultimately though, Iran removed the affected equipment and sought its own way of striking enemies online.

""Iran had an excellent teacher in the emerging art of cyberwarfare,"" wryly noted a 2020 report from the King Faisal Center for Research and Islamic Studies in Saudi Arabia.

That was acknowledged by the National Security Agency in a document leaked by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden in 2015 to The Intercept, which examined a cyberattack that destroyed hard drives at Saudi Arabia's state oil company. Iran has been suspected of carrying out that attack, called Shamoon, in 2012 and again in 2017.

""Iran, having been a victim of a similar cyberattack against its own oil industry in April 2012, has demonstrated a clear ability to learn from the capabilities and actions of others,"" the document said.

There also were domestic considerations. In 2009, the disputed reelection of hard-line President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad sparked the Green Movement protests. Twitter, one source of news from the demonstrations, found its website defaced by the self-described ""Iranian Cyber Army."" There's been suspicion that the Revolutionary Guard, a major power base within Iran's theocracy, oversaw the ""Cyber Army"" and other hackers.

Meanwhile, Iran itself has been hacked repeatedly in embarrassing incidents. They include the mass shutdown of gas stations across Iran, as well as surveillance cameras at Tehran's notorious Evin Prison and even state television broadcasts.

Iranian hacking attacks, given their low cost and high reward, likely will continue as Iran faces a tense international environment surrounding Israel's conflicts with Hamas and Hezbollah, Iran's enrichment of uranium to near weapons-grade levels and the prospect of Trump becoming president again.

The growth of 3G and 4G mobile internet services in Iran also made it easier for the public -- and potential hackers -- to access the internet. Iran has over 50 major universities with computer science or information technology programs. At least three of Iran's top schools are thought to be affiliated with Iran's Defense Ministry and the Guard, providing potential hackers for security forces.

Iranian hacking attempts on U.S. targets have included banks and even a small dam near New York City -- attacks American prosecutors linked to the Guard.

While Russia is seen as the biggest foreign threat to U.S. elections, officials have been concerned about Iran. Its hacking attempts in the presidential campaign have relied on phishing -- sending many misleading emails in hopes that some recipients will inadvertently provide access to sensitive information.

Amin Sabeti, a digital security expert who focuses on Iran, said the tactic works.

""It's scalable, it's cheap and you don't need a skill set because you just put, I don't know, five crazy people who are hard line in an office in Tehran, then send tens of thousands of emails. If they get 10 of them, it's enough,"" he said.

For Iran, hacks targeting the U.S. offer the prospect of causing chaos, undermining Trump's campaign and obtaining secret information.

""I've lost count of how many attempts have been made on my emails and social media since it's been going on for over a decade,"" said Holly Dagres, a nonresident senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who once had her email briefly hacked by Iran. ""The Iranians aren't targeting me because I have useful information swimming in my inbox or direct messages. Rather, they hope to use my name and think tank affiliation to target others and eventually make it up the chain to high-ranking U.S. government officials who would have useful information and intelligence related to Iran.""

Iran has vowed to exact revenge against Trump and others in his former administration over the 2020 drone strike that killed the prominent Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani in Baghdad.

In July, authorities said they learned of an Iranian threat against Trump and boosted security. Iran has not been linked to the assassination attempts against Trump in Florida and Pennsylvania. A Pakistani man who spent time in Iran was recently charged by federal prosecutors for allegedly plotting to carry out assassinations in the U.S., including potentially of Trump.

Officials take Iran's threat seriously given its history of targeting adversaries.

After the 1979 Islamic Revolution, its leader Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini signaled how Iran would target perceived enemies by saying, ""Islam grew with blood.""

""The great prophet of Islam, he had the Quran in one hand, and a sword in the other hand -- a sword to suppress traitors,"" Khomeini said.

Even before creating a network of allied militias in the Mideast, Iran is suspected of targeting opponents abroad, beginning with members of Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi's former government. The attention shifted to perceived opponents of the theocracy, both in the country with the mass executions of 1988 and abroad.

Outside of Iran, the so-called ""chain murders"" targeted activists, journalists and other critics. One prominent incident linked to Iran was a shooting at a restaurant in Germany that killed three Iranian-Kurdish figures and a translator. In 1997, a German court implicated Iran's top leaders in the shooting, sparking most European Union nations to withdraw their ambassadors.

Iran's targeted killings slowed after that, but didn't stop. U.S. prosecutors link Iran's Revolutionary Guard to a 2011 plot to kill the Saudi ambassador to Washington. Meanwhile, a suspected Israeli campaign of assassinations targeted scientists in Iran's nuclear program.

In 2015, Iran signed a nuclear deal that saw it greatly reduce its enrichment in exchange for the lifting of sanctions. Two years later, Trump was elected pledging to unilaterally withdraw America from the accord. As businesses backed away from Iran, Tehran renewed a campaign of targeting opponents abroad, but this time capturing them and bringing them to Iran for trial.

Belgium arrested an Iranian diplomat, Assadollah Assadi, in 2018 and ultimately convicted him of masterminding a thwarted bomb attack against an exiled Iranian opposition group. Iran also increasingly has turned to criminal gangs for some attempts, such as what U.S. prosecutors have described as plots to kill or kidnap opposition activist Masih Alinejad.

Among those targeted after Soleimani's death was former U.S. national security adviser John Bolton. The U.S. has offered a reward of up to $20 million for information leading to the capture or conviction of a Revolutionary Guard member it said arranged to kill Bolton for $300,000.

An FBI agent quoted Guard Gen. Esmail Ghaani as saying in 2022 in a court filing, ""Wherever is necessary we take revenge against Americans by the help of people on their side and within their own homes without our presence."""
"One year in, war casts a shadow over every aspect of life in Israel",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-israelis-mood-depression-28daf7e6aa8ddab419cf76e31b111d4f,2024-10-05T04:13:18Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- At a busy Tel Aviv entertainment district, diners spill into outdoor seating and clink glasses as music fills the air. There's laughter, there's life. But all around the patrons, staring down from lampposts and shop windows, are pictures of hostages held in Gaza, stark reminders that Israel is at war and forever scarred by the deadliest attack in its history.

As Israel's war with Hamas reaches its one-year mark, it can seem on the surface that much of life in the country has returned to normal. But with many still reeling from Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, hostages remaining in captivity and a new front of warwith Hezbollah in the north, many Israelis feel depressed, despondent and angry as the war stretches into its second year.

Uncertainty over the future has cast a pall over virtually every part of daily life, even as people try to maintain a sense of normalcy.

""The conversation about the situation is always there,"" said activist Zeev Engelmayer, whose daily postcard project featuring illustrations of hostages or Israel's new reality has become a fixture at anti-war protests. ""Even those who are sitting in coffee shops, they're talking about it, in every single situation I see it. It's impossible to get away from it. It has entered into every vibration of our life.""

Hamas' attack in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped shattered Israelis' sense of security and stability in their homeland.

Many have been rattled by the war's evolution. Nearly 100 hostages remain in Gaza, with less than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks -- missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings -- -- as the region braces for further escalation.

They've watched as Israel is accused of committing war crimes and genocide in Gaza and becomes increasingly isolated internationally.

""I'm almost 80 -- we grew up in this country with a feeling that we have short wars, and we win them quickly,"" said Israeli historian Tom Segev, who described new feelings of utter hopelessness. ""We're not used to a long war.""

Israelis have long harbored a sense that their country, born of the Holocaust's ashes and surviving a panoply of regional threats, is a success story, Segev said. They've strived, he added, for a normality akin to that of European and North American people, though their reality for decades has been anything but.

""I think that history is going backward,"" he said of the past year. ""Everything we have achieved on our way to becoming a normal state isn't happening.""

Reminders are everywhere. At a Hebrew University graduation in Jerusalem, a large yellow ribbon was placed in front of the stage. A graduate who didn't attend because his brother was killed in Gaza the previous day was honored.

Israel's longstanding internal divisions briefly eased in the aftermath of Hamas' attack, but have only intensified since. Weekly protests calling for a cease-fire deal that would free hostages are attended mostly by secular Jewish Israelis who oppose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government.

According to a September poll by Jerusalem-based think tank Israel Democracy Institute, 61 percent of right-wing Jewish Israelis -- Netanyahu's base -- support the war continuing.

Occupied with their own trauma, most Israelis paid scant attention to the ongoing destruction in Gaza, even as the Health Ministry there put the Palestinian death toll at more than 41,000. Israeli media have reported little on the devastation. Israelis calling for a cease-fire are driven overwhelmingly by the hostages' plight.

Many Israelis are furious at leaders and the military for not preventing Hamas' attack. Tens of thousands of people are expected at an alternative ceremony marking one year since then, as a statement against the government's official commemoration. The state ceremony is being prerecorded without a live audience, in part because of fears of heckling and disruptions.

""The thing we lost on Oct. 7 -- and we haven't gotten it back -- is our feeling of security,"" Muli Segev, executive producer of ""Eretz Nehederet,"" a popular sketch comedy show. ""Despite everything, we have been able to create a life here that's pretty open and Western.

""Especially in Tel Aviv, we go about our lives, and we don't think about the fact that our lives are really just pauses between wars and between explosions of violence.""

In the war's early months, the show's sketches were gentler, focusing on what united Israeli society, such as the massive civilian volunteer response. Over time, they featured more pointed satire, including a reimagining of negotiations if the hostages were Israeli politicians' children -- released in less than two hours.

Parts of life have rebounded -- beaches full of people, bustling cafes, concerts and sports back on schedules. But residents also check for the nearest bomb shelter, deal with school cancellations when violence flares up, and avoid domestic travel hubs that are now off-limits. Heartbreaking news arrives regularly, including the deaths of six hostages in August.

""It's a nightmare; we're just getting used to it,"" said Maya Brandwine, a 33-year-old graphic designer who witnessed the Jaffa shooting that killed seven on Tuesday. ""I have so little hope. I'm sure the situation will only get worse.""

Dror Rotches, a 47-year-old graphic designer, said from a Tel Aviv coffee shop: ""We try to go out when we can, meet friends and try to forget for a few hours. Then we go home and keep slogging through the mud.""

Others simply can't return home. More than 60,000 from Israel's northern border with Lebanon are displaced. Thousands from the southern towns ransacked Oct. 7 are in temporary housing. Tens of thousands of reserve soldiers are serving their second or third tour of duty, straining their families and jobs.

""As the war goes on and on and we can't see the end, there's also a type of very large worry over the future, and, for some, if there is even a future here,"" Muli Segev said.

Cafe Otef seems like any of Tel Aviv's ubiquitous coffee shops: Patrons laugh and sip specialty coffee beside a playground; light rock music plays. But next to the sandwiches and cakes are chocolates made from the recipes of Dvir Karp, who was killed in the Oct. 7 attack, and cheeses from Kibbutz Be'eri, where more than 100 died and 30 were taken hostage. Totes and T-shirts for sale declare ""We shall thrive again.""

The cafe, named for the region next to the Gaza border, is run by residents of Re'im, one of the kibbutzes struck. It's the second shop in the new chain, each aiming to support people of a southern Israeli town where lives were upended.

""The war still continues for almost a year, and I feel that if we won't live, we will die,"" said Reut Karp, cafe owner and Dvir's ex-wife. She lives with most of her kibbutz in temporary housing nearby.

The cafe gives her purpose as her community deals with trauma and the uncertainty of returning home. While it's strange to see people flowing through the doors, going about life as normal, she and the staff have found comfort in the routine.

FEMA has faced criticism and praise during Helene. Here's what it does  --  and doesn't do,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-fema-trump-disasters-b191d88e2ab77d3b79eeeb860e4ae13b,2024-10-04T22:35:57Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Emergency Management Agency is tasked with helping states and communities hit by disasters like Hurricane Helene.

With Helene hitting during the homestretch of an election year, the agency has been criticized by some residents and politicians, like Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, who have questioned its response and are spreading false information that its funding is going to migrants or foreign wars.

The Biden administration has defended FEMA's work and says it has the money it needs to help communities right now.

President Joe Biden does say the agency will need more cash in the future. Climate change is making storms like hurricanes more severe.

There are a lot of misperceptions about FEMA's role in disaster recovery, what it does -- and does not -- pay for and what residents in hurricane-hit areas can expect.

Here's a closer look:

FEMA has an operating budget and a disaster relief fund. The fund gets replenished every year by Congress and is used to pay for recovery from hurricanes, floods, earthquakes and other disasters. FEMA also pays for rebuilding from past disasters and for projects designed to protect communities against future calamity.

""This is kind of like the emergency account for the country,"" said Samantha L. Montano, an assistant professor of emergency management at the Massachusetts Maritime Academy.

Congress recently replenished the fund with $20 billion -- the same amount FEMA got last year. About $8 billion of that is set aside for recovery from previous storms and mitigation projects.

The federal government doesn't help with every disaster -- it generally has to be above the ability of a community or state to handle. In that case, the governor or tribal authority asks the president for an emergency declaration.

Once declared, FEMA assistance varies widely. Public assistance -- which is a lot of what it pays for -- is geared toward reimbursing governments for debris removal or rebuilding roads, public buildings and more.

FEMA also has individual assistance, designed to help residents. This can include one-time payments for emergency needs up to a trailer for someone who lost their house.

When there is warning -- like with hurricanes -- FEMA coordinates with state and local governments about what they need and can pre-position supplies like tarps or water in areas likely to be most affected. FEMA also has search-and-rescue teams.

But experts stress that the federal agency isn't in charge of the entire process.

""Everybody thinks that FEMA just comes in right after the disaster and starts managing the entire disaster. And that's just not the case,"" said Brock Long, who was FEMA administrator from 2017 to 2019.

Trump accused FEMA of spending all its money to help immigrants in the country illegally, while other critics assert that the government spends too much on foreign funding for Israel or Ukraine.

""FEMA absolutely has enough money for Helene response right now,"" said Keith Turi, acting director of FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery, noting the $20 billion from Congress.

FEMA called Trump's accusations ""completely false.""

The agency administers the Shelter and Services Program, which gives money to reimburse cities, towns or organizations for immigration-related expenses. But that comes from a separate pot of money funded by Congress for Customs and Border Protection. FEMA gives out the money, but it doesn't come from the disaster relief fund.

Congress also separately funds foreign military aid.

There are long-term funding concerns for FEMA, however.

Turi said the agency was already working to make what's called a ""supplemental"" funding request to Congress before Helene hit. In the storm's wake, it's clear they'll need even more money, he said.

Both Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, who oversees FEMA, and Biden have sounded the alarm about more money needed in the future.

Speaking from a Georgia pecan farm devastated by Helene, Biden said the supplemental funding could not wait: ""People need help now.""

FEMA seeking extra money is not uncommon. Long said he had to go back to Congress three times during his tenure for more cash.

A 2022 Congressional Budget Office report said that most of the money that goes to the disaster relief fund actually comes in these supplemental requests. Extra money that's needed varies depending on the disaster, but the report noted that ""a small number of those disasters account for a disproportionate share of total spending.""

The disaster assistance fund sometimes runs low in late summer before Congress passes a new budget. When that happens, FEMA shifts to what's called ""immediate needs funding."" That means the agency stops paying out for previous disasters and conserves its money for life-saving missions during any new ones.

When the disaster relief fund is replenished -- like what just happened last week -- then money will flow again to longer-term projects.

""Honestly, there's a lot of work that needs to be done to streamline it and rethink, 'How can a disaster relief fund ... be set up in a manner where the FEMA administrator is not constantly having to ask for supplemental funding?"" Long said.

No. It's important to know not just what FEMA does, but what it doesn't do, especially for individuals.

One claim floating around after Helene is that disaster survivors only get $750 from FEMA. That figure refers to help that the agency can give someone in an affected area for what they might need immediately, like clothing or food, Turi said.

From there, the agency can provide other things like money for a storage unit, medical bills or rental assistance depending on the situation.

For homeowners, the first line of defense is always insurance. Those who don't have insurance or not enough can turn to FEMA, but the maximum amount someone can get to rebuild is $42,500. That's a far cry from what is needed to fix severe damage or rebuild completely.

""This is one of the kind of major problems FEMA has in terms of how the public understands their role and responsibility,"" said Montano, the professor. ""FEMA does not make anybody whole after a disaster happens. They are not going to give you enough money to completely recover your life."""
What's next for oil and gas prices as Middle East tensions heat up?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/oil-iran-middle-east-gasoline-supply-demand-51e7de729e4419a52f3ac66dd5890945,2024-10-04T20:53:23Z,"Oil prices climbed this week as tensions in the Middle East escalated. Iran launched missiles at Israel and the Israelis threatened retaliation, raising the possibility of a disruption to the flow of oil from the region. A jump in oil prices automatically spurs fear of a spike in gas prices, but experts see reasons that may not happen.

Here's a look at the current situation and the outlook for oil and gas prices:

Oil prices rose than $6 per barrel (5.47 euros) this week and prices at the pump moved higher as well. The average price for a gallon of gas rose 5 cents from last week. Any major escalation of tensions in the Middle East conjures up memories of the oil embargo that followed the start of the Yom Kippur war in 1973, which quadrupled oil prices.

However, the global supply of oil has been altered radically since the 1970s, with the U.S. becoming the world's largest oil producer. Months of war between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah, two Iranian proxies, did little to boost prices for OPEC and its 12 oil-producing nations. Only the possibility of a direct confrontation between Israel and Iran moved the needle.

U.S. gas prices typically rise along with crude because the price of oil makes up half the cost of a gallon of gasoline.

The national average for gas has risen to about $3.18 per gallon, according to AAA. But that's still 13 cents less than a month ago and 60 cents less than a year ago. The record national average high of $5 per gallon was reached in June 2022.

""Despite the threat of war and a hurricane season that is still percolating, domestic gasoline prices are edging lower,"" AAA spokesperson Andrew Gross said in a statement on Thursday. ""There are now 18 states east of the Rockies with averages below $3 a gallon.""

AAA also estimates that approximately 1.2 million of its members live in households with one or more electric vehicles. The organization believes that tepid gas demand and low oil costs will likely keep prices at gas pumps sliding.

The long-term expectation is for oil prices to move lower, not higher. That's because the balance between supply and demand has tilted toward supply, a dynamic that typically weighs on oil prices.

In its most recent update on the energy markets, the International Energy Agency said demand for oil in the first half of this year rose by the smallest amount since 2020. Meanwhile, supplies have continued to increase and the OPEC+ alliance, made up of members of the producers cartel and allied countries including Russia, has said it plans to release more oil into the market starting in December.

""Geopolitical tensions have soared of late and yet fundamentals seem to be moving in the opposite direction with Iranian oil exports trending close to the highest level in years,"" Barclays analyst Amarpreet Singh said in a note to clients. ""The jury is out on the primary driver of the geopolitical drift, but it warrants caution against taking a strong view on a sustained disruption.""

The country produces 3.99 million barrels per day, which is 4% of the world total. By comparison, Saudi Arabia produces about 9 million barrels a day.

Despite sanctions imposed by the West that have hampered production and export levels, Iran continues to find ways to maintain its oil sector, sometimes using creative methods like blending and re-labeling oil for sale to markets like China. As of the middle of this year, Iran was exporting about 2 million barrels of oil a day, up from 500,000 in 2020 but below the 2.5 million barrels it exported each day in 2018.

Export terminals like Kharg Island in the Persian Gulf could be a target for an Israeli strike. They play a key role in shipping crude oil abroad, primarily to Asian countries, including China.

Oil prices rose Thursday after President Joe Biden said U.S. and Israeli officials were discussing a possible Israeli strike on Iranian oil facilities. On Friday, Biden said the exact nature of any retaliatory action by Israel was ""under discussion."" But he added, ""I think if I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.""

Tom Kloza, global head of energy analysis with the Oil Price Information Service, believes oil prices are approaching a top, with U.S. crude oil at $74.38 and Brent crude, the international benchmark, at $78.05. ""Perhaps Brent may have a cup of coffee at $80 a barrel or higher,"" he wrote in an email, but the long-term outlook is for lower prices.

""As soon as things calm down, oil traders will concentrate on 2025 and 2025 looks very problematic for high prices with supply almost certainly outpacing demand by 500,000 to 1 million barrels a day,"" Kloza said."
"Biden talks election, economy and Middle East in surprise news briefing",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-conference-hamas-israel-kamala-harris-lebanon-hezbollah-jd-vance-0093866898d9f9067ff0676672cba9d8,2024-10-04T20:48:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 1,080 days as president, Joe Biden on Friday decided to pop in and take questions in the White House briefing room for the first time, striding in with a grin after a strong monthly jobs report and the temporary settlement of a strike by ports workers.

The president has been less available than his recent predecessors to questions from White House press corps, making his surprise appearance welcome to the gathered reporters who waited as his press secretary's daily briefing was moved up 15 minutes, then delayed for nearly one hour.

The president stepped through the press room's blue door in a dark gray suit and red tie and proceeded to make news in response to questions about comments on the 2024 presidential election, the latest jobs numbers and the escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The 81-year old stepped aside from the Democratic nomination this summer, backing Vice President Kamala Harris instead. He acknowledged doubts about whether the November election would be peaceful, given comments by former President Donald Trump that the results could be rigged.

""I'm confident it will be free and fair. I don't know whether it will be peaceful,"" Biden said. ""The things that Trump has said, and the the things that he said last time when he didn't like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous.""

Biden has tried to rebut a political movement that has at times openly trafficked in conspiracy theories, with the latest revolving around the government reporting Friday that employers added 254,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%.

""Another fake jobs report out from Biden-Harris government today,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., posted on social media. ""But all the fake numbers in the world aren't going to fool people dealing with the Biden-Harris.""

The jobs reports are legitimate and have capped a solid run for the U.S. economy. Growth has stayed solid even as the inflation rate has dropped from a four-decade high in 2022 to an annual rate of 2.5%.

Consumer confidence has been weak relative to overall economic growth, a sign that many people still don't feel the strength seen in the latest jobs and inflation numbers. But Biden stressed that he was operating on valid data despite unfounded claims of falsification by supporters of Trump's Make America Great Again movement.

""If you notice, anything the MAGA Republicans don't like they call 'fake,'"" Biden said. ""The job numbers are what the job numbers are. They're real. They're sincere.""

The president also highlighted the deal reached Thursday to suspend a strike by 45,000 dockworkers on East and Gulf coast ports until Jan. 15, creating time to try to hash out a new contract.

Still, challenges remain for Biden as his final months as president involve the risk of a wider war in the Middle East.

Since Hamas attacked Israel nearly a year ago, Israel has retaliated by bombarding the Gaza region in ways that have raised human rights concerns, as well as killing Hezbollah leaders and launching airstrikes in Lebanon. On Tuesday, Iran fired at least 180 missiles into Israel and there are concerns about additional retaliation that could cause the conflict to deepen.

When asked, Biden clarified his comments from a day earlier about Israel possibly striking Iranian oil facilities, which caused the price of the commodity to jump on the prospect of supplies being squeezed.

""Look, the Israelis have not concluded what they're going to do in terms of a strike,"" Biden said Friday. ""That's under discussion. I think if I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.""

The president emphasized that he and Harris are ""singing from the same song sheet"" on foreign and domestic policy, calling her a ""major player in everything we've done.""

As Biden began to leave the room, he was asked if he would reconsider his decision to exit the race. Biden cocked his head and smiled."
Yoga business founder pleads guilty to tax charge in New York City,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/yoga-tax-fraud-gumucio-2936566c238507f584fff7172a0eed99,2024-10-04T20:30:00Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- An international yoga business founder whose chain of yoga studios promoted themselves as ""Yoga to the People"" pleaded guilty on Friday to a tax charge in a New York federal court.

Gregory Gumucio, 63, of Colorado, apologized as he admitted not paying over $2.5 million in taxes from 2012 to 2020. He was freed on bail to await a Jan. 16 sentencing by Judge John P. Cronan, who questioned Gumucio during the plea proceeding.

A plea agreement Gumucio reached with prosecutors calls for him to receive a sentence of about five years in prison, the maximum amount of time he could face after pleading guilty to a single count of conspiracy to defraud the Internal Revenue Service.

Two other defendants are awaiting trial in the case.

Gumucio's business, which generated over $20 million in revenue, had operated in about 20 locations in the United States, including in San Francisco, Berkeley and Oakland, California; Tempe, Arizona; Orlando, Florida; and cities in Colorado and Washington. It also operated in studios in Spain and Israel and was seeking to expand to other countries when it closed four years ago.

When Gumucio was arrested two years ago, a prosecutor said he was the living in Cathlamet, Washington, and had been arrested 15 times and had in the past used at least six aliases, three Social Security numbers and claimed three places of birth.

He was eventually freed on $250,000 bail by a magistrate judge who noted that his last previous arrest was in 1992.

In court on Friday, Gumucio acknowledged that he had agreed to pay $2.56 million in restitution, along with interest, to the IRS.

He said he didn't pay the taxes from 2012 to 2020.

""I apologize for that,"" he told Cronan, saying he operated yoga studios in Manhattan's East Village and elsewhere in the United States during those years.

Under questioning from the judge, Gumucio said yoga teachers were paid in cash, and he didn't provide them tax forms indicating how much revenue had been taken in.

""I deliberately did not file tax returns to avoid paying taxes,"" he said.

He said he was currently living in Colorado, though he did not specify where.

As he left the courthouse, Gumucio kept his head bowed once he realized he was being photographed. He declined to comment."
Thousands of Jewish pilgrims come to Ukraine for Rosh Hashana despite official warnings,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/ukraine-rosh-hashana-uman-pilgrimage-jewish-hasidic-0bfda5004958450de38e90853a5c7fce,2024-10-04T20:23:08Z,"UMAN, Ukraine (AP) -- Prayer chants and the sounding of traditional ram's horns fill the air in the town of Uman, in central Ukraine, as thousands of pilgrims join an annual gathering to mark the Jewish new year, despite the war against Russia.

Uman, 200 kilometers (125 miles) south of the Ukrainian capital Kyiv, is transformed for the celebration of Rosh Hashana. The streets are plastered with signs in Hebrew for the pilgrims who come to pray at the tomb of Rabbi Nachman, the great-grandson of the founder of Hasidic movement.

Despite Ukrainian and Israeli diplomats warning of the security threat, officials told The Associated Press that 35,000 pilgrims made the journey to Uman this year, the same as in earlier years.

Rabbi Moshe Reuven Azman, a leading figure in Ukraine's Jewish community, was one of those who urged international pilgrims not to visit Ukraine due to security concerns but acknowledged that many would still make the trip regardless of the potential risks involved.

""Every year (since Russia's full-scale invasion), I speak on Israeli television and radio, and I call on the (Jewish) pilgrims not to come to Ukraine. My primary concern is for the lives of people,"" he said.

As the war in Ukraine rages for a third year, Russian army fires barrages of drones and missiles at Ukraine almost daily, leaving no region completely safe. Active combat is taking place along a 1,000-kilometer (620-mile) front, as Russian forces press their advantage in the eastern Donetsk region. This year alone, the Russian army has managed to capture several thousand square kilometers (miles) of Ukrainian territory, with the capture of the city of Vuhledar being their most recent notable achievement.

Nachman Shitrit, 18, who traveled to Uman from Haifa, Israel with his father, said he had made the pilgrimage over a dozen times.

""The war here didn't scare me from traveling to Ukraine; there's also war where I came from,"" he told the AP.

This year's pilgrimage comes at an increasingly volatile time in the Middle East. Israel is now engaged in a multifront war that includes the battles with Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, attacks from Iran and strikes inside Syria, plus ongoing confrontations with armed militants in the West Bank and occasional attacks launched by Iranian-backed militants in Iraq and by the Houthis in Yemen.

The hostilities posed additional challenges to some pilgrims travelling to Ukraine this year.

Ukraine closed its air space in February 2022, at the start of Russia's full-scale invasion, forcing visitors to travel overland via other European countries in order to reach Uman.

The United Jewish Community of Ukraine said Wednesday that more than 14,000 pilgrims were unable to travel to Uman, partly as a result of Iran's attack on Israel Tuesday. Iran fired a barrage of nearly 180 missiles, causing cancellation of multiple flights from Israel in an act Iranian officials called retaliation for Israel's recent strikes on Hezbollah.

Meir Shpanier, 23, who travelled from Tel Aviv, said the difficulty of the journey had made the experience more meaningful to him this year.

""I managed to get here by a miracle. My travel agent booked airplane tickets from Tel Aviv to Budapest. From there, a Ukrainian driver picked me up, and we drove 22 hours to Uman. But some of my friends had to travel through five countries.""

""Because I had to work hard to get here, it means more to me now. I think we're all blessed to be here,"" Shpanier said."
Biden says he doesn't know whether Israel is holding up peace deal to influence 2024 US election,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-election-mideast-israel-d9f53ba8c7b3b4db953be020f676274c,2024-10-04T19:12:46Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden had terse words for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Friday, and said he didn't know whether the Israeli leader was holding up a peace deal in order to influence the outcome of the 2024 U.S. presidential election.

""No administration has helped Israel more than I have,"" Biden said. ""None. None, none. And I think Bibi should remember that. And whether he's trying to influence the election, I don't know but I'm not counting on that.""

Biden, in a rare appearance in the White House press briefing room, was responding to comments made by one of his allies, Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., who said on CNN this week that he was concerned Netanyahu had little interest in a peace deal in part because of U.S. politics.

Israel has pressed forward on two fronts, pursuing a ground incursion into Lebanon against Hezbollah that left eight Israeli soldiers dead and conducting strikes in Gaza that killed dozens, including children. And the nation has vowed to retaliate for Iran's ballistic missile attack this week, as the region braced for further escalation.

Biden said there had been no decision yet on what type of response there would be toward Iran.

""I'm assuming when they make a decision on how they're going to respond, we will then have a discussion,"" he said."
US launches air attacks on Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/houthis-yemen-us-strikes-weapons-752dd1e5dd6c284a7909878f89c73149,2024-10-04T16:07:10Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. military struck a number of Houthi targets in Yemen on Friday, going after weapons systems, bases and other equipment belonging to the Iranian-backed rebels, a U.S. official confirmed.

U.S. aircraft and ships struck Houthi strongholds, according to the official. The exact number of targets was not yet available as the mission was just ending.

According to the Houthi media, seven strikes hit the airport in Hodeida, a major port city, and the Katheib area, which has a Houthi-controlled military base. Four more strikes hit the Seiyana area in Sanaa, the capital, and two strikes hit the Dhamar province.

The strikes come just days after the Houthis threatened ""escalating military operations"" targeting Israel after they apparently shot down a U.S. military drone flying over Yemen. And just last week, the group claimed responsibility for an attack targeting American warships.

The rebels fired more than a half dozen ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships that were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but all were intercepted by the Navy destroyers, according to several U.S. officials.

The officials spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly released.

Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza started last October. They have seized one vessel and sunk two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors.

Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels.

The group has maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran."
Relatives say a whole family was killed in Israel's deadliest West Bank strike since Oct. 7,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-west-bank-strike-tulkarem-militants-1656f77bb28acdfb3d72ec5fccd628e9,2024-10-04T12:17:08Z,"TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) -- An Israeli airstrike on a West Bank cafe that the military said targeted Palestinian militants also killed a family of four, including two young children, relatives told The Associated Press on Friday.

The strike slammed into a three-story building in the Tulkarem refugee camp late Thursday, setting it on fire, destroying a popular cafe and killing at least 18 Palestinians, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It was the deadliest strike in the West Bank since the start of the Israel-Hamas war nearly a year ago.

On Friday, paramedics searched the rubble inside the blasted-out coffee shop, gathering human remains into small boxes. Young boys and men walked among the ruins of the shop, with holes in the ceiling and debris blanketing the ground, digging past bloodstained furniture and dislodged iron beams for anything to salvage.

Among the dead was the Abu Zahra family: Muhammad, a bakery worker; his wife, Saja; and their two children, Sham, 8, and Karam, 6, according to the man's brother, Mustafa Abu Zahra, who said the family lived above the coffee shop. He added that one of Muhammad's brothers-in-law was also in the apartment at the time and was killed.

The Israeli military said the strike killed several militants, including Hamas' leader in the camp, who it accused of planning and taking part in multiple attacks against Israeli civilians. Tulkarem, known to be a hotbed of Palestinian militancy, is a flashpoint in the West Bank and a frequent target of Israeli military raids.

Hamas, which did not immediately claim any of the dead as its fighters, condemned the strike and called for Palestinians in Tulkarem to rise up.

Israel has carried out several large-scale raids in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. While airstrikes used to be rare in the Palestinian territory, they have grown more common since the outbreak of war as Israeli forces clamp down, saying they aim to prevent attacks on their citizens.

Israeli fire has killed at least 722 Palestinians in the West Bank since Oct. 7, Palestinian health officials say. In that time, Palestinian militants have launched a number of attacks on soldiers at checkpoints and within Israel.

A shooting attack in Tel Aviv earlier this week that Israeli police said was carried out by Palestinians from the West Bank left at least six people dead.

Nimer Fayat, the owner of Dr. Coffee, said the cafe was full with ""regular customers coming to eat and drink"" when the strike occurred around 10:15 p.m.

""What happened was a very strong blow, the likes of which we had not seen in the past since the Al-Aqsa Intifada,"" he said, using a Palestinian term for the second intifada, or uprising, in the early 2000s.

Paramedics rushing to the area encountered a ghastly scene, with body parts flung onto power lines by the force of the blast, said Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent, whose teams brought nine dead to the hospital.

A full list of the dead and wounded was not immediately released by the Palestinian Health Ministry.

Yasser Jibra, another relative of the Abu Zahras, said the strike was ""like a lightning bolt.""

""Look around, the destruction is so obvious,"" he said, adding that it was difficult to identify the bodies of his loved ones.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on civilian deaths in the strike. Israel says it takes care to guard against such deaths.

But to Jibra, that means little.

""This is the work of the criminal occupation, which does not take into account the presence of a child or a woman, or an elderly or young person,"" he said, as he stood inside the blasted-out cafe. ""Everything is permissible for them.""

"For Pittsburgh Jews, attack anniversary adds to an already grim October",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-antisemitism-israel-hamas-f6249df99d8a508ce2f5cfc1508656e7,2024-10-04T11:37:25Z,"PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jewish communities everywhere reacted with horror at last year's Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, but the approaching one-year commemoration of the assault hits home particularly hard in Pittsburgh's Jewish community, which already marks a grim anniversary each October.

It was here on Oct. 27, 2018, that a gunman carried out the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history, killing 11 worshippers from three congregations at the Tree of Life synagogue.

Adding to the intense feelings is the arrival of the Jewish High Holy Days -- days that bracket the Oct. 7 anniversary with rituals focused on mortality and recalling the deaths of loved ones and ancient martyrs. Many are taking consolation in the rituals as they mark an emotionally fraught milestone.

""The trauma here runs deep in our community,"" said Rabbi Seth Adelson of Congregation Beth Shalom, a Conservative synagogue near Tree of Life in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the heart of Jewish Pittsburgh. ""You can't really separate the trauma of Jews being attacked in Pittsburgh and Jews being attacked in Israel.""

The attacks do have differences.

The Pittsburgh attack was carried out by a right-wing extremist who targeted Jews for their aid to immigrants. It was followed by widespread civic support for the Jewish community.

The Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed 1,200 Israelis and triggered a still-ongoing war in Gaza, whose health ministry says Israel has killed more than 41,500 Palestinians and wounded more than 96,000 others. Israel is now intensifying attacks on Hamas ally Hezbollah with deadly attacks in Lebanon, while Iran has attacked Israel with missiles.

The attacks have common threads, say local Jewish leaders. The synagogue attack violated the sanctuary of a place of worship. The Hamas attack has been followed by an upsurge of antisemitic incidents around the world.

""The similarity of what Oct. 7 and Oct. 27 hold together is a question of safety for Jews,"" said Maggie Feinstein, director of the 10.27 Healing Partnership, which aids those traumatized by the 2018 attack.

Emboldened far-right extremists have been spreading Holocaust denial and other antisemitic screeds. Some on the left have expressed antisemitism along with criticism of Israel's conduct of the war, while debate persists over the line between robust criticism and hate speech.

Nationally, nearly two-thirds of Jews feel less secure than they did a year previously, according to an American Jewish Committee survey earlier this year.

In Pittsburgh, a man was charged in September for allegedly attacking two university students wearing yarmulkes, the skullcap worn by observant Jews.

A synagogue and the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh office were targeted with graffiti. Parents of Jewish college students say their children have endured antisemitism amid protests critical of Israel.

Rabbi Daniel Yolkut of Congregation Poale Zedeck in Squirrel Hill said it's become ""unremarkable"" for his children to hear antisemitic slurs shouted by motorists.

Rabbi Adelson said that unlike in 2018, local Jews haven't felt widespread community solidarity.

""There's this feeling that Israel was attacked and then the attacks just continued here,"" he said.

Many in Pittsburgh have lived in Israel or have friends or relatives there. For Yolkut, one connection is especially poignant.

As a rabbi in Virginia years ago, his congregants included the family of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who in 2023 was taken hostage by Hamas.

""I remember him just as a small child running around my synagogue,"" Yolkut recalled. He was devastated to learn weeks ago that Goldberg-Polin was killed by Hamas at age 23, along with five other hostages.

As Oct. 7 approaches, Feinstein said Pittsburgh Jews are already familiar with the ""anniversary effect"" -- the emotional churn around a traumatic calendar date. Each year since 2019, the community has held memorial services honoring the 11 lives lost on 10/27, as the synagogue attack is known locally.

She reminds people that emotions around anniversaries are natural: ""Whatever we're feeling, we shouldn't feel shame.""

Members of all three congregations worshipping at Tree of Life were killed that Sabbath morning in 2018 -- the host congregation, Dor Hadash and New Light.

News of last year's Hamas raid arrived on another Sabbath, just weeks after the conclusion of a lengthy federal trial in which the Pittsburgh assailant was sentenced to death on 63 criminal counts.

That trial confirmed in previously unknown detail how the gunman absorbed white supremacist ideology online and spread the slander that Jews were bringing in immigrants of color to replace white Americans. He targeted Dor Hadash in particular for its support of a national Jewish agency that helps refugees.

Then came Oct. 7.

""The timing was very difficult because some people had not calmed down from their very high level of anxiety from the trial,"" said Rabbi Amy Bardack of Congregation Dor Hadash. Both attacks raised gut-level questions: ""Are Jews safe in the world?""

The war has worsened divisions on the left. Most U.S. Jews are liberal politically and vote Democratic, but many progressive Democrats have supported Palestinians and say Israel's attacks amount to war crimes and genocide -- charges that Israel and its supporters strenuously dispute.

Some Jewish groups dissent from the broad pro-Zionist consensus of established Jewish groups and oppose U.S. military aid to Israel.

Jewish community members acknowledge broad differences within their families and congregations, though most support Israel as a Jewish state and safe haven for Jews.

""Everybody wants peace,"" Adelson said, ""But there is a strong feeling that Israelis deserve to live in peace and not to be subject to the threats and rocket attacks from Hamas and Hezbollah.""

The disputes have flared locally, such as a recent failed effort by some Pittsburgh organizations to bar the city from doing business with entities linked to Israel.

Rebecca Elhassid now volunteers for the new Beacon Coalition, which researches local politicians' views on Israel and Jews.

Until now, ""we didn't think to understand what a city councilperson thought about the Jewish community they represent,"" she said.

""For many years, we were able to put our Jewish identity aside in terms of our social priorities,"" she said. ""We were able to dedicate much of our social resources toward supporting other marginalized communities and identifying other problems in societies. We are going to have to stand up for ourselves in a way we weren't aware we had to before.""

The danger from the far right was well-known, but antisemitism from parts of the progressive left has hit closer to home.

""All my old colleagues, with whom I've done many things over the years with civil rights and voting rights and gay rights and all kinds of women's rights, and I'm seeing them on the other side of an issue,"" said Tree of Life member Audrey Glickman, a survivor of the 2018 attack. ""That's been personally difficult for me, because it's hard to talk to people when they think you're choosing the wrong side.""

But she's determined to maintain dialogue and has continued to visit schools and other settings, spreading the word against antisemitism and other hatreds.

""If we don't talk to each other, we don't get anywhere,"" she said. ""I always feel more motivated to get our there and pull people together. If you don't keep your optimism going, what good is it?""

The High Holy Days add to the sober commemorations of this season.

""It's in our prayers that we need to understand the precariousness of life and our mortality,"" Bardack said. ""There's also joyful themes, but it's with the understanding that we don't know what the future holds.""

She said her congregation has had hard discussions about the war and Israeli policy. She sees her job as helping congregants navigate the complex moment.

""We can't control the Israel-Hamas war, and we can't control antisemitism,"" she said. ""There's only one thing we can control, which is how we treat each other, how we keep loving and kind connections to each other across differences of ideology.""

"Iranian supreme leader praises missile attack on Israel, says Iran will do it again if necessary",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-missile-strike-khamenei-2bce5479abfdac5fd953d5547d04941c,2024-10-04T10:57:48Z,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's supreme leader on Friday praised the country's recent missile strike on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary, state TV reported.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in his first appearance as leader at Friday prayers in about five years, called the missile strike a ""shining"" job by Iran's armed forces.

On Tuesday, Iran launched at least 180 missiles at Israel, the latest in a series of rapidly escalating attacks between Israel and Iran and its allies that threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. Israel said it intercepted many of the missiles, and officials in Washington said U.S. destroyers assisted in Israel's defense. Iran said most of its missiles hit their targets. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

Khamenei, 80, said in a 40-minute speech to thousands of people at the Mosalla mosque, the main prayer site in Tehran, that the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel nearly a year ago on Oct. 7, 2023, was a legitimate action by the Palestinian people.

He said Tuesday's missile barrage was based on international law, the country's law and Islamic beliefs.

He urged nations from ""Afghanistan to Yemen and from Iran to Gaza and Yemen"" to be ready to take action against the enemy, and praised those who had died doing so.

""Our resisting people in Lebanon and Palestine, you brave fighters, you loyal and patient people, these martyrdoms and the blood that was shed shouldn't shake your determination but make you more persistent,"" he said.

Khamenei gave half of the speech in Arabic as he addressed his comments to Arab nations.

Khamenei's last appearance at Friday prayers was after the death of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in 2020 in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.

A ceremony commemorating the death of Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was held before Khamenei's speech. Most high-ranking Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian and top Revolutionary Guard generals, attended the ceremony.

Iran is Hezbollah's main backer and has sent weapons and billions of dollars to the group.

Also on Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Beirut, Lebanon, where he was expected to discuss ongoing fighting between Israel and Hezbollah with Lebanese officials.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei, said Iran sent a shipment of aid to Lebanon, including 10 tons of food and medicine."
"The Nobel Prizes will be announced against a backdrop of wars, famine and artificial intelligence",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/norway-nobel-prizes-peace-wars-c72eac3761a1169356b5c8d32dbe177e,2024-10-04T07:42:57Z,"STAVANGER, Norway (AP) -- Wars, a refugee crisis, famine and artificial intelligence could all be recognized when Nobel Prize announcements begin next week under a shroud of violence.

The prize week coincides with the Oct. 7 anniversary of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel, which began a year of bloodshed and war across the Middle East.

The literature and science prizes could be immune. But the Peace Prize, which recognizes efforts to end conflict, will be awarded in an atmosphere of ratcheting international violence -- if awarded at all.

""I look at the world and see so much conflict, hostility and confrontation, I wonder if this is the year the Nobel Peace Prize should be withheld,"" said Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

As well as events roiling the Middle East, Smith cites the war in Sudan and risk of famine there, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and his institute's research showing that global military spending is increasing at its fastest pace since World War II.

""It could go to some groups which are making heroic efforts but are marginalized,"" Smith said. ""But the trend is in the wrong direction. Perhaps it would be right to draw attention to that by withholding the peace prize this year.""

Withholding the Nobel Peace is not new. It has been suspended 19 times in the past, including during the world wars. The last time it was not awarded was in 1972.

However, Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, says withdrawal would be a mistake in 2024, saying the prize is ""arguably more important as a way to promote and recognize important work for peace.""

Civil grassroot groups, and international organizations with missions to mitigate violence in the Middle East could be recognized.

Nominees are kept secret for 50 years, but qualified nominators often publicize their picks. Academics at the Free University Amsterdam said they have nominated the Middle East-based organizations EcoPeace, Women Wage Peace and Women of the Sun for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians.

Urdal believes it's possible the committee could consider the Sudan Emergency Response Rooms, a group of grassroots initiatives providing aid to stricken Sudanese facing famine and buffeted by the country's brutal civil war.

The announcements begin Monday with the physiology or medicine prize, followed on subsequent days by the physics, chemistry, literature and peace awards.

The Peace Prize announcement will be made on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo, while all the others will be announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. The prize in economics will be announced the following week on Oct. 14.

New technology, possibly artificial intelligence, could be recognized in one or more of the categories.

Critics of AI warn the rise of autonomous weapons shows the new technology could mean additional peace-shattering misery for many people. Yet AI has also enabled scientific breakthroughs which are tipped for recognition in other categories.

David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate's Institute for Scientific Information, says scientists from Google Deepmind, the AI lab, could be among those under consideration for the chemistry prize.

The company's artificial intelligence, AlphaFold ""accurately predicts the structure of proteins,"" and is already widely used in several fields, including medicine, where it could one day be used to develop a breakthrough drug.

Pendlebury spearheads Clarivate's list of scientists whose papers are among the world's most cited, and whose work it says are ripe for Nobel recognition.

""AI will increasingly be a part of the panoply of tools that researchers use,"" Pendlebury said. He said he would be extremely surprised if a discovery ""firmly anchored in AI"" did not win Nobel prizes in the next 10 years."
Middle East latest: An Israeli airstrike cuts a major highway linking Lebanon with Syria,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-4-october-2024-22ce0cdc4813e1f0d657d67868a2da61,2024-10-04T07:02:41Z,"An Israeli airstrike has cut a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said Friday. The airstrike led to the closure of a road near the Masnaa Border Crossing, from where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks.

On Tuesday, Israel began a ground incursion into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group while also conducting strikes in Gaza that killed dozens, including children. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

Here is the latest:

BEIRUT -- Lebanon's state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike has cut a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria.

The agency gave no further details about Friday's airstrike that led to the closure of a road near the Masnaa Border Crossing, from where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It's the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war.

Lebanese General Security recorded more than 250,000 Syrian citizens and over 80,000 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory during the last week of September, after Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon.

Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles and damaged the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous.

There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state.

Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weapons from Iran via Syria. The Lebanese group has a presence on both sides of the border where it fights alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces.

SYDNEY -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday condemned the Iranian ambassador's comments praising a recently slain Hezbollah leader, but rejected opposition advice to expel the envoy.

Ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi described Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by an Israeli missile strike in September in Lebanon, as a ""remarkable leader"" on social media.

""The government condemns any support for terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. We condemn the ambassador's comments,"" Albanese told reporters in Sydney.

""Australia has maintained a relationship with Iran since 1968 that has been continuous. Not because we agree with the regime, but because it's in Australia's national interest,"" Albanese added.

Opposition leader Peter Dutton, who could become prime minister at elections due by May, called for Sadeghi to be expelled over his post. Dutton described Sadeghi's words as ""completely and utterly at odds with what is in our country's best interests.""

Sadeghi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

Australia officially rebuked Sadeghi in August for endorsing Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin's hope that ""wiping out the Zionist plague out of the holy lands of Palestine happens no later than 2027."""
Israeli airstrikes rock southern suburbs of Beirut and cut off a key crossing into Syria,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-4-october-2024-5f2e512d5334b6f7fd7f5a46400e6979,2024-10-04T06:57:13Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria.

The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates.

Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The blasts overnight rocked Beirut's southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers (miles) away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday.

The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details.

The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon's Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing.

Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces.

Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous.

It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between Sept. 23 -- when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon -- and Sept. 30.

There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there.

Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence.

Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their Oct. 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry."

Tunisia votes Sunday in its third presidential election since the Arab Spring,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-presidential-election-kais-saied-9cb6593c3154b0e9a32131d1afe6d118,2024-10-04T05:34:16Z,"TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) -- With his major opponents imprisoned or left off the ballot, Tunisian President Kais Saied faces few obstacles to winning reelection on Sunday, five years after riding anti-establishment backlash to a first term.

The North African country's Oct. 6 presidential election is its third since protests led to the 2011 ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali -- the first autocrat toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings that also overthrew leaders in Egypt, Libya and Yemen.

International observers praised the previous two contests as meeting democratic norms. However, a raft of arrests and actions taken by a Saied-appointed election authority have raised questions about whether this year's race is free and fair. And opposition parties have called for a boycott.

Not long ago, Tunisia was hailed as the Arab Spring's only success story. As coups, counter-revolutions and civil wars convulsed the region, the North African nation enshrined a new democratic constitution and saw its leading civil society groups win the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering political compromise.

But its new leaders were unable to buoy its struggling economy and were plagued by political infighting and episodes of violence and terrorism.

Amid that backdrop, Saied, then 61 and a political outsider, won his first term in 2019. He advanced to a runoff promising to usher in a ""New Tunisia"" and hand more power to young people and local governments.

This year's election will offer a window into popular opinion about the trajectory that Tunisia's fading democracy has taken since Saied took office.

Saied's supporters appear to have remained loyal to him and his promise to transform Tunisia. But he isn't affiliated with any political party, and it's unclear just how deep his support runs among Tunisians.

It's the first presidential race since Saied upended the country's politics in July 2021, declaring a state of emergency, sacking his prime minister, suspending the parliament and rewriting Tunisia's constitution consolidating his own power.

Those actions outraged pro-democracy groups and leading opposition parties, who called them a coup. Yet despite anger from career politicians, voters approved Saied's new constitution the following year in a low-turnout referendum.

Authorities subsequently began arresting Saied's critics including journalists, lawyers, politicians and civil society figures, charging them with endangering state security and violating a controversial anti-fake news law that observers argue stifles dissent.

Fewer voters turned out to participate in parliamentary and local elections in 2022 and 2023 amid economic woes and widespread political apathy.

Many wanted to challenge Saied, but few were able to.

Seventeen potential candidates filed paperwork to run and Tunisia's election authority approved only three: Saied, Zouhair Maghzaoui and Ayachi Zammel.

Maghzaoui is a veteran politician who has campaigned against Saied's economic program and recent political arrests. Still, he is loathed by opposition parties for backing Saied's constitution and earlier moves to consolidate power.

Zammel is a businessman supported by politicians not boycotting the race. During the campaign, he has been sentenced to prison time in four voter fraud cases related to signatures his team gathered to qualify for the ballot.

Others had hoped to run but were prevented. The election authority, known as ISIE, last month dismissed a court ruling ordering it to reinstate three additional challengers.

With many arrested, detained or convicted on charges related to their political activities, Tunisia's most well-known opposition figures are also not participating.

That includes the 83-year-old leader of Tunisia's most well organized political party Ennahda, which rose to power after the Arab Spring. Rached Ghannouchi, the Islamist party's co-founder and Tunisia's former house speaker, has been imprisoned since last year after criticizing Saied.

The crackdown also includes one of Ghannouchi's most vocal detractors: Abir Moussi, a right-wing lawmaker known for railing against Islamists and speaking nostalgically for pre-Arab Spring Tunisia. The 49-year-old president of the Free Destourian Party also was imprisoned last year after criticizing Saied.

Other less known politicians who announced plans to run have also since been jailed or sentenced on similar charges.

Opposition groups have called to boycott the race. The National Salvation Front -- a coalition of secular and Islamist parties including Ennahda -- has denounced the process as a sham and questioned the election's legitimacy.

The country's economy continues to face major challenges. Despite Saied's promises to chart a new course for Tunisia, unemployment has steadily increased to one of the region's highest at 16%, with young Tunisians hit particularly hard.

Growth has been slow since the COVID-19 pandemic and Tunisia has remained reliant on multilateral lenders such as the World Bank and the European Union. Today, Tunisia owes them more than $9 billion. Apart from agricultural reform, Saied's overarching economic strategy is unclear.

Negotiations have long been stalled over a $1.9 billion bailout package offered by the International Monetary Fund in 2022. Saied has been unwilling to accept its conditions, which include restructuring indebted state-owned companies and cutting public wages. Some of the IMF's stipulations -- including lifting subsidies for electricity, flour and fuel -- would likely be unpopular among Tunisians who rely on their low costs.

Economic analysts say that foreign and local investors are reluctant to invest in Tunisia due to continued political risks and an absence of reassurances.

The dire economic straits have had a two-pronged effect on one of Tunisia's key political issues: migration. From 2019 to 2023, an increasing number of Tunisians attempted to migrate to Europe without authorization. Meanwhile, Saied's administration has taken a harsh approach against migrants arriving from sub-Saharan Africa, many who have found themselves stuck in Tunisia while trying to reach Europe.

Saied energized his supporters in early 2023 by accusing migrants of violence and crime and portraying them as part of a plot to change the country's demography. The anti-migrant rhetoric prompted extreme violence against migrants and a crackdown from authorities. Last year, security forces targeted migrant communities from the coast to the capital with a series of arrests, deportation to the desert and the demolition of tent camps in Tunis and coastal towns.

Bodies continue to wash ashore on Tunisia's coastline as boats carrying Tunisians and migrants from sub-Saharan Africa manage only to make it a few nautical miles before sinking.

Tunisia has maintained ties with its traditional Western allies but also forged new partnerships under Saied.

Much like many populist leaders who've taken power worldwide, Saied emphasizes sovereignty and freeing Tunisia from what he calls ""foreign diktats."" He has insisted that Tunisia won't become a ""border guard"" for Europe, which has sought agreements with him to better police the Mediterranean.

Tunisia and Iran lifted visa requirements and in May announced plans to boost trade ties. It has also accepted millions in loans as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative to build hospitals, stadiums and ports.

Yet European countries remain Tunisia's top trade partners and their leaders have maintained productive ties with Saied, hailing agreements to manage migration as a ""model"" for the region.

Saied has spoken ardently in support of Palestinians as war has swept the Middle East and opposes moves made to normalize diplomatic ties with Israel."
"A year later, Israeli survivors reflect on the lingering toll of Oct. 7",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-war-anniversary-survivors-fb65aa677e344a873566dc948d6bf52a,2024-10-04T04:38:08Z,"Lilach Almog walks past the remains of a police station seized by Hamas militants and buildings pockmarked by bullets in her southern Israeli town multiple times a day.

""Every corner has become a memorial,"" she said. ""Even if you want to forget for a bit, you can't. You look outside at the wall and it reminds you of everything all over again.""

Almog joined the roughly 120,000 Israelis displaced by the Israel-Hamas war but has returned home to constant reminders of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack.

A year later, survivors reflect on that day that changed everything. They hid in bedrooms, bomb shelters, safe rooms and beneath trees as Hamas militants poured across the border. In the aftermath, they've mourned loved ones, struggled with anxiety, suffered survivor's guilt and questioned whether they will ever return home to places that still bear the scars of their ordeal.

The force of a blast at the police station across from her apartment building knocked Almog off her feet on Oct. 7.

She had scrambled to her home's fortified room after air raid sirens sounded in Sderot and watched from the window in disbelief as dozens of gunmen walked down her street with rocket-propelled grenades on their shoulders.

They seized the police station, and a dayslong battle raged before the Israeli military bulldozed the building with militants still inside. More than 30 civilians and police officers were killed in the area around the station.

Almog fled Sderot with her children and mother, living in a hotel in Tel Aviv for eight months, but government assistance ran out in August, forcing her to return to Sderot and memories of that day, when Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 hostage.

The resulting war has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians but says more than half were women and children.

The anxiety of the past year has overwhelmed her, forcing her to leave her work as an architect and interior designer and go on disability leave. Her 9-year-old son began wetting the bed. Her 11-year-old daughter refuses to go anywhere without her.

""As long as the war is still continuing, there's no way to feel calm, to return to our lives,"" she said. ""We still have the hostages there. We still have nightmares. There's no end.""

When Ziv Abud spotted the bomb shelter on the side of the road as she was trying to escape the attack on the Nova music festival, she breathed a sigh of relief, thinking it would be a safe place to wait out the rockets.

""We know now that the shelter we went into was basically going into a death trap,"" she said.

Nearly 30 people had crammed into the concrete shelter meant to hold about 10. When Hamas militants arrived, they started tossing grenades inside.

A former soldier was able to toss out eight grenades, but the ninth exploded inside the shelter, instantly killing about half the people, Abud said. In the smoke and chaos, militants grabbed people to take as hostages and sprayed the shelter with bullets.

Abud survived, protected by the crush of bodies above her. When she opened her eyes, she saw the bodies of her nephew and his girlfriend but no trace of her boyfriend, Eliya Cohen. Four people, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, were kidnapped, and six others survived.

Over the past year, Abud has campaigned tirelessly for the hostages and flown around the world to press for Cohen's return.

""I think less about my own trauma, just how to bring Eliyah home,"" she said.

Shlomo and Hanna'le Margalit still struggle to comprehend how they survived.

All of the residents on both sides of their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz were killed or kidnapped on Oct. 7. Hamas militants entered their home three times but did not go into the safe room where they were hiding.

Of Nir Oz's nearly 400 residents, 42 were killed and 75 were kidnapped that day. But the couple, part of the founding generation on the kibbutz, was spared.

The Margalits have been married for 64 years and lived in Nir Oz nearly all that time, working to transform the barren desert into a village filled with towering trees and green lawns. The kibbutz was devastated by the attack and will take years to rebuild, though questions remain about how -- or even if -- it should be.

Like most of the residents of Nir Oz, the couple is living in temporary housing, a development of new apartment buildings about an hour northeast.

""I still can't think about what was lost. I think for me that will happen much later,"" Hanna'le Margalit said. ""Right now, all the energy and our work is for survival, to get used to a new place, to hope the hostages will come home.""

Shlomo Margalit returns to the kibbutz about once a week to care for the cemetery, a job he held before Oct. 7. But now many graves have been added. Each time he is there, he chooses one person and goes to their ruined house to properly bid them farewell.

""It's too many to do all at once,"" he said. ""It's too sad and too hard. It's impossible.""

Eilat Shalev remembers that the pomelos -- large citrus fruits -- were about to be harvested a few days after Oct. 7 in southern Israel.

She knows that because farmers had already set out large collection bins, which she hid behind as Hamas militants overran the road leading to the Nova music festival, where she had been dancing with her husband, Shai.

The two got separated as militants began shooting at their car. Shalev ran toward nearby fields, jumping in and out of vehicles, until she found herself near a pomelo orchard.

""I grabbed the first tree I saw on the left side. I hid with my hands on my head and my face in the earth, just praying to God that God will rescue me so I will live and return to my kids,"" she said.

Minutes later, a bullet hit just centimeters from her head. She played dead for hours before making her way back to the road. Eventually, Israeli security forces brought her to a police station. As the hours passed and her husband didn't make contact, she grew increasingly worried. He was pronounced dead five days later.

Shalev said she and her four children, ages 12 to 23, have turned to Judaism for comfort. But she has trouble sleeping at night and struggles to run her household alone.

""As the days go by, one day and another day and another day, it's actually getting worse. It doesn't get better,"" Shalev said. ""Missing him gets stronger because you understand more and more that he's not coming back. He's really not coming back.""

After 54 days in captivity in Gaza, Liat Atzili was determined to return to her work as a high school history and civics teacher to wrest back control of her identity.

""I feel most comfortable and most at ease, and it's the thing that comes the most naturally for me to be in a classroom,"" she said. ""It's a real connection to what I used to be like and what my life was before.""

She counts herself lucky to have been held in an apartment in conditions much better than the hostages kept in underground tunnels. Still, during her captivity, Atzili had no idea whether her family had survived.

The day after her release as part of a November cease-fire deal, the Israeli military announced that her husband, Aviv, had been killed and his body was being held in Gaza. Two of her three children were on the kibbutz, and both survived.

The upcoming anniversary is more difficult than Atzili anticipated, a milestone for how much she has lost over the past year. On Oct. 7, she plans for at least part of the day to stay in bed and watch ""Dirty Dancing.""

Next month, Atzili hopes to return to one of her passions, giving tours at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Museum. She understands the parallels people want to draw between the Holocaust and what happened to her, but the reality in the Middle East is different, she said.

Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed after Middle East tensions weigh on Wall St,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-oil-iran-cb6a744bb4c16fe09d59091a60c66609,2024-10-04T03:54:40Z,"TOKYO (AP) -- Asian shares were mixed Friday after worsening tensions in the Middle East sent shares lower on Wall Street, while boosting crude prices.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 edged up 0.3% in morning trading to 38,668.36. Australia's S&P/ASX 200 slipped 0.7% to 8,145.70. South Korea's Kospi added 0.6% to 2,577.51. Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 1.6% to 22,473.56. Trading was closed in Shanghai.

In currency trading, the U.S. dollar edged down to 146.52 Japanese yen from 146.83 yen. The euro stood unchanged at $1.1034.

Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office on Tuesday, was due to give a policy speech on Friday that could indicate his government's stance on issues such as interest rates and spending.

The Bank of Japan has begun very gradually raising its benchmark rate from near zero. It now stands at around 0.25%. Expectations of rising rates had pushed the yen higher after the Liberal Democrats elected Ishiba to head the ruling party and thus serve as prime minister. But the yen has fallen back against the dollar in the past two days after officials sent clear signals that they did not favor further rate hikes at this time.

A cheaper yen could work as a plus for Japan's giant exporters like Nintendo and Toyota by boosting the value of its overseas earnings. But it raises the cost of imports of oil and other vital commodities, pushing prices higher and pinching household spending.

Stocks sank Wednesday on Wall Street as oil prices kept rising as the world waits to see how Israel will respond to Iran's missile attack on Tuesday.

The S&P 500 fell 0.2% to 5,699.94 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4% to 42,011.59. The Nasdaq composite edged less than 0.1% lower to 17,918.48.

Benchmark U.S. crude added 5 cents to $73.76 a barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, gained 8 cents to $77.70 a barrel. On Thursday, Brent leaped 5% after starting the week below $72. It's potentially on track for its biggest weekly percentage gain in nearly two years.

The rise came after President Joe Biden suggested on Thursday that U.S. and Israeli officials were discussing a possible strike by Israel against Iranian oil facilities.

""We're in discussion of that,"" Biden said to reporters. He added, ""I think that would be a little ... anyway,"" without finishing the thought. Biden also said he doesn't expect Israel to retaliate immediately against Iran.

Iran is a major oil producer and a broadening of the fighting could choke off Iran's flows to China and also affect neighboring countries that are integral to crude supplies. Helping to keep prices in check, though, are signals that oil inventories remain ample at the moment. Brent crude fell to its lowest price in nearly three years last month.

A report Thursday showed growth for real estate, health care and other U.S. services businesses accelerated to its strongest pace since February 2023.

A separate report suggested the number of layoffs across the United States remains relatively low. Slightly more workers filed for unemployment benefits last week, but the number remains low compared with history.

Outside of this week's worries about the Middle East, the dominant question hanging over Wall Street has been whether the job market will continue to hold up after the Federal Reserve earlier kept interest rates at a two-decade high. The Fed wanted to press the brake hard enough on the economy to stamp out high inflation.

Stocks are near their records because of hopes the U.S. economy will indeed continue to grow, now that the Federal Reserve is cutting interest rates. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years and indicated more cuts will arrive through next year."
UN peacekeepers stay on Lebanon's border despite Israeli ground incursion,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-peacekeepers-lebanon-israel-unifil-5e2e4a7c8ba5d28eb8556e38536c44a1,2024-10-04T01:07:41Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- U.N. peacekeepers are staying in their positions on Lebanon's southern border despite Israel's request to vacate some areas before it launched its ground operation against Hezbollah militants, the U.N. peacekeeping chief said Thursday.

Jean-Pierre Lacroix said the commander and liaison officers from the U.N. force, known as UNIFIL, also are in constant contact with their counterparts in the Israeli and Lebanese militaries. He called that key to protecting the U.N.'s more than 10,000 peacekeepers.

The U.N. force is ""the only channel of communications between the parties,"" he told reporters. ""The peacekeepers are also working with partners to do what they can to protect the population.""

UNIFIL was created to oversee the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon after Israel's 1978 invasion. The U.N. expanded its mission following the 2006 war between Israel and Hezbollah, allowing peacekeepers to deploy along the Israeli border.

A U.N. Security Council resolution ending that war demanded that all armed groups -- including Hezbollah -- be disarmed and that the Lebanese army deploy throughout the country to the Israeli border. After 17 years, neither has happened.

Lacroix, who is undersecretary-general for peace operations, said UNIFIL had anticipated ""a limited, targeted ground operation"" and had thoroughly discussed whether U.N. peacekeepers should stay or not, deciding they should stay for now.

""We're constantly reviewing the situation"" on the ground in terms of the safety and security of the peacekeepers, he said. He added that contingency plans are ready but refused to discuss them.

Lacroix also stressed that Israel and Hezbollah have an obligation to protect the U.N. peacekeepers.

Israeli ground forces crossed into southern Lebanon early Tuesday, which along with stepped-up airstrikes marked a significant escalation against Iranian-backed Hezbollah militants and of the war in the Middle East. The fighting comes as the region braces for Israel's response to Iran's ballistic missile attack.

Hezbollah began firing across the border after Iranian-backed Hamas militants carried out attacks on Israel on Oct. 7 and then Israel retaliated with its military offensive in Gaza.

Lacroix said that there were a few ""issues"" after Israel's ground operation in Lebanon began, which he wouldn't go into, but that the U.N. liaison mechanism with its Israeli and Lebanese counterparts was ""effective in addressing those issues.""

Lacroix said UNIFIL at the moment is not carrying out patrols, which it would normally do, but its positions are manned. In some places, the number of peacekeepers has been reduced by about 20%, he said.

When Lacroix was asked whether Israeli fire was coming too close to its bases or positions, he replied that one of the added values of the liaison operation is ""to prevent and deal with possible incidents that would have the potential of affecting the safety, the security of our peacekeepers.""

The liaison officers also are dealing with other activities, including military movements, he said.

Lacroix said UNIFIL had been supporting civilian efforts to supply humanitarian assistance to people in southern Lebanon. The peacekeepers are still trying to help and ""are playing a role as much as possible,"" he said."
US arranges flights to bring Americans out of Lebanon as others seek escape,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-flights-war-ddfa44888c713be095a75f710beed6b2,2024-10-04T00:47:05Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S.-arranged flights have brought about 250 Americans and their relatives out of Lebanon this week during escalated fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, while thousands of others still there face airstrikes and diminishing commercial flights.

In Washington, senior State Department and White House officials met Thursday with two top Arab American officials to discuss U.S. efforts to help American citizens leave Lebanon. The two leaders also separately met with officials from the Department of Homeland Security.

Michigan state Rep. Alabas Farhat and Abed Ayoub, executive director of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, used the White House meeting to ""really drive home a lot of important points about the issues our community members are facing on the ground and a lot of the logistical problems that they're encountering with it when it comes to this evacuation,"" Ayoub said.

Some officials and community leaders in Michigan, home to the nation's largest concentration of Arab Americans, are calling on the U.S. to start an evacuation. Pentagon spokeswoman Sabrina Singh said that was not being considered right now.

""The U.S. military is, of course, on the ready and has a whole wide range of plans. Should we need to evacuate American citizens out of Lebanon, we absolutely can,"" Singh told reporters. She added, ""We haven't been called to do that.""

Israel has stepped up airstrikes and launched a ground incursion into southern Lebanon targeting Iranian-backed Hezbollah militant leaders. Iran on Tuesday fired nearly 200 ballistic missiles toward Israel, stoking fears that the escalating attacks, including an Israeli response, will explode into an all-out regional war.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas, another Iranian-backed militant group, attacked Israel on Oct. 7, triggering the war in Gaza.

Other countries, from Greece to the United Kingdom, Japan and Colombia, have arranged flights or sent military planes to ferry out their citizens.

A U.S. family was mourning Kamel Ahmad Jawad, a resident of metro Detroit's Dearborn area, who was killed in southern Lebanon on Tuesday after they say he stayed to help civilians too old, infirm or poor to flee.

He had been on the phone with his daughter Tuesday when the impact of a strike knocked him off his feet, his daughter, Nadine Kamel Jawad, said in a statement.

""He simply got up, found his phone, and told me he needed to finish praying in case another strike hit him,"" she said.

The State Department has been telling Americans for almost a year not to travel to Lebanon and advising Americans to leave the country on commercial flights for months. It also has made clear that government-run evacuations are rare, while offering emergency loans to aid travel out of Lebanon.

Some Americans said their relatives who are U.S. citizens or green-card holders have been struggling for days or weeks to get seats on flights out of Lebanon. They say limits on withdrawing money from banks due to Lebanon's longstanding economic collapse and intermittent electricity and internet have made it difficult.

Rebecca Abou-Chedid, a lawyer based in Washington, said she paid $5,000 to get a female relative on the last seat of a flight out of Beirut on Saturday.

""She was on her way to the airport"" when Israeli began one of its first days of intensified bombing, Abou-Chedid said Thursday.

Jenna Shami, a Lebanese American in Dearborn, Michigan, described American citizens and green-card holders in her family struggling to contact the U.S. Embassy after airstrikes forced some from their lodgings in Lebanon.

The family had tried for weeks to get seats on commercial flights out, facing increasing ticket prices and cancellations, she said.

The U.S. Embassy offered loans for charter flights, but Americans on their own could find no planes to hire, she said.

Shami and another family, of a Lebanese American military veteran from Texas, said their loved ones had just gotten tickets for upcoming flights and that they were hopeful.

State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said the U.S. would continue to organize flights as long the security situation in Lebanon is dire and there is demand.

Miller said Lebanon's flag carrier, Middle East Airlines, also had set aside about 1,400 seats on flights for Americans over the past week. Several hundred had taken them, he said.

Miller could not speak to the cost of the airline's flights, over which the U.S. government has no regulatory oversight, but said the maximum fare that would be charged for a U.S.-organized contract flight would be $283 per person.

More than 6,000 American citizens have contacted the U.S. Embassy in Beirut seeking information about departing the country over the past week.

Not all of those have actually sought assistance in leaving, and Miller said the department understood that some Americans, many of them dual U.S.-Lebanese nationals and longtime residents of the country, may choose to stay.

Miller said the embassy is prepared to offer temporary loans to Americans who choose to remain in Lebanon but want to relocate to a potentially safer area of the country. The embassy also would provide emergency loans to Americans who wish to leave on the U.S.-contracted flights.

FIFA opts not to suspend Israel but will investigate Palestinian claims of discrimination,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/fifa-israel-palestinian-soccer-5b78239c70c568877c89695e2dcd0721,2024-10-03T16:15:19Z,"ZURICH (AP) -- FIFA stopped short of suspending the Israeli soccer federation on Thursday, but asked for a disciplinary investigation of possible discrimination alleged by Palestinian soccer officials.

A senior FIFA panel overseeing governance will separately investigate ""the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine,"" soccer's governing body said after a meeting of its ruling Council.

The Palestinian soccer federation has consistently asked FIFA for more than a decade to take action against the Israeli soccer body for incorporating teams from West Bank settlements in its leagues.

The compromise decisions came more than four months after Palestinian officials had urged FIFA to suspend Israel's membership at a meeting in May.

The request to FIFA's congress in May also cited ""international law violations"" in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas conflict and directed the soccer body to its statutory commitments on human rights and against discrimination.

FIFA delayed making a decision in May until after a legal review scheduled for July, then pushed back the issue two more times until the meeting Thursday.

""The FIFA Council has implemented due diligence on this very sensitive matter and, based on a thorough assessment, we have followed the advice of the independent experts,"" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a statement.

The latest process follows a pattern -- under Infantino and his predecessor Sepp Blatter -- of Palestinian requests for FIFA to uphold its legal statutes and the question then being steered toward ad hoc panels and other committees.

FIFA gave no timetable Thursday for the investigations it has not requested."

"In time for Oct. 7 anniversary, a new film documents Hamas' attack on Israel music festival",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-nova-film-massacre-60e0f57009f10065a5ce556e5c97feeb,2024-10-03T15:41:04Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Horror came with sunrise following an all-night rave near the Gaza border on Oct. 7, 2023, the Hamas attack presaged by rockets that some young people mistakenly thought were fireworks.

A new documentary shows the attack unfold over the next hours in stomach-churning detail: Gunmen mowing down passengers in cars that try to escape. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, or a refrigerator, to avoid detection. Live grenades tossed into a bunker, then thrown out seconds before exploding. Terrified hostages carried away to an uncertain fate.

Veteran news producer Susan Zirinsky calls ""We Will Dance Again"" the most significant project she's ever worked on, notable praise considering her ""9/11"" film is arguably the best video document of that day.

How much it is seen, however, may depend as much on context as content.

The film is now streaming on the Paramount+ service and debuted last weekend on Showtime, in advance of the attack's one-year anniversary. Distributors acknowledge, however, that it has been a hard sell in markets across the world: many potential outlets and film festivals did not want to wade into a hot-button political issue with war in the Mideast grinding on.

A message at the film's beginning acknowledges that the human cost of the Oct. 7 massacre and the war that followed in Gaza ""has been catastrophic for both Israelis and Palestinians"" and lists the death toll on both sides. ""This film cannot tell everyone's story,"" it says.

The message does not appear, however, when ""We Will Dance Again"" is screened in Israel.

""We are documenting a moment in history,"" Zirinsky said. ""This is not a political film. This happened.""

The former CBS News president is now chief of See It Now Studios and, with colleague Terence Wrong, has made a specialty of filmed recountings of major events, like the ""11 Minutes"" series about the 2017 mass shooting at a country music concert in Las Vegas. With cameras in everyone's pocket, there's a rich trove of raw material to bring these stories to life.

She was keenly interested when she learned of Israeli director Yariv Mozer, a former Israeli soldier who grabbed a camera and was one of the first non-officials given access to the scene. The haunting pictures of the hellscape he found illuminate the film's opening moments. What Mozer had already completed didn't need a lot of work, she said.

Mozer weaves an intimate story of that morning through interviews with survivors and cellphone video many had saved. One of his executive producers also acquired material taken by Hamas fighters later killed. ""She didn't tell me how and I didn't ask,"" he said.

That access enabled the scene of the grenades tossed back and forth, almost a cartoonish sequence if the explosions didn't illustrate the life-and-death consequences.

The killings that day weren't confined to the concert site. But Mozer quickly determined he wanted to concentrate his film on the people who were there.

""They were beautiful, young, young in spirit,"" he said. ""Naive in a way.""

The film is graphic and obviously not easy to watch. Zirinsky and Wrong had arguments over how much could be shown; there are a handful of spots where the picture is blurred out, in some cases to avoid showing expressions on the faces of victims. Critic Jacqueline Cutler wrote in The Daily Beast: ""There is no sugarcoating this. 'We Will Dance Again' is the most harrowing documentary I have ever seen.""

Although the film is being offered on a streaming service and premium cable network in the U.S., getting exposure in the rest of the world has not been easy. Distributors made a deal to show it on the BBC, on the condition that it not describe Hamas as a terrorist organization.

Several film festivals rejected ""We Will Dance Again,"" in part because they worried about political fallout, and the rushed effort to make it publicly available for the first anniversary meant some deadlines were missed, said Michael Schmidt, president of the Sipur, an Israel-based studio that has worked on the project.

Its only film festival appearance was in New Zealand, said Schmidt, who would not name the festivals that had rejected it.

One European buyer expressed interest but said it needed to be approved by its board. That was the last he heard from them. Some interested in showing the film wanted changes to reflect a Palestinian point of view, or required that it be aired together with a Palestinian documentary, he said.

Streaming services, which unlike many cable television networks have a direct-to-consumer subscriber relationship, were particularly reluctant to get involved, Schmidt said. Again, he would not specify who rejected the film.

The goal wasn't to create a political controversy, but to document a moment in history. ""We are in this for the long game,"" he said.

See It Now is open to projects that approach the war in Gaza from a Palestinian point of view, and has already taken some pitches. ""Our only qualification is that it's excellent,"" Wrong said.

The company has resisted outreach from Israeli groups, including one effort by the Israeli foreign ministry to show the film at the United Nations, Zirinsky said. The idea is to avoid any appearance that the work could be used as a propaganda film.

Despite the complications involved, she said, ""I am very happy that we stood up to do this.""

Toward the end of the film, one of the survivors says friends lost that day that ""I'm hoping that wherever they are, they're partying like crazy. And one day, we will, too.""

Such a day seemed in the distant future for Eitan Halley, one of the survivors interviewed who attended a recent screening of the film in New York. He said he's determined that the truth of what happened that day get out, particularly when conspiracy theories suggest it didn't happen. He admitted to his emotional struggles, including survivor's guilt. Zirinsky suggested keeping the memories alive serve an important purpose.

2 Swedish teens are held in custody over blasts near Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/copenhagen-blasts-israel-denmark-embassy-security-jewish-6628a626a26307b980a131aa0aba89fa,2024-10-03T12:01:45Z,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Two Swedish teenagers were jailed Thursday in pre-trial detention in connection with two predawn explosions in the vicinity of the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen a day earlier.

Prosecutors said investigators were establishing ""whether the motive could be a terror attack."" No one was injured in the blasts on early Wednesday in a neighborhood with several foreign diplomatic missions, though the nearby Jewish school was closed following the explosions.

The pair, who cannot be identified under a court order, were ordered held for 27 days. They faced preliminary charges of possessing illegal weapons and carrying five hand grenades. Two of the grenades blew up when the suspects threw them at a house near the embassy, prosecutor Søren Harbo said.

""This was pretty close to the Israeli Embassy,"" Harbo said before Thursday's court hearing. The explosions caused damage to a roof terrace of a nearby house. The diplomatic mission was not harmed.

Thursday's hearing was held behind closed doors after the preliminary charges were read. Reporting from inside the court room, Danish broadcaster DR said the teenagers, aged 16 and 19, are suspected of acting ""in association and together with prior agreement with one or more perpetrators.""

Both denied the charges, local media reported.

The two suspects were arrested Wednesday shortly before noon on a train at Copenhagen's central station. Danish media ran photos of a man in a white hazmat suit being taken away by police on a train platform at the station. A third suspect, aged 19, who had been arrested near the embassy, has been released, police said Thursday.

In Denmark, the charges are one step short of formal charges and allow authorities to keep criminal suspects in custody during an investigation.

In Stockholm, the operative of Sweden's domestic security agency SAPO, Fredrik Hallström, said ""the latest incident at the Israeli embassy is not classified as a terrorist crime at the moment."" His counterpart at the Swedish police's National Operations Department, Johan Olsson, told the same press conference that the charges were of ""aggravated weapons offenses, causing danger or other serious illegal threats and damage.""

Separately, shots were fired late Tuesday at the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm. No one was injured. No arrests have been made."

There was no immediate comment from Hamas.

The military said the three commanders had taken refuge in a fortified underground compound in northern Gaza that served as a command and control center.

It said Mushtaha was a close associate of Yahya Sinwar, the top leader of Hamas who helped mastermind the Oct. 7 attack into Israel that triggered the war.

Sinwar is believed to be alive and in hiding inside Gaza."

""Their unwavering commitment to speaking out against forces of oppression and exploitation, while strictly adhering to non-violent methods, resonates far beyond their communities,"" the Stockholm-based foundation said about the laureates. It considered 176 nominees from 72 countries this year.

Issa Amro, a human rights activist in the occupied West Bank and his group, Youth Against Settlements, were awarded the prize ""for their steadfast non-violent resistance to Israel's illegal occupation, promoting Palestinian civic action through peaceful means.""

In the Philippines, Indigenous activist Joan Carling was cited ""for raising Indigenous voices in the face of the global ecological breakdown and her leadership in defending people, lands and culture.""

Anabela Lemos, a Mozambican environmental activist and director of Justiça Ambiental!, was honored for ""empowering communities to stand up for their right to say no to exploitative mega-projects and demand environmental justice."" It is the first time the award went to Mozambique.

Based at University of London, Forensic Architecture was cited ""for pioneering digital forensic methods to ensure justice and accountability for victims and survivors of human and environmental rights violations.""

Created in 1980, the annual Right Livelihood Award honors efforts that the prize founder, Swedish-German philanthropist Jakob von Uexkull, felt were being ignored by the Nobel Prizes. To date, 198 laureates from 77 countries have received the distinction.

""The 2024 laureates demonstrate the power of non-violent resistance and truth-telling, placing decision-making into the hands of local communities,"" said Ole von Uexkull, the nephew of the prize founder and the organization's executive director.

Previous winners include Ukrainian human rights defender Oleksandra Matviichuk, Congolese surgeon Denis Mukwege and Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. Matviichuk and Mukwege received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 and 2018, respectively.

The 2024 laureates will be given their awards on Dec. 4 in Stockholm. The size of the prize amount was not announced. The foundation said that ""the award comes with long-term support to highlight and expand laureates' work."""
Stock market today: Asian shares are mixed and the yen slips against the dollar,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-yen-iran-8c9ee16a53152dcb07bafd0051c3de93,2024-10-03T04:34:23Z,"Asian shares were mixed on Thursday after U.S. stocks were little changed as investors watched to see developments in the Middle East.

The U.S. dollar gained against the Japanese yen as officials downplayed the likelihood of an interest rate hike soon.

That helped push Tokyo's Nikkei 225 index higher. It gained 2.2% to 38,655.03, while the dollar traded at 146.80 Japanese yen, up from 146.41 yen late Wednesday.

The dollar had been trading around 142 yen after the ruling Liberal Democrats chose Shigeru Ishiba to head the party and succeed Fumio Kishida as prime minister. Ishiba had expressed support for the central bank's recent moves to raise its near-zero benchmark interest rate, which stands at around 0.25%. That led traders to bet that the yen would gain in value.

But after a meeting between Ishiba and Bank of Japan Gov. Kazuo Ueda, both officials indicated that the central bank did not view further rate hikes as suitable for the economy at this time. That prompted a flurry of selling of yen.

The meeting between Ishiba and Ueda was not expected to bring major news, however, ""when Ishiba hinted that growing global risks should keep the BoJ firmly grounded, yen bulls hit the exits faster than you can say 'sayonara,'"" Stephen Innes of SPI Asset Management said in a commentary.

Elsewhere in Asia, Hong Kong's Hang Seng dropped 3.5% to 21,661.99 as investors locked in profits after it roared 6.2% higher a day earlier on a wave of investor enthusiasm over recent announcements from Beijing to rev up the Chinese economy.

With Shanghai and other markets in China closed for a weeklong holiday, trading has crowded into Hong Kong. Markets in South Korea and Taiwan also were closed. India's Sensex fell 0.7%.

Oil prices rose again as the world waited to see how Israel will respond to Tuesday's missile attack from Iran.

U.S. benchmark crude oil gained 73 cents to $70.83 per barrel in electronic trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. Brent crude, the international standard, was up 67 cents to $74.57 per barrel.

Israel is not a major producer of oil, but Iran is, and a worry is that a broadening war could affect neighboring countries that are also integral to the flow of crude.

On Wednesday, Wall Street benchmarks ended little changed amid uncertainty over conflict in the Middle East.

The S&P 500 gained less than 1 point, to 5,709.54, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average edged up 0.1% to 42,196.52. The Nasdaq composite added 0.1% to 17,925.12.

In the bond market, Treasury yields rose after a report indicated hiring by U.S. employers outside the government may have been stronger last month than expected.

The report from ADP Research said private-sector employers accelerated their hiring in September. That could be an encouraging signal for the more comprehensive report on the U.S. job market due to arrive Friday from the U.S. government.

The dominant question hanging over Wall Street has been whether the job market can keep holding up after the Federal Reserve earlier kept interest rates at a two-decade high. The Fed was trying to press the brakes hard enough on the economy to stamp out high inflation.

Stocks are near records in large part on the belief that the U.S. economy will continue to grow now that the Federal Reserve has shifted to cutting interest rates. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years and indicated more cuts will arrive through next year.

Nike sank 6.8% even though the athletic giant reported stronger profit for the latest quarter than analysts expected. Its revenue fell short of forecasts, and the slump shows how much work incoming CEO Elliott Hill has in making the brand cool among customers.

Tesla sank 3.5% despite reporting an increase in its deliveries of electric vehicles during the latest quarter, the first time that's happened this year. The number topped analysts' forecasts, but investors may have been expecting an even bigger increase."
"Haunted by 2016, some Michigan Democrats worry that Harris remains ill-defined in swing state",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/michigan-democrats-harris-election-voters-46306c264cd27fa553eda0c2df55ced7,2024-10-03T04:23:26Z,"EASTPOINTE, Mich. (AP) -- Bill Clinton stood with Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell outside a suburban Detroit grocery store two days before the 2016 election when it was clear to both that Hillary Clinton would lose the state. ""They didn't listen to you,"" Dingell recalled the former president saying.

Democrats in the state have seemed ascendant since, controlling the governorship, both Senate seats and the state legislature. But some party leaders here are worried that trend is not enough to put distance between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Harris' campaign is banking on the fact that they have spent considerably more money than Trump on ads and have a stronger voter outreach program.

Michigan is a state that Harris almost certainly must win to capture the White House, and Democrats' concerns are rooted in the fear that polls don't register all Trump supporters both here and in other battleground states as the campaign enters a critical final phase.

""Anyone who's from Michigan knows that, if you believe the polling, like, I got a bridge I'm going to sell you somewhere,"" said Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin, the Democratic Senate nominee.

Dingell and others have said Harris is still relatively new to many voters and that she needs to make her plans clearer to voters. The congresswoman also said Harris needed to counter efforts by Republicans to paint her as out of touch with Michigan workers.

The state of play today? ""No one is winning this state right now,"" Dingell said.

Patrick Schuh, a veteran Michigan Democratic campaign strategist now deputy national states director for the Democratic voter outreach group America Votes, said voters they have canvassed ""are still wanting to hear more about what Harris stands for as a candidate.""

In some ways, it is simply the worrying point in a campaign, and some Michigan Republicans have concerns that mirror Harris supporters, pointing to Harris' spending edge and lack of a get-out-the-vote effort directly from the Trump campaign.

Trump and allied groups have focused in this automotive manufacturing stronghold on the false claim that Harris ""wants to end all gas-powered cars,"" as one ad that began airing this week states.

As vice president, Harris was the tie-breaking vote for the Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which includes $7,500 tax credits for new electric vehicle purchases.

In an ad airing in Detroit this week, Harris emphasized her biography as a former California attorney general and district attorney ""fighting on behalf of others.""

A complication for Harris has been opposition to the Biden administration's support for Israel in the war in the Middle East within metro Detroit, especially Dearborn, an area that is home to the nation's largest Arab American community. After months of ongoing discussions with Harris' team, communication with some Arab American leaders has stalled, according to Arab American News Publisher Osama Siblani, a prominent leader in the community. Phil Gordon, Harris' national security adviser, met virtually with some Arab and Muslim leaders on Wednesday to discuss the escalating war in the Middle East.

The death of a Dearborn resident, who Dingell and other community leaders this week said was killed in south Lebanon, has only ignited anger in the traditionally Democratic area. Kamel Ahmad Jawad's death was confirmed Wednesday by a spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council.

Harris may overcome divisions within the Democratic coalition by boosting voter turnout in Wayne County, home to Detroit, where low turnout in 2016 contributed to Clinton's loss. Black community leaders noted that excitement surged when Harris entered the race in the summer, and that some momentum continues in the majority-Black city of Eastpointe, just north of Detroit.

Canvassers knocking on doors there for Harris last week encountered several who were firmly committed to voting for her, though some undecided voters wanted to learn more.

""I just go off of what I see in the commercials, and Kamala just seems like she's more for the middle class,"" said Taneisha Stinson, a single mother for whom affordable child care is a top issue.

It's understandable for some Democrats to be nervous, given Michigan's recent narrow presidential election margins, said Amy Chapman, a Democratic strategist in Michigan. Trump won in 2016 by fewer than 11,000 votes. In 2020, Biden carried it by a little more than 154,000 votes, but only by 2.8 percentage points.

""If people are worried, they should be,"" said Chapman, who was Barack Obama's state campaign director in 2008. ""But, not in an 'oh no' way, rather in a we-have-to-work-hard way.""

Harris has not ignored pleas to compete aggressively in Michigan, as Hillary Clinton did in 2016 when she became the first Democrat to lose Michigan in 28 years.

Since entering the race on July 23, Harris' campaign and outside groups that support her candidacy have spent more than $79 million in advertising in Michigan, compared to Trump and groups supporting him which have spent more than $62 million, according to the media-tracking firm AdImpact. From Oct. 1 through Election Day, Harris and pro-Harris groups have reserved more than $40 million in Michigan ad spending, compared to $25 million for Trump's campaign and allied groups, according to the firm.

Harris' campaign also has 52 staffed campaign offices in Michigan, including three in Detroit, two in the Grand Rapids area, the state's second-largest metro area and two in vote-rich Oakland County, Detroit's more affluent northwest suburbs. Trump's campaign said they had dozens of offices across the state and in similar places.

""Democrats' financial resources absolutely dwarf anything that the Republicans have,"" said former Republican Michigan Gov. John Engler. ""But Trump is making stops in locations that have never had presidential visits before, and those are impactful with margins this close.""

Due, in part, to an abbreviated campaign, Harris has visited Michigan three times, with a fourth stop planned for Friday in Flint. In contrast, Trump has made 11 visits to the state, with a 12th planned Thursday in Saginaw. His stops have spread across various regions, while Harris' efforts have largely focused on the Detroit area.

Public polling, along with insights from campaign operatives in both major parties, indicates that neither candidate holds a clear advantage. On a call with donors this week, Slotkin said her campaign's polling showed Harris ""underwater"" in the state, a synonym for trailing. Her comments to donors were first reported by Axios.

Slotkin dismissed the term as ""just an expression that this is an exceptionally close race,"" when asked to clarify her remark.

Still, the scenario isn't what Democratic activist Lori Goldman expected after the party's enthusiasm spiked with Harris' July entry into the race.

""What did we see? Money coming in like crazy. Everybody was excited. There was such a bump,"" said Goldman, who founded Fems for Dems, a leading Michigan Democratic voter outreach group based in Oakland County. ""And now, you know, it's neck and neck.""

""It is PTSD,"" Goldman said.

Goldman was referring to what Dingell remembers as the outcome of her unheeded warnings in 2016. The Democratic nominee campaigned in Michigan only four times from June through the election. Instead, she focused more on Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, all of which she also lost.

Polls that showed Clinton ahead in Michigan, said Michigan Democratic strategist Adrian Hemond, as others did at the time, did not accurately reflect Trump's support in the state.

""Smart Democrats have a healthy sense of paranoia,"" Hemond said. ""If polling is as far off as it was in 2016, we're cooked."""
"Casey, McCormick to meet for first debate in Pennsylvania's battleground Senate race",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/pennsylvania-senate-debate-casey-mccormick-89f4120ac553b31d778523dc699d5771,2024-10-03T04:22:51Z,"HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) -- Democratic U.S. Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Republican challenger David McCormick will meet Thursday night for their first debate in an expensive race for a swing-state seat that could help determine control of the Senate in November's election.

Casey, perhaps Pennsylvania's best-known politician, is seeking a fourth term and is facing what he calls his toughest reelection challenge yet.

Casey, 64, is a staunch ally of labor unions, a former state auditor general and treasurer and Pennsylvania's longest-serving Democrat in the Senate. He has campaigned on preserving the middle class, abortion rights, labor rights and voting rights, and calls McCormick and former President Donald Trump a threat to all those.

McCormick, 59, is making his second run for the Senate after losing narrowly to Dr. Mehmet Oz in 2022's Republican primary. He is a former hedge fund CEO who served at the highest levels of former President George W. Bush's administration and sat on Trump's Defense Advisory Board.

He has accused Casey of rubber-stamping Biden administration policies on immigration, the economy, energy and national security that he blames for inflation, domestic turmoil and war. He also has attacked Casey as out of touch after being in elected office for almost three decades.

Casey, in turn, has attacked McCormick as a carpetbagger from Connecticut's ritzy "" Gold Coast "" who got rich at the expense of others while an executive at a hedge fund there.

Casey has been a key player for Democrats trying to reframe the election-year narrative about the economy by attacking ""greedflation"" -- a blunt term for corporations jacking up prices and ripping off shoppers to maximize profits -- as fast-rising prices opened a big soft spot in 2024 for Democrats.

McCormick, meanwhile, has made a bid for Jewish voters by traveling to the Israel-Gaza border, speaking to Jewish audiences across the state and arguing that Casey and the Biden administration have not fought antisemitism or backed Israel strongly enough in the Israel-Hamas war.

Democrats currently hold a Senate majority by the narrowest of margins but face a difficult 2024 Senate map. A Casey loss could guarantee Republican control of the Senate.

More than $150 million has been spent on the race so far, according to Federal Election Commission records, and the total is on track to exceed $300 million, based on campaign ad tracking by AdImpact, which includes spots reserved between now and Election Day.

The 60-minute debate will air on TV starting at 8 p.m. across Pennsylvania and stream live online. The debate is being hosted by WHTM-TV in Harrisburg.

The candidates have agreed to another debate, to be held at a Philadelphia TV station Oct. 15.

Both Casey and McCormick were uncontested for their party's nominations in the primary election.

Also on the Nov. 5 Senate ballot are John Thomas of the Libertarian Party, Leila Hazou of the Green Party and Marty Selker of the Constitution Party. They were not invited to the debate."
UN calls Israel's ban on its top leader a political statement in long-running rift,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-israel-secretary-general-guterres-a929dda6e7c211cf3c2c8277dd88dffe,2024-10-02T20:53:42Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations on Wednesday called Israel's ban on Secretary-General Antonio Guterres entering the country a political statement by its foreign minister and stressed that the world body's contacts with Israel will continue ""because they have to.""

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters that Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz deeming the U.N. chief ""persona non grata"" is also ""one more attack on the United Nations staff that we've seen from the government of Israel.""

Israel's accusations of U.N. bias and antisemitism date back decades, but the rift has intensified since Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks in the country's south killed about 1,200 people and launched the war in Gaza. Israel's offensive against the militant group has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but that a little more than half were women and children.

An Israeli ground incursion in Lebanon and other attacks against Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group also backed by Iran, and an Iranian missile strike against Israel on Tuesday have threatened to plunge the Middle East into all-out war. The U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting Wednesday on the Middle East.

Guterres didn't respond to a question about the ban as he headed to the meeting, where he demanded a halt to the escalation of ""tit-for-tat violence"" that he warned is leading people in the Middle East ""straight over the cliff.""

Earlier in the day, Katz accused Guterres of being biased against Israel and claimed the U.N. chief never condemned the Hamas attacks and sexual violence committed by its fighters.

Dujarric strongly disagreed, saying Guterres has condemned ""over and over again the terror attacks, the acts of sexual violence and other horrors that we've seen.""

But the Israeli government strongly objected to the secretary-general's phrase in his initial condemnation that said Hamas' attack didn't happen ""in a vacuum.""

Israel also has accused staff from the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees, called UNRWA -- the key provider of assistance in Gaza, of being Hamas members and participating in the Oct. 7 attacks and has curtailed their activities.

The U.N.'s internal watchdog has been investigating those Israeli allegations. UNRWA said Monday that a top Hamas commander killed in Lebanon was an employee who had been suspended since allegations of his ties to the militant group emerged in March.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has accused Israel of trying to destroy its operations. The agency provides education, health care, food and other services to several million Palestinians and their families.

Guterres also has accused Israel of ""collective punishment"" of Palestinians in its nearly yearlong military response to the Hamas attacks in Gaza, saying he has not seen so much death and destruction during his seven years as secretary-general.

Dujarric said that in his 24 years at the U.N., there have been U.N. staff declared persona non grata by a country but that he didn't know of a secretary-general being banned.

He stressed that the United Nations has never recognized the concept being applied to U.N. staff.

Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the practice applies to a country declaring a diplomat persona non grata -- not an international organization.

""We continue our contacts with Israel at the operational level and other levels, because we need to,"" Dujarric said."

"Lawyer for keffiyeh-wearing, pro-Palestinian protester questions arrest under local face mask ban",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mask-ban-new-york-arrest-keffiyeh-protest-6c2ed98c3cb79047c35249dcc416d6ec,2024-10-02T18:21:49Z,"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- A lawyer for a pro-Palestinian protester charged with violating a New York county's face mask ban for wearing a keffiyeh scarf questioned Wednesday whether his client's arrest was justified.

Xavier Roa was merely exercising his constitutionally protected free speech rights as he led others in protest chants last month outside Young Israel of Lawrence-Cedarhurst, an orthodox synagogue near the New York City borough of Queens, attorney Geoffrey Stewart said following Roa's arraignment in Nassau County District Court in Hempstead.

Stewart said the county's Mask Transparency Act, which was signed into law in August, bans mask wearing if police have reasonable suspicion to believe the person was involved in criminal activity or intends to ""intimidate, threaten, abuse, or harass"" anyone.

He questioned whether Roa had been attempting to conceal his identity, as police claim. Stewart noted his client had the Arab scarf draped around his neck and only pulled it over his face shortly before his arrest, meaning he was readily identifiable to officers for much of the demonstration.

Videosshared on social mediashow Roa wearing the keffiyeh around his neck as he's led away by officers in handcuffs.

""By all accounts, he complied and acted respectfully to officers,"" Stewart added.

Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly's office, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment Wednesday.

Nassau County police, in their complaint filed in court, said Roa acknowledged to officers at the time that he was wearing the scarf in solidarity with Palestinians and not for medical or religious purposes, which are the main exceptions to the new ban.

The 26-year-old North Bellmore resident is due back in court Oct. 17 and faces up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted of the misdemeanor charge.

County lawmakers have said they enacted the ban in response to antisemitic incidents since the Oct. 7 start of the Israel-Hamas war.

Roa is the first protester among the handful so far arrested in connection with the new law, which has raised concerns from civil rights groups.

A federal judge last week dismissed a class action lawsuit claiming the ban was unconstitutional and discriminated against people with disabilities. In the ruling, U.S. District Judge Joan Azrack noted the ban exempts people who wear masks for health reasons."
Biden won't support a strike on Iran nuclear sites as Israel weighs response to Iran missile attack,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-israel-iran-hezbollah-nuclear-sites-846c8779b2b95a3bebcf955c4e69cf6c,2024-10-02T18:10:25Z,"JOINT BASE ANDREWS, Md. (AP) -- President Joe Biden said Wednesday he will not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran's nuclear program in response to Iran's missile attack on Israel.

""The answer is no,"" Biden told reporters when asked if he would support such retaliation after Iran fired about 180 missiles at Israel on Tuesday.

Biden's comments came after he and fellow Group of Seven leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United Kingdom spoke by telephone about coordinating new sanctions against Iran.

The White House said in a statement that the leaders ""unequivocally condemned Iran's attack against Israel"" and that Biden reaffirmed America's ""full solidarity and support to Israel and its people.""

Biden added that ""there are things that have to be done"" in response to the Iranian barrage. He said he expected sanctions from the G7 nations to be announced soon.

""We will be discussing with the Israelis what they are going to do,"" Biden told reporters before heading to the Carolinas to see the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene. ""All seven of us agree that they have a right to respond.""

The office of Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni said in a statement that the leaders expressed ""strong concern for the escalation of these last hours"" and emphasized that ""a conflict on a regional scale is in no one's interest."" Italy holds the rotating presidency of the G7 group of industrialized democracies.

Biden said that he planned to speak with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ""relatively soon.""

Biden's administration has signaled that it is urging Israel to display restraint in how it responds to Iran's missile attack, which Biden said was ""ineffective and defeated.""

Deputy Secretary of State Kurt Campbell said there ""must be a return message"" to Iran. He said the U.S. and Israel officials continue to discuss their response.

""At the same time, I think we recognize as important as the response of some kind should be, there is a recognition that the region is really balancing on a knife's edge,"" Campbell said at forum hosted by the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, a Washington think tank.

The U.S. helped Israel defend against the attack that Iran carried out in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed leaders of Lebanese Hezbollah.

Javier Bardem on Gaza: 'We cannot remain indifferent' in call for hostage release and cease-fire,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/javier-bardem-gaza-israel-c9366d69afd1395c2b09c09415c187ed,2024-10-02T16:15:22Z,"Javier Bardem was no longer comfortable being silent on Gaza.

The Spanish actor spoke out about the Israeli-Hamas conflict upon accepting an award at the San Sebastian Film Festival last week. In his nuanced remarks, Bardem condemned the Hamas attacks as well as the ""massive punishment that the Palestinian population is enduring.""

He called for immediate cease-fire, Hamas' release of hostages and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Hamas leaders -- some of whom are now dead -- who ordered the Oct. 7 attacks to be judged by the International Criminal Court.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Bardem explained why he chose to speak out.

""I believe that we can and must help bring peace. If we take a different approach, then we will get different results,"" Bardem told the AP, speaking prior to Iran's attack on Israel Tuesday. ""The security and prosperity of Israel and the health and future of a free Palestine will only be possible through a culture of peace, coexistence and respect.""

Israel's offensive has already killed over 40,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, displaced the vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million residents and destroyed much of the impoverished territory. Palestinian militants are still holding some 110 hostages captured in the Oct. 7 attack that started the war, in which they killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Around a third of the 110 are already dead, according to Israeli authorities.

The war has drawn sharp divisions in Hollywood over the past year, where public support of Israel or Palestine has provoked backlash and bullying, with accusations of antisemitism and Islamophobia, and cost people jobs. Even silence has had its consequences. The #blockout2024 movement pressured celebrities who hadn't said anything -- or enough -- to take a stand.

""Why now?"" Bardem said. ""Because to continue to stall negotiations and return to the previous status quo, as they say, or as we are seeing now, embark on a race to further violations of international law would be to perpetuate the war and eventually lead us off a cliff.""

Bardem stressed that while antisemitism and Islamophobia are real and serious problems in the U.S., Europe and beyond, that the terms are being used to divert attention away from the ""legitimate right to criticize the actions of the Israeli government and of Hamas.

""We're witnessing crimes against human rights, crimes under international law, such as, for example, the banning of food, water, medicines, electricity, using, as UNICEF says, war against children and the trauma that's being created for generations,"" Bardem said. ""We cannot remain indifferent to that.""

The Oscar-winner, who was born in the Canary Islands and raised Catholic but no longer practices, has spoken up on global issues before, signing an open letter calling for peace during a 2014 conflict between Israel and Hamas, and a few years earlier speaking to a United Nations committee about refugees in Western Sahara, which he narrated a documentary about. He's also an environmental advocate, and spoke to the UN in 2019 about protecting the oceans.

""My mother educated me on the importance of treating all human beings equally, regardless of skin color, ethnicity, religion, nationality, socio and economic status, ability or sexuality,"" Bardem said. ""Actions inform us and that alone interests me about people. That's why I have always been concerned about discrimination of any kind. That includes antisemitism and Islamophobia.""

Bardem is married to Penélope Cruz, with whom he shares two children.

He said that beyond a fear that the framework of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is in danger, he has seen the effects of the conflict up close and the promise of a different approach. Two of his close friends, one Israeli, one Palestinian, both lost daughters to violence years ago and have bonded together in their shared pain and desire to help create positive change.

Those fathers, Bassam Aramin and Rami Elhanan, are members of a nonprofit organization called The Parents Circle Families Forum that emphasizes reconciliation. They wrote a letter that Bardem shared: ""What happened to us is like nuclear energy. You can use it for more destruction. Or you can use it to bring light. Losing your daughter is painful in both situations. But we love our life. We want to exist. So we use this pain to support change. To build bridges, not to dig graves.""

Bardem added: ""That's what it should be about: Building bridges, not digging graves. That's why it's urgent and important."""

Are LGBTQ Jews welcome in Orthodox communities? This is how they are building spaces of their own,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jewish-orthodox-lgbtq-high-holidays-601c0782d8bb02494552823db1fb7525,2024-10-02T12:11:53Z,"It was a heart-wrenching choice. But when Daniel Gammerman decided to never set foot back in an Orthodox synagogue, he thought of it as an act of love. Not toward the Jewish community he was born into, but to himself.

""A synagogue is a spiritual place, but it's also a community place,"" said Gammerman, 47, from his home in Miami. ""If I have to basically check at the door half of my identity in order to come in, I don't feel that's welcoming enough for me.""

Dozens of LGBTQ+ Jews like him have struggled to find support and acceptance within their Orthodox communities. Most were raised with little knowledge of what being gay or queer meant. They just felt different, but found it hard to ask their rabbis: ""This is who I am, is there still room for me here?""

""The way it mostly works is invisibility,"" Gammerman said. ""There's no addressing the existence of LGBT people among us. And, whenever you hear something about it, of course it's negative.""

He can't put his finger on a specific date in which he realized he was gay. But he remembers clearly what happened to him when the news got out.

""I used to get enormous texts from different people trying to explain to me how this was wrong,"" Gammerman said. ""It was a bombardment of people trying to fix me.""

Grandson to Eastern European Jews who fled during World War II, Gammerman was born in Brazil. He moved to the U.S. after finishing high school in the 1990s and continued his studies at a Jewish Orthodox university. At age 21, he got married. He and his wife -- who he still thinks of as a friend -- raised four children together.

""We built a perfect family,"" he said. ""I checked all the boxes of what a nice Jewish Orthodox family is supposed to be.""

Afraid to destroy his future and his children's lives, he shut down his feelings for years, until he could do it no more.

He initially traveled to Brazil and met with a therapist who counseled gay men in heterosexual marriages. That helped, Gammerman said, but something was missing. What about his life within an Orthodox religious community that didn't even acknowledge that LGBTQ+ people exist?

Embracing his true identity felt easier after meeting Steven Greenberg, an openly gay rabbi who founded Eshel, a U.S.-based organization focused on connecting LGBTQ+ Orthodox Jewish communities.

According to Miryam Kabakov, Eshel's executive director, most of the people who reach out share similar concerns: I'm coming out and I've been part of this community my whole life. Can I still belong? What will happen to me now? Can you find a rabbi who can help me?

""We guide them toward religious leaders who will tell them that there's still a place for them,"" Kabakov said. ""That they still have the religious obligations and expectations that they've always had and that they should stay true to their heart and their tradition if that's what they want.""

Ely Winkler, a 37-year-old LGBTQ+ Orthodox Jew from Brooklyn, will soon be back at an Orthodox synagogue after years of distancing himself from his community.

""After the war broke out between Israel and Gaza, I felt a deeper calling,"" he said. ""I didn't feel strong enough to stand up for myself, for my beliefs, and I knew that I needed to strengthen my Judaism, to remember who I was.""

Abrielle Fuerst, 32, moved from Texas to Philadelphia six years ago. Eshel helped her to connect with a local rabbi and an inclusive synagogue.

""Here it's not: 'Oh, come because you are Jewish and gay, we'll accept you.' It's just: 'Hello, you're Jewish, thanks for being in this space and it's nice to meet you.'""

One of Eshel's projects, named the ""Welcoming Shuls,"" enlists more than 200 rabbis who work across North America to make their synagogues hospitable for LGBTQ+ people. Many of them consent to being publicly identified; others ask to keep a low profile, foreseeing hostile reactions within their Orthodox communities.

""A lot of rabbis are very afraid to be public because they'll get ostracized,"" Kabakov said. ""But we know they're there.""

The group also counsels Orthodox LGBTQ+ Jews who wish to keep a distance from their religion.

""People who don't want to be religious anymore are torn up about it,"" Kabakov said. ""But we try to help them through the struggle and let them know that they can be gay and be religious. It might be hard to find a place, but we're working on that.""

Gammerman has tried to go back to Orthodox synagogues since he came out. Until now, none in Miami have made him feel truly accepted.

""I've tried many times, but it's like wearing a costume,"" he said. ""At some point I was able to live with that. But the more you accept yourself, the more you love yourself, you just cannot do it.""

His Orthodox community did not prevent him from attending religious services after he came out, but rejection was still there. People stopped greeting him, and he was no longer allowed to officiate services at his synagogue. Once, during a speech, the rabbi looked at him and said: ""Homosexuality is destroying humanity and if this continues like this, there'll be no more children in the world.""

""I lost friendships, relationships, participation and community,"" Gammerman said. ""It was all gone really, really fast.""

Meeting Greenberg, who is married to another man and has a child, helped him realize he could still live a happy, fulfilling life. After their encounter, Gammerman decided to talk to his wife. The couple separated and found a way to break the news to their children.

""Since then, I have rebuilt my life,"" he said. ""I remarried. I have a husband. My children are part of my life and they understand.""

In time, he realized that not only his family, but his approach toward his religion would also need to change. At first he tried to attend liberal Reform synagogues, some of which fully embrace LGBTQ+ worshippers, but having been raised an Orthodox Jew, he still felt out of place.

""Being LGBT is a whole identity,"" Gammerman said. ""And I want to be embraced in a place where there are no buts or ifs.""

He'd rather not label his current religious observance, but Rosh Hashana and Yom Kippur still bear huge significance for him. So, every year, during the High Holy Days, he wakes up early, dresses nicely and opens his prayer book.

""I say the prayers from beginning to end,"" Gammerman said. ""I call to all the praises as if I was in a synagogue, but I do it by myself in my house.""

He was once taught that Jewish prayer required at least 10 men to be conducted, but he has learned a few things since.

""If I was given a switch that I could press to change who I am, I would not do it,"" he said. ""God made me like this, so it's not up for me to switch. I have to love myself for who I am.""

Israel's multilayered air-defense system passes another test in fending off Iranian missile strike,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-defense-iron-dome-iran-hezbollah-hamas-326cd1e9484dd38c430d62739b7f2ef3,2024-10-02T11:23:43Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel's multilayered air-defense system appears to have passed another test after fending off Iran's latest missile barrage.

In Tuesday's night's strike, Iran fired over 180 missiles toward Israel. The attack set off air raid sirens across the country and sent residents scrambling for shelter, but caused only a handful of minor injuries and limited damage, in large part because many were intercepted or landed in open areas.

It was the latest success for an air-defense system that over the past year has intercepted projectiles fired from Gaza, Lebanon, Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Iran. They have ranged from short-range rockets to medium-range missiles to attack drones to long-range ballistic missiles like those fired Tuesday night.

In Tuesday's attack, the U.S. and Britain said they assisted in shooting down the incoming missiles. Explosions also were seen over the skies of Jordan, though it remains unclear who carried out the interceptions.

But the vast majority of Israel's air defense over the past year has been carried out by Israel itself. Over the decades, Israel has developed a sophisticated system capable of detecting incoming fire and deploying only if the projectile is headed toward a population center or sensitive military or civilian infrastructure. Israeli leaders say the system isn't 100% guaranteed, but credit it with preventing serious damage and countless casualties.

Here's a closer look at Israel's multilayered air-defense system:

This system developed with the U.S. is designed to intercept long-range missiles, including the types of ballistic missiles Iran launched on Tuesday. The Arrow, which operates outside the atmosphere, has also been used in the current war to intercept long-range missiles launched by Houthi militants in Yemen.

Also developed with the U.S., David's Sling is meant to intercept medium-range missiles, such as those possessed by Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has been deployed on multiple occasions throughout the war.

This system, developed by Israel with U.S. backing, specializes in shooting down short-range rockets. It has intercepted thousands of rockets since it was activated early last decade - including thousands of interceptions during the current war against Hamas and Hezbollah. Israel says it has a success rate of over 90%.

Israel is developing a new system to intercept incoming threats with laser technology. Israel has said this system will be a game changer because it would be much cheaper to operate than existing systems. According to Israeli media reports, the cost of a single Iron Dome interception is about $50,000, while the other systems can run more than $2 million per missile. Iron Beam interceptions, by contrast, would cost a few dollars apiece, according to Israeli officials -- but the system is not yet operational."
2 predawn explosions rock the area around the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen but no one is injured,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/copenhagen-blasts-israel-denmark-embassy-security-jewish-491344e2f65f834f0ddbb7ae65c6851d,2024-10-02T08:27:50Z,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- Police in the Danish capital said two predawn explosions took place Wednesday in the vicinity of the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen, prompting the nearby Jewish school to close for the day.

Police said no one had been injured and they were investigating whether there was a link between the blasts and the Israeli diplomatic mission, which is close by several other embassies.

They declined to say whether anyone had been arrested.

Heavily armed officers, search dogs and forensic teams were inspecting the area which had been cordoned off.

Copenhagen's Jewish school, Carolineskolen, which is just down the street from the embassy, was already due to remain closed on Thursday and Friday for the Jewish New Year holidays, Michael Rachlin, a spokesperson for Denmark's Jewish community told The Associated Press.

There will also be extra security around the main synagogue in downtown Copenhagen, the Jewish community said in a statement. Community chairman Henrik Goldstein wrote that he ""would like to encourage people to be aware when moving in public spaces.""

""And be critical of what you hear on social media and rumors,"" he wrote, adding that ""there is no reason to refrain from participating in Jewish life.""

Police refused to give details about the intensity of the reported blasts or the damage they may have caused.

On Tuesday night, the area around the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm was also closed off after a loud bang was reported. Police later announced that findings from the scene indicated that the embassy was hit by bullets. No one has been arrested, they said."
Lebanese emergency services are overwhelmed and need better gear to save lives in wartime,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-rescue-emergency-services-cc0e211c73d8f033387574a69e14a32f,2024-10-02T07:15:04Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- When Israel bombed buildings outside the southern Lebanese city of Sidon, Mohamed Arkadan and his team rushed to an emergency unlike anything they had ever seen.

About a dozen apartments had collapsed onto the hillside they once overlooked, burying more than 100 people. Even after 17 years with the civil defense forces of one of the world's most war-torn nations, Arkadan was shocked at the destruction. By Monday afternoon -- about 24 hours after the bombing -- his team had pulled more than 40 bodies -- including children's -- from the rubble, along with 60 survivors.

The children's bodies broke his heart, said Arkadan, 38, but his team of over 30 first responders' inability to help further pained him more. Firetrucks and ambulances haven't been replaced in years. Rescue tools and equipment are in short supply. His team has to buy their uniforms out of pocket.

An economic crisis that began in 2019 and a massive 2020 port explosion have left Lebanon struggling to provide basic services such as electricity and medical care. Political divisions have left the country of 6 million without a president or functioning government for more than two years, deepening a national sense of abandonment reaching down to the men whom the people depend on in emergencies.

""We have zero capabilities, zero logistics,"" Arkadan said. ""We have no gloves, no personal protection gear.""

Israel's intensified air campaign against Hezbollah has upended the country. Over 1,000 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Sept. 17, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Health Ministry. Hundreds of thousands of people have fled their homes, sleeping on beaches and streets.

The World Health Organization said over 30 primary health care centers around Lebanon's affected areas have been closed.

On Tuesday, Israel said it began a limited ground operation against Hezbollah and warned people to evacuate several southern communities, promising further escalation.

Lebanon is ""grappling with multiple crises, which have overwhelmed the country's capacity to cope,"" said Imran Riza, the U.N.'s humanitarian coordinator for Lebanon, who said the U.N. had allocated $24 million in emergency funding for people affected by the fighting.

Exhausted medical staff are struggling to cope with the daily influx of new patients. Under government emergency plans, hospitals and medical workers have halted non-urgent operations.

In the southern province of Tyre, many doctors have fled along with residents. In Nabatiyeh, the largest province in southern Lebanon, first responders say they have been working around the clock since last week to reach hundreds of people wounded in bombings that hit dozens of villages and towns, often many on the same day.

After the bombing in Sidon nearly 250 first responders joined Arkadan's team, including a specialized search-and-rescue unit from Beirut, some 45 kilometers (28 miles) to the north. His team didn't have the modern equipment needed to pull people from a disaster.

""We used traditional tools, like scissors, cables, shovels,"" Arkadan said.

""Anyone here?"" rescuers shouted through the gaps in mounds of rubble, searching for survivors buried deeper underground. One excavator removed the debris slowly, to avoid shaking the heaps of bricks and mangled steel.

Many sought refuge in the ancient city of Tyre, 20 kilometers (12 miles) north of the border with Israel, thinking it was likely to be spared bombardment. More than 8,000 people arrived, said Hassan Dbouk, the head of its disaster management unit.

He said that there were no pre-positioned supplies, such as food parcels, hygiene kits and mattresses, and moving trucks now is fraught with danger. Farmers have been denied access to their land because of the bombings and the municipality is struggling to pay salaries.

Meanwhile, garbage is piling up on the streets. The number of municipal workers has shrunk from 160 to 10.

""The humanitarian situation is catastrophic,"" Dbouk said.

Wissam Ghazal, the health ministry official in Tyre, said in one hospital, only five of 35 doctors have remained. In Tyre province, eight medics, including three with a medical organization affiliated with Hezbollah, were killed over two days, he said.

Over the weekend, the city itself became a focus of attacks.

Israeli warplanes struck near the port city's famed ruins, along its beaches and in residential and commercial areas, forcing thousands of residents to flee. At least 15 civilians were killed Saturday and Sunday, including two municipal workers, a soldier and several children, all but one from two families.

It took rescuers two days to comb through the rubble of a home in the Kharab neighborhood in the city's center, where a bomb had killed nine members of the al-Samra family.

Six premature babies in incubators around the city were moved to Beirut. The city's only doctor, who looked after them, couldn't move between hospitals under fire, Ghazal said.

One of the district's four hospitals shut after sustaining damage from a strike that affected its electricity supply and damaged the operations room. In two other hospitals, glass windows were broken. For now, the city's hospitals are receiving more killed than wounded.

""But you don't know what will happen when the intensity of attacks increases. We will definitely need more.""

Hosein Faqih, head of civil defense in the Nabatiyeh province, said that ""we are working in very difficult and critical circumstances because the strikes are random. We have no protection. We have no shields, no helmets, no extra hoses. The newest vehicle is 25 years old. We are still working despite all that.""

At least three of his firefighters' team were killed in early September. Ten have been injured since then. Of 45 vehicles, six were hit and are now out of service.

Faqih said he is limiting his team's search-and-rescue missions to residential areas, keeping them away from forests or open areas where they used to put out fires.

""These days, there is something difficult every day. Body parts are everywhere, children, civilians and bodies under rubble,"" Faqih said. Still, he said, he considers his job to be the safety net for the people.

""We serve the people, and we will work with what we have."""
Middle East latest: Iran and Israel swap threats following missile barrage,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-2-october-2024-9e71114e59ce259511eba59833c84426,2024-10-02T05:17:10Z,"The Middle East moved closer to a long-feared regional war the day after Iran fired a barrage of missiles at Israel and Israel said it began limited ground incursions into Lebanon targeting the Iran-backed Hezbollah militia.

Israel said it intercepted many of the missiles, and officials in Washington said U.S. destroyers assisted in Israel's defense. Iran said most of its missiles hit their targets. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed late Tuesday to retaliate against Iran, which he said ""made a big mistake tonight and it will pay for it."" An Iranian commander threatened wider strikes on infrastructure if Israel retaliates against Iran's territory.

The United Nations Security Council called an emergency meeting for Wednesday to address the spiraling conflict.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after Hamas sent fighters into Israel and sparked the war in Gaza. It's been almost a year since some 250 people were abducted from Israel, and friends and family are worried about their loved ones as attention turns away from hostages and north toward Lebanon.

Here is the latest:

BEIJING -- China's official Xinhua news agency said 146 Chinese nationals and five members of their families arrived in Beijing on Wednesday after being evacuated from Lebanon on a charter flight.

The report said that all Chinese citizens who wanted to evacuate have left the country, while the Chinese Embassy in Lebanon will continue its duties.

MELBOURNE, Australia -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned Iran's missile attack on Israel and called for de-escalation.

""We're very concerned about Iran's actions, which is why we condemn them,"" Albanese told reporters in Melbourne, Australia, on Wednesday.

""It is a good thing that it would appear that the defense of Israel, supported by the United States, has ensured that there is no loss of civilian life, it would appear, at this stage. There's been too much loss of life in that region,"" Albanese added.

Albanese said Israel had a right to defend itself.

""What we have called for consistently is for a de-escalation in the region, along with our friends in the United States and others,"" Albanese said.

UNITED NATIONS -- Yemen's two main ports remain operational following Israeli airstrikes, but the strikes damaged power stations, the United Nations says.

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said Tuesday that the U.N. humanitarian coordinator in Yemen went to assess the situation at Yemen's main port of Hodeida and nearby port of Ras Isa following Sunday's Israeli strikes targeting sites used by Houthi rebels in the ports in western Yemen.

Israel said it was retaliating for a Houthi missile fired at central Israel on Saturday which was shot down. The Houthis said it was aimed at Ben Gurion Airport, where Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's plane had just arrived from New York where he addressed the annual meeting of world leaders at the United Nations.

Dujarric said the U.N.'s humanitarian partners reported Tuesday that ""after conducting an initial assessment, both ports remain operational and able to receive commercial and humanitarian supplies.""

""Power stations throughout Hodeida city are, however, running at a very limited capacity,"" the U.N. spokesman said.

TEHRAN, Iran -- A top Iranian military commander has warned that his country will hit Israel's infrastructure if it takes any action against its territory.

Iran's armed forces joint chief of staff Gen. Mohammad Bagheri said Wednesday that the Revolutionary Guard was prepared both defensively and offensively to repeat its missile attack with ""multiplied intensity.""

""If the Zionist regime, that has gone insane, is not contained by America and Europe and intends to continue such crimes, or do anything against our sovereignty or territorial integrity, tonight's operation will be repeated with much higher magnitude and we will hit all their infrastructure,"" he said.

Bagheri said Iran avoided targeting Israeli civilians although it was ""completely feasible.""

UNITED NATIONS -- Israel's U.N. ambassador says his government will decide when and how to respond to Iran's barrage of close to 200 ballistic missiles that forced Israel's 10 million population into bomb shelters. ""But I can tell you one thing, it will be noticed,"" he said. ""It will be painful.""

Danny Danon reacted to a statement from Iran's U.N. Mission that any new Israeli action would be met with a ""crushing response,"" saying: ""I would not advise Iran to challenge our determination, our capabilities. In the past, we have proved it. We will prove it again.""

""We have no desire for war or escalation, but we cannot sit idly by when our civilians are being attacked in such manner,"" the Israeli ambassador said. ""Iran used to send boxes but now, when they send almost 200 ballistic missiles, that's something that I don't think any other nation in the world will ignore."""
"After pressing an Israel-Hezbollah cease-fire, the Biden administration shifts its message",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/middle-east-israel-hezbollah-united-states-8bed0f7a37b5059ba4c94552ff750f34,2024-10-02T04:32:01Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration says there is a significant difference between Israeli actions that have expanded its war against the Iranian-backed militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah and Iran's retaliatory missile attack against Israel, which it condemned as escalatory.

In carefully calibrated remarks, officials across the administration are defending the surge in attacks by Israel against Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon, while still pressing for peace and vowing retribution after Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel on Tuesday.

President Joe Biden praised the U.S. and Israel militaries for defeating the barrage and warned, ""Make no mistake, the United States is fully, fully supportive of Israel.""

Secretary of State Antony Blinken called the Iranian missile attack ""totally unacceptable, and the entire world should condemn it.""

There was little criticism that Israel may have provoked Iran's assault. ""Obviously, this is a significant escalation by Iran,"" national security adviser Jake Sullivan said.

Just a week after calling urgently for an immediate cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah to avoid the possibility of all-out war in the Middle East, the administration has shifted its message as Israel presses ahead with ground incursions in Lebanon following a massive airstrike Friday in Beirut that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and Iranian Revolutionary Guard Gen. Abbas Nilforushan.

U.S. officials stress that they have repeatedly come out in support of Israel's right to defend itself and that any change in their language only reflects evolving conditions on the ground. And, officials say the administration's goal -- a cease-fire -- has remained constant.

The U.S. has been quick to praise and defend Israel for a series of recent strikes killing Hezbollah leaders. In contrast to its repeated criticism of Israel's war in Gaza that has killed civilians, the U.S. has taken a different tack on strikes that targeted Nasrallah and others but also may have killed innocent people.

At the Pentagon, Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder made it clear that while the U.S. is still ""laser focused"" on preventing a wider conflict in the Middle East, he carved out broad leeway for Israel to keep going after Hezbollah to protect itself.

""We understand and support Israel's right to defend itself against Hezbollah,"" Ryder said. ""We understand that part of that is dismantling some of the attack infrastructure that Hezbollah has built along the border.""

He said the U.S. is going to consult with Israel as it conducts limited operations against Hezbollah positions along the border ""that can be used to threaten Israeli citizens."" The goal, he said, is to allow citizens on both sides of the border to return to their homes.

Part of the ongoing discussions that the U.S. will have with Israel, Ryder said, will focus on making sure there's an understanding about potential ""mission creep"" that could lead to tensions to escalate even further.

State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday that Israel's targeting of senior Hamas and Hezbollah leaders as well as its initiation of ground incursions into Lebanon are justified because they were done in self-defense.

""If you look at the actions that they have taken, they were bringing terrorists to justice, terrorists who have launched attacks on Israeli civilians,"" Miller said.

By contrast, he said that Iran's response was dangerous and escalatory because it was done in support of Hamas and Hezbollah, both of which are U.S.-designated terrorist organizations that Iran funds and supports.

""What you saw (was) Iran launching a state-on-state attack to protect and defend the terrorist groups that it built, nurtured and controlled,"" Miller said. ""So there is a difference between the actions.""

The full-throated defense of Israel, however, may come with risks. So far, there is little evidence that the Biden administration's push for a cease-fire and warnings of broadening the conflict have had much impact on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

In commentary Monday, Jon Alterman, director of the Middle East program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, said that U.S. influence on Netanyahu seems to be waning and that he ""seems to have blown by U.S. cautions about starting a regional war.""

The White House must ""worry that a sustained inability to make diplomatic progress weakens U.S. influence in the Middle East and around the world,"" Alterman said, adding that ""Netanyahu's assurance that the United States will stand by Israel in any circumstance emboldens Israel to take more risks than it otherwise would.""

"Harris, Trump's approach to Mideast crisis, hurricane to test public mood in final weeks of campaign",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-mideast-dockworkers-hurricane-biden-a17bb5abe3c9bcfbea58a6ed17eb0ba6,2024-10-02T04:29:21Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A trio of new trials -- a devastating hurricane, expanding conflict in the Mideast and a dockworkers strike that threatens the U.S. economy -- are looming over the final weeks of the presidential campaign and could help shape the public mood as voters decide between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

How events shake out -- and how the candidates respond -- could be decisive as they claw for votes in battleground states.

The sitting president, Joe Biden, is still the steward of a U.S. economy and foreign policy at this tumultuous moment and may well bear ultimate responsibility for how they play out. But how Harris and Trump approach the three disparate issues could have rippling impact on how Americans perceive their two choices this November.

""Unfortunately, there are going to be events like this, and this is where you see the leadership of a president show up,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday. ""I think this should send a message to Americans: It matters. It matters who sits behind the Resolute Desk.""

Harris, with Biden's help, is trying to display steady calm as a flurry of difficult problems arise all at once.

She and Biden on Tuesday toggled between directing Hurricane Helene recovery and rescue response work and huddling with aides in the White House Situation Room to watch as the U.S. helped Israel defend against a massive attack by Iran in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed leaders of Lebanese Hezbollah.

All the while, they were keeping close contact with economic advisers as dockworkers took to the picket line Tuesday, a walkout stretching from ports in Maine to Texas that threatens to snarl supply chains and cause shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more than a few weeks.

Trump, for his part, lashed out at Harris as in over her head, while claiming that this sort of crush of problems never would have happened under his watch.

""We have been talking about World War III, and I don't want to make predictions,"" Trump said at a campaign event in Wisconsin. ""The whole world is laughing at us. That's why Israel was under attack just a little while ago. Because they don't respect our country anymore.""

Yet voters cast Trump aside four years ago in large part because of how they viewed his handling of the swirling economic, social and public health challenges that emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Biden, in comments to reporters before meeting with aides Tuesday to discuss the ongoing hurricane response, seemed to acknowledge the growing frustration with the federal response to the massive storm.

""I've been in frequent contact with the governors and other leaders in the impacted areas, and we have to jumpstart this recovery process,"" Biden said. He will travel to the Carolinas on Wednesday to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. He is also expected to visit hurricane-impacted areas in Georgia and Florida later this week. ""People are scared to death. People wonder whether they're going to make it.""

Harris, meanwhile, is headed to Georgia on Wednesday and North Carolina in the coming days to do the same.

Tuesday's vice presidential debate offered a sampling of how the two campaigns were reacting to new developments to bolster their own messages and sharpen their attacks on their rivals. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised ""steady leadership"" under Harris while Ohio Sen. JD Vance pledged a return to ""peace through strength"" if Trump is returned to the White House.

Biden has stayed off the campaign trail since announcing in July that he was ending his reelection effort amid sliding public approval ratings.

His conspicuous absence underscores that Democrats see him as more of a liability than an asset in making the case for Harris, said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania.

But how well Biden deals with the three latest emergency situations could have a big impact in how undecided voters perceive Harris in these final days.

""President Biden can't help Kamala Harris on the stump,"" Borick said. ""But in a campaign where you are turning over every rock in a few states to get that undecided voter, how he manages these crises over the next several weeks could have an impact.""

The Harris campaign understands the risks it faces with multiple crises converging all at once, especially given their varied and unpredictable nature. A prolonged strike, a bungled disaster response or a further expansion of Middle East conflict could raise doubts about Biden's leadership, and by extension that of his second-in-command.

At the same time, Harris campaign aides believe the perilous moment presents an opportunity to demonstrate to voters the stakes of who's in the job and the seriousness with which they approach it, according to campaign officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking.

The former president, in a speech in Waunakee, Wisconsin, and in social media postings Tuesday, offered a mixture of prayer and concern for those impacted by Helene, jabs at Harris for the dockworkers strike, and an aside about the casting of Stanley Kubrick's film ""Full Metal Jacket.""

""The situation should have never come to this and, had I been president, it would not have,"" Trump said in a statement about the strike.

Harris aides made a point of having the vice president deliver brief remarks on the Iranian attack Tuesday in between taping interviews for her campaign, aiming to portray her as ready to take command.

Late-term tumult has been fixture in American presidential politics, sometimes in the form of scandal and other times with an incumbent hoping to demonstrate that he or his preferred successor would be a steady head at an uncertain time.

George W. Bush pushed a rescue package through Congress to stabilize a reeling financial system by creating the Troubled Asset Relief Program amid fears that the economy was on the verge of collapse. The broader economic conditions didn't help Republican John McCain in the race he lost to Barack Obama.

Jimmy Carter's reelection campaign in 1980 was paralyzed by the Iran hostage crisis. Fifty-two hostages were released on January 20, 1981, soon after his successor, Ronald Reagan, was inaugurated.

Lyndon Johnson announced a halting of bombings in North Vietnam days before the 1968 election, a step he hoped would bring the conflict toward a peace settlement. But the South Vietnamese indicated they would not negotiate and Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, lost narrowly to Republican Richard Nixon.

""The efforts by incumbents to help themselves or their party's nominee with 'October surprises' go back quite a ways,"" said Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian. ""In this current climate, I'm not sure how many voters can be persuaded by a candidate this late in the game trying to show competency.""

"Tokyo shares fall, Hong Kong's advance as tensions escalate in the Middle East",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stocks-markets-rates-strike-iran-3c147dc46c6ef60cd1e16dd099c4be3e,2024-10-02T04:25:08Z,"Asian shares were mixed on Wednesday, with Tokyo's benchmark falling while Hong Kong's advanced despite the sharp escalation of tensions in the Middle East.

Oil prices extended gains after Iran fired dozens of missiles into Israel, potentially raising the risk of disruptions to supplies. That news overshadowed an upbeat report showing U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in August as the American labor market continued to show resilience.

But regional trading was thin, with mainland Chinese markets closed for a weeklong national holiday.

In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 lost 1.7% to 37,993.18. It has retreated since the ruling Liberal Democratic Party chose Shigeru Ishiba to lead the government, replacing Fumio Kishida, who stepped aside on Tuesday. A weaker Japanese yen and higher energy prices would add to Ishiba's burdens as he works to pep up the economy.

The dollar was trading at 143.82 yen, up from 143.57 yen late Tuesday.

Hong Kong's Hang Seng jumped 2.3% to 21,615.87, riding a wave of investor enthusiasm over recent moves by Beijing to rev up the Chinese economy with policies aimed at reviving the ailing property sector and supporting financial markets.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 was flat at 8,208.50 and the Kospi in Seoul lost 0.5% to 2,579.63.

On Tuesday, U.S. stocks retreated from their records, with the S&P 500 dropping 0.9% to 5,708.75. The Dow dropped 0.4% to 42,156.97, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1.5% to 17,910.36.

White House National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan called Iran's missile attack a ""significant escalation,"" although he said it was ultimately ""defeated and ineffective.""

Israel is not a major producer of oil, but Iran is, and the potential for a wider conflict could affect other, neighboring producers of crude. The price for a barrel of benchmark U.S. crude rose as much as 5% before settling 2.4% higher. Brent crude, the international standard, rallied 2.6%.

Early Wednesday, U.S. crude was up $1.15 at $70.98 per barrel. Brent crude climbed $1.10 to $74.66 per barrel.

On Tuesday, oil-and-gas producers logged some of the market's biggest gains. ConocoPhillips rose 3.9%, and Exxon Mobil climbed 2.3%.

Shares of defense contractors also rallied. Northrop Grumman rose 3%, and RTX added 2.7%. RTX partners with Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems to make the ""Iron Dome"" air defense system that Israel's government uses.

Most U.S. shares fell.

The all-time high that the S&P 500 set on Monday was its 43rd of the year so far. Stocks had been jumping on hopes the U.S. economy can continue to grow despite a slowdown in the job market, as the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to give it more juice. The Fed last month lowered its main interest rate for the first time in more than four years, and it's indicated it will deliver more cuts through next year.

The dominant question hanging over Wall Street is whether the cuts will ultimately prove to be too little, too late after the Fed earlier kept rates at a two-decade high in hopes of braking on the economy enough to stamp out high inflation.

A discouraging report arrived Tuesday, showing U.S. manufacturing weakened by more in September than economists expected.

Another threat to the economy could lie in a strike by dockworkers at 36 ports across the eastern United States that could snarl supply chains and drive up inflation.

The workers are asking for a labor contract that doesn't allow automation to take their jobs, among other things. Supply chain experts say consumers won't see an immediate impact because most retailers have stocked up on goods, moving ahead shipments of holiday gift items.

An encouraging update from Europe showed inflation among the 20 countries that use the euro came in below 2% in September, the first time that's happened in more than three years. That could give the European Central Bank leeway to cut interest rates more quickly."
Republicans are more likely than Democrats to see Israel as a US ally: AP-NORC poll,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-hezbollah-iran-20b070612a8a76ee1d4d6c47864a2355,2024-10-02T04:13:57Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a year of war between Israel and Hamas, U.S. public opinion on the conflict remains polarized, a new survey by the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds, with Democrats more likely to be critical of Israel, while Republicans remain more supportive.

There are a few points of relative consensus -- about half of U.S. adults, for example, say Hamas bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war, while about one quarter says it has ""some"" responsibility and about 2 in 10 say it has ""not much"" responsibility or ""none at all.""

But U.S. adults remain divided on the extent to which the Israeli government is responsible for the conflict continuing. And the findings indicate that the past year of war hasn't done much to widen or narrow the partisan gulf that existed early in the conflict.

Democrats remain more sympathetic toward the Palestinians than Republicans and more critical of Israel, while Republicans are more likely to sympathize with the Israelis and view Israel as a U.S. ally that shares the United States' values and interests.

However, it's unclear from this survey if public opinion will shift as the war in the Middle East expands beyond Gaza. It was conducted from Sept. 12 to 16, before Israel's military significantly escalated its operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon and before Iran launched missiles at Israel on Tuesday. Hamas, based in Gaza, and Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, are militant groups allied with Iran.

President Joe Biden has maintained crucial U.S. military support to Israel throughout the Gaza war, while repeatedly trying -- and failing -- to broker a cease-fire. Americans are most likely to place ""a lot"" of blame on Hamas for the continuation of the war between Israel and the militant group, followed by the Israeli government, and the Iranian government and groups backed by Iran.

They place much less responsibility on their own country. Only about 1 in 10 Americans say the U.S. government bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war between Israel and Hamas, while about 4 in 10 say it bears ""some"" responsibility, and 45% say the U.S. bears ""not much"" or no responsibility at all.

Democrats are slightly more likely than Republicans to say the U.S. has ""some"" responsibility, but overall the partisan differences on this question are small.

Brian Grider, a 48-year-old Republican from Moscow, Ohio, isn't sure how the U.S. could defuse the conflict.

""I don't know if there's anything we can do,"" he said. ""It would be nice if we could and we might want to try, but is it going to work? Probably not.""

The year of fighting appears to have calcified the partisan divide on the war and the U.S. relationship with Israel.

About half of Republicans view Israel as an ally of the U.S. that shares its values and interests, while about half of Democrats think Israel is a partner that the U.S. should cooperate with but that doesn't share American values and interests.

More than half of Democrats also say the Israeli government bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war, compared to about 4 in 10 Republicans.

Brian Becker, a 49-year-old Democrat in Colorado, says his views of the war shifted after hearing more on social media about Palestinians and Palestinian Americans who were harmed by the war.

""I didn't feel like that was fair for them,"" Becker said. ""So that did start to change my mind a little bit, started to give that waver of support to Palestine,"" he said. ""Where before I probably would have been just, 'Yeah, go Israel.""'

On the other hand, about half of Republicans say they sympathize more with the Israelis than the Palestinians, while Democrats are more likely to say they sympathize with both groups equally.

Grider, the Ohio Republican, thinks Israel responded appropriately to the Oct. 7 attack, comparing it to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S.

""I definitely don't think Israel is doing too much in response to what happened to them,"" he said.

Views of the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the U.S. role in mediating it, haven't shifted much over the course of the year.

Support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state rose slightly, from around 2 in 10 in August 2023 to about 3 in 10 now. (About half of Americans currently say they neither favor nor oppose an independent Palestinian state, and about 2 in 10 are opposed.) There was also a slight uptick in the share of Americans who think the U.S. is too supportive of Israel.

But about 4 in 10 U.S. adults continue to say the U.S. is spending ""too much"" on military aid to Israel in the war, while a similar share say the U.S. is spending ""the right amount."" About 1 in 10 say the U.S. is spending ""too little,"" which is in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in early 2024.

The mix of U.S. opinions on the Gaza war reflects the complexity of a conflict where Americans may see bad actors and innocent victims on both sides, according to Paul Poast, a political scientist at the University of Chicago and a research affiliate of the Pearson Institute.

""This leads to people having very strong views on both sides, which, of course, we've seen,"" Poast said. And it doesn't, he added, make for ""a consistent narrative of, 'We've got to support Israel,' or 'We've got to support the Palestinians.'""

Hamas killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7 and took hostages, some of whom are still being held in Gaza. Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians. Gaza health officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their death toll but say many of those killed are women and children.

Charles Jolivette, a 42-year-old Democrat in New Orleans who developed concerns about Israel's offensive through discussions with friends and colleagues who have Palestinian heritage, has observed a kind of echo-chamber effect, where people on the different sides of the issue seem to only hear views that reflect their own beliefs.

""But I would love to have some more,"" Jolivette said, referring to exchanges of view with people who see the conflict differently. And for ""not only mainstream media, but the mainstream American populace, to have that ability to have these real conversations.""

The poll of 1,111 adults was conducted using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.95 percentage points."
Palestinians in West Bank risk crossing Israel's separation barrier to flee failing economy,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jobs-palestinians-israel-barrier-economy-west-bank-2971f01fd6fd878399911cef00bfa087,2024-10-02T04:13:51Z,"YATTA, West Bank (AP) -- At dawn in mid-May, Sayyed Ayyed and dozens of other unemployed Palestinian men gathered at the foot of the towering wall of concrete and barbed wire dividing the occupied West Bank from Israel.

A smuggler was there with a ladder and ropes. Each man handed over the equivalent of $100. Ayyed waited his turn as others clambered over.

The 30-year-old father of two young daughters hadn't found work for a year. Debts were mounting. Rent had to be paid. On the Israeli side, there was the lure of work on a construction site. He just had to get over the wall.

""When we reach the point where you see that your children do not have food,"" he said, ""the barrier of fear is broken.""

A year of war in Gaza has reverberated across the West Bank, where the World Bank warns the economy is at risk of collapse because of Israeli restrictions barring Palestinian laborers from entering the country for work, and the biggest wave of violence in decades.

Unemployment has skyrocketed, reaching 30% from around 12% before the war. The past year, some 300,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, many of whom worked in Israel, have lost their jobs, the Palestinian Economy Ministry says. Over the first quarter of 2024, the territory's economy contracted by 25%, according to the World Bank.

Desperate for jobs, some Palestinians are resorting to smuggling themselves at great personal risk through the guarded barrier and into Israel.

When they find them, Israeli security forces arrest them -- or at times open fire. There are no official figures from Palestinian authorities about workers killed or injured by Israeli gunfire trying to cross the barrier. The Associated Press spoke to families of three Palestinians who said their relatives were killed trying to sneak across.

""These people are being shot at trying to go to work,"" said Assaf Adiv, director of MAAN, a worker's association that focuses on Palestinian labor rights.

Before the war, some 150,000 Palestinians from the West Bank were crossing legally every day into Israel to work, mainly in construction, manufacturing and agriculture.

After Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israeli authorities barred entry to most Palestinians, saying it was necessary for security. Tens of thousands of Palestinians became jobless overnight.

Eyad al-Najjar, a 47-year-old laborer from a village near the West Bank town of Yatta, slipped into Israel through a barbed-wire section of the barrier in July, earning the equivalent of $650 for a week's work, his family said.

Then his son got married. The wedding set the family back $8,000. So al-Najjar tried his luck again.

He approached a hole in the barrier Aug. 26, three days after the wedding. Israeli troops spotted al-Najjar and opened fire, killing him with a shot to the head, his relatives said.

""His children will have to work to close this debt in the future,"" relative Jawadat al-Najjar said. ""No one helps in these difficult days.""

The Israeli military told the AP it couldn't comment on the shooting without specific coordinates of where relatives said it happened.

""The IDF forces work to prevent illegal infiltrations and to maintain the security of the barrier and the safety of residents,"" it said in a statement. ""The forces conduct proactive ambushes along the barrier, arresting infiltrators and infiltrator smugglers and operate both overtly and covertly to protect the barrier area.""

Labor rights experts say infiltrations happen daily, often involving dozens of Palestinians at a time.

Many Palestinians found their livelihoods gutted by the restrictions. Some sold possessions. On West Bank roadsides, children hawk tissues, bottled water and air fresheners. Some men have tried their hand at selling sandwiches at makeshift street stalls.

It isn't just the cutoff from jobs in Israel. The military also tightened its grip in the West Bank, implementing a network of new military checkpoints that have hampered the movement of commerce and workers.

Vehicles can wait for hours as soldiers inspect everyone, unlike before the war, when many were waved through. Other roads are shut off completely. In one case, the army closed a road linking 12 villages to the southern town of Dura, said local activist Badawi Jawaed. Many workers couldn't reach their jobs and were laid off, he said.

Violence has surged, with increased Israeli raids targeting armed groups. More than 700 West Bank Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, the Palestinian Health Ministry says. Many were shot dead in armed clashes, others for throwing stones at troops. But some appear to have posed no apparent threat.

In Israel, Palestinians can earn double or triple a West Bank salary. Standing in their way is Israel's barrier, running some 700 kilometers (400 miles) long and peaking at 7-meters (23-feet) tall.

Many climb over with ladders and ropes. Others hide in trucks that pass through checkpoints. Some slip through holes in fencing, workers and experts said.

Ayyed once worked for an Israeli construction company that paid 7,000 shekels ($1,850) monthly. Cut off from the job since the war began, he searched for work in his home city of Jenin, in the northern West Bank.

Ayyed said he tried grocery stores and restaurants, but no one was hiring.

To get by, he borrowed money from friends, racking up around $1,600 in debt. He cut back on water and electricity. By spring, he had no one left to borrow from and a $500 monthly rent bill to pay.

So he decided to risk it.

As he scaled the wall, the ladder slipped. Ayyed fell to the ground on the West Bank side, breaking his leg. He limped home penniless.

Palestinian smugglers or middlemen linked to gangs on both sides of the barrier arrange the crossings. They provide ladders and rope, as well as vehicles on the Israeli side to whisk workers away from the patrolled barrier.

They charge 300 to 1,000 shekels ($79 to $260), said Arafat Amro, a Palestinian labor rights expert.

Once through, work isn't hard to find, due to a labor shortage across Israel, mostly in construction and agriculture, Palestinian workers and Amro said.

To evade Israeli authorities, Palestinian workers are ""sleeping in the fields, they sleep in the farms, they sleep under the trees, at the construction sites,"" Amro said.

Raouf Adra, a laborer from Yatta, said he found two week's work on a construction site in the southern Israeli town of Dimona that would have paid 350 shekels ($65) daily. After climbing the barrier and reaching the site, he was told he was forbidden to leave after his shifts, to prevent discovery.

The next day, Israeli police stormed the site, arresting Adra and several other Palestinians. The Israeli site manager was nowhere to be seen.

""He ran away,"" Adra said.

Adra was handed a 40-day prison sentence and fined 1,500 shekels ($390). Once released, he was transported back to the West Bank and banned from entering Israel for three years.

Unable to walk after his fall in May, Ayyed said he had to sell the gold his family gave his wife as a wedding present and then his car.

""I know people who sold their furniture,"" he said.

Four months later, his broken leg is almost completely healed.

Asked if he would try again, he replied: ""If the situation remains the same, I will consider it."""
Vance and Walz focus their attacks on the top of the ticket  --  not each other: VP debate takeaways,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-takeaways-vance-walz-harris-trump-5b6f219b555416ff579764048ac238a1,2024-10-02T02:25:01Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice Presidential hopefuls Tim Walz and JD Vance squared off Tuesday night in what may be the last debate of the 2024 presidential campaign. It was the first encounter between Minnesota's Democratic governor and Ohio's Republican senator, following last month's debate between the tops of their tickets, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

No more debates are on the political calendar before Election Day. Tuesday's confrontation came as the global stakes of the contest rose again as Iran fired missiles at Israel. The vice presidential hopefuls sparred over the violence in the Middle East, climate change and immigration. Here are some takeaways from Tuesday's debate.

Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel on Tuesday elicited a contrast between the Democratic and Republican tickets on foreign policy: Walz promised ""steady leadership"" under Harris while Vance pledged a return to ""peace through strength"" if Trump is returned to the White House.

The differing visions of what American leadership should look like overshadowed the sharp policy differences between the two tickets.

The Iranian threat to the region and U.S. interests around the world opened the debate, with Walz pivoting the topic to criticism of Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, then referenced the ""nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes"" and responding to global crises by tweet.

Vance, for his part, promised a return to ""effective deterrence"" under Trump against Iran, brushing back on Walz's criticism of Trump by attacking Harris and her role in the Biden administration.

""Who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years and the answer is your running mate, not mine,"" he said. He pointedly noted that the Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, happened ""during the administration of Kamala Harris.""

Vance and Walz trained the bulk of their attacks not on their on-stage rival, but on the running mates who weren't in the room.

Both vice presidential nominees sought to convey a genial mien as they lobbed criticism at Harris and Trump, respectively.

It was a reflection of the fact that most voters don't cast a ballot based on the vice president, and on a vice presidential nominee's historic role in serving as the attack dog for their running mates.

Walz pointedly attacked Trump for failing to meet his pledge of building a physical barrier across the entire U.S.-Mexico border at the country's southern neighbor's expense.

""Less than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime,"" Walz said.

Underscoring the focus on the top of the ticket, during a back-and-forth about immigration, Vance said to his opponent: ""I think that you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does.""

In the wake of the devastation of Hurricane Helene, Vance took a question about climate change and gave an answer about jobs and manufacturing, taking a detour around Trump's past claims that global warming is a ""hoax.""

Vance contended that the best way to fight climate change was to move more manufacturing to the United States, because the country has the world's cleanest energy economy. It was a distinctly domestic spin on a global crisis, especially after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the international Paris climate accords during his administration.

Walz also kept the climate change focus domestic, touting the Biden administration's renewable energy investments as well as record levels of oil and natural gas production. ""You can see us becoming an energy superpower in the future,"" Walz said.

It was a decidedly optimistic take on a pervasive and grim global problem.

The two running mates agreed that the number of migrants in the U.S. illegally is a problem. But each laid the blame on the opposing presidential nominee.

Vance echoed Trump by repeatedly calling Harris the ""border czar"" and suggested that she, as vice president, single-handedly rolled back the immigration restrictions Trump had imposed as president. The result, in Vance's telling, is an unchecked flow of fentanyl, strain on state and local resources and increased housing prices around the country.

Harris was never asked to be the ""border czar"" and she was never specifically given the responsibility for security on the border. She was tasked by Biden in March 2021 with tackling the ""root causes"" of migration from the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and pushing leaders there and in Mexico to enforce immigration laws. Harris was not empowered to set U.S. immigration policy -- only the president can sign executive orders and Harris was not empowered as Biden's proxy in negotiations with Congress on immigration law.

Walz advanced Democrats' arguments that Trump single-handedly killed a bipartisan Senate deal to tighten border security and boost the processing system for immigrants and asylum seekers. Republicans backed off the deal, Walz noted, only after Trump said it wasn't good enough."

Taremi, who joined from Porto in the offseason, played a crucial role in Inter's 4-0 victory over Red Star in the Champions League by also setting up two of Inter's other goals.

Inter was already 1-0 up courtesy of sumptuous Hakan Çalhanoğlu free kick when Taremi stole the ball off Red Star midfielder Rade Krunic and rolled it across the area for Marko Arnautovic to tap in at the back post in the 59th minute.

Taremi set up another 12 minutes later when, despite being tripped by Uros Spajic, he managed to get up -- after somersaulting on the ground -- and send Lautaro Martínez through.

Lautaro, one of Inter's usual penalty takers, more than returned the favor shortly afterward when a penalty was awarded for a foul on him by Vanja Drkusic.

Lautaro handed the ball to Taremi and embraced the Iranian. Taremi had a long wait to take his penalty amid problems with the VAR communication system, but kept his cool to drive the spotkick past Glazer.

Shortly before kickoff at San Siro, Iran launched at least 180 missiles into Israel -- the latest in a series of escalating attacks in a yearslong conflict between Israel and Iran and its Arab allies that threatens to push the Middle East closer toward a regionwide war."

What to know about Hezbollah's capabilities after its recent losses,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-nasrallah-ground-operation-c14b6079a847fde6f7f9ce148ea55053,2024-10-01T19:05:17Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Hezbollah has suffered some of the heaviest losses in its history over the past two weeks, chief among them the killing of its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah, in an Israeli airstrike.

Two weeks ago, thousands of communications devices used by Hezbollah members exploded, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000 in an apparent remotely detonated attack that Hezbollah blamed on Israel.

The Lebanese militant group has lost nearly 500 fighters since it started attacking Israeli military posts in support of its ally, Hamas, last October. And hundreds more were likely killed in Israel's bombardment of Lebanon over the past week, which has killed a number of high-ranking commanders and officials.

Still, Hezbollah has continued to launch rockets at central Israel. The group's chief spokesman, Mohammed Afif, warned Tuesday that those attacks were only the beginning and that the militant group is waiting for invading forces to enter Lebanon to confront them.

Iran, which backs Hezbollah, fired dozens of missiles into Israel on Tuesday and referenced Nasrallah's death in a statement on state television claiming responsibility for the attack. The bombardment came a day after Israel said it had begun limited ground operations against Hezbollah in southern Lebanon.

Here's a look at where Hezbollah stands after its recent losses.

Hezbollah's tens of thousands of fighters have been battle-hardened in regional conflicts, including in Syria, where the militant group helped tip the balance of power in the 13-year conflict in favor of President Bashar Assad.

Hezbollah has five main units, each consisting of several thousand fighters.

The Nasr and Aziz units are deployed in areas bordering Israel, with Nasr controlling the southeastern region including the edge of the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. The Aziz unit is deployed in the southwest, including along the Mediterranean coast. Nasr and Aziz commanders were killed in Israeli airstrikes earlier this year but were believed to have been replaced.

The Badr unit is deployed in an area that includes Apple province, a mountainous region overlooking large parts of southern Lebanon that has been a Hezbollah stronghold since the late 1980s. The Haidar unit is in the eastern Bekaa Valley while the Dahiyeh unit is in Beirut's heavily populated southern suburb that housed the group's headquarters where Nasrallah was killed Friday.

The group also has the elite Radwan Force of several thousand fighters, part of which is deployed along the border with Israel. Hezbollah's Al-Manar TV said in a report Monday that invading Israeli troops will get to know the experienced fighters of Radwan Force if they decide to launch a ground invasion.

In recent weeks, Hezbollah has lost some of its most experienced military commanders, including Ibrahim Akil, who was in charge of the Radwan Force, and Ibrahim Kobbeisi, who was the group's missiles commander.

The commander of Hezbollah's drones unit, Mohammed Surour, and the commander of Hezbollah forces in south Lebanon, Ali Karaki, were also killed in air strikes.

In late July, Israel killed Hezbollah's top military commander, Fouad Shukur.

Among the group's commanders who are still active is Talal Hamieh, who is in charge of Hezbollah's external operations, and Khodor Nader, who heads the group's security unit. Hezbollah denied Israeli statements that claimed to have killed senior military commander known as Abu Ali Rida, commander of the Badr unit.

The group's strongman, Hashem Safieddine, Nasrallah's maternal cousin, is also alive and widely expected to replace Nasrallah as Hezbollah secretary-general. Safieddine is close to Iran and his son, Rida, is married to Zeinab Soleimani, the daughter of an Iranian general who was killed in a U.S. airstrike in Iraq in 2020.

Hezbollah has an arsenal of more than 150,000 rockets and missiles as well as surveillance and explosive drones of different types.

Over the past year, Hezbollah has used a small type of guided missile known as Almas, or Diamond, as well as short-range Falaq and Burkan rockets from areas several kilometers (miles) from the border. Over the past week, Hezbollah introduced the middle-range Fadi rockets, attacking the outskirts of Tel Aviv and the northern city of Haifa.

Hezbollah has yet to use all the weapons it is believed to possess, including its precision-guided missiles and surface-to-sea missiles such as the Russian-made Yakhont.

Israeli officials say its bombardment of large swaths of Lebanon over the past week aimed to take out Hezbollah's supplies of weapons. However, since the escalation began, Hezbollah has continued to launch attacks across the border and even unveiled new types of weapons.

On Tuesday, Hezbollah said it fired middle-range Fadi-4 rockets toward the headquarters of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency. Hours later, the group said it fired similar rockets toward an air base in a Tel Aviv suburb. The group has used surface-to-air missiles and shot down or chased off Israeli drones on several occasions -- including in the past week.

Most of the incoming fire has either been intercepted or landed in open areas. But Israeli military officials warn that the country's air defenses are not hermetic."
A man in South Lebanon cares for pets left behind as residents flee Israeli bombs,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-dogs-pets-hussein-hamza-0cfef8b03035713b71de395358928b3b,2024-10-01T16:23:22Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- A dog clings to Hussein Hamza inside a car as he pans his camera around to show the aftermath of an Israeli airstrike in southern Lebanon.

""Poor thing. Look at this, he's clinging to me out of fear,"" Hamza says in the video he posted online. ""A missile hit here,"" he said, his voice shaking.

As Israel pummels southern Lebanon with airstrikes, tens of thousands of residents are fleeing their homes in fear. But Hamza is staying. His mission is to care for the dogs and other animals left behind.

He runs an animal shelter that houses 200 dogs in the village of Kfour. Recently, he has also been driving around towns and villages in the south, looking for stray animals and abandoned pets to feed.

""I opened bags of food and left them water. I'm relying on God,"" said Hamza as he spread food hundreds of meters away from the shelter he runs, in case the dogs need to escape the facility when airstrikes come too close.

Israel has dramatically stepped up its airstrikes across many parts of Lebanon, which it says target Hezbollah and its weapons. However over a 1,000 people have been killed in the country in the past two weeks, nearly a quarter of them women and children, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

The Lebanese government says the fighting may have displaced up to a million people, although the U.N. estimate is around 200,000.

With his town under constant bombardment, Hamza, 56, refused to abandon the animals in his care.

Despite the danger, Hamza drives around looking for stray animals and pets left behind by families, many of them abandoned behind locked gates. He brings them food, and then posts the videos online.

""Come here, come here! I got you food,"" Hamza called to a dog hiding behind a fence in one of his online videos. ""At least unleash your dogs,"" he pleads with residents in his videos. ""The dog owners had to escape on foot and couldn't take them.""

In the midst of the chaos, Hamza has become a lifeline for many who reach out to him, hoping he can get food to their pets.

""This nice man called me, crying. They (the family) left the dogs behind the fence, and they couldn't take them,"" he said. ""I just got the dogs dry food.""

Hamza's journey has been perilous. On more than one occasion, he's narrowly avoided airstrikes.

His work extends beyond dogs. ""We found a chicken on the road,"" Hamza explained in another clip. ""It flew from a pickup truck. I will take it home.""

Hamza's shelter has attracted support online, allowing him to buy 200 bags of dog food to distribute to the dogs in the region.

Even so, the danger keeps mounting. ""I hope someone can take some load off my shoulders,"" Hamza said as he picked up an elderly stray dog off the street and into his car.

""God help people. At the time of a strike, people lose it and don't know what to do,"" he said while dropping off food and water in remote areas.

With an Israeli ground invasion of south Lebanon looking increasingly likely, Hamza worries about what comes next.

US sanctions extremist West Bank settler group for violence against Palestinians,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hilltop-youth-sanctions-israel-gaza-settler-treasury-west-bank-extremist-53fb26077c8d88637b4bd366ad3343cb,2024-10-01T15:22:47Z,"In addition, the State Department placed diplomatic sanctions on two men -- Israeli settler Eitan Yardeni, for his connection to violence targeting West Bank civilians and Avichai Suissa, the leader of Hashomer Yosh, a sanctioned group that brings young volunteers to settler farms across the territory, including small farming outposts that rights groups say are the primary drivers of settler violence across the territory.

The sanctions, which expose people to asset freezes and travel and visa bans, come as violence against Palestinians in the West Bank has exploded since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, following the deadly terrorist attacks of October 7th.

Palestinians report verbal and physical harassment, restriction of movement, and face intimidation by settlers circling their properties on motorbikes, cars or horses and spying via drones.

The Treasury Department said Hilltop Youth has carried out killings and mass arson, while rights groups and Palestinians say the group is behind ""price tag"" attacks - attacks on Palestinian villages in retaliation for perceived efforts to hamper settlement construction.

The group may prove difficult to effectively sanction, as it is loosely organized and decentralized. In addition, Israel's finance minister has previously vowed to intervene on sanctioned settlers' behalf.

In the past, sanctioned settlers have told the AP that the measures have had little impact on their finances.

Hilltop Youth has already faced sanctions from the EU and UK.

The Biden administration has been criticized for imposing relatively few sanctions on Israeli extremists. According to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, 27 extremists and entities have been sanctioned by the U.S. under President Joe Biden 's February 2024 Executive Order related to maintaining West Bank stability.

The Treasury's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith said that the U.S. ""will continue to hold accountable the individuals, groups, and organizations that facilitate these hateful and destabilizing acts.""

State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said ""the actions of these individuals have contributed to creating an environment where violence and instability thrive. Their actions, collectively and individually, undermine peace, security, and stability in the West Bank.""

Johannesburg considers naming a street after a Palestinian woman who hijacked a plane,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-sandton-street-renaming-palestine-bec02d2b06debe710a27d3871c91d865,2024-10-01T14:34:01Z,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) -- Officials in South Africa's biggest city of Johannesburg have proposed renaming a major street after a Palestinian woman who was involved in a hijacking more than 50 years ago, sparking criticism from several political parties and the city's Jewish community.

The city council is considering naming the street in its financial district of Sandton after Leila Khaled, a Palestinian militant and member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine group.

Khaled, who is now 80 years old, gained infamy in 1969 when she was part of a group who hijacked a Trans World Airlines flight on a journey from Rome to Tel Aviv, Israel. She became known as the first woman to hijack a plane.

She was also one of two people who attempted to hijack an Israeli Airlines flight from Amsterdam to New York City the following year, which resulted in the other hijacker being fatally shot by air marshals.

Israel considers Khaled a terrorist, but she is widely seen as a hero and freedom fighter by Palestinians and by some in South Africa who support the Palestinian cause. The PFLP is part of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the internationally recognized representative of the Palestinian people. While the main PLO faction, Fatah, recognizes Israel's right to exist, the PFLP doesn't, and Israel, the United States and other Western allies of Israel consider it a terrorist group.

South Africa has historically close ties to the Palestinians and has accused Israel of committing genocide in the war in Gaza in a highly sensitive case that's being heard by the United Nations' top court. South Africa and Israel have been fiercely critical of each other over that case.

Khaled has previously visited South Africa.

The street renaming controversy dates back to 2018, when it was first proposed and reportedly sparked a brawl among Johannesburg city officials, according to local media coverage at the time. It was initially proposed by Al Jama-ah, a pro-Palestinian minority party in the Johannesburg council, and supported by the African National Congress, South Africa's largest political party.

The name change is being considered again and members of the public have until mid-October to register their objections.

The South African Zionist Federation said the proposed change was partly aimed at the fact that the U.S. consulate in Johannesburg is located on the same street, which is currently called Sandton Drive. SAZF spokesperson Rolene Marks said renaming the street ""after a failed terrorist with ties to a globally recognized terrorist organization"" would sow division in South Africa.

Marks has also previously called the proposal ""an affront to peace-loving South Africans"" and ""deliberately provocative"" toward Johannesburg's Jewish community.

Sandton Drive is a major road in the district of Sandton, which is considered to be the richest square mile in Africa. It's also been the site of several pro-Palestinian protests in recent months outside the U.S. consulate.

Fana Mkhonza, a council member for the African Christian Democratic Party, a South African political party opposed to the proposal, said Khaled did not qualify to have the street renamed after her, according to the city's policies. South Africa has renamed some streets in recent years to remove colonial references and better reflect and recognize the country's majority Black population, especially those who fought against the apartheid system of white minority rule that ended in 1994.

""As much as Ms. Khaled could be seen as a freedom fighter in a thin slice of South African society, her fight has been for the Palestinian cause, not for the development of Johannesburg,"" Mkhonza said. ""The ACDP does not see any tolerance, reconciliation and peace in this proposed person's name to replace Sandton Drive.""

Al Jama-ah said renaming the street would show solidarity with the Palestinian people and be a recognition of their struggle.

""While some argue that we should focus on South African heroes, we should not ignore international figures who have fought for justice and freedom,"" said Thapelo Ahmad, the Johannesburg chairperson of Al Jama-ah and the former mayor of the city who originally proposed the name change in 2018."
Yemen's Houthi rebels are looking to gain from continuing conflict in the Middle East,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthis-gaza-israel-defe499e9df870381f078ad3e3b667b5,2024-10-01T14:24:00Z,"CAIRO (AP) -- In the days since Israel intensified its campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, including the strike that killed the militant group's leader Hassan Nasrallah, Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have been quick to show they are an important player in the complex conflicts convulsing the Middle East.

In a brazen attack on Saturday, the Houthis fired a ballistic missile at Israel's main airport as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was arriving back from New York, where he had addressed the United Nations. On Monday, they threatened ""escalating military operations"" to target Israel after apparently shooting down a U.S. military drone flying over Yemen.

And on Tuesday, an explosive-loaded drone crashed into one ship in the Red Sea as a missile exploded against another, the British military and private security officials said, the latest in the Houthis' assaults on commercial shipping in the key waterway.

The salvo of Houthi attacks has again drawn attention to the Yemeni rebels and raised questions about their goals and strategies.

The rebels, armed by Iran, seized most of Yemen's north and its capital, Sanaa, a decade ago, pushing the country's internationally recognized government into exile.

A Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen's government entered the war in 2015 and the Houthis have since been fighting what has become a long-running but now largely stalemated civil war in Yemen.

However, when the Israel-Hamas war erupted in the Gaza Strip a year ago, the Houthis began targeting shipping throughout the Red Sea corridor -- part of a campaign they say aims at pressuring Israel and the West over the war.

Analysts and observers say a widening conflict could boost the Houthis militarily and expand their already outsized role across the region -- despite retaliatory strikes by Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom.

Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the Crisis Group, says that before the war in Gaza, the Houthis were seen as an often-forgotten and less-prominent faction in an axis that includes Iran, Syria's government forces, Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and other groups in the region.

That changed when the Houthis began hitting ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden making their way to the Suez Canal, suddenly posing a much wider threat.

""Over the past year, the Houthis have taken center stage,"" Nagi said.

After Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages, Israel responded with a blistering offensive on the Gaza Strip, a coastal enclave run by the Palestinian militant group.

Israel's retaliatory invasion of Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 95,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and militants in its count but says that over half of those killed are women and children.

The toll the war has taken and the extent of Gaza's destruction have shocked the world.

Meanwhile, the Houthis see the Yemenis' prevailing solidarity with Palestinians as a useful tool for recruiting new fighters and swelling their ranks, Nagi said

In June, the Houthis unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier one displayed by Iran, which Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speed.

The rebels fired their new ""Palestine"" missile -- complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf -- at the southern port of Eilat in Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no damage or injuries.

The extent of the Houthis' actions was a surprise to some, mainly because of their limited resources and Yemen's own costly civil war.

Nagi described their strategy as one of ""gradual escalation"" towards Israel. As their prominence grows, the Houthis -- who have for years relied on portable missile launchers and hit-and-run tactics -- will likely be eager to get their hands on more advanced weapons, he added.

The Houthis initially targeted vessels claimed to be linked to Israel and later expanded their campaign to include all commercial shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They used small boats, short-range missiles and drones to carry out those attacks.

Their campaign prompted a response by an international coalition, led by the U.S. and U.K., which in February launched strikes on ""sites associated with the Houthis' deeply buried weapons storage facilities, missile systems and launchers, air defense systems and radars,"" U.S. defense officials said.

In July, an Iranian-made drone launched by the Houthis struck Tel Aviv, killing one person and wounding 10. Israel responded with a wave of airstrikes on Houthi-held areas of Yemen, including the port city of Hodeida.

The Houthis have since warned they could expand their campaign beyond Mideast waters, to target ships using the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, or those in the Mediterranean Sea heading to Israel.

According to Faozi al-Goidi, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, the rebels are not likely to be deterred anytime soon and could also target vessels further out in the Indian Ocean.

They may also seek to ""partner with other militias to build an alliance that would threaten security in the region,"" al-Goidi said.

The New York-based Soufan Center, a think tank, said in a September report that the Houthis were increasing ""operational autonomy"" and diversifying their alliances away from Iran by cooperating with Russia, pointing to alleged plans for Russian weapons shipments to the Houthis that fell through.

The Houthis remain in control of most of Yemen's north where they enjoy popular support despite a dire economic situation and a brutal crackdown on dissent that has included humanitarian workers.

Their fight against Israel is likely to play into that. Thousands of Houthi supporters come out to Sanaa streets to rally every Friday, demanding justice for Palestinians and denouncing Israel and the U.S.

""Yemenis of all political backgrounds and ideologies support Palestinians and have a deep connection with them,"" said Yemeni political analyst Abdel-Bari Taher. That will help grow support for the Houthis, despite the rebels' ""oppressive policies against Yemenis.""

The Houthis may also seek to exploit their new-found stature following strikes against Israel in any potential negotiations with Saudi Arabia over a resolution to Yemen's civil war.

The have raised ""their ceiling for negotiations,"" said al-Goido. ""No one will ignore them anymore."""
What to know as Israel says it has launched ground incursion into Lebanon,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-what-to-know-hezbollah-incursion-c44358cb4c70db69bdab4b254cb2ed76,2024-10-01T12:20:10Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- Israel said its ground troops crossed into Lebanon overnight, launching what the military described as ""localized"" raids to root out Hezbollah fighters and infrastructure.

Hezbollah, meanwhile, said it saw no sign of Israeli forces and its troops were ready to confront them.

Israel said the incursion would be focused on the narrow strip of land just across the border. But it also issued evacuation warnings covering a wider swath of Lebanon, raising fears that a large-scale ground invasion was soon to come.

In recent days, a wave of Israeli airstrikes has killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and several of his top commanders, while driving hundreds of thousands of Lebanese from their homes. Israel says a ground operation is now necessary to return tens of thousands of displaced Israelis to their homes in the north, pummeled by continuous rocket fire from Hezbollah since Oct. 8.

Here's what we know:

The military says that Israeli troops entered Lebanon late Monday. A military official who spoke on the condition of anonymity in line with military regulations declined to say whether troops were rotating in and out of the country or were stationed there for the foreseeable future.

The Lebanese army and UNIFIL, a U.N. peacekeeping force stationed in the zone that Israeli forces purportedly entered, have not confirmed that Israeli troops crossed the border, although UNIFIL said it was notified that they were going to.

The military official said that at this point Israeli ground troops are ""within walking distance"" of the border, targeting the small Lebanese villages hundreds of meters (yards) from Israeli territory.

The military says Hezbollah militants remain in the area, despite heavy Israeli bombardment over the past few weeks. It says they are using the areas to launch attacks on Israel and to store weapons.

There were no signs of ground combat late Monday and early Tuesday in southern Lebanon.

The military official said there have been no clashes between Hezbollah militants and Israeli troops so far.

Meanwhile, cross-border fire continued. Hezbollah announced in statements that it had targeted groups of soldiers in several Israeli border areas with artillery shelling and rockets. Israel said no soldiers were injured and the targeting was unsuccessful.

Still, Israeli artillery units pummeled targets in southern Lebanon through the night and the sounds of airstrikes were heard throughout Beirut.

Hezbollah fired a rare volley of rockets toward central Israel on Tuesday, injuring one man, Israeli paramedics said.

Israel has not given a timetable for how long the incursion will last and has declined to specify how far troops will go.

The military official said that marching to Beirut, as Israel did in its 1982 invasion of Lebanon, is ""not on the table."" At the time, the Israeli invasion was also pitched as a limited incursion to push the Palestine Liberation Organization back.

He added that the operation in its current stages does not mirror Israel's ground incursions in Gaza, where the military entered cities with heavy manpower, artillery and tanks.

That could change, depending on whether Israel's government decides to launch a more extensive ground operation. Chris Coyle, a resident of Israel's north, told AP on Monday that Israeli tanks had been positioned along the border.

Troops that entered Lebanon are from the 98th division, the military said. The division is responsible for some of the heaviest fighting inside Gaza and includes elite units specializing in attacks behind enemy lines.

Meanwhile, Israel is expanding its evacuation warnings in southern Lebanon, sending hundreds of thousands of Lebanese fleeing from the south.

On Tuesday, the Israeli military's Arabic-language spokesperson asked residents living in villages north of a U.N.-declared buffer zone to flee. Under a U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 war, the zone was supposed to be controlled by a U.N. peacekeeping force and the Lebanese military."
Israeli military orders evacuation of several Lebanese communities near the border,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-gaza-news-10-01-2024-eb175dff6e46906caea8b9e43dfbd3da,2024-10-01T09:52:17Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- The Israeli military on Tuesday ordered the evacuation of nearly two dozen Lebanese border communities.

The orders came hours after Israel sent ground forces into southern Lebanon in what it described as a limited incursion against the Hezbollah militant group.

The evacuation order, posted by the Israeli military's Arabic spokesman on the social media platform X, specified around two dozen communities in southern Lebanon and ordered people to evacuate north of the Awali River, some 60 kilometers (36 miles) from the border.

That is farther than the Litani River, which marks the northern edge of a U.N.-declared zone that was intended to serve as a buffer between Israel and Hezbollah after the 2006 war. The Litani River is 30 kilometers (18 miles) from the border."
Suspected Yemen Houthi rebel attack targets ship in Red Sea,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthi-rebels-red-sea-attacks-israel-hamas-war-2faa48176d4f773003b6a4a3ad5ca73d,2024-10-01T05:12:20Z,"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- A suspected attack Tuesday by Yemen's Houthi rebels targeted a ship in the Red Sea, likely marking their first assault on commercial shipping in weeks as the Israel-Hamas war threatens to become a regional conflict.

The attack comes as Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon after days of Israeli airstrikes that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other top leaders and the earlier explosions of sabotaged electronic devices used by the Shiite militia. The Houthis had threatened ""escalating military operations"" targeting Israel on Monday after they apparently shot down a U.S. military drone flying over the country.

The attack Tuesday morning took place off the port city of Hodeida in the Red Sea, which has become a battlefield for shippers since the Houthis began their campaign targeting ships traveling through a waterway that once saw $1 trillion a year of cargo pass through it.

A captain on a ship saw four ""splashes"" near his vessel, the British military's United Kingdom Maritime Trade Operations center said in a warning. That likely would have been missiles or drones launched at the vessel.

""All crew are safe and the vessel is proceeding to (its) next port of call,"" the UKMTO said.

The Houthis did not immediately claim the attack. However, they sometimes take hours or days to acknowledge one of their assaults.

Houthis have targeted more than 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones since the war in Gaza started in October. They have seized one vessel and sank two in the campaign that has also killed four sailors. Other missiles and drones have either been intercepted by a U.S.-led coalition in the Red Sea or failed to reach their targets, which have included Western military vessels.

The rebels maintain that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the United Kingdom to force an end to Israel's campaign against Hamas in Gaza. However, many of the ships attacked have little or no connection to the conflict, including some bound for Iran.

The last attack on a merchant ship by the Houthis came on Sept. 2.

The Houthis claimed an attack targeted American warships last week. The rebels fired more than a half dozen ballistic missiles and anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships that were traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait, but all were intercepted by the Navy destroyers, a U.S. official said Friday. The official spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss details not yet publicly released."
"A former hostage fought for her own life in Gaza. A year on, she fights for her husband's freedom",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hostages-gaza-tunnels-hamas-israel-war-d8ecb415268e911cea09518acdaf7ba2,2024-10-01T04:44:25Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- As a hostage in Gaza, Aviva Siegel found herself begging for food and water. Since her release, she has found herself begging for her husband to be set free from his own ongoing captivity.

Siegel has come to embody the disaster that befell Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Armed Hamas militants snatched her from her home and thrust her into Gaza's web of tunnels. Released during a brief cease-fire in November, she returned to find her community destroyed and became one of tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by conflict. She has emerged as a prominent voice in the struggle to free the remaining hostages, fighting tirelessly for her husband's release.

But as her ordeal reaches the one-year mark, Israel's attention is focused not on the plight of the hostages and their families, but on fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon. It's the latest diversion to chip away at Siegel's hope that she may reunite with her husband of 43 years anytime soon.

""The hostages, they are being left to die. To die slowly. How can I handle that? I just don't know how to handle it anymore,"" she said, sitting beside a poster of her husband, Keith, a 65-year-old American Israeli originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Her torment is all the more acute because she knows firsthand what her husband is enduring.

""Hostages were chained, tortured, starved, beaten up into pieces. I saw that in front of my eyes. That's what they did to us,"" she said from a short-term rental apartment in Tel Aviv, one of the many places she has lived since her return during the November cease-fire, the first and only deal reached between Israel and Hamas during the war.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue the war until ""total victory"" over Hamas and pledged to bring home the hostages, but has faced widespread criticism that dozens remain captive a year after the attack. Netanyahu has also argued that the pressure on Hezbollah will, in turn, lead to pressure on its ally Hamas and help speed up the release of the hostages.

The Siegels were jolted awake on Oct. 7 at their home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, one of the hardest-hit communities that day, by a burst of air raid sirens. Like so many others, they took cover in their safe room, built to protect against rocket attacks, that turned out to be no match for the rifle- and grenade-toting Hamas militants who stormed their home.

In its attack, Hamas kidnapped roughly 250 people, including women, children and older people. It killed some 1,200 people -- most of them civilians -- according to Israeli authorities. The war the attack sparked has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to health officials in Gaza.

Hamas has said the hostages are treated humanely, but multiple accounts from freed hostages contradict that.

The militants led the Siegels out of their house, shoved her husband, breaking his ribs, and shot him in the hand, Siegel said. They were forced into their own car and driven into Gaza, where crowds of onlookers cheered at their capture.

Their first stop was a home with a living room that opened up into an underground tunnel.

""And there's somebody underneath the hole, in the hole underneath the ground, that's waiting with a smile, happy as can be. I'll never forget his face,"" she said.

They climbed down a steep ladder into the tunnel, one of several they were held in throughout Siegel's 51 days in captivity. All told, Siegel was moved around 13 times, held in both tunnels and militants' homes, she said.

On the first day, they were joined by other hostages and they were brought pita and cheese, which hardly anyone ate because they were all in shock. But throughout her captivity, food was scarce and Siegel said there were entire days when she wasn't brought anything to eat.

""They used to starve us while they ate in front of us and not bring us water for hours and days. I had an infection in my stomach, I was dehydrated. We had to beg -- beg -- for water. Beg and beg for food.""

The first tunnel had light -- others did not -- as well as a fan that labored to circulate the scant air. Seven hostages were held in a room Siegel described as being about the size of three yoga mats. She found comfort in having her husband by her side throughout.

She brushed her teeth four times over those weeks and washed herself the same amount, in salt water.

""It's disgusting. We were filthy. Dirty. The smell that came out of us is the worst that you can imagine,"" she said.

But worse was the treatment from the guards. Siegel, a 63-year-old grandmother of five, said she was pushed and yanked by the hair and shoved into cars.

Her captors told her that Hamas had taken over her kibbutz and that Israel didn't care about freeing her. So she was in disbelief when freedom came on Nov. 26. But it came at a price: Her husband was to remain behind.

Her parting words to him were, ""Be strong for me,"" and she promised to be strong for him.

Since their painful goodbye, she has crisscrossed Israel and the world, sharing her story and pleading for her husband's release. She has met Netanyahu, United States President Joe Biden and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, among others. She has spoken repeatedly to Israeli lawmakers and become a fixture at weekly protests in support of the hostages.

But her energetic advocacy has been beaten down by the horrific twists and turns of the war. Since her release, she has watched multiple rounds of hostage negotiations collapse. Hostages have been killed by Hamas but also mistakenly by Israeli forces, and some have been rescued.

The fighting in Israel's north, and the stunning assassination of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, feels like another blow to her struggle, which has faded from the public consciousness.

Siegel said she can't bring herself to watch a video of her husband that Hamas released in April. Clearly filmed under duress, he says he is OK, but breaks down in tears and lays his head on his knees, sobbing.

She finds the strength to soldier on by thinking about him, a vegetarian who loves reading books to his grandchildren and studied Arabic so he could converse with workers from Gaza who were employed in the kibbutz. But a year on, her hope is wearing thin.

""I don't know why I get up,"" she said. ""But I do know that I have to get up for Keith."""

Leaders depart UN facing prospect of a wider Mideast war  --  but with a blueprint for a better future,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-leaders-mideast-war-multilateralism-inequality-netanyahu-a6396f79d45a67b44c97f8ece2eec619,2024-10-01T01:25:29Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- They gathered at the United Nations surrounded by unsettling warnings of an escalating conflict that could engulf the Middle East and further shatter international relations that are based on ""multilateralism"" -- nations working together and sharing power. A week later, world leaders headed home with the prospect of a broader war intensifying and global divisions front and center, not only in the Mideast but elsewhere.

There was no expectation of major breakthroughs in the public and private meetings at the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting of presidents, premiers and other leaders. There rarely is. But this year was especially grim, with no end in sight to the three major conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, and Israeli military action in Lebanon escalating.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' warning that multilateralism needs to be brought back ""from the brink"" added to the gloom, along with speech after speech decrying failures to tackle climate change and address growing inequalities between rich and poor nations, and warning of artificial intelligence with no guardrails and the potential of killer weapons with no human control.

General Assembly President Philémon Yang concluded the weeklong, high-level meeting Monday afternoon, calling it ""particularly tumultuous"" and pointing to the ""violent conflicts"" that are raging.

""This is, unfortunately, not an exhaustive list of the crises and conflicts affecting member states of the United Nations,"" he lamented.

There was no disagreement that multilateralism is broken, that this founding principle of the United Nations - established in 1945 on the ashes of World War II -- needs urgent resuscitation to deal with the challenges the world faces today.

One example: During the very hour on Friday when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the General Assembly that his country genuinely wants peace -- a goal stressed by virtually every leader -- Israeli warplanes were bombing areas around Beirut in a lethal barrage.

In the last few days, Yang said, the world has seen ""an extremely dramatic escalation"" between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon that risks war in the entire Middle East. ""As we speak, peace in the Middle East is hanging delicately on a shoestring,"" he warned..

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said this year's meeting of leaders - with its marquee speeches known in U.N.-speak as the ""general debate"" - took place at ""a very serious and a very intense time.""

""The world doesn't stop for the general debate,"" he told reporters Monday. ""So we were focused very much on what member states said, but we continue to be very much focused on what is going on in the world outside of this building.""

There was one positive development welcomed by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and many leaders: The adoption of a ""Pact for the Future"" at a summit just before world leaders began their addresses to the General Assembly. The 42-page blueprint aims to bring the 193 U.N. member nations together to meet today's challenges, from climate change and artificial intelligence to escalating conflicts and increasing inequality and poverty.

It challenges leaders of countries large and small, rich and poor, to turn promises into actions. Whether that happens remains to be seen. Yang, the assembly president, said his office has already instituted ""an awareness-raising campaign"" to spur implementation.

In an illustration of the blend of woe and weary hope that percolated through the gathering, Burundi's foreign minister, Albert Shingiro, on Monday decried an international community where ""most of us act like we were alone in the world, like others didn't exist or didn't count.""

Still, he said, the consensus on the Pact for the Future ""shows that multilateralism is not dead and buried.""

From the vantage points where leaders of smaller or less powerful nations sit, the U.N. can't change the world without changing itself. Founded with 51 member countries, it now has 193, and many feel included only to a point.

""We must ensure that global institutions give developing countries, especially small, vulnerable ones like my own, seats at the tables of decision-making,"" said Barbados' prime minister, Mia Mottley. ""The anger and mistrust of our citizens in institutions, in leaders and in multilateralism and its processes which exclude, while yielding much talk and little action, is very real.""

Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, head of Bangladesh's interim government, said ""time demands new attitudes, new values, new compacts, across communities and countries.""

""I believe, the world needs to engage on a shared vision of 'three zeroes' that we can materialize together, targeting zero poverty, zero unemployment, and, zero net carbon emissions -- where a young person anywhere in the world will have opportunities to grow, not as a job seeker but as entrepreneur,"" he told the assembly.

During the global gathering, the assembly heard from 190 countries - all but Brunei, Myanmar and Afghanistan. The speakers included 71 heads of state, 42 heads of government, six vice-presidents and crown princes, eight deputy prime ministers, 53 ministers, three vice-ministers and seven heads of delegations. Usually, the U.N. Security Council holds one meeting during the high-level week, but this year the council met about a half-dozen times because of the global conflicts and crises.

For all the alarm, leaders here are politicians, and many made a point of appealing at least somewhat to optimism. Perhaps none stressed it as much as U.S. President Joe Biden, making his last speech at the annual meeting after more than a half-century in public life.

He noted that humanity has brought to a close some of the seemingly intractable threats, conflicts and injustices that beset the world when he was elected as a senator in 1972, from the Cold War to apartheid in South Africa.

""Things can get better,"" Biden said. ""We should never forget that.""

It also threatens to unleash further devastation on Lebanon, where hundreds have been killed in recent Israeli strikes and hundreds of thousands have been displaced.

Hezbollah is a well-trained militia, believed to have tens of thousands of fighters and an arsenal of 150,000 rockets and missiles. The last round of fighting in 2006 ended in a stalemate."

The incursion follows weeks of heavy blows by Israel against Hezbollah -- including an airstrike that killed its longtime leader, Hassan Nasrallah - and seeks to step up the pressure on the Lebanese militant group. The last time Israel and Hezbollah engaged in ground combat was a monthlong war in 2006.

The Israeli military said in a brief statement it had begun ""limited, localized and targeted ground raids"" against Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon.

""These targets are located in villages close to the border and pose an immediate threat to Israeli communities in northern Israel,"" it said.

There was no word on how long the operation would last, but the army said soldiers had been training and preparing for the mission in recent months."

A group that has labeled Vice President Harris a ""pro-genocide candidate"" has endorsed third-party presidential candidate Jill Stein in the 2024 contest.

The Abandon Harris campaign says America, as well as presidential candidates Harris and former President Trump, is supporting an ""Israeli project of Palestinian annihilation"" and urges Muslim Americans and those who oppose genocide to cast their ballot for the Green Party this year.

""In October 2023, under the darkening shadow of the U.S.-backed Israeli project of Palestinian annihilation, the Abandon Harris campaign - formerly Abandon Biden - was born. Our movement remains dedicated to ensuring that the American people, especially the Muslim-American community, recognize the responsibility we share in standing up against oppression and using all our power to stop genocide - wherever it may arise,"" the group declared in a press release.

""We are confronting two destructive forces: one currently overseeing a genocide and another equally committed to continuing it. Both are determined to see it through. We call on Muslim-Americans and all those who stand firmly against genocide to vote for the Green Party in 2024,"" the press release states.

Stein has expressed her gratitude to the group and its support of her candidacy.

The Abandon Harris campaign says on its website that its ""current goal is to hold Harris accountable for her continued support of genocide.""

""It's painfully obvious that Kamala Harris can only sound articulate and firm when parroting US support for Israel,"" the group wrote in an August post on X. ""She fumbles through everything else, but when it comes to endorsing the killing of Palestinians, she suddenly finds a pristine level of eloquence,"" the post added.

Israel launched a war effort last year in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks perpetrated by Hamas terrorists who committed atrocities that included rapes, kidnappings, and murders.

""What Hamas did that day was pure evil - it was brutal and sickening,"" Harris said in a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the attack on Monday. ""I will do everything in my power to ensure that the threat Hamas poses is eliminated, that it is never again able to govern Gaza, that it fails in its mission to annihilate Israel, and that the people of Gaza are free from the grip of Hamas,"" she declared in the statement.

Islamic group calls out Jets for firing Robert Saleh after wearing Lebanon pin amid Israel war,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/islamic-group-calls-out-jets-firing-robert-saleh-after-wearing-lebanon-pin-amid-israel-war,2024-10-08T21:12:39Z,"Emmanuel Acho reacts to the New York Jets firing HC Robert Saleh after a 20-36 record and 2-3 start this season.

The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) released a statement on Tuesday addressing the firing of former New York Jets head coach Robert Saleh.

CAIR called on the Jets and owner Woody Johnson to explain reports that Saleh was escorted out of the building by security following his firing, and also brought up the fact that Saleh was fired just days after wearing a pin with the Lebanese flag amid ongoing attacks on the nation by Israel.

Saleh is of Lebanese descent and was the first Muslim head coach in NFL history.

""We commend Coach Robert Saleh for making history as the first American Muslim head coach in NFL history. Although no one should jump to conclusions about why the Jets fired Coach Saleh, the report that Jets security physically escorted Saleh out of the building does raise concerns about the possible motive for such unusual hostility -- especially given that Saleh wore a Lebanese flag pin at a game just days ago and that owner Woody Johnson is a former Trump administration official who has been accused of making racially charged remarks. We encourage the Jets to thoroughly explain its unusually hostile reported treatment of Coach Saleh,"" the statement read.

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Jets for comment multiple times but has not received a response at the time of publication.

Both of Saleh's parents were born in Lebanon and immigrated to the United States ahead of his birth in 1979. Saleh previously wore the Lebanese flag on his arm during a game against the Giants, just weeks after Hamas terrorists attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

Saleh wore that patch during the week that NFL executive vice president of club business Peter O'Reilly released a statement encouraging players to represent their heritage via decals to the back of their helmets with their flags, while coaches added a patch to their team gear.

Saleh's decision to wear the patch in London on Sunday came amid Israel's ongoing strikes on Lebanon and Gaza as it seeks to combat Hamas and Hezbollah.

CAIR's point that Johnson ""has been accused of making racially charged remarks,"" references an investigation in 2020 that never confirmed whether Johnson made those remarks. Johnson was accused of making racist and sexist comments to staff while serving as an ambassador to the United Kingdom under the Trump administration. Johnson was investigated in July 2020 by the State Department watchdog after the allegations.

Johnson denied the allegations in a post on the official X (then known as Twitter) account for the U.S. ambassador to the U.K. that same month.

FORMER JETS QUARTERBACK REVISITS AWKWARD HUG BETWEEN ROBERT SALEH, ARRON RODGERS AFTER FIRING

""I have followed the ethical rules and requirements of my office at all times. These false claims of insensitive remarks about race and gender are totally inconsistent with my longstanding record and values,"" Johnson wrote.

The investigation's findings have never been made public.

At the time, Johnson was not involved with the Jets, as he was tending to his diplomatic duties for Trump. Still, the Jets released a statement regarding the allegations against Johnson and noted his denial of them.

""Since the Johnson family became owners of the New York Jets, the organization has consistently and actively supported, engaged and encouraged the development of many different social justice, diversity, women's, and inclusion initiatives,"" the team said in a statement. ""One of our fundamental principles is treating employees, players, coaches and fans with respect and dignity, regardless of their race, color, religion, or gender. These principles have been established by the Johnson family, which Woody implemented in our organization over the past 20 years.""

Saleh was hired by the Jets in January 2021 while Johnson was in the final month of his duties as ambassador to the U.K. Therefore, the owner did not make the final decision to hire Saleh. It was Johnson's brother, Christopher Johnson, who made the decision to hire Saleh.

When Trump left office and Woody Johnson returned to his duties as Jets owner, he kept Saleh employed for three straight seasons, none of which resulted in trips to the playoffs or winning records. Saleh went 20-36 with New York and never won more than seven games a year while at the helm.

Then, when Saleh was fired on Tuesday, the coach was reportedly escorted out of the team facility by security, according to multiple reports. The most recent head coach to be fired by the Jets, Adam Gase, was fired after the conclusion of his second season and was reportedly not removed by security.

The Jets were off to a 2-3 start this year after losing to the Minnesota Vikings 23-17 in London on Sunday, as New York is among the most penalized teams in the league this year. The Jets have struggled this year despite veteran star quarterback Aaron Rodgers starting all five games this season."
Prospects of a deal with Israel fade away as Saudis invite Iranian foreign minister to visit,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iran-foreign-minister-saudi-arabia-deal-israel,2024-10-08T20:45:15Z,"One year ago, Saudi Arabia and Israel were supposedly on the brink of a deal to normalize relations.

That deal has seemingly evaporated as Iran's foreign minister visits the kingdom on Tuesday to discuss efforts to halt Israel's incursions into Gaza and Lebanon.

""Our dialogue continues regarding the developments in the region to prevent the shameless crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon, in continuation of the crimes in Gaza,"" Iran Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a video broadcast on state media.

He added: ""Starting today, I'll begin a trip to the region, to Riyadh and other capitals, and we will strive for a collective movement from the countries of the region... to stop the brutal attacks in Lebanon.""

The Saudis share a longtime strategic partnership with the U.S. and are the largest purchaser of its weapons. But in recent years, they've had a political rapprochement with Iran.

9/11 FAMILIES URGE TRUMP, HARRIS TO OPPOSE SAUDI DEAL UNTIL KINGDOM ADMITS INVOLVEMENT IN TERROR ATTACK

Last week, Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, reaffirmed their neutrality in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Iran has warned that if ""Israel supporters"" intervene directly, their interests in the region would be targeted. That could mean missile strikes on their oil facilities.

Iran rained some 200 missiles down on Israel last week, many of which were intercepted by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with U.S. assistance.

""The Gulf states think it's unlikely that Iran will strike their oil facilities, but the Iranians are dropping hints they might from unofficial sources. It's a tool the Iranians have against the U.S. and the global economy,"" Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to the royal court, said.

In 2019, drones attacked Saudi Arabia's key refinery at Abqaiq, briefly shutting down around 5% of the world's oil supply. Those drones originated in Iran, according to U.S. intelligence.

Prior to Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Biden administration considered a proposed deal, akin to the Abraham Accords, a major priority. This deal aimed to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, including security guarantees and cooperation on civil nuclear matters. For months, the White House had been saying the deal was nearly done.

The prospect of a deal was largely blamed as a catalyst for the Hamas attacks.

OPINION: WHY SAUDI ARABIA MATTERS MORE THAN EVER TO THE US

""I don't think we were ever really that close,"" Robert Greenway, former senior director of the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital.

""We were closest probably in the waning days of the Trump administration, but we knew that that would be a second-term issue if there was to be one, and obviously that didn't play out. I don't know that the Biden-Harris administration ever took it that terribly seriously.""

Just before the Hamas attack, a group of 20 Democratic senators made clear their opposition to the treaty, voicing concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record and that a peaceful nuclear energy program might one day be converted to a military one to produce a nuclear weapon.

And Oct. 7 changed the Saudis' calculus: they now demand a plan for a Palestinian state.

""If anyone believes there was a chance of getting the House or Senate in an election year with virtually no majority, getting anything as controversial as a security treaty, with Saudi Arabia - permission for them to enrich with our blessing and support - I don't know if anyone credibly believes that that was ever possible.""

Former deputy national security adviser Victoria Coates was optimistic that the Saudis could be brought back into the fold.

""From what I'm hearing from both sides, it's when, not if,"" she said. ""There are various reasons you might want to wait to find out what the makeup of the Congress is going to be... you're going to need supportive majorities in the Senate to get [a civil nuclear agreement] through."""
Saudi Arabia | Fox News,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/category/world/world-regions/saudi-arabia,2024-10-08T20:39:50Z,"The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia is the largest sovereign state in the Middle East and makes up the majority of the Arabian Peninsula. The country is ruled by the Al Saud royal family along with a coalition of ultraconservative Wahhabi religious elites. Together, they enforce Islamic law and define themselves as an Arab Islamic State. The kingdom is home to Islam's holiest cities, Mecca and Medina.

Saudi Arabia is bordered by the Red Sea, Jordan, Kuwait, and Iraq while surrounded to its east by Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. It is the only country with a coastline on the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf. Mountains, arid deserts, and lowlands make up most of its terrain, and its largest city is the capital of Riyadh. The population of Saudi Arabia is more than 34 million people.

Approximately 8% of its total GDP is spent on the kingdom's military, which is ranked as the third largest army in the world, behind the United States and China. From 2015 to 2019, Saudi Arabia imported more firearms and military weaponry than any other country while possessing the highest quality military equipment in the Middle East, after Israel. Additionally, more than half of the weapons exports to the Middle East arrived in Saudi Arabia.

The current Saudi king, Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman have been criticized for human rights violations, participation in the Yemeni Civil War, and treatment of political opponents. Moreover, in 2018 the kingdom received international criticism after the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi, a Saudi dissident journalist, and columnist for the Washington Post. He was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, Turkey, to pick up visa papers. However, Khashoggi was strangled to death upon his arrival and dismembered by a hit team of 15 individuals closely associated with the crown prince. Leaders in the U.S. and abroad, such as President Joe Biden, condemned the assassination."
Kamala Harris' tough words on Iran confounds critics,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-iran-biggest-us-adversary-china,2024-10-08T19:40:49Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris told the women of ABC's 'The View' that she would put a greater emphasis on small businesses and crimes against women and children.

Vice President Kamala Harris had harsh words for Iran in an interview Monday evening as she said the regime is America's biggest foe.

In a sit-down with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" the Democratic presidential nominee was asked to name the U.S.'s greatest foreign adversary. ""I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands.""

""This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. What we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power. That is one of my highest priorities.""

Harris declined to say whether she would take military action if given proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon.

""I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment,"" she told Bill Whitaker.

The suggestion that Iran was the greatest U.S. adversary raised some eyebrows -- as China is thought by many to be foe No. 1.

""Iran is our biggest adversary, not China?,"" Mary Kissel, former adviser to ex-Sec. of State Mike Pompeo, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

""Harris is completely clueless for claiming that Iran is America's greatest adversary rather than China,"" former Trump adviser Steve Cortes said.

""Really? It's not Russia? It's not China? A middle power is America's greatest adversary?"" Iranian nuclear researcher Sina Azodi questioned.

Harris also defended U.S. aid to Israel -- at a time when many liberals are calling on her to halt that aid or put conditions on it amid the rising death tolls across Gaza and Lebanon.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel,"" she said.

Harris highlighted threats from ""Hamas, Hezbollah... Iran,"" asserting it is ""without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.""

Still, she held out hope that Israel and its enemies could get to a ceasefire deal.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done, which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire."" She added, ""We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.""

""China is the far greater threat just about, I think, everyone's estimation,"" said Rob Greenway, a former Trump aide and senior director of the National Security Council. ""If you really do view Iran as a threat, then the behavior they've made makes absolutely no sense.""

Former President Donald Trump has blamed President Joe Biden and Harris for loosening sanctions on Iran, which he said made the U.S. adversary ""very rich in a very short period,"" and prompted the turmoil that began with the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023.

During a rally last week, Trump tore into the September 2023 prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Iran that facilitated a detainee swap in Qatar and resulted in the release of $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets from oil sales.

""If they have somebody who was kidnapped, it's always $6 billion. Whoever heard of that?"" Trump said. ""Somebody else gets like $4,000.""

Iran said it had reached a ""good understanding"" to access the money from a Qatari bank account on Monday.

The Biden administration, meanwhile, has long claimed it has not rolled back sanctions on Iran. But ""it's not enforcing any sanctions,"" according to Greenway. Iran is now bringing in nearly $36 billion per year from oil sales.

Last week, Iran rained down 200 missiles toward Tel Aviv, many of them intercepted by both Israeli Defense Forces and U.S. capabilities. Though Iran's proxies have long attacked both Israeli and U.S. postures, it was the regime's first direct attack on Israel since April.

Harris was sharply critical of Trump for pulling out of the Iran deal in 2018. President Joe Biden campaigned on returning to the deal, but failed to do so in office.

""[Iran] made a tremendous amount of money. They have had doors opened by the U.S. administration,"" Greenway said.

HARRIS' 'WORD SALAD' ON ISRAEL ALLIANCE

The Trump administration's policies ""brought them to the brink of financial collapse.""

After Biden rolled back sanctions on Iran, the regime went from 500 centrifuges needed to make a nuclear bomb to 7,000. It went from 5% enriched uranium to 60% (90% is needed for a nuclear weapon.) It went from exporting 400,000 barrels of oil per day in 2019 under the Trump administration's harsh sanctions to 1.7 million barrels per day today.

Reports also suggest renewed activity in two nuclear weaponization sites in Iran - Sanjarian and Golab Dareh.

Last week, Biden warned Israel to make sure its response to the Iranian missile attacks was ""proportional,"" and urged them not to go after Iranian nuclear facilities.

While speaking at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he said when Biden was asked about Israel attacking Iran, the president answered, ""'As long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff.' That's the thing you wanna hit, right? I said, 'I think he's got that one wrong. Isn't that what you're supposed to hit?'""

He added nuclear proliferation is the ""biggest risk we have.""

Trump said when Biden was asked about Israel and Iran: ""His answer should have been: 'Hit the nuclear first. Worry about the rest later.'"""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu confirmed on Tuesday that Hezbollah's intended replacement of its former leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed late last month, has also been ""taken out.""

""Today, Hezbollah is weaker than it has been for many, many years,"" Netanyahu said in a message tailored directly to the ""people of Lebanon.""

""We've degraded Hezbollah's capabilities, we took out thousands of terrorists, including [former Hezbollah leader Hassan] Nasrallah himself, and Nasrallah's replacement, and the replacement of his replacement.""

BIDEN WHITE HOUSE HAS 'VERY LOW' TRUST IN NETANYAHU REGIME, URGES TRANSPARENCY: REPORT

Netanyahu said Iran has ""conquered"" Lebanon to ensure Hezbollah serves Tehran's interests in the region by turning it into a ""stockpile of ammunition and weapons"" serving as a pseudo ""Iranian military base"" on Israel's border.

""Now you, the Lebanese people, you stand at a significant crossroads. It is your choice,"" he continued. ""You can now take back your country. You can return it to a path of peace and prosperity.""

""If you don't, Hezbollah will continue to try to fight Israel from densely populated areas at your expense,"" the prime minister added. ""Free your country from Hezbollah.""

Netanyahu did not explicitly say what it would take to stop Israeli strikes on Hezbollah in Lebanon, but earlier on Tuesday the group's deputy leader Naim Qassem suggested he may be open to a cease-fire without the inclusion of Gaza in the negotiations.

Netanyahu's announcement regarding the death of Hashem Safieddine, who sat as the head of Hezbollah's executive council and was most likely slated to be the group's next leader, comes as Israeli forces expanded their incursion westward along the border in Lebanon.

1 YEAR AFTER HEZBOLLAH STRIKES, ISRAEL REINFORCES TROOPS AND QUESTIONS MOUNT OVER 'LIMITED' OPERATION

Though Safieddine was not as well-known as Nasrallah, who served as the leader of Hezbollah for more than 30 years, his close ties to Iran and his outspoken behavior following the Hamas attacks against Israel on Oct. 7,2023 cemented him as a top target of Jerusalem's.

It is not clear how or where Safieddine was allegedly killed, though the announcement of his death followed an update provided by the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) which said ""hundreds of terrorists"" had been ""eliminated"" since the 98th Brigade first entered Lebanon last week.

The brigade, which is made up of paratroopers, commandos as well as top soldiers of the 7th Brigade and the Yahalom Unit, has been targeting and dismantling Hezbollah strongholds, weapons depots and tunnel routes used by Hezbollah's elite Radwan Forces near the border with Israel.

The IDF has said it will carry out a ""limited, localized, targeted"" operation in Lebanon, but as Israeli forces continue to hit Hezbollah strongholds well north of the border including the capital city of Beirut, concerns are mounting that Lebanon could see similar destruction to that caused in Gaza, with one U.N. official referring to the strategy of bombardment as the ""spiral of doom,"" reported multiple outlets Tuesday.

Internally displaced people from southern Lebanon have been pouring into Beirut following Israel's increase in strikes three weeks ago, followed by the incursion earlier this month.

Beirut mayor Abdallah Darwich urged a cease-fire to be reached between Hezbollah and Israel and told the BBC on Tuesday there was ""no safe place in Beirut,"" warning that the capital city had reached the ""limit of its tolerance.""

""You do not know who is living in this building or that building, so you do not know if there is a target there,"" he said. ""You can no longer say Beirut is safe. Where the next Israeli target is, nobody knows.""

Roughly 1.2 million people have been displaced in Lebanon since the conflict between Hezbollah and Israel escalated last month. More than 400,000 people have fled Lebanon into Syria, and roughly 1,400 have been killed based on numbers provided by the Lebanese Health Ministry and the number of combatants believed to have been killed by Israel. Some 70,000 Israelis have been forced out of the country's northern communities since the start of the conflict."
Kamala Harris's 'joy' is quietly turning to panic for Democrats,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harriss-joy-quietly-turning-panic-democrats,2024-10-08T16:59:02Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In the days after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential election to be replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, there was real joy among Democrats across the country. That was not just a made-up media story, I saw it, but with less than a month to go, the joy is gone and a quiet panic is setting in.

In the first week of August I was, appropriately enough, in Harrisburg, Pa. and Democrats I spoke to were ebullient and effervescent at the change atop the ticket. One woman told me of calling her mother to celebrate together the chance at a Black female president.

Other left-leaning voters told me that they didn't love how Biden had been shown the door but that they felt Harris could turn the race around and take down Donald Trump. For about a month, it sure looked that way.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM KAMALA HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

In San Francisco, most voters I spoke to, red and blue alike, felt like Harris was likely to win, that the Democrats' stalled campaign had called AAA, gotten a jump, and was back on the road.

Harris had erased the lead Trump had over Biden, quickly eclipsing him as the frontrunner and much like a new restaurant opening in a small town, voters were eager to give her a try.

While Republicans and some in the media were frustrated by her unwillingness to do traditional interviews or hold so much as one press conference, her arrogant advisers smirked and said basically, ""So what? She's winning.""

Well, she's not winning anymore, and with her back against the wall appeared on ""60 Minutes"" this week, showing voters the real reason why she is camera shy when it comes to tough questions.

Asked if she and the Biden administration had lost America's influence with our Middle East ally Israel, the veep once again proved herself to be a walking, talking salad bar, here is what she had to say:

""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.""

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

The most generous interpretation of this odd assemblage of verbiage is that she is saying, ""we're trying,"" the more likely one is that she has no idea what she is talking about.

Over the past two weeks in my travels, it has been increasingly difficult to engage Democrats about the presidential race, much like a fan whose team has dropped a few playoff games and who is avoiding the sports page, they just don't want to talk about it.

As one lifelong Democrat in Ohio who I did get to talk to put it, ""I don't know, she's just kind of there.""

It is hard to say exactly when the shine started wearing off the Harris penny, when joy gave way to frustration, but the failure of the Teamsters to endorse her, and the massive union's internal polling showing Trump with a lead seems significant.

It was only after that, that I started hearing Democrats uttering words that seemed unthinkable back in August, namely, ""Maybe we should have stuck with Biden."" Ouch.

Biden himself even joked about it at a press conference, something he is at least still capable of, quipping ""I'm back in.""

Harris spokespeople are busy trying to talk Democratic voters down off the bridge, they insist she still leads in the polling averages, she has a war chest worth more than Fort Knox, and a ground game that Trump can only envy.

These points are all true, and the latter may prove decisive. The Harris movement may be Astroturf and not grassroots, much like her crowning as the nominee, but those busloads of supporters in matching teachers' union T-shirts are the same machine that gets out the vote.

But still, there is no mistaking that the thrill is gone.

It is not clear what Harris can do to reverse the clear trends favoring Trump today, ""60 Minutes"" wasn't it, and her appearances on podcasts, late night shows, and ""The View"" make her look like she is pitching a new Rom Com, not running for president of the United States.

The only answer left may be for Harris to make this fight uglier and dirtier as the clock runs out. If the joy is gone, and it is, the only thing left to do may well be to rage and rage, against the dying of the light."
Jewish CBS anchor forced to meet with Race and Culture Unit after grilling pro-Palestinian author: report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/jewish-cbs-anchor-forced-meet-race-culture-unit-after-grilling-pro-palestinian-author-report,2024-10-08T15:47:53Z,"CBS Mornings anchor Tony Dokoupil pressed author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates on whether he believed Israel had a right to exist in a Monday interview.

CBS News reportedly forced Jewish anchor Tony Dokoupil to meet with the network's in-house Race and Culture Unit after a group of employees complained he was too tough on a pro-Palestinian author.

The saga began last week when Dokoupil interviewed author Ta-Nehisi Coates about his book, ""The Message,"" which describes in part his travels ""to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how easily we are misled by nationalist narratives."" The CBS News anchor irked liberal colleagues by bluntly stating that it read like something you would find in ""the backpack of an extremist,"" and pressing Coates on whether he believes Israel has the right to exist.

The New York Times reported that ""a group of CBS News employees approached executives with their concerns about Mr. Dokoupil's handling of the interview,"" and Dokoupil had to meet with both the CBS News standards and practices team and the Race and Culture Unit.

CBS News and Dokoupil did not immediately respond to requests for comment from Fox News Digital.

The CBS News Race and Culture Unit has ""a four-pronged role at CBS News and Stations as a reviewer, an incubator, a producer and a library,"" according to the CBS website.

""We will still ask tough questions. We will still hold people accountable... but we will do so objectively, which means checking our biases and opinions at the door,"" CBS News news gathering chief Adrienne Roark said during the meeting.

5 key takeaways from Kamala Harris' '60 Minutes' interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-key-takeaways-from-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview,2024-10-08T15:03:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.

Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, with Israel under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In her answers, Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current administration.

On Israel, Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end, though she acknowledged the Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.

""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end,"" Harris said.

Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in military aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over Netanyahu, Harris dodged the question and stayed on message, emphasizing the current administration's diplomatic efforts.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" she said.

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

Whitaker pressed, ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""

Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

On Europe, Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to the war with Russia.

""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in what that success looks like,"" she said.

In a definitive statement, Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However, she was less specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.

""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,"" Harris said. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration, noting that she supported Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed the border. Now, the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers,"" he said.

Whitaker asked, ""If that's the right answer, now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,"" she said.

However, Whitaker pushed back on the vice president, observing that in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or Harris.

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""

Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from day one, literally.""

""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,"" she said, again echoing Biden.

To fight inflation, Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6,000, give first-time homebuyers $25,000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small business.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.

""Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,"" Harris answered. ""But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""

HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND ECONOMIC PLAN

Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me, madam vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair,"" Harris asserted.

Whitaker followed up again, stating, ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.

""I disagree with you,"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

""None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy,"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that I am also a capitalist, and I know the limitations of government.""

After a discussion on foreign policy, Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her recent admission that she is a gun owner.

""I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she owns. ""And, I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.""

Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's 2020 running mate.

She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president, she remains a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago, when Biden decided to drop out of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you,"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

""It's an election, Bill,"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support."

The Biden-Harris administration has privately warned of ""very low"" trust in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's regime following several Israeli strikes the U.S. was not warned about, Axios reported Tuesday.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan reportedly told Israeli officials that the U.S. expects ""clarity and transparency"" about Israel's plans, specifically regarding any retaliation against Iran for last week's missile attack.

""Our trust of the Israelis is very low right now and for a good reason,"" one U.S. official told the outlet.

The report comes after weeks of the Biden-Harris administration growing more and more willing to criticize Netanyahu's regime. They have repeatedly stated that they support Israel's right to defend itself, however.

Vice President Kamala Harris wouldn't say whether she thought the administration had influence over Netanyahu in an interview this week.

CBS' Bill Whitaker asked Harris about why Netanyahu seemed to be ""charting his own course,"" despite the billions of dollars of military aid the U.S. has provided to Israel. ""Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?"" he asked.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel.

""Now the work we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire. And we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders,"" Harris responded.

Morning Glory: Trump stands with Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-trump-stands-israel,2024-10-08T09:13:17Z,"Former President Donald Trump agreed to an interview on the first anniversary of the horrific massacre and mass kidnapping in Israel on October 7, 2023. The focus was primarily on Israel of course, but also on the explosion of antisemitism in the United States.

HH: Now Mr. President, when we spoke in April, you said to me that Israel needed to win and win quickly. They are winning, but they're still fighting, and they're now fighting in Lebanon. Do you think Biden and Harris have been holding back Israel from winning?

DT: I do. I think everything they do is the opposite. In particular, him. Now she's a dumber person than him, but he has the worst foreign policy of anybody in history, probably. You know what you do with him? I realized it the other day. You could be one of the greatest foreign policy presidents. All you do is listen to what he says and do the opposite. If you've done the opposite for 30 years with this poor guy, this poor, pathetic guy, if you've done the opposite for 30 years, you would have been successful. But he's never gotten it right. And you know, I don't have to go back into the old secretaries of state and all the people that talk about it.

HH: If Israel hits [Iran's] nuclear sites, will you applaud?

DT: Yeah. I dealt with Kim Jong-un. And he has nuclear weapons. And you tend to speak a little bit differently when they have nuclear weapons.

HH: Yes.

DT: Does that make sense to you?

HH: Yes, it does. Well, Nixon met with Mao, who was the greatest murderer of the 20th Century, because they had nukes. He met with Brezhnev.

DT: Right.

HH: I noticed you didn't meet with Khamenei, and he did not have nukes. Can they be allowed to have nukes?

DT: No, they can't have nukes. No, they can't have nukes. Nukes, if you would see the power of these weapons that I renovated and rebuilt at great cost, I rebuilt the whole military. And then, you know, they gave $85 billion of it away to the Taliban and to Afghanistan. Can you imagine? They gave $85 billion dollars away. They gave everything. This is the worst group of people, these are the worst negotiators in history.

Exchange three:

HH: Let me turn to antisemitism in the United States. Your daughter is Jewish. Some of your grandchildren are Jewish. Your son-in-law is Jewish. Jewish students are not safe on many American campuses. Your alma mater, my alma mater, Biden and Harris have ignored this. I mean, they really have ignored it. If you're president, will you send the DOJ to those campuses, the office of Civil Rights from the Department of Education to enforce the law?

DT: 100%. I mean, the law is being broken. 100%. You wouldn't think you'd even have this. Did you ever think two years ago, three years ago, that you'd ever have this discussion?

HH: No, I didn't.

DT: I'm unbelievable what's happening. And when you see these riots, and you see a lot of people, too. But you know, a lot of the people in that, a lot of those people are Jewish people. You know that. They're Jewish kids.

HH: Oh, yeah. There are some outliers, but most Jewish students are afraid to be overt on places like Harvard and Penn.

DT: Yeah, but then you have other Jewish students that are afraid. Yeah, that's true, and they should be afraid. I never thought I would see this in my life with the campus riots and what they're saying and what they're doing. And they have to put them down quickly. They really have to put them down quickly.

Some pro-Israel Americans would prefer that zero attention be given to the outliers, but as the excellent Commentary Magazine podcast occasionally mentions the insidiousness of Jewish Americans attacking Israel and defending, implicitly or even explicitly, Hamas, then it should not be shocking when the former president notices it too.

I highlight these three exchanges because the result in November's election will reverberate around the world but most especially in Israel.

US ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE 'VIOLENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY' ON AMERICANS ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7

It seems clear to me that a President Kamala Harris will be the least supportive American president of the Jewish State in Israel's 76-year history.

By contrast, the argument is solid that Trump in his first term was at least the equal of any previous president when it comes to a record of support for Israel in peacetime. (Richard Nixon ordering the Pentagon to ""send everything that can fly"" to Israel in an arms resupply during the 1973 Yom Kippur War is the sole example of when an American president stepped up at a moment of existential peril to Israel and does everything to help it short of sending American forces. Trump did not face such a choice in his first term, but might very well in a second if Iran crosses the nuclear threshold.)

The choice should be clear for any American who supports Israel and for whom the continued existence and vibrancy of the Jewish State and the Middle East writ large is a priority: They should vote for Trump.

"1 year after Hezbollah strikes, Israel reinforces troops and questions mount over 'limited' operation",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/one-year-after-hezbollah-strikes-israel-reinforces-troops-questions-mount-over-limited-operation,2024-10-08T08:10:46Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

One week after Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon and one year after Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in support of Hamas, Jerusalem reinforced its troops fighting inside Lebanon with a third division, prompting immediate questions over the extent of its ""limited"" operations in Lebanon.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Sunday sent troops from its 91st Division, also known as the Galilee Formation, to join forces already in Lebanon hunting down Hezbollah strongholds.

The 91st Division, traditionally responsible for overseeing security for the entirety of the border with Lebanon, will reinforce efforts already being carried out by two other divisions.

AMERICAN FATHER OF HAMAS HOSTAGE ITAY CHEN PUSHES US, ISRAEL ON 'PLAN B' AS NEGOTIATIONS FALTER

Israel's initial advance into Lebanon was led by soldiers from the 98th Division on Oct. 1, which encompassed paratroopers, elite commandos and the 7th Armored Brigade, who were transferred to northern Israel from the border with Gaza in early September for training, reported the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) Long War Journal on Sunday ahead of the IDF announcement.

""Forces from the Commando Brigade, including soldiers from the Egoz Unit, located and destroyed a Hezbollah attack infrastructure, which included a rocket launcher, explosive stockpiles, and additional military equipment,"" the IDF said of the initial operation.

Though Hezbollah's response was fairly muted as many were believed to have retreated ahead of the incursion, at least nine IDF soldiers were killed between Oct. 1-2 during one of the opening battles in Lebanon, confirmed the Long War Journal.

Reinforcements from the IDF's 36th Division, including the Golani infantry, 188th Armored Brigade and the 6th Reserve Infantry Brigade were then sent in, according to reports last week.

Following the Israeli incursion - a security measure that the U.S. and other international allies warned Jerusalem against - IDF spokesperson Rear. Adm. Daniel Hagari said Israel would not push its ground forces north toward Beirut and would instead focus on securing the villages near the border.

Jerusalem has said the operation in Lebanon is necessary to secure the area so some 60,000 Israelis from northern Israel could return home, though data collected by the FDD shows that some 150,000 Israelis have evacuated from the northern border areas.

IDF MEETS LITTLE RESISTANCE FROM HEZBOLLAH AFTER WEEKS OF HITTING TERROR TARGETS, OFFICIALS SAY

Hagari said the incursion would be ""limited"" and take ""days"" to ""weeks"" to complete.

But the renewed support of additional troops on Monday prompted questions over the scope of Israel's plans in southern Lebanon, including from the U.S. State Department on Monday.

In response to questions from reporters regarding Israel's operations in Lebanon, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, ""We're watching this very closely.""

""We support their ability to target militants, to degrade Hezbollah's infrastructure, to degrade Hezbollah's capability. But we are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years,"" he added. ""And ultimately, that's not the outcome that we want to see.""

Israel has not announced any additional plans for its ground forces and said the IDF Divisions have engaged in ""targeted, limited, and localized operations"" in southern Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah's infrastructure.

But one security expert with the FDD pointed out that Israel could be taking precautionary steps to build up its force in the region should Israel decide it needs to bolster its ability to go after Hezbollah even further.

""What the Israelis have been doing is gradually ratcheting up pressure on Hezbollah to make the price of continuing to attack in support of Gaza too costly for the organization,"" David Daoud, senior fellow at FDD specializing in Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital.

Daoud explained that in the wake of the Oct. 8 attacks, Israel and Hezbollah engaged in ""mutual attrition,"" continuing to strike one another but rarely taking the level of attack beyond aerial bombardments, unlike the attacks carried out by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023.

ISRAEL'S GROUND INVASION INTO LEBANON IMMINENT AS CABINET APPROVES NEXT PHASE OF THE WAR

This level of engagement shifted after Israel's telecommunication device operation in which it allegedly detonated some 5,000 pagers previously distributed to Hezbollah operatives, killing more than three dozen and wounding nearly 3,000 others in a coordinated attack in late September.

Israel has not taken credit for the attacks, but according to open-source data compiled by the FDD in its latest interactive report dubbed ""Road to the Third Lebanon War, Mapping the War of Attrition,"" the event was a clear launching point in which Jerusalem drastically changed its modus operandi when it came to countering Hezbollah.

On Sept. 22, Israel carried out its most significant bombardment against the terrorist group than at any other point since the Oct. 8, 2023,attacks, firing some 1,182 strikes, nearly five times the number of attacks it fired during its second-heaviest strike campaign on Feb. 11, 2024, when 239 strikes were fired, the FDD found.

""I would call it a kind of proactive attrition,"" said Daoud, who co-authored the FDD report. ""The Israelis are no longer keeping a balance of attrition, they're really weighing heavily on Hezbollah without going to a full ground invasion.""

The expert explained that the IDF is ""ratcheting up pressure"" on Hezbollah in an attempt to get it to back off its support for Hamas, a similar strategy it has taken in Gaza in an attempt to persuade Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to hand over the hostages.

The merits of this approach are debatable as hostages remain in Hamas captivity despite the immense pains the IDF has caused in the Gaza Strip, and Daoud questioned whether this tactic would be effective against Hezbollah, an organization that is more sophisticated, better armed, better financed and more entwined in Lebanese society.

""I don't see Hezbollah backing down, even at this level of pain that the Israelis are inflicting upon them,"" Daoud said. ""So a ground invasion may become necessary, and you want to make sure that your forces are in place for that to move into effect immediately, if that becomes the case.""

The expert highlighted that Israel may once again be considering the establishment of a ""security zone"" in Lebanon in order to create a buffer between Hezbollah strongholds and the Israeli border, a move that would replicate steps Israel took between 1985 and 2000 and one that would require a prolonged IDF stay in Lebanon.

It is unclear if Israel could be considering another buffer-zone scenario, though it would likely prove unpopular not only with the Lebanese government but with the international community, which has increasingly urged Israel to reduce its footprint in the region by embracing a two-state solution with the Palestinians in the south and along Israel's eastern border.

But Daoud argued that the threat Hezbollah poses isn't going away and that creating a buffer zone combined with continued air strikes could be the solution that appeases the international community best by avoiding an all-out ground invasion across Lebanon.

""There are ways to avoid a ground invasion,"" Daoud argued. ""It will take much longer, but given where international opinion is, this is probably a better option for Israel now than a full ground invasion up to Beirut.""

Though Israel has not announced any plans to engage in a ground operation to oust Hezbollah forces from strongholds like Beirut, it has ramped up the number of strikes on suburban areas outside the capital city, and since late September the U.S. has organized the departure of some 700 Americans from Lebanon."

The home of University of Michigan president Santa Ono and the sidewalk were vandalized Monday, with anti-Israel messages spray-painted at the location on the first anniversary of Hamas terrorists' attack against Israel.

The words ""intifada"" and ""coward"" were spray-painted on the property in West Bloomfield, Michigan, according to The Associated Press. ""Intifada"" is an Arabic term for the Palestinian uprising against Israel.

West Bloomfield police did not identify the owner of the home, but the university acknowledged that Ono is the owner. This house is separate from his official campus residence.

The home of the university's chief investment officer, Erik Lundberg, was also vandalized on Monday, according to The Detroit News.

The university said it has no direct investments and less than $15 million placed with funds that might include companies in Israel, which is less than 0.1% of the total endowment.

Mark Bernstein, a member of the university's Board of Regents, said the vandalism was ""yet another assaultive act of intimidation by the antisemitic mob.""

""I have to say, when I read the book, I imagine if I took your name out of it, took away the awards, the acclaim, took the cover off the book, publishing house goes away, the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,"" Dokoupil said.

""So then I found myself wondering, why does Ta'Nehisi Coates, who I've known for a long time, read his work for a long time, very talented, smart guy, leave out so much? Why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it? Why leave out that Israel deals with terror groups that want to eliminate it? Why not detail anything of the first and the second Intifada, the café bombings, the bus bombings, the little kids blown to bits. Is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?"" the CBS anchor continued.

Coates defended the book, saying he sought to give a voice to the Palestinian people, whose views he argued were underrepresented in the American media.

The interview prompted outcry from some CBS News staff, who felt Dokoupil pressed Coates too strongly on his anti-Israel stance. The network addressed the internal frenzy in a staff meeting Monday, which marked the one-year anniversary since the October 7th massacre in Israel. CBS leadership reassured offended staff members that following a review, they concluded that the interview did not meet the company's ""editorial standards,"" the Free Press reported, which obtained audio of the staff meeting.

ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF OCTOBER 7 ATTACKS ARRIVES WITH LASTING TRUAMA FOR ISRAELIS, AMERICAN JEWS: EXPERT

Adrienne Roark, who oversees news-gathering at the network, told employees that covering an event like October 7 ""requires empathy, respect, and a commitment to truth,"" according to the Free Press.

""We will still ask tough questions. We will still hold people accountable. But we will do so objectively, which means checking our biases and opinions at the door,"" Roark reportedly said.

""We are here to report news without fear or favor,"" Roark added, according to the Free Press. ""There are times we fail our audiences and each other. We're in one of those times right now, and it's been growing. And we're at a tipping point. Many of you have reached out to express concerns about recent reporting. Specifically about the CBS Mornings Coates interview last week as well as comments made coming out of some of our correspondents' reporting.""

CBS NEWS CASTS A LONG SHADOW OF ANTI-TRUMP BIAS AHEAD OF ITS VICE-PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

She continued, ""I want to acknowledge and apologize that it's taken this long to have this conversation.""

But not everyone at CBS agreed with the leadership's decision to appease their staff.

CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford reportedly defended Dokoupil's handling of the interview, remarking during the meeting, ""I don't even understand how Tony's interview failed to meet our editorial standards... I thought our commitment was to truth. When someone comes on our air with a one-sided account of very complex situation -- which Coates himself acknowledges that he has -- it's my understanding that as a journalist we are obligated to challenge that worldview, so that our viewers can have access to the truth and can have a more balanced account...,"" Dylan Byers of Puck News reported her as saying.

""And that is what Tony did,"" Crawford added, according to Byers. ""He challenged Coates' one-sided worldview, Coates got to respond. It was civil... I don't see how we can say that it failed to meet our editorial standards.... Tony prevented a one-sided account from being broadcast on our network about a deeply complex situation that completely was devoid of history or fact. As journalists, that's what we have an obligation to do.""

CBS has yet to respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

An imminent ballistic missile strike from Iran looms, but the current alarm is different - more immediate, more dangerous.

It's a terror attack in Jaffa.

The details are still emerging, but we know this much: Several people have already lost their lives.

In a rush, we load up our gear and protective equipment into our vehicle. Just as we're pulling out of the hotel, orders from New York come through: Get back inside. They don't want us on the road with Iran's attack approaching.

FOUR AMERICAN HOSTAGES REMAIN IN HAMAS CAPTIVITY A YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 MASSACRE

Before my producer can even hang up, the car fills with a new sound: the blare of alarms. Iran has fired ballistic missiles - headed straight for us.

It takes about 12 minutes for a missile to travel from Iran to Israel. How far into those 12 minutes we are is anyone's guess.

Our photographer, doubling as our driver, floors the accelerator, weaving through traffic as we race back to the hotel.

We make it back and join about two dozen others in the hotel's shelter. Many of them are Israelis. A father plays with his two daughters, rolling on the ground, laughing. Nearby, people chat calmly, unbothered by the threat of nearly 200 ballistic missiles targeting Israel. I notice a young man standing calmly beside his girlfriend. He's missing a leg from the knee down but stands strong and composed.

""Hamas terrorists,"" he tells me when I ask about his injury. ""They hit us with an RPG.""

He credits his - and others' - composure during this attack to their faith in Israel's air defense systems.

From the shelter, I go live on Fox News Channel, describing those around me. As Israel's layered air defense - comprised of the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow systems - intercepts incoming threats, it becomes clear why the soldier's confidence is well-placed.

HAMAS LAUNCHES ROCKETS FROM GAZA ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 ATTACKS, WHILE IDF STRIKES TERROR TARGETS

Iran is launching the largest ballistic missile barrage in history. Amid this, a Palestinian man in the West Bank dies from falling shrapnel, but not a single additional person in Israel is seriously harmed by the missiles.

It strikes me: the calm in the shelter is born of a tragic familiarity - being fired upon has become normal here.

Terror attacks, while common, rarely reach Tel Aviv.

When we're given the all-clear, we race to the scene of the attack in Jaffa, as originally planned.

Evidence of the brutality is everywhere along the light rail tracks: bloodstains and evidence markers hint at the horror that unfolded just before we arrived.

""When the train stopped and opened its doors, the terrorists walked inside, began firing their automatic weapons, then stepped back out and continued their killing spree,"" the Israeli Police International Spokesman, Dean Elsdunne, tells me.

US ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE 'VIOLENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY' ON AMERICANS ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7

""I even saw an image where the terrorists stood over a civilian who had clearly already been shot, and they continued shooting him,"" he adds.

Seven people lost their lives in the attack.

My mind flashes back to what I witnessed 63 miles south of Tel Aviv, in the devastated city of Rafah in southern Gaza.

Weeks earlier, I had embedded with the IDF in the evacuated city, where soldiers exchanged gunfire with militants.

There wasn't a single civilian in sight, but remnants of life before the war were scattered everywhere - a child's superhero mask, clothes, household goods buried beneath the rubble from Israeli airstrikes.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre got into a heated exchange with Fox News Channel's Peter Doocy over the White House sending aid to Lebanon during the hurricane season, which has had devastating effects on North Carolina.

Harris pledged Saturday to send $157 million of ""additional assistance"" to Lebanon while Israel attacks Hezbollah infrastructure and targets in the country. Harris argued the country was ""facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation."" Doocy asked Jean-Pierre why the Biden administration was soliciting congressional input before sending disaster loan funds to North Carolina, but not to send the slush funds to a foreign country.

""On this issue of funding, the administration has money to send to Lebanon without Congress coming back. But Congress does have to come back to approve money to send to people in North Carolina. Do I have that right?"" Doocy said.

""The president and the vice president has had a robust whole-of-government response to this... More than $200 million, ...for the disaster help,"" Jean-Pierre responded, adding that ""people want to do disinformation, misinformation, which is dangerous.""

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

Doocy asked whether the president's letter to Congress soliciting their help was misinformation.

""No. The way you're asking me the question is misinformation. There is money that we are allocating to the impacted areas, and there's money there to help people who truly need it. There are survivors who need the funding, who need the funding. And it's there,"" she said.

""You can't call a question you don't like misinformation,"" Doocy said.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

""No, what you're asking me is why Congress needs to come back and do their job. That's what you're asking me. Congress needs to come back and do their job and provide extra assistance, extra funding for the disaster relief fund. That's what Congress needs to do,"" she responded. ""You may not want that, but that's okay. That's what this president wants, and that's what the vice president wants.""

Jean-Pierre then stormed out of the briefing room.

The administration has been accused of mismanaging funds after Homeland Security's Alejandro Mayorkas said Wednesday ""FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.""

Critics on social media were quick to slam Harris for touting the foreign aid to Lebanon, arguing that many North Carolina residents are struggling to recover from Hurricane Helene.

""Kamala is touting giving money to the people of Lebanon-while stiff-arming the humanitarian crisis in North Carolina,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said on X. ""This is Kamala's Katrina.""

""Could this be any more tone deaf? We have Americans suffering and in danger right now after the hurricane and this is what Kamala has to announce. America First!"" Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., said on X.

The controversial tweet comes as the Biden administration has continued to face backlash for its handling of Helene, with former President Trump calling the federal response to the disaster the ""most incompetently managed 'storm,' at the federal level, ever seen before."""

The Minnesota Vikings released a statement on Monday remembering the one-year anniversary of the ""reprehensible"" Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023.

""We mourn the loss of all innocent lives from this ongoing conflict,"" the statement read. ""We stand against the rising antisemitism and Islamophobia and know we must steadfastly work towards combating hate in all forms. We pray for the 101 hostages who have yet to be freed, and our deepest hope is for a future of peace and safety throughout the region.""

Hamas launched an attack on Israel that sparked a massive conflict in the Middle East, which continues to rage on today.

The initial attacks had a large impact on the sports world, including the NFL as the war began in the middle of the 2023 season.

Many within the NFL, especially New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft with his Foundation to Combat Antisemitism, spoke about after the Hamas attacks, calling Jewish hate ""out of control.""

VIKINGS' GREG JOSEPH TO WEAR 'I STAND WITH ISRAEL' CLEATS DURING NEXT GAME

The Vikings also saw their veteran kicker at the time, Greg Joseph, raising money to provide aid in Israel by starting a ""Kicks for Israel"" campaign on Oct. 17, 2023.

Joseph, who is Jewish and noted his religion ""absolutely"" guided him throughout his life, donated $54 for every extra point made and $180 for every field goal made to the non-profit organization Leket Israel.

Joseph now kicks for the New York Giants, who signed him after Graham Gano got hurt earlier this season. He wore cleats that said ""I Stand With Israel"" last season, and his campaign raised over $7,000.

As the Vikings' statement mentioned, there are still 101 hostages who remain in Gaza as the conflict continues.

The United States has helped Israel with military aid, while vetoing U.N. Security Council ceasefire resolutions.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed Monday that the U.S. ""will continue to work tirelessly"" to bring home the four American hostages who have now been held by Hamas for more than a year inside the Gaza Strip.

The four that remain -- Keith Siegel, 65, Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Omer Neutra, 22, and Edan Alexander, 21 -- were abducted by the Palestinian terrorist group exactly one year ago Monday on Oct. 7, 2023. The abductions took place alongside the murder of approximately 1,200 Israelis.

""Hamas also took 254 people hostage that day, including 12 Americans. Four of those Americans - Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Itay Chen, Judy Weinstein, and Gad Haggai - were murdered by Hamas. Four were released through an agreement the United States negotiated last November, but four remain in captivity in Gaza: Edan Alexander, Keith Siegel, Sagui Dekel-Chen, and Omer Neutra,"" Blinken said in a statement.

""There are also an estimated 97 other hostages who remain held in Gaza today. They include men, women, young boys, young girls, two babies, and elderly people from more than 25 nations,"" Blinken added. ""Hamas should release these hostages immediately. Every single one of them must be returned to their families, and the United States will continue to work tirelessly to bring them home.""

HAMAS LAUNCHES ROCKETS FROM GAZA ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 ATTACKS, WHILE IDF STRIKES TERROR TARGETS

Blinken, who on Monday called Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel the ""largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust,"" also said ""It is time to reach a ceasefire agreement that brings the hostages home, alleviates the suffering of the Israeli and Palestinian people, and ultimately brings an end to this war.""

The youngest of the hostages, 20-year-old Edan Alexander, graduated from Tenafly High School in New Jersey in 2022 before volunteering to serve with the IDF.

""He was kidnapped Oct. 7th from his post, from the IDF post, and since then, we have no additional information about this abduction,"" his father Adi has said.

Adi and his wife Yael wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times in September saying that for hundreds of days ""the world has failed our son and his fellow hostages: The Israeli government has abandoned them, too many countries have turned a blind eye, and while we're grateful for the U.S. government's steadfast support, its efforts have yet to yield results.

Omer Neutra, 22, also volunteered to serve in the IDF, according to his parents Orna and Ronen.

""He's like an all-American kid. He loved sports. He was accepted to Binghamton University, but decided to defer this school. And he went to Israel on a gap year, and he connected deeply with the country, with his peers, and he decided to volunteer to the IDF, and he was taken from his post,"" his mother Orna has said.

She recently told the New York Post from her home in Plainview, New York, ""Our kid is a bargaining chip in this geopolitical nightmare, and we, the families, we're just floating on this wave. We're trying not to sink.""

HEZBOLLAH ROCKET ATTACK ON ISRAEL HITS HAIFA FOR FIRST TIME

Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose 36-year-old son Sagui is still being held in Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, said in an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" in September, ""It is absolutely clear, the only way to get hostages home alive is by some kind of negotiated agreement with Satan.""

Dekel-Chen was abducted by Hamas in Kibbutz Nir Oz one year ago, according to the American Jewish Committee. The organization said he made sure his then-pregnant wife and his two daughters were safe in a shelter before confronting Hamas terrorists who had broken into his home.

Last November, Elan Siegel, the daughter of 65-year-old Keith Siegel, wrote in a column for Fox News Digital, ""They forced my parents, unassuming people filled with kindness and a quiet sensitivity, into my father's car and took them to Gaza.""

Siegel's wife Aviva later was released from captivity.

""It's just cruel to think that he's in such terrible conditions for so long,"" Aviva Siegel recently told the New York Post. ""What they're going through is the cruelest thing on Earth.""

The 'Outnumbered' panel also discusses the tragedy as the Israel-Hamas war rages on.

Vice President Kamala Harris appears to prioritize winning back Arab American and Muslim voters who were dejected by President Joe Biden's handling of war in the Middle East over courting the Jewish voter.

That's according to an internal review of her calendar meetups with both groups since becoming the Democratic nominee for president.

Harris met with Arab American advocates ahead of a campaign event in Flint, Michigan, on Friday. That followed a meeting with activists with the Pro-Palestinian Uncommitted Movement, which has declined to endorse her, in Michigan in July.

Her public schedule hasn't included meetings with Jewish groups since meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu privately in July, after she declined to preside over his joint address to Congress.

In August, her campaign nominated Ilan Goldenberg as its liaison to the Jewish community, and on Aug. 15, Harris sent campaign officials to meet with Jewish leaders in Michigan. In September, she called the parents of the late Hersch Goldberg-Polin, the American hostage slain by Hamas. Fox News Digital could not find a record of any other face-to-face Jewish outreach by Harris.

Wa'el Alzayat, the CEO of Emgage Action, told CNN that Harris had told the Arab group on Friday ""that she also wants the war to end and that she will do all she can to work in this regard.""

The Arab Americans told her she needed ""to show distance between how she would govern on this matter with the current administration policies, which we don't agree with.""

HARRIS REFUSES TO CALL NETANYAHU A 'CLOSE ALLY' ONE YEAR AFTER OCTOBER 7

Michigan, which Biden narrowly won in 2020, is a crucial battleground state this election. It has the second-highest population of Arab American residents, who make up around 3% of its population.

On the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, former President Donald Trump will speak to Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and plant a pomegranate tree on the grounds of the Vice President's Residence in honor of those killed a year ago.

One year on from the outbreak of war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel is now entrenched in war on other fronts too. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) recently launched a ground offensive in Lebanon to fight Hezbollah, and last week missiles rained down on Tel Aviv -- though most were intercepted -- from Iran.

Jewish Americans tend to vote Democratic -- in 2020, Biden won 69% of their vote. Trump won 30%.

Harris' focus on Arab American outreach could in part be due to shifting polling within the community and an aggressive outreach from the Trump campaign to capitalize on that.

Arab Americans also historically favor Democrats -- but new polling suggests that could change. Of likely voters in the community, Arab Americans favor Trump over Harris 46% to 42%, according to new polling by the Arab American Institute.

Trump has been airing ads aimed at Arab Americans in Michigan, and his former director of national intelligence Ric Grenell and his daughter Tiffany Trump's father-in-law Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman, have been leading his outreach to the community.

HARRIS WON'T SAY WHETHER BIDEN ADMIN HAS ANY 'SWAY' OVER NETANYAHU

""His outreach now is much better, much different than it was in 2016 and 2020,"" Adel Ayoub, leader of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, told Fox News Digital of Trump.

Biden won 60% of the Arab American vote in 2020, but support from that community has cratered since the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, 2023.

The National Uncommitted movement launched a campaign calling on voters to cast uncommitted ballots in swing state primaries to send a message to Democrats, and more than a million did so.

Harris spoke with leaders of the Uncommitted Movement in August. That same month, her campaign manager met with Arab and Muslim leaders.

Trump has blamed Harris and Biden for loosening sanctions on Iran, thus emboldening Iran's proxies to carry out the attack last year.

Trump has repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats ""should have their head examined"" and that if he loses the Nov. 5 election, ""the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that."""
JD Vance hits Biden-Harris on hurricane response: 'Incompetence of the highest order',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/jd-vance-hits-biden-harris-hurricane-response-incompetence-highest-order,2024-10-07T19:09:23Z,"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, joins 'Fox & Friends' one year after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel to discuss the Biden-Harris administration's leadership and the lack of funding for FEMA in the wake of Hurricane Helene.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance slammed the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the fallout of Hurricane Helene as incompetent in an interview Monday on ""Fox & Friends.""

Vance said FEMA has been ""distracted"" by illegal immigrants as a result of the Biden-Harris administration's ""incompetence.""

""I think the fundamental mistake that Kamala Harris' administration has made here, Will, is that from the get-go, you should have imposed military-style command and control,"" he said. ""You've got eight different bureaucratic organizations, you've got a lot of different bureaucratic fiefdoms that sometimes delay the provision of necessary resources, you need to empower a military commander on the ground to get helicopters to where they need to go, to get supplies ... to cut through some of the FAA bureaucracy.""

""The problem here, I really believe, it's like the DMV at industrial scale, and because of it, a lot of folks in North Carolina are suffering unnecessarily,"" he added. ""I hope to God you don't have unnecessary loss of life, but I fear that we do, and it all goes back to why do we have a president and a vice president, one of whom is on the beach, the other of whom is participating in fundraisers rather than doing their job. It is incompetence of the highest order.""

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S CHURCHILL MOMENT COMES AMID MULTIFRONT WAR AGAINST IRANIAN TERROR, EXPERT SAYS

Vance discussed the claim that there is a bucket of money in FEMA that has gone to illegal immigrants and another separate bucket of money that goes to American citizens.

""I think that misses the fundamental point that the Biden-Harris administration has turned FEMA effectively into an agency that helps to resettle and helps to deal with illegal immigration,"" he said. ""That is just fundamentally going to distract focus from their core job of helping American citizens in their time of need.""

Vance continued, calling the administration's response following Hurricane Helene a ""complete failure of leadership,"" demonstrated by the contrast in previous responses to natural disasters.

""In 2010, there was a terrible earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti,"" he explained. ""The 82nd Airborne was on the ground two days later. There was a disastrous hurricane an hour away from the 82nd Airborne headquarters. It took more than a week for the full deployment to arrive and start helping people out.""

""It's a complete lack of leadership,"" he added. ""When things like this happen, you need somebody in charge, you need somebody saying we're going to save as many lives as possible. Red tape be damned. Unfortunately, what you've had is somebody asleep at the wheel. Nobody knows who's in charge and I think it has delayed the provision of necessary resources to the people of North Carolina.""

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

Vance said the area, the Appalachian region of the country, has been ignored by U.S. leadership for 40 years.

""They really feel ignored today,"" he said. ""The way you solve that problem is by having leaders who show up and focus on the people. Kamala Harris has failed to do that.""

FEMA has set up a fact-check page to respond to what it says are false claims about its response to the hurricane. In one, it responded to a claim that funding for its disaster response was diverted to support international efforts or border issues.

""No money is being diverted from disaster response needs,"" the site states. ""FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts.""

A White House spokesperson didn't have a direct response to Vance but referred Fox News Digital to its comment about similar criticism by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

""A wide range of leaders in both parties and from every affected state have praised the bipartisan response to Hurricane Helene,"" spokesman Andrew Bates said. ""The Republican governor of South Carolina, Henry McMaster, has called the response 'superb.' Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a Republican, said, 'They're doing a great job.' Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer said, 'We are seeing incredible help from the Federal government to the state.' The Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, has said he 'appreciated' President's Biden's offer to 'call him directly' with any 'other things we need.' The Republican governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin, said he's 'incredibly appreciative of the rapid response.' Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said, ""The federal response has been nothing short of amazing. And Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said, 'This is an incredible experience for me. So, to President Biden, thank you for coming. Thank you for paying attention to our needs. We have had a good working relationship between the federal government.'"""

The Israel Football Association (IFA) has responded to allegations of discrimination and a proposed suspension of its team from the Palestinian Football Association (PFA).

FIFA, the world's soccer governing body, launched an investigation into allegations of discrimination against the IFA last week. FIFA leaders made this decision when they ruled against suspending Israel from international play after the PFA proposed a suspension to Israel amid the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza earlier this year.

In a statement provided to Fox News Digital by IFA head of communications Shlomi Barzell over the weekend, the IFA condemned the PFA for its recent proposal to FIFA.

""Whoever fantasized about the suspension of Israeli football from the international arena or sanctions through lies and false accusations, has suffered a defeat,"" the statement read. ""Again, we have acted over time in different channels, in a calculated and proactive manner in the face of the challenge of the Palestinian Association and its leader to distort reality, and the result today leaves no room for doubt.

""We respect the authors of the report submitted to the council members and the decision of the council members to consider transferring two issues to a legal examination, as long as there is any factual justification for it. Thanks to values that represent a glorious democracy and an independent and determined legal system of the Football Association, we have never violated and will not violate any of the FIFA/UEFA rules,"" the statement read.

The PFA has not responded to multiple requests for comment from Fox News Digital.

The PFA's original proposal claimed at least 92 non-professional Palestinian players have been killed in the war, football infrastructure has been destroyed, its leagues suspended and its national team required to play World Cup qualifiers abroad. The Palestinian federation wanted FIFA to adopt appropriate sanctions against Israeli teams, including the national side and clubs.

Katarina Pijetlovic, head of the PFA's legal department, addressed FIFA's decision not to suspend Israel in posts on X on Oct. 3.

""FIFA allowed Israel FA to continue using the Palestinian territory [occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem] as their own territory, and to use football under its umbrella as an instrument of colonial expansion,"" she wrote in a post on X. ""The decision is purely political. Will we wait 2 yrs again, as in 2015-17, for the committee to suggest the obvious and then have their suggestion rejected again? Why don't they just say it: Israel has impunity to destroy FIFA member associations & use their colonized territories.""

Gaza-based soccer journalist Abubaker Abed previously told Al Jazeera that the Palestinian Federation ""acts as a form of resistance"" and alleged that more than 50 Palestinian sports facilities had been destroyed.

""The people of Palestine know this team acts as a form of resistance and is conveying a message to the world,"" Gaza-Abed said. ""More than 50 sports facilities have been reduced to rubble in Gaza, including nine out of 10 of Gaza's stadiums. Almost every club has been destroyed in this war, while one stadium in Deir el-Balah has been turned into a shelter for thousands of displaced people.""

FIFA's disciplinary committee will now be asked to look into the allegations of discrimination. The PFA has specifically accused the IFA of complicity in violations of international law by the Israeli government, discrimination against Arab players and inclusion in its league of clubs located in Palestinian territory.

""The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offense of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,"" FIFA said in a statement. ""FIFA's Governance, Audit and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate... the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.""

The PFA's proposal of suspension was enough to convince FIFA to seek an independent legal council and hold a landmark council meeting to make a decision on whether to suspend Israel from international soccer because of the conflict with Hamas, said FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the FIFA congress in May.

However, for the time being, it doesn't appear that Israel will be subject to a suspension. A suspension may have severely impacted its hopes to compete in the 2026 World Cup, which will be played in North America. The final will be played in East Rutherford, New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from New York City.

Countries have been banned from competing in the World Cup in the past based on the actions of their governments and national team administrations.

Germany and Japan were banned from the 1950 World Cup after the end of World War II. South Africa was banned from 1966 to 1992 for violating FIFA's anti-discrimination charter due to apartheid. Mexico was banned for two years after using overage players in qualifiers for the 1989 World Youth Championship.

Israel has only ever qualified for the World Cup once, in 1970, and it didn't make it out of the group stage. Israel won a championship in the 1964 Asian Games. However, they were moved from the Asian Football Federation to the the European Confederation UEFA in 1994, where they have struggled to compete. The team suffered its most lopsided loss in its history in a 7-1 blowout to Germany in 2002.

Israel is currently in the midst of its UEFA Nations League schedule. It will play France on Thursday after starting off 0-2.

Meanwhile, Palestine is currently in the midst of group play for the FIFA World Cup Asian qualifiers. It will play Iraq on Thursday after starting group play with one loss and one draw. Palestine has never qualified for the World Cup.

Monday marks the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel, which killed 1,195 people, including 815 civilians, and resulted in 251 people being taken hostage. At least 31 Americans were killed during the attacks and 13 others were missing.

On Aug. 15, at least 40,005 Palestinians were reported to have been killed in Gaza since the war began. Gaza's health ministry doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but says at least 5,956 women and at least 10,627 children have been killed.

One year after the attack, Hamas marked the anniversary by firing a barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv on Monday.

Israel's war in Gaza rages on even as Israel is now fighting a new war against Hezbollah, escalating its bombing campaign in Lebanon the past three weeks. Last week Israel faced additional attacks from Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, in the form of missile strikes.

The strikes forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday, and even forced a pair of Israeli women's basketball teams to abandon their game and flee to shelter, per the Jerusalem Times."
"Moving toward healing, Jewish people display 'resilience' and will experience 'renewal,' says rabbi",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/moving-healing-jewish-people-display-resilience-experience-renewal-says-rabbi,2024-10-07T18:52:39Z,"A Florida-based rabbi, faith leader, author, husband and father reveals a key life lesson -- noting that a period of struggle in a person's life does not mean failure. It's likely a stepping stone to future understanding.

A faith leader and rabbi based in Plantation, Florida shared thoughts about the status and well-being of the Jewish people this week as Yom Kippur approaches -- the holiest day of the year for Jews amid the High Holiday season and one offering ""a profound sense of reflection and hope.""

Rabbi Pinchas Taylor said in comments to Fox News Digital, ""Amid the pain and uncertainty, there is an opportunity for something beautiful to emerge -- a deeper, more forged renewal. The story of Yom Kippur reminds us that from brokenness comes the possibility of a greater, stronger restoration.""

On Oct. 7, 2023, one year ago, ""Israel faced a brutal and senseless assault that brought pain and heartache to countless families,"" he said.

HEALTH, HAPPINESS AND HELPING OTHERS ARE VITAL PARTS OF FREE AND RESPONSIBLE SOCIETY, FOUNDING FATHERS TAUGHT

""One year later, we are also reminded of the incredible resilience that lies within the Jewish people,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""Yom Kippur emphasizes this theme -- that from brokenness, there is always a path toward healing and enhanced restoration.""

He noted that Yom Kippur is not only ""a day of atonement but a celebration of the possibility of starting over. It marks the moment when Moses came down from Mount Sinai with the second set of tablets after the first set had been broken.""

Said Taylor, ""Think about that. A people who had sinned, who had fallen, whose covenantal symbol had been broken were given a new chance, a renewed covenant.""

""Within all the brokenness of life, we are not beyond repair.""

In Jewish tradition, ""the quality of the second tablets is considered to be superior to the first, in that while the first tablets were a divine gift from above, the second set incorporated an 'awakening from below,' the human spirit of repentance, return and resilience.""

So, he said, this is a reminder that ""within all the brokenness of life, we are not beyond repair -- and that there is a divine invitation to pick up the pieces and build something even better.""

Taylor said that beyond ""the pain of loss,"" there is the ""strength of a people who refuse to give in to despair.""

He said that in this context, ""Yom Kippur's message becomes even more powerful. It's a day when we can take the broken pieces of our lives, the shattered remains of our dreams, and hold them up to God, knowing that we are not alone.""

He added, ""The same God who guided Moses back down the mountain with a new set of tablets, a new path forward, is ready to guide us, too.""

Said Taylor, ""Even in the darkest times, there is always a light -- a hope that cannot be extinguished, that from all brokenness emerges brilliance, breakthrough and blessing.""

He also said October 7th ""will not be the end of our story.""

Instead, ""it is a chapter, a season, a moment in time that reminds us how much we need each other, how much we need faith -- and how much we need hope.""

Taylor said, ""This Yom Kippur, even as we remember the pain of October 7th, we can lift our eyes to the future with a renewed sense of purpose.

Sen. JD Vance blasted the Biden-Harris administration on Monday for not doing enough to bring home the hostages that Hamas took from Israel during the deadly Oct. 7 attack one year ago.

Vance, R-Ohio, spoke during the Philos Project's Memorial Rally and March on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., briefly taking aim at President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

""I'm going to get a little political here. It is disgraceful that we have an American president and vice president who haven't done a thing,"" Vance said. ""Vice President Harris, our message is, 'Bring them home.' Use your authority to help bring them home. We can do it. We just need real leadership.""

Iran-backed Hamas terrorists launched a massacre against Israel in the Oct. 7 attack last year, killing about 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, and taking about 250 hostages. A year later, about 100 people, including several Americans, remain in Hamas captivity, as U.S.-led efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage release deal have sputtered out.

ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS SET UP ENCAMPMENT OUTSIDE JEWISH DEM REP'S HOME ON EVE OF OCT 7 HAMAS ATTACK ANNIVERSARY

The attack sparked a war in Gaza, where Israel has moved to eliminate Hamas and return those taken hostage. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians.

Harris came under fire Sunday for a lengthy ""word salad"" answer in which she appeared unable to fully commit to Israel during an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes.""

Meanwhile, Vance gave full-throated support for Israel, saying that former President Trump will make sure Israel has the right to protect itself and that the hostages are returned home.

""I speak for Donald Trump and saying that when he is president, America will protect our American Jewish brothers and sisters. We will stop funding anti-American and anti-Jewish radicals. And we are going to bring home American hostages wherever they're held and whoever is holding them,"" he said.

One year later, 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/october-7-hasnt-ended-one-year-later-101-hostages-still-being-held-gaza,2024-10-07T18:18:28Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

While visiting her boyfriend's family for the religious holiday of Simchat Torah, a young Israeli woman, Sapir Cohen, was taken hostage on October 7, 2023. She spent 55 days in captivity in Gaza before she was released in a deal with the Hamas terrorists who took her and hundreds of other Israelis captive. Cohen's boyfriend, Sasha Troufanov, has been held captive with one hundred others for exactly one year, today.

Cohen visited my children's overnight sleepaway program this summer, telling campers about the plight of those still left behind in Gaza while sharing her own experience.

She shared, ""Down there [in the tunnels] there is no light. Sometimes a terrorist would use a flashlight, but even then, I couldn't see anything. There is also no air."" She went on to explain the lack of oxygen, the prevalence of humidity and mold, and the lack of food. She experienced this for less than two months; Sasha and 100 others have for twelve months.

She goes anywhere she can to share her story in order to raise awareness about the hostages who have spent a year of their lives wasting away in the tunnels of Gaza, because she knows the world has lost interest. There are no yellow ribbons lining the trees of America's small towns in honor of the four Americans still being held hostage; nor were there large memorials for Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a young American boy who was taken hostage and executed in the tunnels in Gaza one month ago.

ONE YEAR AFTER 10/7, IRAN IS LOSING THE WAR. NOW, ISRAEL MUST SECURE PEACE

Even Troufanov's own employer has forsaken him. Despite working as an engineer on a pivotal project for Amazon, the Seattle-based company has been silent about his plight.

Amazon isn't alone in their disinterest in their imprisoned Jewish employees. One year ago, PepsiCo's subsidiary, SodaStream, had one of its employees, Guy Gilboa-Dalal taken captive as well, and Pepsi have maintained their silence. Pepsi has had no issues speaking up and ponying up on other social issues, yet, when it comes to their own staffer kidnapped from a music festival, they can't be bothered to advocate for his immediate and unconditional release.

On the anniversary of October 7th, hostage Emily Damari's mother Mandy spoke out about her daughter, violently taken from a Kibbutz on the Gaza border, Kfar Aza.

ONE YEAR AFTER 10/7 ATTACKS AND DEMOCRAT-RUN STATES HAVE LET THE PROBLEM FESTER

In her British accent, Mandy pleaded, ""I would like to feel that the British public were behind her, and the British government were behind her, and they were saying there is a British hostage held captive in the terror tunnels by Hamas in Gaza. I want them to know she's there, and to advocate for her release, unconditionally and immediately. She's a young woman, and who knows what's happening to her. If there's a way to put her on social media, and see her out there. Remind people that she's there, [and] make sure she's not forgotten.""

The worst fears of their families and loved ones have been realized; Sasha, Guy and Emily have been forgotten. Put simply and bluntly: Hostages and their families feel alone and forsaken because they have been. Their employers have abandoned them, and their governments have, too. The world community and organizations, tasked with advocating for the most vulnerable among us, have clearly indicated that Jews don't count in their hierarchy of victims.

Not only are the victims of October 7th forgotten, they have been transformed into oppressors by evil individuals and organizations who have decided that Jewish lives simply do not matter.

Amnesty International UK, in the days leading up to the anniversary, justified the massacre and reminded their followers ""Don't let anyone tell you that this all started on the 7th of October 2023.""

In response to Amnesty, pro-Israel influencer Hen Mazzig asked, ""So when did it start? In 2002, during the Second Intifada, when I was almost killed in a terror attack? Or in 1951, when my family was expelled from Tunisia for being Jewish? Or in 1941, during the Farhud, when my family members were killed and expelled from Iraq? Or the Hebron massacre in 1929? When did it start? When did the world become so apathetic as to deny Jews the right to mourn our dead and post videos like this on the day we commemorate the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust? And October 7th hasn't ended for us, because 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza for 365 days.""

A year on, millions of Jews, both American and Israelis alike, are all still trapped in October 7th, but the year is still 2023, not 2024. Life has moved on as we have scrambled to try to beg for sympathy, relevancy and attention while the world marks holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah, Easter and Passover, all the while we struggle to remind the world that we are still trapped in October. And here we are, back in October.

In her famous book, ""Anne of Green Gables,"" L. M. Montgomery wrote, ""I'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers.""

Anti-Israel protesters set up an encampment outside the home of a Jewish Democratic House member on the eve of the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas terror attacks, the congressman revealed on social media.

Rep. Greg Landsman, D-Ohio, posted on X throughout the evening of Oct. 6, announcing that a group of people with their faces covered congregated outside his house, prompting his family to get police escorts in order to exit and enter their home.

""A group of masked anti-Israel protesters assembled outside my home early Sunday morning and remained through the evening, forcing police to escort my family in and out of our house for safety,"" the lawmaker declared in a post that included a photo of the group. ""The protesters refuse to leave, setting up tents, cots, and sleeping bags in their encampment in the road, and are spending the night harassing my family outside our home. It's not clear if or when they will leave,"" he added in another tweet.

Landsman's communications director told Fox News Digital via email that as of Monday morning, the individuals were still outside the congressman's home in Cincinnati.

NEW DEMS ARE LASER-FOCUSED ON FIGHTING CRIME

Landsman noted that Monday marks the grim anniversary of the heinous Oct. 7, 2023, terror attack against Israel in which Hamas committed atrocities.

""On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the October 7th terror attacks, when Jews were brutally murdered and kidnapped, these people came to the home of a Jewish family at night, dressed in all black and fully masked,"" the congressman said in a statement.

""They've done this to my staff and me for nearly a year, and now they're doing it to my family and neighbors. I don't think they have any boundaries at this point.

The Iranian-backed Hamas and its supporters unleashed a scale of unprecedented barbarism, including beheadings and burning bodies, within the territory of the Jewish state, resulting in the mass murder of nearly 1,200 people, including over 30 Americans.

The U.S. designated terrorist movement Hamas also kidnapped more than 250 people on that fateful day that jolted Israel like none of the numerous wars against Iran-backed proxies that the tiny Jewish state has fought within this century. As of Monday, 101 hostages still remain in Hamas captivity, .

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

After a year of intense war with Hamas, including the opening of six additional fronts against the Islamic Republic of Iran's ""Axis of Resistance,"" Netanyahu has bounced back to take on the threat to Israel's very existence. He is in his prime as a modern war planner and head of state, a number of Israeli experts told Fox News Digital, including Israel's top diplomat to the United Nations.

""Prime Minister Netanyahu's leadership in this war is a case study in tenacity and courage.""

""Netanyahu was completely shocked during the first hours on the first day of the attack, but at the same time, he understood what was going on and controlled events. Netanyahu responded very quickly,"" Ariel Kahana, the senior diplomatic correspondent for the widely read Hebrew-language daily Israel Hayom, told Fox News Digital.

Kahana referenced Netanyahu's public announcement on Oct. 7, in which he declared, ""Citizens of Israel, we are at war, not in an operation or in rounds, but at war. This morning, Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the State of Israel and its citizens.""

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ISSUE WARNING AHEAD OF OCT 7 ATTACKS ANNIVERSARY

Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, said, ""This isn't a war Israel started nor is it a war Israel wanted. But, under the leadership of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel has succeeded in mitigating the threat of Hamas by destroying its tunnel infrastructure and taking out its leaders. Israel is also successfully degrading Hezbollah in the north by eliminating its senior leadership and launching a targeted operation in southern Lebanon with the goal of pushing the group north of the Litani River and reducing the threat the terrorist organization poses to our northern border.""

Danon, who is a member of Netanyahu's conservative Likud party, added, ""While we are making progress, there is still work to be done. We still have 101 hostages who are held in brutal captivity in Gaza, and we still have 70,000 Israelis who are refugees in their own country, unable to return to their homes in the north.""

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY TERRORISTS IN GAZA

Prior to Oct. 7, Netanyahu was an embattled prime minister. His right-wing coalition government had suffered public humiliation when his administration was forced to abandon its judicial reform plan because of massive civil society protests.

Now, with a string of tactical victories over Hezbollah and Hamas' top leaders, including Israeli control over most of the Gaza Strip, Bibi, as he is known in Israel by his nickname, has gained popularity in political polling.

""Bibi made the right actions against Hamas and Hezbollah. That is why you see him rising in the polls.""

One key turning point for Israel is the near total decimation of the leadership of the U.S. classified terrorist movement Hezbollah, including its leader Hassan Nasrallah, in Lebanon.

ISRAEL WAS BEHIND LEBANON PAGER ATTACK TARGETING HEZBOLLAH, SENIOR US OFFICIAL SAYS, AS NEW BLASTS REPORTED

The de facto ruler over the Lebanese state, Hezbollah, launched missiles at Israel one day after the Hamas invasion, on Oct. 8. Last week, Israeli ground troops entered south Lebanon, with a view toward rooting out Hezbollah terrorists and missiles that sparked the flight of as many as 70,000 Israelis from their homes in the north.

Kahana noted, ""Bibi made the right actions against Hamas and Hezbollah. That is why you see him rising in the polls. He is the only one to use the term victory. You don't hear that from the security establishment."" He cited the examples of Bibi's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and Herzi Halevi , the chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, who ""are not talking about a complete defeat of Hamas.""

The veteran Israeli commentator said Israel's seizure of the southern Gaza city of Rafah was a telling example of a clash between Bibi and his war planners, Gallant and Halevi. There was hesitation on the part of Gallant and Halevi while Netanyahu wanted to expedite the capture of Rafah, the last major holdout of sizeable Hamas terrorist forces. Kahana chalked up a possible explanation of delay from Gallant and Halevi to the Biden administration's interference in having expressed opposition to the IDF operation in Rafah.

After a four-month offensive in Rafah, the IDF, in September, declared victory over Hamas' Rafah brigade. The incursion into Rafah also secured the release of four Israeli hostages in June. From May to September, the IDF eliminated thousands of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in Rafah.

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

According to Kahana, ""Bibi had to push the army to act."" He compared Bibi to Britain's WWII prime minister, Winston Churchill, who demanded that his army do certain things but encountered resistance. Kahana noted, ""Netanyahu has full responsibility for what brought about Oct. 7, but he is leading the war better than Gallant, Halevi and Benny Gantz.""

""What is the strategy, what is the exit plan in the war against Hezbollah?""

Gantz, a retired general and leader of the main opposition party, left Bibi's war cabinet in June.

Yet Bibi still has many critics who believe he should have tendered his resignation on Oct. 7 or a few months into the war against Hamas. Netanyahu has also been accused of forgoing the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and thousands of Israelis have protested on a near weekly basis against his policies since the war began.

Yossi Melman, a veteran Israeli columnist for the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, is one of Bibi's sharpest critics. Melman said, ""His performance is very bad."" He said Bibi has ""no vision and no strategy."" Melman asked, ""What is the strategy, what is the exit plan in the war against Hezbollah?""

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

He claimed, ""Most of his decisions are about political and personal survival.""

Israel's then-attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, charged Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a legal saga that started four years ago and is still unfolding. Netanyahu has vehemently denied all the allegations against him.

Melman also claimed that Netanyahu, along with his cabinet, military and security chiefs, refused to accept responsibility for Oct. 7.

As one of Israel's leading intelligence experts, he attributed the penetration of Hezbollah's leadership structure to the ""last four chiefs of the Mossad and the military chiefs. ""Israel's foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, built these abilities over the years,"" he said.

He also claimed that Netanyahu also ""strained relations with the U.S. in an unprecedented way. His performance is full of ungratefulness. The U.S. sent air carriers and the U.S. provided $14 billion in extra military aid and resupplied ammunition. Without that, Israel could not sustain one year against Gaza and now Lebanon and also Iran.""

Melman also noted that Bibi has failed to secure the freedom of 101 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.

Caroline Glick, who served as an adviser to Netanyahu, took issue with criticism against him, pointing out, ""Prime Minister Netanyahu's leadership in this war is a case study in tenacity and courage. Israel's other political leaders and military leadership all demanded that he capitulate to continuous pressure from the Biden-Harris administration to stand down and permit Hamas to survive and accept Hezbollah's continued presence on the border, sufficing with an entirely defensive posture.""

She continued, ""Had Israel agreed, its regional standing would have completely collapsed. He refused. His tenacious refusal to give up the fight and determination to fight to victory is the reason Israel has been able to turn the corner. Israel is winning today in a way that seemed unimaginable a year ago. We never would have made it to this turning point had it not been for Netanyahu."""

Vice President Kamala Harris was roasted on social media for a comment on Israel and how she ""can't make any sense at all"" in a new viral clip.

Harris gave a rare sit-down interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" Sunday, where Bill Whitaker asked whether the U.S. has any ""sway"" over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the war against Hamas continues. Monday marks one year since the brutal terrorist attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel. And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents, Iran, I think that it is without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks,"" Harris responded.

She continued, ""Now the work we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a cease-fire. And we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.""

The lengthy ""word salad"" and her inability to commit to Israel as an ally shocked and frustrated several X users after the clip premiered.

""Shocking,"" Fox News host Mark Levin exclaimed.

Comedian Tim Young commented, ""60 minutes asked Kamala if Netanyahu even listens to us after we give Israel weapons and money. Kamala replies with a pile of word salad. It would be easier if she just said that no world leader respects or listens to her even after we hand out money.""

""This is the real Kamala. And she's no friend of Israel,"" California Rep. Darrell Issa wrote.

New York Rep.

Whitaker asked, ""Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?""

""I think with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people, and the answer to that question is yes,"" Harris responded.

The Israel Defense Forces announced Monday that multiple rockets were fired toward Israel from the Gaza Strip on the one-year anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attack that launched the war.

Military officials say the Israeli Air Force ""intercepted five launches that crossed from the north of the Gaza Strip"" into Israel. The Jerusalem Post reported that two people were lightly injured after being hit with shrapnel.

""Sirens sounded in Israeli communities surrounding Gaza a few moments ago,"" the IDF wrote on X. ""At exactly this time last year, sirens were sounded all over Israel, marking the beginning of Hamas' October 7 massacre.""

The Israeli military said prior to the attack, its troops ""struck Hamas terror targets and launchers throughout the Gaza Strip"" in order to thwart ""an immediate threat.""

""A short while ago, the Israel Air Force (IAF) struck Hamas launch posts and underground terrorist infrastructure,"" the IDF added. ""Furthermore, overnight, the IAF and IDF artillery struck targets in the central Gaza Strip that posed a threat to IDF troops operating in the area.""

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited a memorial in Jerusalem on Monday for civilians, first responders and soldiers killed in Hamas' attack on Oct. 7, 2023.

""We remember our fallen, our hostages - whom we are committed to return - our heroes who fell in defense of our homeland and country. We went through a terrible massacre a year ago and we arose as a nation as lions,"" he said.

ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF OCT. 7 ATTACKS ARRIVES WITH LASTING TRAUMA FOR ISRAELIS, AMERICAN JEWS: EXPERT

There are still 101 hostages who have been held in Gaza by Hamas since the start of the war. Thirty-six of them are declared dead and their bodies are being held by the terrorist group.

Idan Shtivi, a 28-year-old who volunteered to photograph the Nova music festival in southern Israel that Hamas attacked on Oct. 7, was declared dead on Monday.

Idan, an environmental sciences student, loved nature, camping, and music. He was planning to work in the energy sector to combat climate change and join an African volunteer program that aids children.

""On October 7, Idan arrived at the Nova Festival in the early morning to document his friends' performances and workshops. However, he never made it inside,"" the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement. ""When the attack began, Idan helped two strangers he had just met escape from the site. This selfless choice ultimately led to his abduction.""

Hezbollah rocket attack on Israel hits Haifa for first time,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-rocket-attack-israel-hits-haifa-first-time,2024-10-07T11:32:11Z,"'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts discuss the latest in the Israel-Hamas war and Vice President Kamala Harris' foreign policy record.

Hezbollah rockets hit Haifa, Israel's third-largest city, on Monday in the first direct attack on the city since the conflict began.

Hezbollah's ""Fadi 1"" missiles landed in Haifa early Monday morning as the country began to mark the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 massacre. Two rockets hit Haifa and five more hit the city of Tiberias, which lies about 40 miles away.

""This was the first real hit in the city,"" Haifa's mayor, Yona Yahav, said in a statement.

Israeli media said 10 people were injured across the two cities, and police in Haifa confirmed reports of minor injuries as well as damage to buildings.

ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS HEZBOLLAH LEADER HASSAN NASRALLAH KILLED IN BEIRUT STRIKE

In response, Israel says IDF fighter jets struck targets they said belonged to Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in Beirut.

The exchange of fire comes as Israel continues to issue warnings about a response to Iran's massive missile attack against Israel that occurred last week. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued an ominous warning to Iranian officials during an interview with Fox News on Sunday.

During an exchange with Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst on Sunday, Gallant promised that Israeli forces are considering all options in terms of its response to Iran's attacks against Israel, including potentially striking Iranian nuclear sites.

BIDEN SAYS HE WILL TALK TO NETANYAHU AS ISRAEL PUMMELS SUNNI TERROR TARGETS IN BEIRUT

""At the moment, everything is on the table,"" the Israeli official said. ""Israel will respond to the unprecedented Iranian attack in the manner of our choosing, and at the time and place of our choosing.""

President Biden told reporters last week that he would not support a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, but said Israel had the right to act ""proportionately"" to Iran. On Saturday, Vice President Kamala Harris vowed to send $157 million of ""additional assistance"" to Lebanon, which, she claimed, is ""facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation.""

"Saving lives on 'Death Street,' how an Israeli kindergarten teacher became a battlefield hero on October 7",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/saving-lives-death-street-how-israeli-kindergarten-teacher-became-battlefield-hero-october-7,2024-10-07T11:32:10Z,"SOUTHERN ISRAEL - Tali Hadad is a 49-year-old mother of six and a kindergarten teacher whose days would normally be spent teaching basic reading, math and social skills to 5-year-olds. She never imagined that one day she would be forced to make life-or-death decisions while under fire in the middle of a war zone.

But on Oct. 7, 2023, she was thrust into unimaginable circumstances.

As Hamas launched its assault at 6:45 a.m., she awoke to the sound of sirens and gunfire in her hometown of Ofakim, a small, working-class city in southern Israel 15 miles from the border with Gaza. The piercing alarms that filled the air signaled this was not an ordinary rocket attack, to which much of the region had, over the course of many years, become accustomed.

ISRAELI SOLDIER GRAVELY INJURED IN OCT. 7 TERROR ATTACK FINDS NEW FAITH, OFFERS HOPE TO OTHERS

Hadad instantly knew her family was in grave danger.

Her son, Itamar, a soldier in officer training, was home on leave for the weekend. As the sounds of gunfire grew closer, he grabbed his rifle, fully aware that there was fighting just outside their door. Without hesitation, he ran toward the terrorists. Hadad, still in her pajamas, quickly slipped on running shoes and chased after him, her instincts as a mother taking over.

""I ran toward the playground,"" Hadad told Fox News Digital. ""I hid behind a wall and saw a line of terrorists walking with rifles, heading in the direction where my son had gone."" Moments later, she heard gunshots. ""I knew Itamar was in the middle of it. I waited, hoping he would come out, but he didn't. So, I ran toward him.""

Dodging through alleys while gunfire rang out around her, Hadad saw the devastation unfold. ""People were yelling from windows, begging for help,"" she said. ""But there were no ambulances coming, no one to save them.""

Then, she saw Itamar. He had been shot multiple times - in the stomach, leg and thigh. Two of his comrades lay dead on the ground beside him.

""He looked at me and said, 'Mom, what are you doing here?' I told him, 'You're hurt, I'm going to take you to the hospital,'"" she recalled.

With gunfire still echoing around her, Hadad sprinted back to her house, jumped into the family car and drove straight back to her son. ""They put Itamar in the car, along with more of the wounded, and I drove as fast as I could, 120 kilometers per hour, to the Magen David Adom station (Israel's national emergency medical service) at the entrance to the city,"" she said. ""I knew if I drove slowly, the terrorists would shoot me.""

After handing Itamar over to the paramedics, she made a fateful decision. ""I told him, 'Mom isn't coming with you. You'll go in the ambulance, I'll join you later. I have to go back and help the others.'""

6 MONTHS ON, FAMILIES OF US HOSTAGES IN GAZA STUCK IN 'AMBIGUOUS TRAUMA'

Hadad returned to the scene of the fighting and made three more trips to rescue 13 people in total, all while under constant fire. ""People tried to stop me,"" she said. ""They told me it was too dangerous, but I took Itamar's rifle, and I knew this was something I had to do. I had no choice but to act.""

After hours of intense fighting involving police officers, forces from the Yamam special-operations unit, armed civilians and off-duty soldiers, Israeli forces regained control of the town. A helicopter arrived to evacuate the wounded. Only then was Hadad able to step away from her role as a rescuer and check on her son at the hospital. Itamar had survived, but his road to recovery would be long.

""Half of the rehabilitation is physical, and half is mental,"" Itamar Hadad told Fox News Digital, reflecting on the traumatic events of that day, the friends he lost in the battle, and those he has lost since in Gaza, where his unit, Sayeret Nahal, has suffered many casualties. Despite the pain, his dream remains to return to his unit and continue fighting.

AN INSIDE LOOK AT ISRAEL'S SPECIAL FORCES RESCUE UNIT FIGHTING TERRORISTS, RESCUING HOSTAGES: 'FULL ON FAUDA'

On Oct. 7, 47 of Ofakim's 50,000 residents were murdered, and the street where Hadad lives became known as Rechov Ha'Mavet - ""Death Street.""

A year after the attack, Ofakim is rebuilding. Death Street, once a symbol of horror, has been renovated. The city has built a memorial, painted murals and planted olive trees - a sign of life replacing the destruction.

""We've gathered the pieces, all the memories of the victims, and we're trying to bring life back to the place that was destroyed,"" Hadad said.

Ofakim was not among the many towns and settlements in the south that were resettled in other parts of Israel. But the psychological scars remain. The waiting list for trauma counseling has grown, overwhelming the available therapists. In response, the Israel Psychoanalytic Society and the NGO IsraAid established a multidisciplinary trauma center, offering free mental health support to survivors of the massacre.

Hadad, like many others in Ofakim, and in the entire country, continues to struggle with the emotional aftermath. ""We're still bleeding,"" she said. For her, the experience was life-changing. She hasn't returned to work since the attack, choosing, instead, to stay home and care for Itamar. Five of her six children are serving in the IDF, either on active duty or in the reserves. At the moment, two of them are fighting in Gaza. Her youngest daughter will enter the army in a month.

The community of Ofakim continues to heal, but the memories of Oct. 7 will never fade. ""We remember how our children ran through the streets barefoot, fighting like lions. No politicians come here anymore. No tour buses arrive. But we remember. We will always remember,"" Hadad said."
One year after 10/7 attacks and Democrat-run states have let antisemitism fester,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/one-year-after-10-7-attacks-democrat-run-states-have-let-antisemitism-fester,2024-10-07T09:22:57Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

October 7th was the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Hamas invaded Israel, murdering people at random, raping, destroying homes and kidnapping people back to Gaza. There are more than 100 still held hostage, including four Americans.

Raw and hurting, American Jews watched the streets of U.S. cities fill up with crowds. The people in the streets weren't marching to stand with the slaughtered and the raped. They were gleeful, exuberant and there were many of them.

In New York's Times Square, hundreds of people gathered on October 8, while Israel was still sorting through their dead, and counting how many children and elderly had been kidnapped, to flash swastikas and chant ""death to Israel"" as well as ""700,"" the number of Israeli dead counted at the time. That number was later revised to 1,195.

AS OCTOBER 7TH ANNIVERSARY APPROACHES, JEWISH STUDENTS BRACE FOR PROTESTS, VOW TO 'WALK PROUDLY'

In Los Angeles, it's been nearly a year of violent protests outside synagogues and in Jewish neighborhoods. One Jewish man was killed after a confrontation in November.

It seemed like antisemitism was festering all over the country.

But a closer look showed that it wasn't, actually, happening everywhere, it was very specifically happening in places primarily run by Democrats. It's not that antisemitism can't exist in red areas. It can, it does. Vandalism, verbal harassment, even physical assault can happen in Republican-led places. But the occurrence is far rarer and the real difference is the consequences.

According to the Anti Defamation League (ADL) ""The states with the highest number of incidents were California (1,266), New York (1,218), New Jersey (830), Florida (463) and Massachusetts (440)."" Four of those states are blue states. In my red home state of Florida, we had approximately the same number of incidents as Massachusetts while having about three times the population and a third of the incidents of New York despite having over 2 million more people.

The ADL is a left-leaning Jewish organization, and yet they admit, ""On a per capita basis, the states with the highest concentration of antisemitic incidents were New Jersey - with 8.93 incidents per 100,000 residents - followed by Vermont (6.64), Massachusetts (6.28), New York (6.23), Maryland (5.49) and Connecticut (5.09). On the city level, two cities - Manhattan (26.84 per 100,000) and Washington, D.C. (25.75 per 100,000) - stood out with far and away the highest levels of incidents per capita. Brookyln [sic], NY, stood out specifically in terms of physical assault incidents, with 1.16 assaults per 100,000 residents."" Again, all deep blue states and cities.

The argument to defend the blue states, and their rampant antisemitism, is that Jews primarily live in those blue states, so of course, antisemitism will be higher. But that doesn't explain Florida's low count. It's also hard not to notice that Mississippi had 19 incidents of vandalism and harassment while New Hampshire had 35 when they each have under 1% of their population being Jewish and Mississippi is nearly double New Hampshire's population. There is a pattern, and it's related to whom the population elects.

Antisemitism simply does not thrive in red areas the same way as it does in areas dominated by Democrats. Jew-hatred, and the chaos that accompanies it onto our streets is put down as quickly as it surfaces in places like Florida.

Last October, Dr. Ahmed ElKoussa was fired from his job as a Miami dentist after ripping down posters of kidnapped hostages being held by Hamas. Anti-Israel agitators protested outside Real-Time Laboratories, an American company which is a subsidiary of an Israeli weapons manufacturer, in Boca Raton, but were met with even more pro-Israel protesters. When the anti-Israel protesters got violent, Boca Raton Police immediately took action and made arrests.

And in May, when anti-Israel protesters pulled their usual move of attempting to block a highway in Orlando, they lasted a total of 11 minutes before Florida Highway Patrol arrested them. Governor Ron DeSantis boasted, ""I think that's the world record.""

Meanwhile, in New York, the Manhattan district attorney has dropped all charges against the violent anti-Israel protesters who occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall. In California, protesters have spent the last year blocking traffic for the Palestinian cause. Only some incidents yielded arrests. In March, protesters stopped traffic outside San Francisco International Airport and blocked security lines inside for four hours. No one was arrested. This simply does not happen in red states.

School campuses in red states were relatively quiet, while Ivy League campuses in the northeast featured Jewish students being told to ""go back to Poland"" and assaulted. The protests that did spring up on red state campuses were quickly brought under control.

Antisemitism simply does not thrive in red areas the same way as it does in areas dominated by Democrats. Jew-hatred, and the chaos that accompanies it onto our streets is put down as quickly as it surfaces in places like Florida.

It was obvious to the students at some of the red-state universities that the protests were about Israel, yes, but they were about America too. U.S. flags were often torn down and replaced with Palestinian flags. At the University of North Carolina, fraternity brothers protected an American flag from being defaced, while at Princeton University, protesting students halted a Memorial Day parade because it featured an American flag.

Open antisemitism exposes a deep rot in societies and the hatred of Jews for the last year has caused many to notice that the same people hate America too. History is filled with examples of governments and societies that no longer exist because succumbing to the world's oldest hatred was a clear sign that their civilization was on a downhill trajectory. What is happening in blue cities is exposing their own decay.

Cities, like New York, that had been prospering not so long ago have had a hard time bouncing back from the bad policies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the rolling back of crime policies during the Bill de Blasio administration. Antisemitism is a symptom of a larger problem and places that control antisemitic activity can count on flourishing in a way that places that don't won't. Jew-hatred can happen anywhere, the acceptance of it does not."
"One year after 10/7, Iran is losing the war. Now, Israel must secure peace",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/one-year-after-10-7-iran-losing-war-now-israel-must-secure-peace,2024-10-07T09:22:56Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

One year ago, Iran took a gamble and started a war in Gaza with the attack by Hamas that killed nearly 1,200 Israelis, including over 40 Americans, and took more than 200 hostages

A year later, it is clear that Iran is losing this war.

For his part, Ayatollah Khamenei on Friday, October 4, 2024, remembered the massacre as ""logical and legal"" and used his first public Friday sermon in five years to proclaim that Iran ""won't back down."" He also had a rifle at the podium. He's that worried.

ISRAELI MILITARY KILLS 250 HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS SINCE START OF LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN LEBANON

You can measure the defeat of Iran in two ways. The first is restoring Israel's security and carrying out the military destruction of Iran's terror agents Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and more.

Israeli strikes of the past several weeks have brought this goal closer.

Second, getting Israel and Saudi Arabia back on track toward normalizing relations will be the ultimate defeat for Iran.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

Iran couldn't stand it.

Last fall, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman were in serious, quiet negotiations. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan wrote in his Foreign Affairs article that the work toward joint infrastructure projects and new partnerships between Israel and its Arab neighbors was ""bearing fruit.""

""Every day we get closer,"" bin Salman said in an interview aired Sep. 20, 2023.

""We can forge a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said to President Joe Biden during a televised meeting in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly sessions that same day.

The impending deal included a significant Palestinian component of concessions by Israel. ""It is not a done deal and there are many variables, but the odds are more than 50%,"" a senior Israeli official told Axios at the time.

Diplomacy was bubbling along, with Netanyahu invited to Washington, D.C., at the end of the year.

You can imagine how that went over in Tehran.

Less than two weeks later, Iran gave ""the green light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut"" on Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, sending word to Hamas and Hezbollah, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The objective was to force Israel into a war to blacken its reputation and scorch any path to peace.

To do it, Iran coached Hamas to change tactics.

Just three years earlier, in May 2021, Hamas waged an all-out missile war with huge salvoes to overwhelm Israel's missile defenses, to no avail. Even with the incredibly brief warning times characteristic of short-range launches, Israel's multi-layered defensive system held. Of course, the Israeli Air Force hit weapons caches and launch sites. Egypt stepped in to broker the ceasefire.

This time, the kind of war sought by Iran would have to go beyond missile attacks.

Officers of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps began specific planning with Hamas for the attack in August 2023. The goal was ""the most significant breach of Israel's borders since the 1973 Yom Kippur War,"" the Journal reported Oct. 8, 2023.

And so it was. Note Iran was content to let the civilians of Gaza pay a terrible price being caught of the middle of a war zone.

Most of the Hamas military structure in Gaza was destroyed by the spring of 2024. Biden offered a ceasefire on May 30. Hamas toyed with agreement, but this time there would be no ceasefire despite strenuous efforts by Egypt and Qatar. Iran wasn't ready.

Enter Hezbollah. A surge in rocket attacks across the alleged UN ""blue line"" effectively saw Hezbollah take the lead in fighting. Now, Israel would have to contend with Hezbollah, too. The war entered a new phase with the July 30 killing of Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas Politburo, in Tehran itself.

Israel's systematic campaign has decimated Hezbollah's leadership, culminating with the pager attacks and the death of Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's strikes in Lebanon are now attempting to restore border safety.

A year after the initial attack, Iran is the loser by any military standard. Two big missile attacks on Israel have been thwarted. The military advantage rests with Israel. However, I suspect more strikes on legitimate military and infrastructure targets to reduce Iran's power may be required.

Despite Israel's military successes, dangers remain. For a year, the American military has done everything President Joe Biden asked in the name of deterrence. This includes steps that made sense: U.S. Navy destroyers intercepting Iran's missiles, aircraft carriers and F-22s deployed with strike options. And measures that didn't, such as the Gaza aid pier. The bottom line is 40,000 U.S. forces deployed to the U.S. Central Command region, all to keep a lid on Iran. That can't go on forever (although China would like it).

The path ahead depends on restoring Israel's security and taking out Iran's capabilities. After that, the goal is to get back to the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a goal shared by the Trump and Biden administrations. It's not easy - the two-state dilemma remains. But it is the one sure way to defeat Iran, for good.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

And it's important for Americans to stay committed to Israel's security and to the diplomatic goals, despite the pain caused by the shock unleashing of antisemitism. Too many 21st Century Americans turned out to be biased, ignorant, susceptible to foreign instigation, or all of the above. We Americans have to do better than this.

Don't forget that in the words of the Justice Department's Indictment of Hamas, the government of Iran's regional and global campaign of terrorism aims to ""weaken and ultimately destroy both the United States and Israel.""

America's best interest remains to support Israel - and take all military steps necessary to get back to the regional diplomacy that will shut down Iran for good."
New Jersey high school allegedly banned yellow ribbons honoring Israeli hostages: 'Deeply offensive',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-jersey-high-school-allegedly-banned-yellow-ribbons-honoring-israeli-hostages-deeply-offensive,2024-10-07T09:06:55Z,"October 7th Nova festival survivor Millet Ben Haim shares the harsh reality of the Israel-Hamas war as the one-year anniversary nears.

A New Jersey high school is accused of banning yellow ribbons, aimed at honoring Israeli hostages abducted by Hamas, at a club fair, a move critics described as ""deeply offensive"" and ""blatant antisemitism.""

Fair Lawn High School also prohibited Israeli flags at the event, because administrators believed the flags were too political, some parents and the group StopAntisemitism allege, noting that members of the Muslim Student Association were permitted to display a keffiyeh, a traditional headdress worn by men from parts of the Middle East, according to the New York Post.

The event, according to the report, was partly promoting a trip to Israel.

""What happened at Fair Lawn High School is an alarming case of hypocrisy and blatant antisemitism,"" StopAntisemitism founder Liora Rez told the outlet. ""This incident is nothing short of a direct violation of Jewish students' rights to express their identity and humanitarian concerns.""

AMERICAN FATHER OF HAMAS HOSTAGE ITAY CHEN PUSHES US, ISRAEL ON 'PLAN B' AS NEGOTIATIONS FALTER

Between 33% to 40% of the 35,000 residents in Fair Lawn are Jewish. Fair Lawn in Bergen County is located about 17 miles from New York City.

This comes a year after Hamas terrorists' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks against Israel, which led to military retaliation from Israel and sparked a still-ongoing war in the Middle East. More than 250 people, including some Americans, were abducted by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attacks. Many hostages have since been released, rescued or killed, while dozens are still held by Hamas.

One parent said the school district's failure to address complaints about alleged antisemitism is not a new concern.

""The incident at Fair Lawn High School's Club Fair is not an isolated event but part of a disturbing pattern of antisemitism that I and other parents have been battling for years,"" Adi Vaxman, founder and president of Operation Israel, which provides humanitarian relief to Israel, told the New York Post.

""Despite numerous meetings with the board of education and the superintendent, promises of inclusion in anti-antisemitism efforts have gone unfulfilled,"" added Vaxman, whose daughter Maya attends the school.

Vaxman continued: ""The administrator's claim that the yellow hostage ribbon -- a humanitarian symbol calling for the release of innocent civilians abducted from their homes and held in subhuman conditions by Hamas -- is 'political' is deeply offensive and unacceptable.""

ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF OCT. 7 ATTACKS ARRIVES WITH LASTING TRAUMA FOR ISRAELIS, AMERICAN JEWS: EXPERT

Claiming a double standard, Vaxman said that the black-and-white keffiyeh, which she says is ""a symbol of the armed resistance against Israelis,"" was allowed to remain on display at the club event for hours.

""This glaring double standard exposes the bias of the school and the administrator in question,"" she said. ""It's alarming that the school supports the Muslim Student Association identifying as Palestinian while censoring the Israeli flag for the Jewish Student Union. Israel is the world's only Jewish state, naturally associated with Judaism and relevant to the [Jewish Student Union's] advertised trip to Israel.""

Fair Lawn High Principal Paul Gorski released a statement defending the school's response to ribbons and flags.

""We take pride in our Student Activities program as well as the leadership shown by both students and faculty,"" Gorski wrote. ""During this year's event, both the Muslim Student Association and the Jewish Student Union were asked to adjust items that were not part of their original displays. Both groups received the same instruction and were treated equally.""

Gorski said no students were disciplined in connection with their participation at the club fair.

The principal also said the high school participates in the Anti-Defamation League's ""No Place for Hate"" initiative and that the school was ""proudly recognized"" with a Gold Star distinction from the group during a ceremony earlier this year.

""We condemn antisemitism and remain steadfast in our commitment to creating an inclusive community where hate is not tolerated,"" he said. ""When we return to school after being closed for the Jewish holidays, we will engage in dialogue with our students and community. Hate has no home at Fair Lawn High School.""

Vaxman, however, maintains that the school discriminated against Jewish students during the club fair.

""This selective application of rules further demonstrates the discriminatory treatment of Jewish students,"" Vaxman said. ""The school's response is extremely disappointing and fails to address these core issues. Their participation in the 'No Place for Hate' initiative rings hollow when Jewish students face such blatant discrimination and intimidation in their school on a regular basis. We demand concrete actions, not empty platitudes, to combat antisemitism and ensure true equality for 'all' students."""

In the lead-up to the attack's anniversary, the FBI and Department of Homeland Security issued a public service announcement warning of hate crimes or violence: ""Jewish, Muslim, or Arab institutions - including synagogues, mosques/Islamic centers, and community centers - and large public gatherings, such as memorials, vigils, or other lawful demonstrations, present attractive targets for violent attacks or for hoax threats by a variety of threat actors, including violent extremists and hate crime perpetrators,"" it stated.

A new report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), also released before the attack's one-year anniversary, revealed that after Oct. 7, antisemitic incidents in the U.S. rose more than 200% from the year prior.

In a Hebrew message to Israeli citizens after Rosh Hashanah, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu recounted the months of war on multiple fronts and touted recent military successes in taking out key Hamas and Hezbollah terrorist leaders.

Life in Israel one year after the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attacks is far from a return to normal, as one expert explained to Fox News Digital what it's like dealing with the psychological fallout of the massacre while living near an active war zone - and even the lasting consequences for American Jews 12 months later.

Dr. David Fox, director of crisis and trauma services for Chai Lifeline International, a Jewish nonprofit and network supporting families living with illness or loss, said he's traveled to Israel multiple times over the last year to meet with hostages' families and consult with survivors' families on the ground.

""I think Oct. 7 will remain seared into the consciousness of Jews and of Israelis,"" Fox told Fox News Digital. ""It's sometimes just referred to as 'the seventh' or as 'October.' October is not an Israeli or Hebrew word, but that's what it's been called. So I don't think it will ever be forgotten as an infamous day of what has become an ongoing battle for survival.""

The Los Angeles-based rabbi described to Fox News Digital how daily life in Israel remains uprooted: Tens of thousands of Israelis are internally displaced, and Israeli families must adjust as parents who were in the Army Reserves are tapped again for active duty. With a cease-fire and hostage release deal still yet to actualize, Fox also explained the lasting trauma and constant fear of another attack -- especially in border areas.

Fox said he spoke to one of the country's most prominent infertility specialists who transitioned from his day-to-day life as a gynecologist and obstetrician back into military service.

The doctor now spends his days crawling onto the battlefield to rescue soldiers who have been hit and carry them back to ambulances to be transported to hospitals.

""The families of those reservists who have now been activated and deployed, they may not see daddy for weeks or sometimes months at a time. Spouses may not see one another for a while... and there is that apprehension. Will he or will she return? So that has been a crisis for many individuals,"" Fox explained. ""On the other hand, those who serve in the IDF and the armed forces, they do it with a strong sense of conviction that we're doing the right thing, and we're doing really what God wants, but we're doing what our families need us to be doing right now. So those unfortunate separations don't end up fragmenting the family.""

""But I believe in most situations, the children will look up to that parent who has to be away,"" Fox said. ""They'll look up with love and admiration. But this has definitely been a change in what goes on on the ground, that family life has been changed.""

A heightened threat environment is especially palpable in moshavs, which are cooperative Jewish agricultural settlements in Israel. Fox cited a recent conversation with members of one moshav, which was ""surrounded by villages which were hostile,"" where settlers could hear messages broadcast from prayer towers or minarets calling out for attacks against Jews.

""Some of them are armed and many of them are not,"" Fox said of the Jewish residents. ""The army and security guards may not always be available at this point to shelter, to protect civilians. So there is a feeling of fluidity. The situation is changing.""

Over the past year, Fox said Chai Lifeline worked to expand its crisis hotline to provide ""around the clock"" support, as well as Zoom counseling, trauma intervention and other materials to Israelis or people who had family in Israel who witnessed the horrors of Hamas terrorists slaughtering approximately 1,200 people and taking hundreds of hostages on Oct. 7, 2023. Since then, the rabbi said he observed another societal change among young Israelis ""who are politically conscious"" as they look at the ""response or non-response of other countries, of the Red Cross or the United Nations"" and are ""rethinking their confidence in who we trust.""

""An ally who's with you in peace time, but who ignores you or turns against you in times of strife is not an ally,"" Fox said.

""The world does not expect the Jews to fight back,"" he added. ""The world does not expect a small country who has faced massacre and slaughter to get up and protect itself by going on the, let's say, the avenging offense. And we do have to face the condemnation of many of the sanctions of others. But I think a groundswell of understanding from still others that we are fighting to survive, and we are doing what any other country would do. If citizens were attacked and raped and mutilated and butchered, and their homes desecrated, I think we are doing what virtually any sovereign nation would do if its people were attacked.""

The trauma of the Oct. 7 attacks, Fox said, has remained for Israeli civilians and the families of hostages, including those who are still held in Gaza and are subjected to deprivation and torture.

Yet, Fox said there's also a bolstered sense of support among the Israeli people in supporting each other as the Jewish state continues its war effort.

""We know that there is a constant punctuation of the reactive grief by an intensification of horror and feeling terrorized,"" Fox told Fox News Digital. ""The attitude of the Jewish people historically and of the Israeli nation since its inception has been to react to oppression by displays of resilience coming together.""

IRAN'S AYATOLLAH ALI KHAMENEI IN HIDING WITH EXTRA SECURITY FOLLOWING HEZBOLLAH LEADER'S DEATH: REPORT

The rabbi told Fox News Digital that he has been directly in touch with Israeli families who've retreated from their homes in the north along the Lebanon border amid the Israeli military's escalating skirmishes and exchanges of rocket fire with Iran-backed Hezbollah terrorists, as well as people who have fled their homes in the south along the border with Hamas-controlled Gaza. Fox spoke to the continued need for intervention services, as people ""out of familiar territory"" have been finding ""it's very difficult to feel grounded emotionally and spiritually when you're not sure what's going to happen next, when you're not sure where to go.""

""There are families uprooted from their homes, nothing to go back to. All their belongings vanished,"" Fox said. ""But the country and its people, its blessed people, have absorbed those who have nowhere to go. And other communities have welcomed those in need of shelter. And we're finding ways to get them into schools with their children and to give them some type of financial support or even employment if that's needed.""

""There's also an upsurge in the principles that really have defined the Jewish religion in terms of loving kindness, charitable loss, compassion and caring for one another,"" the rabbi added. ""So there is this resounding feeling that we're in this together. We're going to help each other. Nonetheless, there's traumatization.""

""There's the abject traumatization of those who were part of the targeted massacres, who still have the imprint of what they saw, what they heard, what they witnessed, and some of them what they endured physically and mentally themselves,"" Fox explained. ""So there has been a definite need for trauma intervention services. We've been providing some of that.""

His work also extends to supporting Jewish Americans experiencing rising antisemitism in the United States.

Anti-Israel protests reached a fever pitch last spring at U.S. college campuses. With the return of the fall semester and the Oct. 7 anniversary approaching, Fox said there's a lot he unfortunately can't control.

""I think there's a lot we can't do,"" Fox said. ""Despite the fact that we're offering support, we can't get away from the fact that there is a new fear in the air, and it's based on a credible threat. And how that will pan out in the course of time, whether the bigotry and the prejudice will skyrocket again or whether it will come down. I don't think any of us can predict.""

Fox also pointed to attrition, as more Jewish students opt to transfer to Jewish institutions and out of major elite American universities. He made a parallel with what happened in Germany leading up to the Second World War and noted that, in the present day, leadership at universities seem to ""close their eyes"" or ""at times seem to condone"" antisemitism, causing Jewish students and parents to no longer feel safe.

""We saw this in Germany in the 1930s, where professors were fired from their positions if they were Jewish and students were, if they were Jewish, might not be admitted into the medical school or into the graduate school. So we've seen this before. That was because of the political governing of the state of Germany. What we're seeing here is not coming from the White House,"" Fox said. ""It's coming from other influences, other attractions. And the government or the police in some cases are just tolerating, and as I said earlier, at times, are condoning this. So it has some parallels, some echoes of pre-World War II.""

""There is a sea of change, I believe, in the attitudes shown toward Jewish people. We didn't think it would happen in America,"" he added."
"American father of Hamas hostage Itay Chen pushes US, Israel on 'Plan B' as negotiations falter",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-father-hamas-hostage-itay-chen-pushes-us-israel-plan-b-negotiations-falter,2024-10-07T08:16:30Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

""When was the last time you talked to your kid? Do you know where he slept last night? Do you know what he ate? Do you know if he had a blanket on him?"" Ruby Chen, father of Itay Chen who was taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, asked in a sit-down interview with Fox News Digital.

""All those types of questions are questions that we ask ourselves constantly,"" he said. ""The feeling is that we've been failed.""

Itay,19 years old when he was taken, has remained a hostage held in Gaza for 365 days after his unit in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was attacked in southern Israel when Hamas terrorists flooded the border in a series of mass assaults.

Chen, a New York City native, said he and his wife have been given ""unprecedented"" access to the White House, the CIA and other top agencies throughout the last year to discuss ongoing strategies to try and get the hostages out of Gaza.

ISRAEL SAYS TOP HAMAS RAFAH BRIGADE 'DISMANTLED' ON PHILADELPHI CORRIDOR, 2,000 TERRORISTS KILLED

The Chens have not only met with national security adviser Jake Sullivan a dozen times, as well as CIA Director William Burns and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, they also hold a weekly call with the White House.

But ultimately, these supportive efforts have fallen flat when it comes to the real needs of American families whose loved ones are still held hostage by Hamas.

""We have been failed by the Israeli government, we, as U.S. citizens, feel we've been failed by the Biden administration despite all of the access that they've provided us,"" he explained. ""They share as much as they can. But at the end of the day, it's... very black and white.

""Where is he?""

Chen explained that following the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, the Israeli government pushed a strategy to secure the release of the then 251 hostages by bombarding suspected Hamas positions in Gaza.

In the initial weeks following the deadly Hamas attacks, Israel began pounding northern Gaza - a move Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believed would bring Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar ""to his knees"" and make him be ""willing to release hostages.""

A week-long cease-fire in November saw the release of 105 hostages. Twelve other hostages have been freed following negotiations during the immediate aftermath of the attack, or because of IDF rescue operations between February and August.

YAZIDI WOMAN HELD HOSTAGE FOR 10 YEARS IN GAZA RESCUED IN ISRAEL, US OPERATION

None of the eight American hostages that were kidnapped have been released, and only seven continue to be held by Hamas after the body of Hersh Goldberg-Polin was discovered by IDF forces in late August, after he along with five others were killed by the terrorist group.

More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in the Gaza Strip - 97 of whom were abducted on Oct. 7, 2023.

The Chens, other American families and the international community have repeatedly urged Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire agreement and return all hostages to their families.

But disagreements over security corridors in Gaza have created a seemingly insurmountable hurdle as U.S., Egyptian and Qatari officials work to get Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement.

The father of the IDF soldier pointed out that so long as no one is discussing a ""day after"" plan for the Gaza Strip and the Palestinians there, Hamas will continue to hold tightly to its most powerful bargaining chip, the hostages.

""Where is Hamas in the day-after? And if no one is willing to talk about it, then Hamas believes that they are better off holding on to the hostages until something changes,"" he explained. ""It's a jihad organization. They wish to have chaos. They are looking for a regional conflict.

""When they see that there's now a conflict with Lebanon, that does not motivate them to get into a cease-fire agreement. On the contrary, they wish to belong, and have other players join in this jihad against Israel,"" Chen continued. ""So I question, what is the plan?""

""I am very critical of the time,"" Itay's father said. ""The last 10 months, I've been asking Mr. Sullivan, What's plan B?

""I haven't heard of a Plan B. And that's unacceptable,"" he added.

BLINKEN TRAVELS TO EGYPT FOR CEASE-FIRE TALKS AS ISRAEL ADDS NEW WAR GOAL

Securing peace in the region became even more precarious last week after Israel, against the objections of the U.S. and its international allies, launched an incursion into southern Lebanon with the expressed intent of dismantling the threat posed by Hezbollah.

Chen pointed out that this second front not only added another dimension to securing the release of the hostages, but it also seemingly pushed talks with Hamas on the backburner as concerns remain high over a broader regional conflict.

""If you could follow the news, you could see that the hostage issue has been less prioritized,"" he said. ""And that's a very difficult feeling for us and the families.""

Netanyahu has said his top priority is securing the release of the hostages, but his refusal to withdraw from the Philidelphi Corridor due to security reasons has created a negotiation impasse and questions have begun to mount over whether the prime minister is truly prioritizing the hostages over his push to ""eliminate Hamas.""

But the parents of Itay - who has been described as a ""fun-loving kid,"" the ""sandwich"" of the family with an older sibling and younger sibling, everybody's ""best friend,"" and a former Boy Scout turned a young man with a loving girlfriend - cannot allow for him, or the others still in Gaza, to be at the mercy of any political agenda.

""I'm a guy that comes from New York City - and we talk less, we look at actions. The actions of the last year show the opposite."" Chen said. ""He can say whatever he wants. I don't believe a thing that comes out of his mouth, I believe in what he does.""

The father of three also urged the Biden administration to question whether it is still in the U.S.'s strategic interest to unequivocally back Netanyahu.

""There is no accountability from either side for failed negotiation. You do not see any equation that says, 'OK, if you do not do A, then there's a consequence' on either side,"" Chen said in reference to both Israel and Hamas. ""There's no consequence associated with a negative action to a strategic interest of the United States.""

Chen also argued that ""effective pressure"" needs to be put on Hamas by reevaluating what other ""pressure points"" can be utilized.

The father pointed to the clear need for tougher economic and diplomatic involvement when it comes to international aid sent to Gaza - including tougher sanctions not only on adversarial nations but on partner countries that allow aid to flow into Gaza.

This includes stricter oversight of United Nations-provided humanitarian aid, which though intended for the Palestinian people, is falling into the hands of Hamas, a group that is not designated as a terrorist organization by the UN.

Hamas has long been accused of seizing basic goods in Gaza and then reselling them in a black-market scheme at exuberant prices.

Reports have further indicated that Hamas for years has had substantial access to monetary aid siphoned from funds provided by top organizations like the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which has been directly used for combatant operations against Israel, including tunnel building and access to arms.

But aside from the substantial need to address aid-based concerns, Chen also argued that diplomatic solutions are not being fully recognized by the U.S.

Nations like Russia and Thailand secured the release of their citizens taken by Hamas, and Chen argued Washington - which was able to negotiate with its biggest adversary just months ago to free U.S. citizens from Russian prisons - should be working to do the same to secure the release of those held in Gaza.

""So, it's possible,"" Chen said. ""Complicated, yep. Doable, yep.""

""The assumption that was put in front of us at the beginning was that U.S. hostages will come out via a larger deal that Israel will be a part of. And if that assumption is not working out after a year, then yes, we need to challenge the administration and look at that assumption."
Iran's chief of overseas arms dealings radio silent since Beirut strikes: Iranian officials,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/irans-chief-overseas-arms-dealings-radio-silent-since-beirut-strikes-iranian-officials,2024-10-07T01:33:55Z,"The exiled crown prince of Iran weighs in on the Iranian regime, sends a message to the Iranian people and assesses his nation's oil potential.

The commander of Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) overseas military-intelligence service, who traveled to Lebanon last month after Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was killed in an Israeli airstrike, has not been heard from since last week's strikes on Beirut, Iranian officials say.

Reuters reported that two senior Iranian security officials confirmed that Iran's Quds Force commander, Esmail Qaani, had not been heard from since late last week.

One official told the wire Qaani was in the southern suburbs of Beirut during a missile strike that reportedly targeted senior Hezbollah official Hashem Safieddine, though he was not meeting with the Hezbollah leader.

An official from Hezbollah said Israel was not permitting them to search for Safieddine after the bombing in Beirut's southern suburbs on Thursday. The group also said it would not announce Safieddine's fate until the search for him was over.

Safieddine was reportedly a likely successor to Nasrallah, who died when Israel launched a strike on Dahiyeh on Sept. 27.

The Iranian official told the Associated Press that Iran and Hezbollah were unable to contact Qaani after the U.S. assassinated his predecessor, Qassem Soleimani, in a drone strike in 2020.

The second Iranian official told the AP that Qaani traveled to Lebanon after Nasrallah was killed, adding that authorities had not been able to contact him since the strike on Safieddine.

An Iranian official told Fox News Digital that the higher up an official is, the harder it is to conceal.

""Whatever the verdict is on Qaani's whereabouts, the fact that the regime has not been able to produce him to quell rumors means he is either injured or in hiding,"" the official said. ""Israel is pressing its advantage in Lebanon against commanders of Iran's threat network, leading to command-and-control issues and chaos that generates rumors like these.""

Israeli military spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani was asked about reports that Qaani may have been killed in the Israeli airstrike, and he said the results of the strikes were still being assessed.

Shoshani said the attack late last week was against Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in Beirut.

Qaani's Quds Force is responsible for overseeing the dealings with Tehran and allied militias like Hezbollah across the Middle East.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued an ominous warning to Iranian officials during an interview with Fox News on Sunday, amid the rapid escalation of the Israel-Hamas war in the Middle East.

The interview came days after Israel invaded Lebanon as part of a mission to eliminate Hezbollah, on the heels of several successful strikes against the terrorist group. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that it had killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last weekend - prompting Iran to launch 181 retaliatory missiles in response.

During an exchange with Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst on Sunday, Gallant promised that Israeli forces are considering all options in terms of its response to Iran's attacks against Israel - even potentially striking Iranian nuclear sites.

""At the moment, everything is on the table,"" the Israeli official said. ""Israel will respond to the unprecedented Iranian attack in the manner of our choosing, and at the time and place of our choosing.""

""I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there,"" Harris said.

Amid the White House's response to the IDF's recent strikes, Gallant emphasized that he hopes the United States continues to cooperate with the Israeli military.

""It is important for us to hold discussions on strategic cooperation between our countries and defense cooperation in light of the threats posed by Iran and its proxies,"" Gallant said. ""We are powerful when we are aligned and I want to make sure of it.""

Gallant also said the IDF's recent strikes in northern Gaza were in response to terrorists planning ""Oct. 7-style attacks"" against Israelis.

""We have conducted counterterrorism activities in northern Gaza and in Judea and Samaria, following intel indicating that terrorists were planning Oct. 7-style attacks on Israeli citizens,"" he explained. ""We will operate precisely and preemptively when necessary in order to defend our citizens.""

The military official acknowledged the IDF's ""extraordinary"" wins against Hezbollah in recent weeks and vowed to continue its mission. On Friday, the IDF announced that it had killed 250 Hezbollah terrorists since the ground strikes began, including several commanders.

""Israel has made extraordinary achievements against Hezbollah - we will do what it takes to defend our citizens and our sovereignty,"" Gallant said. ""This includes eliminating their attack capabilities, taking out leadership, and placing a weapons embargo on Hezbollah.""

Vice President Kamala Harris wouldn't say whether she thought the Biden administration had influence over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the war in the Middle East continues.

CBS' Bill Whitaker asked Harris about why Netanyahu seemed to be ""charting his own course,"" despite the billions of dollars of military aid the U.S. has provided to Israel. ""Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?"" he asked.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel.

John Fetterman, D-Pa., says he will not 'politicize' the Israel-Hamas during an appearance on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., on Sunday said that he will continue to ""support and follow"" Israel after seeing how the Jewish State has been able to humiliate Iran and its proxies, Hamas and Hezbollah.

Fetterman made the remarks on ""Fox News Sunday,"" telling anchor Shannon Bream that Israel knows best about how to take on Iran and the regime's proxies.

""Whatever they decide to do in response to Iran, I'm going to support that because Israel will have a better idea of the intelligence and the circumstances on the ground,"" Fetterman said. ""And that's why I'm going to support and follow that.""

The Democrat praised Israel for their effective responses against Hezbollah and Hamas that he said left the Iranian proxies ""cowering.""

BIDEN SAYS HE WOULD NOT BACK ISRAELI STRIKE ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR SITE

""I also want to celebrate what Israel has been able to do,"" Fetterman said. ""They've demolished Hamas and now they have humiliated Hezbollah and they are now cowering. And Iran shot, you know, 200 missiles and [Israel] vaporized those. So, Iran now is left exposed and humiliated, and Israel has put them back on the ropes. And I am going to support what they continue to do.""

Iran bombarded Israel with 181 missiles last week in what the regime said was retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike in September and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.

Meanwhile, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have traded attacks with Israel since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7.

Fetterman's comments come days after President Biden told reporters that he would not support an attack by Israel on Iranian nuclear sites in retaliation for Iran's missile attack against Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

Biden said all the G7 leaders on a recent call - France, Canada, Japan, Britain, Italy and Germany - agreed that Israel had the right to ""proportionally"" respond to Iran's military strike.

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

Biden's response came under fire from former President Trump, who told Fox News correspondent Bill Melugin on Thursday that Biden's response on Israel attacking Iran was the ""craziest thing I've ever heard. That's the biggest risk we have. The biggest risk we have is nuclear.""

Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Saturday called out Western leaders who he said had called for an arms embargo on Israel over its airstrikes against Hamas in Gaza.

""As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side, yet President Macron and other western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them,"" Netanyahu said in a statement.

He continued, ""Is Iran imposing an arms embargo on Hezbollah, on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not. This axis of terror stands together, but countries who supposedly oppose this terror axis call for an arms embargo on Israel.""

Walz tries to downplay laws he signed granting benefits to illegals in Minnesota: 'Not the VP's position',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-tries-downplay-laws-he-signed-granting-benefits-illegals-minnesota-not-vps-position,2024-10-06T16:46:59Z,"Vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz discusses Israel's right to defend itself and Kamala Harris' economic policies on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sought to distance Vice President Kamala Harris from laws he himself signed that granted benefits to illegal immigrants in Minnesota on Sunday.

Walz made the comments during a wide-ranging interview on Fox News Sunday with host Shannon Bream. Bream pressed Walz on his military history and his record on abortion in addition to questioning him on legislation he signed in Minnesota that allows illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and receive state-funded tuition assistance, among other benefits.

""Are those not magnets to draw people here, many times on dangerous journeys for themselves? And why should your taxpayers in Minnesota or across the states pay for those programs?"" Bream asked.

""Well, that's not the vice president's position,"" Walz admitted, before going on to defend his leadership in Minnesota.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""But I will say this, Minnesota ranks as a top five business state. We rank as a top three state for children living, and we're a top state for health care access,"" he said. ""Look, the Vice President has made it clear that she has policies that make a difference. Her border policies are the most strongest, the fairest we've seen.""

Bream also challenged Walz to clarify his ticket's position on abortion access. The exchange ultimately led to Walz flatly accusing former President Trump of lying when he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

Bream began by pointing out that Minnesota's abortion law imposes no limits on abortion procedures through all nine months of pregnancy, something that goes far beyond the provisions of Roe v. Wade, which Harris and Walz said they support.

""You signed the bill that makes it legal through all nine months. Is that a position you think Democrats should advocate for nationally?"" Bream asked.

""The vice president and I have been clear the restoration of Roe versus Wade is what we're asking for,"" Walz responded.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGES MORE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AS VOTERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POLICIES

""But that law goes far beyond Roe v. Wade,"" Bream pressed. ""Let's agree, in what you signed there's not a single limit through nine months of pregnancy. Roe had a trimester framework that did have limits through the pregnancy. The Minnesota law does not have that.""

""This doesn't change anything. It puts the decision back on to the woman, to the physicians,"" Walz responded. ""And we know that this is simply something to be brought up - to be very clear Donald Trump's asking for a nationwide abortion ban.""

""[Trump] has said repeatedly that he will not sign a national abortion ban. Are you calling that a flat out lie?"" Bream asked.

""Yes, of course, and Senator Vance has in the past said so too,"" Walz said.

Bream concluded the interview by giving Walz a chance to respond to criticism of his frequent ""misstatements,"" such as his claims about military service and his assertion that he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

""Look, I speak passionately. I had an entire career, decades before I was in public office. They know, and I'm very proud of my 24 years in service and my record. I have never disparaged someone else in this, but I know that's not what Donald Trump does. They disparage everyone,"" Walz said.

Under fire: Israel's Iron Dome winning but pressure's on as conflict with Iran escalates,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/under-fire-israels-iron-dome-winning-pressures-conflict-iran-escalates,2024-10-06T16:37:38Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As rockets continue to rain down on Israel, Tuesday marked an unprecedented attack from Iran, which fired 181 ballistic missiles toward the country. For an hour, the entire nation took shelter; fortunately, there were no casualties or injuries, thanks to Israel's air defense system.

This system has been crucial in protecting Israeli civilians, intercepting thousands of missiles aimed at population centers. However, some missiles did land at several air force bases and near the Mossad headquarters, although they did not cause ""significant damage,"" according to the IDF chief of staff.

Israel's air defense strategy extends beyond Iron Dome. Systems like David's Sling and Arrow 2 and Arrow 3 provide defense against medium- and long-range missiles, and these systems have also been crucial in the current conflict. Israel Air Force Reserve Brig. Gen. Doron Gavish explains that the multi-layered defense structure was designed to handle a wide range of threats. ""We've used David's Sling to intercept rockets from Lebanon, and Arrow 3 to counter ballistic missiles from Iran. It's not just Iron Dome - it's a network of systems working together.""

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

While the Iron Dome wasn't extensively utilized against Iran, its operators have kept busy keeping Israel safe since the start of the war on Oct. 7 last year.

""The Iron Dome has done incredible work, but, like any defensive system, the extended, high-intensity fighting has taken its toll on it - it wasn't built for a conflict of this length and intensity,"" Hilla Haddad Chmelnik, an aerospace engineer who played a key role in developing Iron Dome, and who acknowledges that the system is being tested in ways it was not originally designed for.

Haddad Chmelnik, who also served as director-general of Israel's Ministry of Innovation, Science, and Technology, emphasizes the need for ongoing innovation to keep up with evolving threats.

And with Lebanon and Israel's escalating fight with Hezbollah, the need for the system is greater than ever, she says. Just this last week alone, hundreds of rockets, missiles and UAVs were launched against Israel from Hezbollah in Lebanon.

While Hamas's rocket supply in Gaza has been largely depleted, the situation in Lebanon is very different. ""In Gaza, we have significantly reduced the number of rockets left in Hamas' arsenal. But in Lebanon, the numbers have not dropped enough,"" she says. Hezbollah is believed to have perhaps 140,000 rockets, and they are much more sophisticated than those used by Hamas and can penetrate much deeper into Israel.

And then there is the question of Iran, and the possibility of the war widening to include direct conflict with that country. ""Compared to Lebanon, the threat from Iran is more manageable,"" she says. Staging a large-scale missile attack from Iran is a complex undertaking, which can be detected and preemptively targeted,"" Haddad Chmelnik says. ""Launching a ballistic missile 1,500 kilometers requires preparation, and that's visible. It's very hard to hide from satellites, and that gives us the opportunity to strike preemptively, in addition to preparing to defend ourselves.""

Haddad Chmelnik emphasizes that Israel's missile-defense systems, which were built in coordination with the U.S., are capable of withstanding Iranian attacks. ""The Iranian missile threat can be countered, and our second-strike capability is very significant. Israel has the upper hand in that respect,"" she says. ""That's why Iran is cautious - it has more to lose than to gain.""

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

Iron Dome was first deployed in 2011, following years of development in response to the growing threat of rocket fire from Gaza. What sets the system apart, Haddad Chmelnik says, is its innovation and simplicity. ""It's a brilliant technology that no other country has. Iron Dome was developed with the support of the U.S., and now we're seeing other nations buying it for their own defense.""

Indeed, the success of Iron Dome has attracted international attention. Countries such as the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Finland have purchased Iron Dome components or batteries. ""Israel is the most protected country in the world when it comes to air defense,"" Haddad Chmelnik explains. ""Now, we are seeing countries across the globe investing in it.""

Israel Air Force Reserve Brig. Gen. Doron Gavish, former commander of Israel's Air Defense Corps, recalls the initial skepticism surrounding the project. ""Before Iron Dome, we had no real answer to these types of rockets,"" he says. ""People doubted we could create an effective, cost-efficient interceptor. But the system has proven itself over the years. Iron Dome has intercepted thousands of rockets.""

Each Iron Dome interceptor missile costs around $50,000, while some of the rockets it is designed to destroy, such as those made by Hamas, can cost just a few hundred dollars. The cost of maintaining one Iron Dome battery, which requires dozens of soldiers to operate, is about $100 million. Currently, there are approximately 12 Iron Dome batteries spread out across the country, each capable of defending up to 60 square miles, providing vital coverage in strategic areas.

WHAT IS ISRAEL'S FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE, THE IRON DOME?

Half of Iron Dome operators are women, who agree to extend their service to three years - the same as is mandatory for men - to accommodate the long period of training. ""The experience these soldiers have gained under fire is invaluable. But the pressure is enormous,"" Brig. Gen. Gavish says. ""It's not like a video game. You're making real-time decisions on which rockets to intercept. These soldiers know they're protecting their families, their cities - sometimes even their own homes.""

But the current conflict, which has seen more than 20,000 rockets fired from Gaza and Lebanon since October 2023, has pushed the system, and its operators, to their limits. ""When we designed Iron Dome, we never imagined it would have to function under such continuous strain,"" Haddad Chmelnik says. ""The system was built for short, intense bursts of fighting - not for a war that lasts nearly a year.""

In recent months, some enemy rockets have slipped past the defenses, causing destruction in northern Israel. ""No system is hermetic,"" Gavish says. ""There is no perfect defense. The reality is, the longer the war continues, the more pressure the system is put under.""

Meanwhile, the enemy is learning. ""Every time Iron Dome successfully intercepts a rocket, our enemies are watching, learning and adapting,"" Haddad Chmelnik says. ""That's why we see more complex threats emerging, like UAVs, and drones, which are harder to intercept.""

While Iron Dome remains effective, the future is uncertain. ""The system is saving lives every day,"" Brig. Gen. Gavish says. ""But as the war goes on, it becomes harder and harder to maintain the same level of defense.""

Despite these successes, Haddad Chmelnik points out that no defense system is foolproof. ""The way Iron Dome is built, it's about more than just about identifying individual threats; it's about adapting quickly as those threats evolve."" She emphasizes that while Iron Dome continues to play a crucial role, Israel's long-term security will depend on continued technological advancements.

Despite the challenges they face in the current situation, those operating Iron Dome continue their mission. ""The soldiers - men and women - are making complex decisions in real-time, protecting cities and families,"" Brig. Gen. Gavish says, ""They are the key to Iron Dome's success."""
Anti-Israel protester lights himself on fire outside of White House,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/anti-israel-protester-lights-himself-fire-outside-white-house,2024-10-06T14:37:00Z,"Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst reports on Israel targeting Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters and his new book on 'Special Report.'

A photojournalist lit himself on fire outside the White House on Saturday in protest against Israel's war in Gaza and America's support for the regime.

The man, Samuel Mena Jr., lit his left arm on fire and was seen screaming in pain and shouting that the media was spreading ""misinformation."" Law enforcement officers quickly surrounded Mena and restrained him, putting out the fire.

One bystander could be seen pouring a bottle of water on Mena's arm after the flames were extinguished.

A blog posted to Mena's website shortly before the incident suggested he only intended to burn his arm.

""To the 10 thousand children in Gaza that have lost a limb in this conflict, I give my left arm to you. I pray my voice was able to raise up yours, and that your smiles never disappear,"" Mena wrote.

The blog also says Mena first tried to end the ""genocide"" in Gaza by making a documentary. He later gave up on the effort, however, convinced that it wouldn't make a difference.

Mena's social media profiles say he worked for the local CBS affiliate AZFamily and graduated from Arizona State University's Walter Cronkite School of Journalism.

Authorities transported Mena to the hospital soon after the incident and confirmed that his injuries were not life-threatening.

""The District of Columbia has a long and proud history of peaceful first amendment activities and the Metropolitan Police Department handles hundreds of protests, demonstrations and other events every year,"" first responders said in a statement.

""We will continue to support those who choose to protest peaceful and safely, and we will continue to hold accountable those who commit criminal acts while in our city,"" the added.

The incident comes months after a member of the U.S. Air Force set himself on fire outside the Israeli embassy in February. Senior Airman Aaron Bushnell, 25, also carried out the act in protest against Israel's campaign in Gaza, saying in a recorded video that he would ""no longer be complicit in genocide."""
It's the most repeated command in the Bible and it will bring you closer to God,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/most-repeated-command-bible-bring-closer-god,2024-10-06T14:17:47Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The most repeated command in the Bible is some version of ""fear not!"" It sounds great in theory, but let's be honest, how can God expect us to not live in fear when everything around us feels so out-of-control? Hurricane devastation. Israel under attack. Election rage. Port strikes. Record rates of depression and anxiety. Lord have mercy.

In Isaiah 40:11, God commands, ""Don't panic. I'm with you. There's no need to fear for I'm your God. I'll give you strength. I'll help you. I'll hold you steady, keep a firm grip on you."" (MSG Bible translation)

When God commands something, such as fear not, we can count on three things: It's for good reason, it's for our good, and it brings Him glory.

In Isaiah 40:11, God is speaking specifically to Israel who is aware of all the danger around her, and it is only through God's promise of His presence that fear loses its paralyzing power over her.

BIBLE'S 'EVIL PRESENCES' HIGHLIGHTED BY KATHIE LEE GIFFORD SHED DRAMATIC LIGHT ON PRESENT-DAY CONFLICTS

We are not Israel, and our dangers are different, but the promise is the same and still holds true for us today.

God says there is no need to fear, not because everything is fine, but because ""I'm your God.""

God is showing us how functioning out of fear gets us nowhere. And could it be possible that our fear tells God we don't trust Him? What does our panic express? Do we actually believe that we care more than God does about seeing love come down and His will be done?

PEACE OF JESUS CHRIST 'WILL DRIVE ALL ANXIETY, EVERY FEAR, FROM OUR HEARTS,' SAYS DC-BASED FRIAR

The One who says ""I'm with you"" is Almighty God. He is the judge of all nations and the ruler of all rulers. He reigns over all things. He is the alpha and omega, the beginning and the end. He is the one who has already won the victory over evil and death. This is the One who says, ""I'm with you!""

Because He is all these things, and because He is with you in all things, He can therefore command you ""do not fear."" We can ""fear not"" in all that we face because He is present in it. And He will ultimately prevail over it.

Those who have put their hope in Christ do not need to be panic people. We are given the supernatural peace to prevail in times that are terrifying and disheartening, because we know who wins in the end.

Until then, we act justly, love mercy and walk humbly. We call out evil and share the gospel. And then we do that thing we typically resist because we don't appreciate the gift that it is: We humbly repent. We draw closer to God.

For God Himself said, ""Then if my people who are called by my name will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and turn from their wicked ways, I will hear from heaven and will forgive their sins and restore their land."" (2 Chron 7:14)

The secret to living fearless in this fallen world isn't putting your head in the sand and hoping it will all turn out OK. The secret to fearless living is believing that God is who He says He is and is able to do what He says He can do! It's drawing on the assurance of His presence because His presence is our confidence. His presence empowers us to ""fear not."" His presence is peace. And panic loses its power in His presence.

And when ""fear not"" feels impossible, let us call to mind His promise: ""'I will never leave you nor forsake you.' So, we may boldly say, 'The Lord is my Helper. I will not fear. What can man to do me.'"" (Heb 3:5)

Draw closer to God for your courage and pray fervently for His will to be done on Earth as it is in heaven."
New report finds nearly 200% increase in antisemitic incidents in US since Oct. 7 Hamas terror massacre,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/new-report-finds-nearly-200-increase-antisemitic-incidents-in-us-since-oct-7-hamas-terror-massacre,2024-10-06T14:09:32Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A new report from the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) found that antisemitic incidents in the U.S. rose over 200% following the Oct. 7 Hamas massacre in Israel as compared to the same period the year before.

The report from the ADL Center on Extremism recorded over 10,000 antisemitic incidents following the Hamas terrorist attack in Israel - the most recorded in any single year since the group started tracking them in 1979. In the year prior to Oct. 7, the center recorded 3,325 incidents.

""Today, we mourn the victims of the Oct. 7 Hamas attack in Israel, marking one year since the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust,"" Jonathan Greenblatt, ADL CEO, said in a press release alongside the report's publication.

SEN COONS DISCUSSES BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN'S SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL, FEARS OF WIDER REGIONAL WAR

""From that day on, Jewish Americans haven't had a single moment of respite,"" Greenblatt said. ""Instead, we've faced a shocking number of antisemitic threats and experienced calls for more violence against Israelis and Jews everywhere.""

Of the roughly 10,000 incidents recorded, the ADL broke them down into three different types: Over 8,000 verbal or written harassment, over 1,840 incidents of vandalism and over 150 physical assaults.

Around 12% of these incidents occurred on college campuses compared to around 200 incidents in the same period in the previous year.

Around 20% of those incidents occurred at ""Jewish institutions,"" which includes synagogues and Jewish centers, but around 30% of the incidents occurred during anti-Israel rallies. The ADL did not clarify how much overlap it found among these different groupings.

However, the group did clarify that it recorded 8,873 antisemitic incidents in 2023 alone, marking a 140% increase from the previous year, and that it will have finalized figures in 2025 as it continues to survey partners, law enforcement and victims - from which it expects the figure to continue rising.

Experts and watchdog groups have raised the alarm over the increasing number of antisemitic incidents, not just in the U.S. but in Europe as well: The Community Security Trust in the United Kingdom reported in March 2024 that it recorded at least 2,093 antisemitic incidents across the country between Oct. 7 and Dec. 13, 2023.

The group called it the ""highest-ever total reported"" across a roughly two-month period since it started recording such incidents in 1984.

""I think people are feeling tense and nervous, particularly with marches taking place every Saturday,"" Jake Wallis Simons, editor-in-chief of the London-based Jewish Chronicle, told Fox News Digital from England at the time.

On Saturday, thousands marched against Israel in London with observers complaining of the large amount of antisemitic imagery and slogans on display at the protests.

FIGHTING THE DISTURBING SPIRAL OF JEW-HATRED IN CANADA

Canada has also seen a massive spike in incidents, focused around Jewish institutions, including schools, community centers and synagogues, as well as several of the country's universities.

In a statement on X, Israel's Consul General to Montréal Paul Hirschorn warned, ""Montréal is now ranked one of the most dangerous places in the world to be visibly Jewish. 9 times Jewish community buildings have been shot at or petrol bombed - synagogues, schools, community centers. Just this week people were identified with petrol-bombs near synagogues (and fortunately prevented from perpetrating what they had planned). The authorities released them to go home. I guess they said they would behave themselves.""

""Statistically, hate crimes in Canada have increased north of 132%, with the vast majority of those crimes targeting the Jewish community,"" Casey Babb, who teaches courses on terrorism and international security at the Norman Paterson School of International Affairs in Ottawa, told Fox News Digital earlier this year.

Reflections on the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in Israel must not only consider the tragedy itself but the silence that followed.

That day, Hamas militants unleashed unspeakable violence, deliberately targeting civilians. Among the victims were hundreds of women and girls who were subjected to sexual violence - an intentional strategy designed to terrorize and degrade.

Yet, despite the horrific nature of these acts, international bodies, including the United Nations, took weeks - if not months - to even acknowledge what had transpired. Leaders who claim to stand for women not only failed women with their words; it was a failure to act.

Silence is not neutral.

AS OCTOBER 7TH ANNIVERSARY APPROACHES, JEWISH STUDENTS BRACE FOR PROTESTS, VOW TO 'WALK PROUDLY'

The use of sexual violence as a weapon in conflict is not a recent phenomenon. It is an age-old, barbaric tool of war, used to humiliate, destabilize and traumatize communities. However, the global community's muted response to the sexual atrocities of Oct. 7 reveals a troubling double standard.

Israeli women did not receive the swift and vocal condemnation for gender-based violence that is often extended in other conflicts. While many leaders and organizations, such as UN Women, eventually condemned the violence, it took them over 50 days to issue a statement denouncing these acts. This delay occurred despite a significant body of credible and corroborated evidence available at the time.

Even without an official report, every woman who saw that video of a young woman, her sweatpants stained with blood, instinctively knew the devastating reality behind those marks. That unspoken understanding crosses every boundary -- cultural, political or religious. It's a truth embedded in the experience of being a woman, a shared recognition of the raw vulnerability to violence that so many of us have felt, feared or survived.

ISRAEL BANS UN SECRETARY-GENERAL OVER ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIONS: 'DOESN'T DESERVE TO SET FOOT ON ISRAELI SOIL'

Yet, the willful delay of condemnation, combined with the relative silence from many women's rights organizations, reflects a larger issue where political affiliations seem to overshadow the fundamental responsibility to stand against rape as a weapon of war.

Silence in the face of gender-based violence is complicity. When leaders delay or fail to acknowledge such atrocities, they send a message that the suffering of women, especially in complex geopolitical conflicts, can be overlooked. It is precisely this neglect that fuels cycles of violence, making it clear that women and girls are collateral damage, their dignity expendable.

It also reflects a profound unwillingness to confront uncomfortable truths about the nature of this violence and who it is perpetrated against.

There remains a persistent reluctance in the West to confront and criticize cultures that subjugate women through practices like stoning for adultery or forcing women to cover their faces. Political correctness has led to a loss of moral clarity, and an inability to confront harmful practices and values that undermine human rights.

END US FUNDING FOR UN AGENCY GIVING IMMUNITY TO ITS MURDEROUS HAMAS MEMBERS

This reluctance to offend has led to dangerous acceptance and moral relativism. Practices such as honor killings or female genital mutilation are undeniably violations of basic human rights. Yet, the guise of inclusivity shields these practices from criticism, framing them instead as cultural differences that must be respected.

Tacit acceptance has consequences. In fact, the United Nations, the same body that failed Israeli women so spectacularly, also reported a 50% increase in verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence from 2022 to 2023. When women are overlooked or targeted in this way, the global response must be swift and unequivocal. Whether in Israel, Ukraine, Sudan or elsewhere, we must demand accountability for those who weaponize gender-based violence.

Protecting women and girls requires a clear, unambiguous commitment to their dignity, safety and inherent worth. It means recognizing that sexual violence is not just an issue of war, it's an attack on the very identity of women.

We need leaders who are willing to confront these truths, who will stand up unequivocally against violence, and who will advocate for policies that protect the most vulnerable, not shy away from defining who they are.

This anniversary must serve as a call to action and a reminder that silence is not an oversight, it is a betrayal. If the international community continues to hesitate, it signals that the lives, bodies and dignity of women are negotiable.

Women and girls must not be sacrificed on the altar of political expediency, and none of us should remain silent when women and girls' bodies are turned into battlefields."
Fox Nation's 'Black Saturday' with Trey Yingst takes viewers inside horrific events of October 7,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/fox-nations-black-saturday-trey-yingst-takes-viewers-inside-horrific-events-october-7,2024-10-06T12:20:32Z,"Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst's new book, which is available now, provides a riveting, on-the-ground account of the devastating Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.

A three-part docuseries of the same name, based on Yingst's book, is streaming now on Fox Nation, with a condensed version airing on Fox News Channel on Sunday night at 10 pm ET.

Yingst began writing ""Black Saturday: An Unfiltered Account of the October 7th Attack on Israel and the War in Gaza"" during the immediate aftermath of Hamas' horrific assault. At the same time, he was also working to provide Fox News viewers with the latest information from southern Israel and Gaza.

Yingst told Fox News Digital he feels the book is unique because it was penned in the field by a correspondent who was ""living this story"" in real time.

""'Black Saturday' is the gold standard in storytelling when it comes to what took place on October 7 in southern Israel and the war that followed,"" Yingst said from Tel Aviv.

""A massacre against the civilian population of Israel unfolded in the early hours of October 7, when Hamas militants crossed the border from the Gaza Strip into the communities that line Gaza in southern Israel, and it killed soldiers and civilians alike and dragged more than 240 hostages back into Gaza,"" he continued. ""'Black Saturday' talks about our experience, the Fox News team in Jerusalem responding to that attack.""

Yingst and his team reported from the Gaza border area as the attack unfolded.

""'Black Saturday' tells that story, and then the stories of the soldiers and the police officers and the civilians in southern Israel who were trying to make sense of what was unfolding, and then take the fight back to Hamas inside Gaza, along with the stories of Palestinian civilians who were directly affected by this conflict and continue to be affected today,"" he said.

""This book really captures all of those angles. It is a book about Israelis. It is a book about Palestinians. It is a book about October 7 and the war that followed, and it is a book about humans,"" Yingst said.

He details the horrifying ordeal at the start of the book and shows readers the risks that reporters take to bring critical information to the world.

""The soldiers that we were with got lost, and they were driving through areas that hadn't been cleared, that Hamas was routinely operating in, firing RPGs, anti-tank missiles and small arms fire at Israeli soldiers in the weeks prior, and we had no way out. We were stuck in that moment, and as I open this book, 'Black Saturday,' I talk about this moment,"" he said.

""I truly thought this could be it,"" Yingst continued. ""This could be the moment that I die.""

For the project, Yingst interviewed a range of people to include multiple perspectives, including Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, high-ranking IDF soldiers, Hamas official Dr. Basem Naim and Gazan journalist Nael Ghaboun.

""I think that when you read it, you will learn more about what that morning was like for Israelis who were living through hell on Earth. You'll learn more about the behind-the-scenes reporting that we did to bring that story to our viewers under fire in real time,"" Yingst said.

""Black Saturday,"" the latest offering from Fox News Books, also includes 16 pages of full-color photographs.

The Fox Nation series based on the book of the same name includes Yingst and the Fox Jerusalem Bureau team racing to cover the devastating terror attack, the team experiencing the haunting aftermath of horrific massacres throughout the Israeli communities along the Gaza border and the Fox News chief foreign correspondent entering the Gaza Strip during the Israeli ground invasion."
'There is no life' after Oct 7: An Israeli mother grapples with grief one year after Hamas' devastating attack,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/there-no-life-after-oct-7-israeli-mother-grapples-grief-one-year-after-hamas-devastating-attack,2024-10-06T11:06:34Z,"Sigal Shemer, an Israeli mother from Lod, Israel, opens up about the murder of her eldest son on Oct. 7 and how she's navigating her grief one year later.

Sigal Shemer headed to the cemetery in Lod, a city in central Israel, in late September to wash her son's headstone and place flowers on his grave.

Ron, her eldest son, was murdered by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, after the militant group launched an early morning attack on southern Israel, killing roughly 1,200 people and taking more than 250 as hostages, according to estimates from Israeli authorities.

Numbers compiled by Fox News indicate an estimated 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza, almost 365 days later, including seven Americans.

Sigal reflected on the death of her son and the enduring impact of Oct. 7, one year later, in an interview with Fox News Digital.

Trauma has reshaped her life and left an indelible mark on her family, but she's found some solace and hope through the Jerusalem-based nonprofit OneFamily, which offers support and resources to victims of terror. Through community outreach, the organization has become a lifeline, helping her navigate the complexities of her sorrow while honoring her son's memory, amid a background of ongoing violence and loss.

Ron had been attending the Nova music festival in Re'im when the carnage unfolded, running with his friends to a car to escape the sound of gunshots in the area and the horror that was beginning to take place.

But the 23-year-old didn't want to leave without two of his close friends. He opted not to get into the car and instead went to look for Dan and Omar. Soon after he found them, the trio went inside a shelter not far from the festival.

HAMAS TERRORISTS 'SYSTEMATICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY' COMMITTED SEXUAL VIOLENCE DURING OCT. 7 ATTACK: REPORT

""He told to a friend, 'Don't be afraid. I will attack if someone will come in. I will attack them, and I will take care of you.' But the terrorists dropped three grenades into the shelter,"" his mother told Fox News Digital.

Dan was killed, Omar survived and Ron was taken outside, where he was heard fighting and struggling with Hamas militants. He wasn't heard from for days and his family feared he had been taken hostage.

""One week after, there was a knock on the door, and they told us -- the army and the police told us -- that Ron is... is not... is not alive because they shot him in the head,"" Sigal said.

She took a moment to remove her glasses and wipe away the tears from her eyes. The death of her son is still palpable and raw for the mother of two, who is survived by her husband Oren, and younger son Bari.

Sigal remembered Ron as a young man who loved people and animals, loved to travel and loved to help others.

He was a counselor at a Jewish youth summer camp in Pennsylvania, where he taught children Muay Thai, a form of boxing and the national sport of Thailand.

Since his murder, the Shemer family has returned to the camp, meeting with those who knew Ron and visiting all of his favorite places in the United States.

Before Oct. 7, Ron was on a 10-month trip to South America and Sigal feared for his safety.

""All the time, I was afraid that something will happen to him because it's, you know, in Brazil, the Amazonas, Colombia -- places that -- they're not so safe. And I tell him, please come home, please come home. It's not safe there. So, he came home and it's not safe here. It's not safe to be here,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""The terrorists, the monster... came inside the country and killed and murdered and raped and burned a lot of people, innocent people.""

""There is no life. I think there is no life. There is no life from the 7th of October,"" she added.

Sigal was working as an event producer prior to the day that's now known as ""Black Saturday."" She's since left her job, consumed by grief, and now works two days a week taking care of dogs, something her son loved to do.

""I want people to know that my son and all of the murdered boys and girls on the 7th of October are lost for the world,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""Many people in Israel lost their sons and daughters for nothing. Just for nothing.""

OneFamily Fund has provided support to many families whose loved ones were murdered in the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.

Naomi Nussbaum, OneFamily's executive director, told Fox News Digital how they use different types of therapy to help families cope with the loss of a loved one.

""We offer three types of support: Emotional support, financial support and legal aid. We've given out much, much more financial aid now than before because of the kind of devastation, you know, the nature of the attack on October 7th,"" she said.

""There's traditional therapy with psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, trauma-informed therapists tackling PTSD throughout all the categories. Dealing with PTSD is the most insidious and difficult part of the terror attacks to deal with. Then, we have the social network, which is really the heart and soul of OneFamily.""

Sigal has met with other mothers whose children were murdered and said it's not an easy thing to do, but it's helpful to speak with someone who's suffering from a similar situation and going through the same stages of grief.

DOJ CHARGES HAMAS LEADERS OVER 'TERRORIST ATROCITIES' IN OCT 7 ISRAEL ATTACK

""We're like professional friends for life. And the other people in the group that we put her with will be there also. You know, she can call anybody at any time to have dinner or to go for a walk or for a birthday or the anniversary of a death. They'll be there for each other forever,"" said Nussbaum.

""It takes a lot of courage and strength to smile again for the first time or to take a little bit of joy to say, let's go out to dinner tonight. Sometimes, the guilt and the grief and bereavement is too strong, and people can't do that. So, OneFamily, really with open arms and a lot of love, does everything they can to get them to want to come back to life again.""

A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital in Israel's nearly 12-month-long war against Hamas, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 6,200 women and 11,300 children.

The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.

"Georgia's Muslim voters opposing Harris, Trump in election over both candidates' support for Israel",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgias-muslim-voters-opposing-harris-trump-election-over-both-candidates-support-israel,2024-10-06T10:17:03Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia say they will not back either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump in next month's election because of both candidates' support of Israel amid the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

Harris has said she supports Israel's right to defend itself and would not withhold weapons from the country, but has also called for a ceasefire in Gaza, while Trump said recently he is Israel's ""protector"" and reaffirmed his support for the Jewish state.

In battleground Georgia, where Trump narrowly lost in 2020 to President Joe Biden, the Peach State could help determine whether Harris or Trump wins the presidency.

The Muslim population in Georgia could also impact which candidate wins the state's 16 electoral votes. Muslim voters across the country are virtually tied between Harris and Trump, with Harris only securing a single-point advantage, according to a recent poll by the Arab American Institute.

KAMALA HARRIS' SUPPORT WITH ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN IS 'TENUOUS': DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST

Kristen Truitt, a Muslim American voter in Atlanta, has voted for Democrats in prior elections but now says the party will not have his support over its position on Israel.

""Just to give unlimited funds and access to Israel, I think that is totally ridiculous,"" Truitt told Fox 5 Atlanta.

This comes just ahead of the one-year mark of the ongoing war in Gaza between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists. The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel and took more than 250 hostages, which prompted retaliatory action from Israel's military.

The Hamas-run government's Gaza Health Ministry estimates that more than 41,000 people have been killed in the conflict, although it does not distinguish between civilian and terrorist deaths. More than 1,500 people have reportedly been killed in Israel since the start of the conflict, with most of them being killed on Oct. 7 and its immediate aftermath.

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

The growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia and across the country have said they will not vote for Harris or Trump due to both sides' vocal support of Israel in its war in Gaza, and the conflict is now expanding to include Israel attacking Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon.

""What we're trying to say is we should really do away with the logic of voting for the 'lesser of two evils,'"" Kareem Rosshandler, Georgia co-chair of the ""Abandon Harris"" campaign, told Fox 5.

The ""Abandon Harris"" campaign group is urging Muslims to vote third-party to send a message to Republicans and Democrats that they need to earn the votes of the Muslim community.

""I think the main one is to say that the Muslim community in the United States won't be taken for granted,"" Rosshandler said.

Rosshandler said the group has already secured commitments from more than 10,000 Muslim voters to support third-party candidates. Some third-party candidates, including Libertarian Chase Oliver and the Green Party's Jill Stein, have been critical of Israel's war in Gaza.

The loss of Muslim voters is expected to hurt Harris more than Trump, as the Republican candidate has previously struggled to secure Muslim votes.

""That would essentially have a greater adverse impact on the Harris-Waltz ticket than it would on Trump-Vance,"" Emory University assistant professor of law Alicia Hughes, who is also a voting expert, told Fox 5 Atlanta. ""Trump, historically, has not been able to count on those votes.""

Hughes also says that if Harris or Trump were more vocally critical of Israel, it may not help their election chances either.

""There's a great possibility that you would lose more from the change than you would actually gain,"" she said."
"Netanyahu calls Macron, other Western leaders who support arms embargo against Israel a 'disgrace'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-macron-western-leaders-support-arms-embargo-against-israel-disgrace,2024-10-05T23:13:33Z,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu slammed French President Emmanuel Macron and other Western leaders on Saturday who he said had called for an arms embargo on Israel over its airstrikes against Hamas in Gaza.

""As Israel fights the forces of barbarism led by Iran, all civilized countries should be standing firmly by Israel's side, yet President Macron and other western leaders are now calling for arms embargoes against Israel. Shame on them, ""Netanyahu said in a statement.

He continued, ""Is Iran imposing an arms embargo on Hezbollah, on the Houthis, on Hamas and on its other proxies? Of course not. This axis of terror stands together, but countries who supposedly oppose this terror axis call for an arms embargo on Israel.""

Netanyahu called their stance a ""disgrace,"" adding that Israel would win ""with or without their support, but their shame will continue long after the war is won.""

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

He said, ""in defending ourselves against this barbarism, Israel is defending civilization against those who seek to impose a dark age of fanaticism on all of us. Rest assured, Israel will fight until the battle is won - for our sake and for the sake of peace and security in the world.""

Netanyahu noted that Israel is defending itself on seven different fronts, including Hamas in Gaza, Hezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Lebanon, Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria, terrorists in Judea and Samaria and Iran.

On Saturday, Macron said France would no longer supply arms to Israel, although the country will continue to send missile defense equipment.

""I think that today, the priority is that we return to a political solution, that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza,"" Macron said in an interview, according to Euro News.

Also on Saturday, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it had raided and dismantled a Hezbollah underground command complex in Lebanon.

""The troops entered a terror tunnel about 250 meters long, located about 300 meters from the border and not crossing into Israeli territory,"" IDF spokesperson Rear Admiral Daniel Hagari said in a press conference.

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ISSUE WARNING AHEAD OF OCT 7 ATTACKS ANNIVERSARY

He said a kitchenette and rooms that allowed for extended stays underground along with weapons and command rooms were found inside the complex.

""These compounds were intended to be used by Hezbollah terrorists in an attack on the communities of the Galilee,"" he said. ""This tunnel did not cross into our territory, and yesterday we destroyed it.""

The U.S. continues to supply Israel with arms, although President Biden has spoken out against the country's approach to its war with Gaza where tens of thousands of civilians have died.

""I think what he's doing is a mistake,"" Biden said in August, while continuing to call for a cease-fire. ""I don't agree with his approach.""

This week in a surprise appearance at a White House press briefing, Biden, in answering a reporter, said he wasn't sure if Netanyahu was holding off on a cease-fire to influence the November election.

""Whether he's trying to influence the election, I don't know - but I'm not counting on that,"" Biden said. ""No administration has helped Israel more than I have. None, none, none, and I think he should remember that."""
Rising from the ashes: Israelis in nation's war-torn south move home a year after October 7 massacre,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/rising-from-ashes-israelis-nations-war-torn-south-move-home-year-after-oct-7-massacre,2024-10-05T15:27:58Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Before October 7, the communities of the mostly agricultural cooperative settlements, commonly known as kibbutzim, near the Gaza Strip, were considered some of the most picturesque places in Israel, characterized by green fields and carpets of vibrant red anemones. Yet, they were also among the most bombarded areas in the country. ""Ninety-nine percent of the time, it's paradise; one percent of the time, it's hell,"" was a common saying among residents.

""It's fair to say this year, we live in that one percent"" Ofer Liberman admits, reflecting on the harsh reality faced by his community. For 22 years, he has served as the spokesperson for Kibbutz Nir Am, nestled in the Gaza envelope.

On October 7, it was Liberman's daughter, Inbal, the community's security coordinator, who displayed remarkable courage. She opened the weapons storage lockers and distributed arms to the community's rapid response team, sending them to various locations along the kibbutz fence. She and the team engaged in face-to-face battles with Hamas terrorists. Her quick actions prevented them from entering the kibbutz and prevented a massacre similar to what occurred in neighboring communities.

ISRAEL'S MILITARY SAYS FORCE IS 'AT WAR' WITH HAMAS AS IDF HITS BACK AT TERROR TARGETS

On Wednesday, during Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, Liberman celebrated with his family back in Kibbutz Nir Am. ""My wife and I were the only ones to come back in mid-November, while the kibbutz was under full military control. I manage the agriculture in Nir Am, and I had to be here. By the end of March, a small number of families returned, and on August 15, when government funding ended, everyone returned except for 12 families,"" he recounted.

""This was a sad holiday; some of our friends still have family members and friends held in Gaza. In the morning, we were informed by the IDF there would be loud noises coming from their fighting in Gaza,"" Liberman described the ongoing tension in the region. ""People got anxious because it reminded them of October 7 -- the booming and gunfire. But we're managing a routine. People go to work, and children go to school, living my life completely, with sounds of war.""

After October 7, 15,000 people were evacuated from the 21 kibbutzim in southern Israel, first to hotels and then into temporary housing across the country. Remarkably, about 70% have returned home, a significant achievement considering the ongoing war in Gaza and the devastating impact of the attack, which claimed the lives of some 1,200 people, 319 of whom were kibbutz members, and destroyed hundreds of homes.

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ISSUE WARNING AHEAD OF OCT. 7 ATTACKS ANNIVERSARY

However, six of the communities where the impact was most severe have yet to return. In Kibbutz Be'eri, 98 men, women, and children were murdered, and 30 were kidnapped. In Kfar Aza, home to 700, 64 people, including women and children, were massacred, and 19 were taken hostage. In Nahal Oz, a small community of 450, 15 were killed and 8 were kidnapped.

""Only twenty members of Kibbutz Nahal Oz have returned to the kibbutz, while 330 residents -- eighty percent of our community -- are in Mishmar Ha'emek, a kibbutz in north-central Israel. They've been hosting us since October 8,"" Amir Tibon, a resident of Nahal Oz, told Fox News Digital. ""Being together as one community in this temporary housing has been significant, as we are surrounded by the people we love. Our children still go to school and kindergarten together, which makes a big difference.""

On October 7, Tibon and his wife Miri were rescued along with their two younger daughters, thanks to his mother Gali, and father, retired IDF Major General Noam Tibon, who drove from Tel Aviv to the kibbutz to rescue them. On their way, they rescued survivors of the music festival massacre and helped wounded Israeli soldiers. Hours after leaving his home in Tel Aviv, Amir's father battled a Hamas terrorist in Nahal Oz and saved his family. Tibon later chronicled his experiences in his new book, ""The Gates of Gaza: A Story of Betrayal, Survival, and Hope in Israel's Borderline,"" where he intertwines his personal story with the history of the kibbutz.

FOREIGN SURVIVORS OF BRUTAL HAMAS ATTACK ON ISRAEL RECALL TERROR MASSACRE: 'EVERYTHING WAS BURNING'

""The kibbutzim's key role in the history of Israel, in creating and protecting the borders of Israel, remains crucial. This way of life, with a strong emphasis on community and togetherness, is more important now than ever,"" Tibon believes.

""A kibbutz can be understood as a microcosm of collective living, where community, equality and shared labor play vital roles in the daily lives of its members,"" Ayelet Harris, head of the community division in the Kibbutz Movement, said of the leadership dynamics in these communities.

""The Kibbutzim institutional structure has been crucial in the process of recovery. I saw women and men leading their kibbutzim and prioritizing the mission of returning, even in uncertain times. They decided to focus on the mission of going, working through their emotional states while being part of the teams planning the return. This sense of ownership fosters a deeper sense of belonging than in other places where people feel less influence over future plans.""

Tibon reflected on the complexities surrounding the decision to return home. ""This is a conversation we have every day. The issue is about the sense of security that the government and IDF must provide, and overcoming the psychological barriers of returning to a place where such horrors occurred.""

The ongoing trauma is compounded by the uncertainty of their friends and family who remain in Hamas captivity. ""We received five of our hostages back alive in November, thanks to a deal orchestrated by President Biden. But we still have two friends, Omri and Zachi, in the hands of the enemy,"" Tibon explained. ""For me, going back to the kibbutz means living in a house where a neighbor was killed in the house in front of me, and another neighbor was murdered in the house behind. This is where I will raise my daughters. I believe I can do that, but I don't know if I can pass by the homes of these two friends and know they were left to die in the tunnels of Gaza.""

VIDEOS OF HAMAS BRUTALITY TOWARD ISRAELIS EERILY REMINISCENT OF ISIS TACTICS

Last week, while walking around Kibbutz Gvulot, the contrast between the children's laughter and the reality of their lives was striking. Children played soccer on the grass, joyfully unaware of the shadows cast by the shelters positioned every few meters, decorated with pictures of beloved cartoon characters. The regional school at the center of the kibbutz has been improvised from structures that existed prior to October 7.

""After the attack, we found ourselves in a hotel in Eilat with a large part of the traumatized community of the south,"" Lior Dafner, the chairman of Kibbutz Gvulot, recalls. ""Every day we received news about more people we knew being kidnapped or murdered- a truly incomprehensible situation."" Kibbutz Gvulot was one of the very few places that were not raided during the October 7 massacre.

""You see a slow deterioration of people into helplessness; there are no frameworks for children. We realized we needed to establish ourselves and figure out where to go next. We wanted to ensure that the children and staff started the year on September 1, like all children in the country, and finish on June 30, in the same classroom with the same teacher and group of kids -- all in a safe and stable environment. After everything they've been through, losing friends and teachers, seeing them now in school gives us hope. This is the future. It gives us hope for what lies ahead,"" Dafner said.

Throughout the communities that are back in their homes, there is a call for resilience despite the challenges. Liberman said, ""I think we had to return here and hold this place. We need to preserve our country. I was just in New York, sitting with Jews who lamented that they are not in Israel. You see the synagogue surrounded by police protecting them because they are afraid. We, the Jewish people, are unwelcome anywhere in the world. So, we have no choice but to remain in our state. I hope that after the fighting in the south and north ends, and once we bring our hostages home, we can return to living that ninety-nine percent of paradise."""

Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as anticipated, easily won the vice-presidential debate Tuesday, October 1, on demeanor, facts, and analysis. But in fairness to a sometimes herky-jerky and nervous Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, he had the harder task of defending the temporary pseudo-conservative make-over of Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

His additional burdens were her co-culpability for the last three-and-a-half-years of the Biden disaster, and her unwillingness to implement her supposedly ""change"" agenda in the last months of her vice-presidential tenure.

The CBS News moderators, Nora O'Donnell, and, especially, Margaret Brennan, also as expected, ganged up on Vance. They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing from the last disastrous, and biased debate moderators.

EMHOFF DENIES REPORT HE SLAPPED EX-GIRLFRIEND OUTSIDE RITZY OVERSEAS MOVIE EVENT

The two moderators shamelessly broke their own rules by fact-checking (wrongly and solely) Vance. They ignored questions of the administration's tardy responses to Hurricane Helene, the Ukraine war, the recent Trump assassination attempts, or crime, while only briefly touching on Iran and a Middle East on the brink of total war. Instead, they concentrated, as also expected, on climate change, abortion, healthcare and childcare.

All were issues they thought might more easily embarrass Vance. And, of course, as also expected, the two ended the debate pressing Vance on January 6. And yet Vance again parried easily and won decisively. In doing so, he dispelled the smear that he was somehow ""mean,"" when, in fact, he proved calm and magnanimous as he methodically dissected Walz.

The nation perhaps learned that a confident Trump selected him to articulate his MAGA positions, and perhaps in a manner superior to Trump's own.

In contrast, an insecure Harris picked Walz. The vice president was assuming that he would not upstage her and perhaps, by his limitations, would make her look competent in comparison.

The debate will give some momentum to Trump-Vance in the last month of the campaign.

It follows the lethargic Biden-Harris reaction to Hurricane Helene, whose toll in human life and property had been initially and vastly ignored by the media.

It follows the growing specter of a theater-wide Middle East war, as a solitary Israel faces off against Iran and its appendages (all empowered after 2020 by Biden-Harris).

It follows the chaos of a longshoremen's strike intended to shut down the entire country. And it follows Harris's continued inability to survive even serial soft-ball interviews without her memorized and banal answers.

As a result, the slow, steady hemorrhaging of support for Harris-Walz will likely still continue in the last month of the election."

Former President Trump on Friday said that Israel should attack Iran's nuclear facilities while mocking President Biden's answer earlier this week on the subject.

While speaking at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he said when Biden was asked about Israel attacking Iran, the president answered, ""'As long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff.' That's the thing you wanna hit, right? I said, 'I think he's got that one wrong. Isn't that what you're supposed to hit?'""

Trump went on to say that nuclear proliferation is the ""biggest risk we have.""

""I hated to build the nuclear, but I got to know firsthand the power of that stuff, and I'll tell you what: we have to be totally prepared. We have to be absolutely prepared.""

He said when Biden was asked about Israel and Iran: ""His answer should have been ""'Hit the nuclear first, worry about the rest later.'""

Trump made similar comments in an interview with Fox News on Thursday, telling correspondent Bill Melugin Biden's response on Israel attacking Iran was the ""craziest thing I've ever heard. That's the biggest risk we have. The biggest risk we have is nuclear.""

TRUMP NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISORS MOCK BIDEN'S WARNINGS TO ISRAEL TO STICK TO 'PROPORTIONAL' IRAN RESPONSE

He continued, ""I mean, to make the statement, 'Please leave their nuclear alone.' I would tell you that that's not the right answer. That was the craziest answer because, you know what? Soon, they're going to have nuclear weapons. And then you're going to have problems.""

Former deputy director of national intelligence Kash Patel, who served under Trump, said this week: ""Iran launched a war into Israel, so to say that the Israelis who are defending themselves and our hostages shouldn't attack sites in Iran that could kill them - especially when you're the one who gave Iran $7 billion as a commander in chief and then allowed them to acquire nuclear materials - is wildly political.""

Following Tuesday's attack by Iran on Israel, Biden told reporters at Joint Base Andrews, ""the answer is no,"" of Israel potentially targeting the country's nuclear program.

As the presidential campaign enters the home stretch, it remains a margin-of-error race nationally and in the seven key battleground states likely to determine the winner of the election between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump.

Both national party chairs are confident of their chances.

CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Since replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in mid-July, Harris has enjoyed a wave of momentum and enjoyed a surge in fundraising. In the all-important cash dash, Harris and the DNC appear to hold a large advantage over Trump and the RNC.

And that's helped bolster what was already a very impressive ground game organizational advantage the Democrats held over the Republicans.

""We started laying the foundation well before 2024 by investing in our ground game,"" Harrison highlighted. ""We have been on the ground since the earliest days of this campaign getting our message out.""

The DNC chair touted that there are ""more than 312 coordinated offices across the battleground states,"" with ""over 2,000 coordinated staff...doing the hard work on the ground.""

But Whatley wasn't phased.

""The Democrats have a ton of money. The Democrats always have a ton of money,"" Whatley said, noting that Trump was outraised in both the 2016 and 2020 elections.

The RNC chair emphasized that ""we have the resources we need to get our message out to our voters and to every voter. I feel very, very comfortable about the campaign plan.""

And while the Harris campaign and allied groups have outspent Trump and his aligned groups in the ad wars, Whatley pointed to the former president's ability to capture free media.

""Donald Trump is out there talking every single day to the voters in a way that only he can. He can generate news. He can go out there and generate social media hits. He can communicate directly with the American voters like no other politician of our generation, so it's a huge advantage for us,"" he said.

Veteran Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducted the Fox News Poll along with longtime Republican pollster Daron Shaw, said with four weeks to go, ""my expectations of plausible outcomes range from a narrow Electoral College victory for Trump to a modestly more comfortable victory for Harris.""

TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS

But while Harris holds a slight two-point edge in an average of the national surveys, Shaw noted that ""the issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump.""

Veteran political scientist and New England College president Wayne Lesperance said that ""this presidential contest is shaping up to be one of the closest in history, with the results likely to be slow-coming.""

And longtime Republican consultant Matt Gorman, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, highlighted that ""we're slated for the tightest race since 2000.""

""There are no more debates. There's going to be a vacuum of news,"" he said. ""It's integral the Trump campaign fill that vacuum with a message that puts Harris on the defensive.""

Trump, like Biden, is a well-known commodity.

But Harris, even after being in the spotlight for nearly two months, is still less well-defined.

""The more voters get to know Vice President Harris, the more they like her,"" Democratic strategist and communicator Chris Moyer argued.

""It's imperative that she continues to get in front of swing state voters, and she could afford to do more in the final weeks,"" he offered. ""She should barnstorm the key states, filling up her schedule with rallies and local interviews and off-the-record stops that produce shareable clips that bounce around social media. They've run a nearly perfect race to this point, but many voters still want to know more about who she is, what she believes, and what she will do as president.""

With one month to go, there's always the possibility of an October surprise that could rock the White House race.

The dockworkers strike earlier this week - which closed major ports - could have wreaked havoc on the nation's supply chain. It could have turned into an October surprise, but the strike was suspended after just two days.

Hurricane Helene, which tore a path of destruction through the southeast, also made an impact on the presidential contest - and there were memories of how Superstorm Sandy rocked the 2012 White House race between then-President Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney.

And the strife in the Middle East - between Israel, Iran, and Hezbollah, also threatens to upend the election.

It's important to note that while Election Day is a month away, in over two-dozen states, early in-person voting, absentee balloting, and voting by mail, are already underway."
White House reporters ask zero questions about Hurricane Helene in surprise opportunity to press Biden,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/white-house-reporters-ask-zero-questions-about-hurricane-helene-surprise-opportunity-press-biden,2024-10-04T21:10:00Z,"President Biden touted the September jobs report and said that he may need to ask Congress for more money for Hurricane Helene disaster relief, Friday, Oct. 4, 2024, during a surprise White House press briefing appearance.

Reporters had a unique opportunity to question President Biden when he made a surprise appearance at the White House press briefing on Friday, but didn't ask about the historic disaster unfolding in the Southeast in the wake of Hurricane Helene.

It was the first time that Biden appeared at a White House press briefing since taking office. The president spoke briefly about the suspended port workers strike and Friday's positive jobs numbers, and he announced that he may request additional money from Congress to fund Hurricane Helene relief efforts. But there was no follow-up from the press on hurricane relief.

After thanking the president for his presence, the first reporter asked about Republicans casting doubt on his economic numbers, saying, ""Florida Sen. Marco Rubio described today's jobs report as having fake numbers. What do you make of that? And how worried are you that many Americans are hearing that the jobs numbers aren't real?""

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

The crisis in the Middle East was the biggest topic, with questions about Biden's comments about strikes on Iranian oil facilities, Israeli plans to retaliate, possible U.S. sanctions, and worries about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu trying to influence the U.S. election.

Election security and the peaceful transfer of power were also top of mind for reporters.

""The election is a month away. One, I'd like to know how you're feeling about how this election is going. And then also, do you have confidence that it will be a free and fair election and that it will be peaceful?"" one reporter asked. ""Are you making any preparations, getting security briefings related to domestic security?""

The only mention of Hurricane Helene, with a death toll topping 230, was in a question about Vice President Kamala Harris' role in the administration.

""There have obviously been a number of crises that the country has been facing over the past several days with the hurricane, with the port strike, with the situation in the Middle East. Can you talk about how your vice president, who is running for the presidency, has worked on these crises and what role she has played over the past several days?"" a reporter asked.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

The Biden-Harris administration has come under fire from former President Trump for the federal response to the devastation left by Helene, already one of the deadliest hurricanes this century.

The White House has pushed back hard against these criticisms, emphasizing that Biden has coordinated the federal response, including approving emergency declarations and deploying 1,000 active-duty soldiers to support search-and-rescue efforts. More than 4,800 personnel from FEMA and other agencies have been deployed to North Carolina and neighboring states impacted by Helene. Additionally, FEMA has shipped over 8.5 million meals, more than 7 million liters of water, 150 generators and over 220,000 tarps to aid response efforts, according to the White House.

As of Friday, the federal government has provided more than $45 million in Individual assistance to survivors affected by the storm, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, including in the form of one-time $750 payments from FEMA to qualified applicants in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.

The FBI and Department of Homeland Security on Friday warned that the upcoming one-year anniversary of the Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel could motivate some people to engage in violence within the United States.

In a public service announcement, authorities said the anniversary may motivate extremists and others to engage in hate crimes and provoke violence.

""Over the past year, we have observed violent extremist activity and hate crimes in the United States linked to the conflict,"" the PSA states.

Hamas killed 1,200 people and kidnapped hundreds of hostages during its brazen Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack on the Jewish state.

Newly revealed emails show senior military officials raised concerns with the White House within days of Israel commencing its operation in Gaza.

Reuters obtained and examined emails between senior State Department and Pentagon officials between Oct. 11-14 that showed concern and alarm as Israel started hitting the Gaza Strip with missile strikes.

The emails specifically focused on the mass evacuation of Palestinians as a potential legal issue. Dana Stroul, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East at the time, wrote to senior Biden aides Oct. 13 and warned that Israel could face war crime charges for its actions.

The emails also include pressure to include messages of sympathy for the Palestinian people and to allow more aid into Gaza while seeking to remain in solidarity with Israel.

ISRAELI MILITARY KILLS 250 HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS SINCE START OF LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN LEBANON

Israel's invasion of Gaza has proven polarizing and painful for the Democrats. The progressive wing and younger voters are trying to hold the Biden administration to account for its support of Israel as tens of thousands of Palestinians die.

The invasion also made it difficult -- if not impossible -- for aid groups to help the displaced residents of Gaza who fled their homes to avoid getting caught up in Israel's operations.

Stroul outright alleged that Israel could be ""close to committing war crimes"" after the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) dropped leaflets over northern Gaza urging residents to flee their homes ahead of the military rolling into the territory as part of the early ""targeted incursions.""

""Their main line is that it is impossible for one million civilians to move this fast,"" Stroul wrote. One official said that such an operation was not possible without creating a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""

Three senior U.S. officials argued the White House was slow to address these problems, with Biden's team at one point arguing that the U.S. was ""leading international efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza,"" which would remain a ""top priority.""

Bill Russo, at the time an assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of Global Public Affairs, attempted to drive home the long-term impact of the U.S.'s ""lack of response on the humanitarian conditions"" in Gaza, calling it ""ineffective and counterproductive"" while also harming relations with Arab nations.

""If this course is not quickly reversed by not only messaging, but action, it risks damaging our stance in the region for years to come,"" Russo wrote in one email, according to Reuters. A colleague forwarded his emails to White House officials and warned that ""otherwise would-be stalwart"" Arab partners might think twice about relations with the U.S.

Russo eventually resigned from his post in March 2024, citing personal reasons for his decision.

Far-left voters have placed the fate of Gaza front and center of their concerns approaching November's election. The voters of Michigan started an ""uncommitted"" protest vote during the Democratic primary as a means of venting frustration at the Biden administration's handling of the crisis.

Those same voters shredded Harris for her DNC speech in August, calling it ""horrible"" and accusing Harris of ""downplaying"" U.S. complicity in the Gaza invasion by providing Israel funding and weapons.

A group of volunteers who saved an 11-day-old baby in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene questioned where the federal government and state leadership are as devastated communities continue to reel from the historic storm.

Florida Guard Special Missions Unit's Jon Howard, Aerial Recovery's Charlie Keebaugh, pilot Mark Roseman and civilian helicopter pilot Zeb Hadley are conducting search and rescue operations in North Carolina as the Biden-Harris administration's leadership remains in question over their response to the catastrophe.

NORTH CAROLINA COMMUNITY 'HUNTING' FOR MISSING TEACHERS IN 'DEVASTATING' AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE HELENE

""There's just a complete failure of weak leadership here in North Carolina, the federal government, and it takes mind-strong leadership in Florida to send us up here,"" Howard told Bill Hemmer on Friday. ""If it wasn't for DeSantis sending the state guard special missions unit up here, this never even would have happened. But there's just no support here. There's no leadership.""

""When we meet these locals on the ground, they're asking, like, 'You're from the state guard?' I'm like, 'I am from Florida,' and they're like, 'Where's North Carolina?' You know, they're asking where their leadership is,"" he continued. ""They have no understanding of what's going on, and then we've even had people, officials here, try to kick us out of Lakemoor, out of Chimney Rock... Nonsense stuff. They're asking me for my authorizations to be here... It's the most insane thing you would ever see. It's like they want these people to die.""

President Biden has pledged to provide significant resources to aid in the recovery efforts, acknowledging the immense cost - estimated to be in the billions of dollars. To expedite the delivery of essential supplies to those in need, Biden is directing the Defense Department to deploy 1,000 active-duty soldiers.

But critics say his action hasn't been enough to help those struggling without food, power and water one week after the storm made landfall.

Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., also slammed the Biden administration for the Helene response, telling Laura Ingraham he saw his first Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) truck on Thursday, after traveling to various locations to help struggling residents.

HURRICANE HELENE SURVIVOR SAYS WATER ROSE 4 FT. WITHIN MINUTES: 'WE'RE JUST THANKFUL WE ARE ALL ALIVE'

""There's been a complete pattern of abandonment under Biden and Harris,"" Mills said during ""The Ingraham Angle"" on Thursday, citing the administration's handling of the Afghanistan withdrawal, the Oct. 7 massacre in Israel and civil unrest in Haiti.

""This administration, what the pattern is, you have to shame them into doing what is right,"" he continued.

Amid criticism targeting Biden and Harris over their hurricane response, some volunteers have taken action themselves to help those in urgent need as hundreds remain missing, and the death toll continues to climb.

The relief efforts of Howard, Keebaugh, Roseman and Hadley included the miraculous saving of a newborn baby who was in dire need of oxygen after the storm hit. Ultimately, their action saved the baby's life.

""I reached out to my state guard team that was on the ground, didn't know their exact location. And then my paramedic, Paul, he was actually a few minutes away from there, and he was able to rush over there to stabilize that baby to get ready for LifeFlight while the rest of the team, Mark and HLZ, sent us imagery that way Mark could put the helicopter down,"" Howard said.

""Charlie was doing all the coordinating, and then we grabbed that baby,"" he continued. ""The mom and grandma threw on the helicopter as fast as we could. Mark flew us right to the Asheville Airport, did his first rooftop landing in a very small crosswind, and doctors and nurses were right there on standby and saved that baby's life.""

Howard mentioned that he has stayed in contact with the family, and the newborn is alive and healthy.

Keebaugh, who is the chief development officer at Aerial Recovery, explained the significance of the organization's work post-Helene as human traffickers try to seize upon the disaster for their own benefit.

""We also respond to disasters because a lot of people don't realize when there's a natural disaster or a manmade disaster, human traffickers show up... you've got people missing, thousands of people from this area missing. What's five more? That's the attitude of the traffickers,"" he said.

""So they will come up, they'll come to shelters. They'll come to your homes,"" he continued. ""So that's one thing we look out for while we're here, but we've also got several trained disaster response technicians on our team.""

At least 224 people have lost their lives across six states, with North Carolina bearing the brunt of the devastation. As more areas are searched for the first time, that number is expected to rise. The lack of phone service and electricity in the region hampers efforts to locate missing individuals.

Search crews are meticulously combing through the mountains, hoping to find survivors among the reported missing. Their efforts have been hampered by washed-out roads, downed power lines and mudslides. Helene has now become the second-deadliest hurricane to strike the U.S. mainland in 55 years.

""Seeing devastation like you've never seen,"" Roseman said. ""People trapped. Roads are just demolished. There's no way in and out... There's no communication. The only lifeline is just coming in there, either flying the sick out or either us taking in supplies, so it's just a lot. I've never seen devastation like this."""
Trump national security advisors mock Biden's warnings to Israel to stick to 'proportional' Iran response,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-israel-response-iran-trump,2024-10-04T19:26:57Z,"Fox News senior strategic analyst Jack Keane joined 'Fox & Friends'

A ""painful"" Israeli response weighs over the heads of the Iranian regime after their ballistic missile attacks on Tel Aviv on Tuesday.

President Joe Biden has insisted that an angry Israel should not strike Iran's nuclear sites - and should make sure its response is measured - proportional.

""Iran launched a war into Israel,"" said former deputy director of national intelligence Kash Patel.

""So to say that the Israelis who are defending themselves and our hostages shouldn't attack sites in Iran that could kill them - especially when you're the one who gave Iran $7 billion as a commander in chief and then allowed them to acquire nuclear materials - is wildly political.""

On Thursday, he revealed that he was ""discussing"" recommending Israel target Iran's energy facilities.

""That put the oil markets into a tailspin, even if we are talking to them about it. It's not something you muse about publicly,"" said former Trump deputy national security advisor Victoria Coates.

""If you've made a decision, and you have something to announce, fine. You want to level with the American people as much as you can. These random comments are really damaging and confusing to the Iranians, because . . . they don't have any guidelines or guardrails about what might be coming and so they might do something weird.""

IRAN'S AYATOLLAH KHAMEINI DEFENDS MISSILE ATTACKS ON ISRAEL

Israel's counterattack could come at any moment. ""We will act. Iran will soon feel the consequences of their actions. The response will be painful,"" Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon told reporters.

Rather than its longtime goal of helping to negotiate a ceasefire, the Biden administration has now shifted its priority to containment - helping the region avoid all-out war between its two hegemonic superpowers.

""This is the 1930s all over again. G7 leaders - led by President Biden - are urging Israel to have a proportional and limited response against the Iranian regime,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., told Fox News Digital.

""The idea of telling Israel what targets to strike ignores reality,"" he went on. ""Would a proportional response be launching 200 ballistic missiles from Israel into Iran, mimicking what the Iranians did to Israel?""

Former President Donald Trump has not said how Israel should respond to the attacks - which he insists never would have happened under his watch.

Striking Iran's nuclear facilities risks provoking all-out war on yet another front for Israel in the eyes of the Biden administration. The Trump team is caught between an anti-war mindset and a penchant for supporting Israel without conditions. It's unclear whether they still believe the two can exist in harmony.

Proportionality is ""clearly not what Israel is doing,"" according to Coates.

""It really seems to me that after the Prime Minister [Benjamin Netanyahu] left Washington in July, after that visit, some factor, or combination of factors, really changed his calculus,"" she said.

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

""He appears to have gotten home with the attitude of, 'I want to get everything I can get done before the election.' He's not really listening to the White House at all, which is unfortunate.""

After Iranian plots to assassinate him and the hacking of his campaign, Trump did say that if he were president, he would tell Iran, ""I'm going to blow you to smithereens"" if they harm any U.S. political figures.

On Tuesday, Trump was asked whether he wished he had responded more forcefully after Iran fired dozens of missiles at U.S. forces stationed in Iraq in 2020, leaving many with traumatic brain injuries.

""So, first of all, 'injured.' What does 'injured' mean? 'Injured' means -- you mean, because they had a headache? Because the bombs never hit the fort,"" Trump said.

""So just so you understand, there was nobody ever tougher on Iraq,"" Trump continued, saying 'Iraq' instead of 'Iran.' ""When you say not tough, they had no money. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. And when we hit them, they hit us. And they called us, and they said, 'We're going to shoot at your fort, but we're not going to hit it.'""

Defense officials have said more than 100 suffered traumatic brain injuries after the January 2020 attack.

That attack came after Trump ordered the killing of Iranian General Qassem Soleimani due to an uncovered Iranian plot to kill American diplomats and service members.

Trump vowed to hit 52 Iranian sites ""very hard"" if Iran were to carry out the plot, representing the 52 Americans held hostage in Iran for 444 days after being seized at the U.S. embassy in Tehran in November 1979.

Still, in January, Iran lobbed attacks on two Iraqi bases housing U.S. troops, including the Ain al-Assad military base, and a second facility near Erbil airport.

In March, three U.S.-led coalition forces were killed when multiple rockets hit Taji military base.

Trump, who withdrew from the Iran nuclear deal and reimposed sanctions on Tehran, has insisted to reporters this week that ""nobody [was] ever tougher on Iran"" than he was.

'Look at the World today -- Look at the missiles flying right now in the Middle East, look at what's happening with Russia/Ukraine, look at Inflation destroying the World. NONE OF THIS HAPPENED WHILE I WAS PRESIDENT!' he wrote on Truth Social.

Alexander Vindman, the former Trump National Security Council Director for European Affairs for the United States, claimed that the former president was ""fearful"" of escalation with Iran.

""Iran struck first and early, during Trump's presidency, attacking US troops. Trump consistently recoiled in fear inviting further attacks,"" he wrote on X.

""Fact check: In 2020, Iran fired ballistic missiles at U.S. forces in retaliation for the Soleimani assassination. 110 U.S. service members sustained traumatic brain injuries. Many administration officials remain on an Iranian hit list today,"" former White House press secretary Stephanie Grisham said.

But Patel argued the Biden administration's lifting of sanctions on Iran -- and the Obama administration's 2015 nuclear deal -- is what led to the attacks in the first place.

""The JCPOA, which was called the 'Iran nuclear deal' for a reason. It was never intended to prevent Iran from having a nuclear weapon. It literally gave them one on a timeline,"" he said.

""Now I believe they have one, because for four years they haven't stopped them or slowed them down. They've only been successful in politicizing national security."""

During the interview, Yui also suggested that Taiwan's government was in touch with both Vice President Harris and former President Trump's circles to be prepared for whatever comes next in U.S. relations.

""The whole world is watching, and I'm sure the diplomatic community here in Washington, D.C., is also watching closely and [trying] to reach out to both candidates or to the people around the candidates,"" Yui said.

Blinken penned an op-ed in Foreign Affairs Magazine on Oct. 1 that said world powers were in competition to set the stage for a ""new age"" of international relations.

""While these countries are not an axis, and the administration has been clear that it does not seek bloc confrontation, choices these revisionist powers are making mean we need to act decisively to prevent that outcome.""

Soros-backed dark money network paid New York Dem candidate's salary: 'Incredibly problematic',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/soros-backed-dark-money-network-paid-new-york-dem-candidates-salary-incredibly-problematic,2024-10-04T17:05:32Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A top Democratic House recruit drew a salary worth tens of thousands of dollars from a left-wing dark money group heavily bankrolled by George Soros' political empire, Fox News Digital has learned.

New York congressional candidate Laura Gillen, a town supervisor in the Long Island town of Hempstead, drew a $40,000 ""fellow"" salary with the group Our American Future Foundation (OAFF) in 2023, according to her financial disclosures. The group and a sister nonprofit, Our American Future Action, help pay expenses for individuals -- overwhelmingly Democrats -- who plan to run for office in the future.

According to the Open Society Foundations, the umbrella of groups founded by Soros, its Open Society Action Fund has donated more than $18 million to Our American Future Action ""to support non-partisan policy advocacy and civic engagement.""

Tax filings show Our American Future Action is Our American Future Foundation's ""direct controlling entity.""

Our American Future Foundation also received direct support from the Soros empire. It got an undisclosed level of funding last year from the Jennifer and Jonathan Allan Soros Foundation, a charitable group run by one of the left-wing billionaire's sons, tax filings show.

Jonathan and Jennifer Soros have also donated to Gillen's campaign directly, each contributing $3,300 this year. Another Soros son, Robert Soros, donated $2,900 to Gillen's unsuccessful 2022 campaign to unseat Republican Rep. Anthony D'Esposito.

""It is incredibly problematic that George Soros is paying candidates to run for office through a program disguised as a 'fellowship,'"" said Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of the nonprofit watchdog group Americans for Public Trust, in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""Voters should be seriously alarmed that Laura Gillen, who is claiming to run on ethics and transparency, is being personally propped up by a Soros group that is advocating for open borders, anti-police measures, and radical energy policies,"" Sutherland continued. ""This raises crucial questions about who Gillen will answer to if elected to Congress: the voters...or George Soros?""

Gillen has claimed that pointing out Soros funding for her campaign is responsible for ""antisemitic violence.""

Rep. Dan Goldman, a fellow New York Democrat, has also accused D'Esposito, whom Gillen is challenging again this cycle, of ""using a disgusting antisemitic trope"" by pointing out Soros' backing.

Soros' groups have heavily funded organizations behind antisemitic protests since last year aimed at delegitimizing Israel and stopping U.S. support for its military campaign against the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah.

The Open Society Action Fund's $18,055,000 in funding for Our American Future Action began in 2023 and was slated to finance activities stretching for 19 months, according to a grants database on the Open Society Foundations website. Tax filings indicate the Jonathan and Jennifer Alan Soros Foundation's donation also came in 2023, the same year Gillen drew her fellowship salary.

The fellowship program is designed to provide aspiring political candidates, overwhelmingly Democrats, with money to cover basic living expenses while they focus on future political campaigns.

Several Democratic candidates in competitive 2024 contests have received funding from the group, including California's Will Rollins, Nebraska's Tony Vargas, Arizona's Kirsten Engel and New York's Josh Riley, according to the Washington Examiner.

In March, the Examiner first reported that the nonprofit watchdog group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) was filing a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging OAFF's payments to future House candidates violated federal law. As a 501(c)3 nonprofit, OAFF is prohibited from spending money on political activity. However, FACT alleged its payments to eventual candidates for office were explicitly designed to advance their political prospects.

""The fellowship's true purpose was explicitly described by its founder as a way to give money to failed candidates (or prospective candidates) for personal expenses in the brief downtime before they are able to file again to run for another office,"" FACT wrote in its complaint. ""Thus, the fellowship is directly tied to a federal candidacy and not for bona fide independent employment. Any claim otherwise would strain credulity.""

Soros has also poured millions into several other groups and committees backing Democrats throughout the 2024 cycle. His two super PACs - Democracy PAC and Democracy PAC II - have so far combined to shower left-wing groups with $53 million, Federal Election Commission records show.

Gillen recently benefited from one of the groups financed by the left-wing billionaire. On Aug. 2, Soros' Democracy PAC sent $500,000 to the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund, which weeks later spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on independent expenditures backing her candidacy in the form of digital production, ad buys, and other items. During that time, the group also backed Kamala Harris and a handful of other Democrats.

Gillen's campaign, Our American Future Foundation, and the Open Society Foundation did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment."

'It makes no sense': Jordan says FBI stonewalling requests for briefing on Iran hack of Trump campaign,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/it-makes-no-sense-jordan-says-fbi-stonewalling-requests-briefing-iran-hack-trump-campaign,2024-10-04T15:36:44Z,"EXCLUSIVE: The FBI is refusing to give the House Judiciary Committee a briefing on Iran's hack of the Trump campaign and other key issues, Chairman Jim Jordan told Fox News Digital, saying that the American people deserve to have the information before Election Day.

Jordan, R-Ohio, spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital and said that he and his committee have been seeking a briefing in an unclassified setting to obtain information relating to Iran's hack of the Trump campaign, and whether the former president and his team had been given a defensive briefing on the matter.

The FBI has told Fox News Digital that it is committed to working with the committee but did not say if or when officials would brief Jordan.

""This hacking of the Trump campaign by Iran -- it looks like there was a dossier on JD Vance -- that dossier winds up at the Harris campaign, and somehow, it happens to wind up in the press,"" Jordan said. ""There are lots of questions, like when did you find out about this? How did you find out about this? Did you give Trump a defensive briefing? Who was the person in the Harris campaign who got the information? How did they get the information? When did they tell you they had the information? How did it then get to the press?""

HOUSE JUDICIARY INVESTIGATING DOJ FOR RELEASE OF ROUTH MANIFESTO OFFERING $150K TRUMP BOUNTY

Jordan said, ""Those are just questions off the top of my head.""

""It makes no sense, because we know if everything were reversed and the Iranians hacked the Harris campaign and there was a dossier on Tim Walz that winded up in the Trump campaign and then in the press, we know that they would all be going crazy,"" Jordan said. ""There would probably already be a special counsel.""

Jordan also pointed to the fact that the hack was taken by an adversarial nation -- Iran.

""This is the same country that says they are trying to assassinate President Trump. This is the same country who is the chief sponsor of terrorism. This is the same country that wants to assassinate [Israeli] Prime Minister Netanyahu. And this is the same country who just sent rockets to our best ally -- ballistic missiles to our best ally -- the State of Israel,"" Jordan said. ""And we want to be briefed on this hacking, and they won't do it.""

The Trump campaign said that the documents had been obtained ""illegally from sources hostile to the United States,"" who ""intended to interfere in the 2024 election and sow chaos throughout our Democratic process.""

IRAN IS 'INCREASINGLY AGGRESSIVE' IN ITS OPERATIONS TO TARGET US PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGNS: INTEL COMMUNITY

The hack by Iran came ""after recent reports of an Iranian plot to assassinate President Trump around the same time as the Butler, PA tragedy.""

The documents were sent to Politico and included a 271-page ""dossier"" that the Trump campaign had put together on his eventual running mate Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, that dated back to February, the outlet said.

It included Vance's past stances on issues, statements and previous criticisms of Trump in a section called ""POTENTIAL VULNERABILITIES.""

Meanwhile, Jordan also said his committee has other questions relating to Trump, the GOP presidential nominee, including why the Justice Department released the ""bounty letter"" from the second attempted assassin, Ryan Routh, who offered $150,000 to someone who could ""complete the job"" against Trump if he were to fail.

The DOJ, in a court filing last month, released Routh's letter as evidence in a detention memo by the Justice Department in an effort to ensure Routh's detention.

DOJ INSPECTOR GENERAL DOES NOT DENY FBI INFORMANTS WERE AMONG JAN 6 CROWD

Jordan also told Fox News Digital he wants information from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz, who testified last week that he would include in his highly anticipated report on Jan. 6, 2021 details about confidential human sources from the FBI and whether they had been embedded in the mob during the Capitol riot.

During the hearing last week, Horowitz was asked whether he would ""expose that there were confidential human sources at the Capitol"" on Jan. 6, and ""how many went into the Capitol?""

Horowitz replied, ""I'll have that information in the report.""

Horowitz, though, indicated his report would not be made public until after Election Day.

""Well, for goodness' sake, it's been four years,"" Jordan said. ""Why not give us that information now, right?""

But Jordan said that ""the FBI will not sit down with the committee.""

Jordan stressed that the House Judiciary Committee is ""the authorizing committee for the Justice Department.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN SAYS INTERNAL COMMUNICATIONS WERE HACKED, INCLUDING VANCE 'DOSSIER,' BY FOREIGN SOURCES

""They will not sit down and talk with our committee, and it's ridiculous,"" Jordan said. ""This is important information for the American people to know before a consequential election.""

Fox News Digital has learned that representatives for the House Judiciary Committee began requesting the briefing during a phone call on Sept. 24 with the FBI. The committee then had two phone calls on Sept. 25 with the FBI requesting a briefing, a call with the Justice Department on Oct. 1 requesting a briefing, and two calls with the FBI on Oct. 1 requesting a briefing.

A source said representatives of the committee also left a voicemail for the FBI on Oct. 1 requesting a briefing and had a call with the FBI again on Oct. 2.

An FBI spokesperson told Fox News Digital that the bureau ""has continually demonstrated its commitment to working with the Committee to accommodate its requests, and we have provided numerous documents and briefings.""

""The FBI recognizes the importance of congressional oversight and remains committed to cooperating with the Committee in good faith,"" the FBI spokesperson said.

But that cooperation has not met Jordan's requests, the chairman said, and warned that all options are on the table.

""We have done more than 100 subpoenas this Congress, so every option is on the table for us to try to get the information that we believe the American people are entitled to have before making a decision, as I said, in an election that is so consequential,"" Jordan told Fox News Digital.

""We've got important questions about important issues that impact our country and one of the major candidates for political office,"" he said. ""Give us the briefing, for goodness' sake. Answer our questions."""
Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei defends missile barrage against Israel in rare sermon,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/irans-ayatollah-khamenei-defends-missile-barrage-against-israel-rare-sermon,2024-10-04T12:34:54Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared in a rare sermon Friday that his country's ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier this week was ""legal and legitimate"" and that the ""resistance in the region will not back down even with the killing of its leaders.""

The public address from Khamenei was his first during Friday prayers in Tehran in nearly five years, according to the AFP.

Khamenei said Iran will not ""procrastinate nor act hastily to carry out its duty"" in going after Israel, Reuters reports.

The news agency cited him as saying that Tuesday's barrage of nearly 200 missiles fired by Iran at Israel was ""legal and legitimate"" and the minimum punishment for Israel's ""crimes.""

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

""The resistance in the region will not back down even with the killing of its leaders,"" Khamenei reportedly added, mentioning recently slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah during the speech.

The remarks came as the Israel Defense Forces announced Friday that Mohammad Rashid Sakafi, the commander of Hezbollah's Communications Unit, was killed in an airstrike in Beirut, Lebanon.

""Sakafi was a senior Hezbollah terrorist, who was responsible for the communications unit since 2000,"" the IDF wrote on X. ""Sakafi invested significant efforts to develop communication capabilities between all of Hezbollah's units.""

ISRAEL BANS UN SECRETARY-GENERAL OVER ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIONS

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier this week that the Iranian missile attack on Israel was ""defeated and ineffective"" and that the U.S. military coordinated with the IDF to repel the strikes.

""U.S. naval destroyers joined Israeli Air Defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles. President Biden and Vice President Harris monitored the attack and the response from the White House Situation Room, joined in person and remotely by their national security team,"" Sullivan said during a briefing.

""This is a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event, and it is equally significant that we were able to step up with Israel and create a situation in which no one was killed in this attack in Israel... We are now going to look at what the appropriate next steps are to secure, first and foremost, American interests and then to promote stability to the maximum extent possible as we go forward,"" he added.

Fox News' ""Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.

- As Oct. 7 anniversary approaches, Jewish students vow to 'walk proudly'

- CNN's Amanpour says Iran does not want to 'escalate' conflict even as Iranian rockets strike Israel

- Harvard went easy on students for antisemitic conduct, House committee finds

- Hugh Hewitt: How Kamala Harris' snub of Netanyahu only seemed to embolden Israeli leader

TOP STORY: With the first anniversary of October 7 fast approaching, universities and college students are bracing for renewed anti-Israel demonstrations on campuses across the United States. In particular, the National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) is orchestrating a nationwide ""Week of Rage"" on campuses beginning Monday.

VIDEO: Comedian and pro-Israel influencer Zach Sage Fox believes an interview he filmed in the West Bank could show Americans how Palestinian civilians truly feel about Jewish people - but it took him months to recover the footage after he was threatened to delete it. Watch it here:

COME AGAIN, CHRISTINE?: CNN chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour insisted Tuesday that Iran does not want conflict to escalate with Israel or the United States, and that Tehran felt it had ""no choice"" but to strike the Jewish state after Israel took out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon last week. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan disagreed, calling the attack ""a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event.""

GRADING ON A CURVE: Harvard University went easy on students whose antisemitic conduct violated its own policies, according to the House Education and the Workforce Committee, which probed anti-Israel college protests in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. Of 68 students disciplined, none are currently suspended, 52 remain in ""good standing,"" 15 are not, and one is on leave. The committee said it believes Harvard is in violation of Title VI, which forbids ""a hostile environment based on race, color, or national origin.""

HUGH HEWITT: Vice President Kamala Harris sent a very public message to her anti-Israel supporters when she skipped Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit this summer. And ever since, Netanyahu has embraced a different strategy, from his fiery address the United Nations General Assembly last week, to taking the war to Hamas and Hezbollah.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: ""This October 7, as I mourn the innocent lives lost and pray for the brave men and women of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who continue to fight, I will walk proudly and be a tribute, a public voice of remembrance, for all those beautiful souls who were stolen from us too soon.""

6 ways Iran could strike US in the Mideast or here at home,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/6-ways-iran-could-strike-us-mideast-here-home,2024-10-04T11:10:07Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Iran's terror goons are in crisis mode right now. Having seen their missile attack on Israel fail yet again due to Israel's powerful defenses, Iran is now expecting an Israeli counterstrike.

""There will be severe consequences for this attack, and we will work with Israel to make that the case,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Tuesday, October 1. All the G7 nations agree Israel has the right to strike back, President Joe Biden added Wednesday.

Iran wants blood. But they are running out of options. More than 40,000 U.S. forces were already deployed to U.S. Central Command in the Middle East, in locations from Syria to the Red Sea. Three more squadrons of F-15Es, F-16s and A-10s are on the way to U.S. Central Command, joining stealth F-22s, F-35s and others already in the region.

TRUMP SAYS IRANIAN PRESIDENT BEING GUARDED AT UN WHILE PLOTTING ASSASSINATION 'A STRANGE SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES'

The aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln is launching jets day and night and the USS Wasp, with a Marine Expeditionary Unit aboard, is in the eastern Mediterranean. The submarine USS Georgia, carrying 154 Tomahawk land-attack cruise missiles, is nearby too, along with a bevy of U.S. Navy destroyers.

Make no mistake. This is enough firepower to hit many types of Iranian targets. Guarantee you, Iran's military units are scrambling to prepare. While being very, very careful about using cellphones.

Whatever action comes will aim to weaken and contain Iran. Iran's proxies Hamas and Hezbollah have been mauled. But this conflict won't be over as long as the ayatollah holds power over Iran's people. That gang has been in the ideology and terror business for almost 50 years and won't go quietly.

Look for desperate Iran to consider six moves - including two here in the USA.

Already in massive violation of the United Nations inspection regime, Iran proclaimed in July they would install more than 1,400 centrifuges at the underground Fordow facility. ""Iran has managed to reach a point where it can not only produce nuclear weapons on-demand but produce large quantities of WGU [weapons-grade uranium] quickly in a very hard-to-destroy enrichment plant,"" expert David Albright noted. The best case is that Iran's new president wants more enriched uranium as a bargaining chip. The worst case is rapid production of three to five nuclear warheads.

Many of the recent deployments directed by Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin are beefing up security against direct attacks from Iran, like the January 2020 ballistic missile attack on U.S. personnel at a base in Iraq. U.S. outposts will be on guard against attempted strikes by Iran-backed militia.

The Houthis, supplied by Iran, will continue to menace Red Sea shipping. Iran has also been working a deal for Russia to supply upgraded P-800 ""Oniks"" anti-ship missiles to the Houthis.

Even after tactical failures on Apr. 13 and Oct. 1, more missile attacks from Iran remain a concern. Fortunately, U.S. Navy destroyers USS Cole and USS Bulkeley fired interceptors from the eastern Mediterranean against Iran's attack. This is sweet vengeance for the USS Cole, nearly sunk by al Qaeda terrorists in Yemen in 2000, with the loss of 17 sailors killed and 37 wounded.

Beyond this, U.S. Central Command is massing a powerful defensive and offensive force starting to serve a new deterrent role. Should Iran field nuclear weapons, this is the type of force array that will be necessary to deter their attacks. Iran's leaders must get the message that any nuclear-armed missiles they may build in the future won't get through.

Two more threats from Iran could aim directly at the U.S.

The FBI says threat indicators are spiking. In early September, the FBI warned Iran is targeting hospitals and healthcare in the US. Don't forget Iran almost opened the Bowman Avenue Dam in Rye, New York back in 2013; by chance, the sluice gate was offline for maintenance. A 2023 bulletin from Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency warned the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps group ""CyberAv3ngers"" is still targeting wastewater management systems. Who knows what cyber tricks Iran may have learned from Russia.

The Director of National Intelligence has briefed former President and Republican nominee Donald J. Trump on ""real and specific threats"" to assassinate him. ""I am surrounded by more men, guns, and weapons than I have ever seen before,"" Trump posted on Truth Social last week. Sadly, violence against American leaders fits Iran's playbook.

Whatever action comes will aim to weaken and contain Iran. Iran's proxies Hamas and Hezbollah have been mauled. But this conflict won't be over as long as the ayatollah holds power over Iran's people. That gang has been in the ideology and terror business for almost 50 years and won't go quietly.

Be assured the U.S. and allies are prepared to counter every one of these options.

Whatever violence Iran unleashes next, remember China is also to blame. China buys almost 90% of Iran's oil in what the Atlantic Council dubbed ""the axis of evasion"" and China's support is enabling Iran's lethal mayhem."

With the first anniversary of October 7 fast approaching, universities and college students are bracing for renewed anti-Israel demonstrations on campuses across the United States.

The anniversary of the devastating attacks by Hamas against Israel is likely to exacerbate already inflamed tensions at colleges - further heightened by Iran's unprecedented missile attack against the Jewish state.

Many anti-Israel groups are already planning demonstrations. In particular, the National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) is orchestrating a nationwide ""Week of Rage"" on campuses beginning on the October 7 anniversary.

Cornell undergraduate student Amanda Silberstein suggested that while many students are focused on honoring the memory of innocent lives lost throughout the Israel-Hamas war, SJP is ""choosing to celebrate the day and glorify violence under the guise of resistance.""

JEWS PREPARE TO OBSERVE ROSH HASHANAH AS GROUP STEPS UP TO SECURE COMMUNITY AMID HUGE RISE IN ANTISEMITISM

""This overt dehumanization of Jews not only disrespects all of the victims but also incites Jew hatred on campus,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""It is disheartening to witness such a lack of empathy and understanding on a day that should be reserved for solemn reflection and unity - not for promoting hate and conflict.""

NSJP did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Bela Ingber, a student at NYU, also expressed concern about her local SJP chapter. The group is staging a walkout in Washington Square Park before joining larger protests throughout the city.

She noted that NYU has an open campus, meaning student protests can snowball into much more significant events. Not only do the protests attract students, but outsiders can agitate and take advantage of students to support a larger platform.

Ingber said that she is hopeful the NYPD, in conjunction with NYU campus safety, will attempt to keep the situation under control. Still, she is ""angry, frustrated and sad"" that fellow students will ""continue to justify the murder, rape, and kidnapping of Jews.""

However, Ingber stressed that she is also empowered and motivated.

""We are not going anywhere,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""We will not cower in fear and we most certainly will not be intimated. This October 7, as I mourn the innocent lives lost and pray for the brave men and women of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who continue to fight, I will walk proudly and be a tribute, a public voice of remembrance, for all those beautiful souls who were stolen from us too soon.""

Other students at campuses across the country told Fox News Digital they are preparing for the worst.

University of Pennsylvania student Noah Rubin said that campus leaders are putting together a vigil for the victims of October 7. But many peers, he said, are preparing for professors and fellow students to ""glorify and eulogize"" Hamas terrorism.

He recalled how last year, an anti-Israel encampment at UPenn shouted, ""They should do it again"" while playing footage of the October 7 terrorist attacks.

Just last week, after Israel eliminated Hezbollah's terror organization leader Hassan Nasrallah, Rubin claimed that students and professors at the school organized a vigil for him and other ""martyrs"" in Lebanon.

""There absolutely should be no place on college campuses to mourn the death of terrorists - and yet that is what we expect will continue on October 7 this year,"" he said.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum revealed to Fox News Digital that Jewish students at schools like Harvard, including Berkeley, Binghamton and the University of California-Los Angeles, have already hired and coordinated significant security operations to protect their October 7 commemorations.

While Berkeley has not released a statement on October 7 in particular, a school spokesperson told Fox News Digital that campus safety and inclusivity were addressed at the start of the semester in a video message from Berkeley's chancellor and UC's systemwide President, Michael Drake.

The spokesperson also told Fox News Digital that the school has been engaged in scenario discussions and planning.

""Student activism is nothing new on the Berkeley campus and we have established processes for planning and preparation,"" he added.

Kestenbaum called the need for security measures at several schools a ""damning indictment on the state of contemporary American higher education.""

""Many Jewish students don't feel safe because they are objectively not safe,"" he said.

For example, he pointed to the University of Pittsburgh, where five physical assaults against Jewish students have occurred in the last month. He also highlighted a recent attack against a Jewish student at the University of Michigan and a physical assault at Harvard Business School.

Columbia University was one of the major schools rocked by protests over the last year. These protests led to more than 200 arrests on campus and an incident in which agitators stormed into and occupied the university's Hamilton Hall for nearly 24 hours.

A Columbia spokesperson sent Fox News Digital a message from Interim President Katrina Armstrong to the campus community about the October 7 anniversary and recent demonstrations that occurred on September 5.

The other schools listed in this story did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment."
Disapproval mounts both at home and abroad as US avoids direct action against Houthi rebels,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/disapproval-mounts-home-abroad-us-avoids-direct-action-against-houthi-rebels,2024-10-04T08:09:52Z,"Fox News senior strategic analyst Ret. Gen. Jack Keane joins 'Fox Report' to discuss the escalating tensions in the Middle East amid fears of a wider war.

While much of the world has eyes on Israel's battles with Hezbollah and Hamas, the U.S. Navy has its sights set on another of Iran's proxies, the Yemeni Houthi rebels.

With a mission to keep international waterways at peace, the Navy now finds itself fending off attacks from the shadowy gang of pirates who have gone from arming themselves with assault rifles, pickup trucks and motorboats - to a seemingly unending supply of drones, missiles and other weaponry.

The Houthis often attack unarmed Western ships carrying goods through the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden - while the U.S. has responded in kind with drone attacks on Yemen.

ISRAELI AIR FORCE STRIKES HOUTHI TARGETS IN YEMEN WITH 'EXTENSIVE' OPERATION

That's led to perilous waters along a trade route that typically sees some $1 trillion in goods pass through it, as well as shipments of aid to war-torn Sudan and the Yemeni people.

And as the attacks continue, some experts argue the U.S. response has not been strong enough to deter the Houthis from inflicting billions of dollars worth of damage to the global economy.

""The U.S. response has been ineffective,"" Can Kasapoglu, a Turkey-based Hudson Institute fellow who specializes in Middle East political-military affairs, told Fox News Digital.

""We have very limited intelligence about [the Houthis] and they are in a different part of the world, in a distant corner of the Middle East. But that corner also happens to be right next to a choke point on global trade... The Houthis are the most daring of the Iranian proxy network. And the U.S. has never gone into a preemptive phase where they target the Houthi leadership.""

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

The U.S. has responded to attacks with air and missile defense efforts, drone and missile interceptions - only engaging the Houthis once an attack is imminent, said Kasapoglu.

""We never saw a high-yield targeted killing campaign by the United States, for instance, Israel killed [Hezbollah leader] Hassan Nasrallah. Or just like Israel went after, for instance, the higher, high-level Iranian Revolutionary Guards generals, so this is what is missing - the U.S. acting against critical leadership.""

In addition to destroying goods destined for the West, the regular Houthi attacks drive up insurance costs: premiums for some shot up tenfold. They force some ships to travel the long way - down around the Horn of Africa, which can add $1 million in fuel costs for a round trip.

""They are launching relatively low-cost weapon systems, and inflicting major economic damage on the West on behalf of Iran. This is a very lucrative business,"" said Kasapoglu.

One argument for restraint could be the cost of action: Houthi drones are estimated to cost a few thousand dollars each. The Naval missiles the U.S. fires back at them can run around $2 million a shot.

Houthi attacks ramped up after Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel, targeting 80 merchant vessels with missiles and drones over the past year.

They've seized one vessel and sunk two and killed a total of four sailors. A U.S.-led series of airstrikes in May killed at least 16 people, the rebels said.

BIDEN ADMIN NEEDS 'MORE AGGRESSIVE' PLAN TO TAKE ON HOUTHIS

On Tuesday, the rebel group claimed it shot down a multimillion-dollar, U.S.-made MQ-9 Reaper drone flying near Yemen. The U.S. acknowledged losing one of the drones, which costs around $30 million apiece.

In January, the Iran-backed militias killed three U.S. service members and injured 40 others in an attack on a U.S. base in Jordan. The U.S. responded forcefully to that attack with a barrage of airstrikes on 85 targets across Iraq and Syria.

""That response proved to be effective, and I think that we could do more of that certainly - take that approach,"" said retired Lt. Gen. Mark Schwartz, former security coordinator of the Israel-Palestinian Authority.

Since the Houthis seized the country's north and its capital of Sanaa in 2014, the U.S. military has seen Reapers shot down in Yemen in 2017, 2019, 2023 and 2024. The U.S. military acknowledged the Houthis shot down two MQ-9s in September.

The Houthis also continue to launch missiles targeting Israel. In response, Israel Defense Forces launched aggressive retaliatory strikes in Yemen's key port city of Hodeida.

The rebels have maintained that they target ships linked to Israel, the U.S. or the U.K. to force an end to Israel's campaign in Gaza against Hamas. But many of the ships they attack have little connection to the conflict - some were even bound for Iran.

BIDEN SAYS HE WOULD NOT BACK ISRAELI STRIKE ON IRAN'S NUCLEAR SITES

Last month, they attacked the Greek-flagged oil tanker Sounion, which was carrying 1 million barrels of oil in the Red Sea.

And last week, Houthi rebels fired half a dozen ballistic missiles, anti-ship cruise missiles and two drones at three U.S. ships traveling through the Bab el-Mandeb Strait. All were intercepted by Navy destroyers, a U.S. official said Friday.

""This gets resolved when we finish our dealings with Iran, whatever that looks like in the long term,"" said Seth Krummrich, a retired Army colonel and former chief of staff at Special Operations Command Central (SOCCENT).

Sources say the U.S. lacks a will to put boots on the ground to fight the Houthis. Central to the Biden administration's global strategy is a concern over escalating tensions that could lead to a full-scale confrontation with Iran - a nation that, by many estimates, is only weeks away from having the capability to build a nuclear bomb.

""The Israelis have the will to fight the Houthis, but they have limited capability, and they're also engaged with two wars going on right now, so it necessitates American intervention if the West really wants to stop them,"" said Kasapoglu.

US FORCES DESTROY HOUTHI WEAPONS

""Avoiding escalation is an obsession right now. It is a psychological case, not a political case. And it is imprisoning American military capabilities.""

Krummrich argued that the Pentagon ""has been staring at the Houthi problem long enough to understand that there is a limit to what you're going to be able to do without putting boots on the ground.""

""That would be like a giant sponge. It can absorb an endless amount of our resources,"" he said. ""But the Houthis are also smart. They launch and then retreat quickly... if they stay outside of our rules of engagement, they will be less likely to be struck.""

But others say there is more to be done that does not amount to ground forces.

""Yemen has proven time and time again that they're willing to absorb a lot of lethal activity from the U.S. and the coalition and still attack vessels, still attack Israel,"" said Schwartz.

""There's this fear of escalation, doing something that's so provocative that we're going to have a broader war. Yemen is at war with the United States from their perspective, right? Just like Lebanese Hezbollah is at war and has been with Israel, and the same with Hamas prior to Oct. 7.""

""We overestimate our concern in terms of a broadening conflict, because at the end of the day, the Houthis in particular, they're not a viable military force,"" Schwartz went on.

""We could be much more aggressive in terms of our military response to the Houthis and find an overwhelming response that falls well short of getting the U.S. mired in some type of major conflict."""
"FIFA to investigate Israel, days after Iran attacks, for alleged discrimination due to Palestinian complaints",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fifa-investigate-israel-alleged-discrimination-after-palestinian-complaints,2024-10-03T22:49:54Z,"Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., says the Biden-Harris administration is ""out of step"" with the conflict in the Middle East.

FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, intends to launch an investigation against the Israel Football Association (IFA) over allegations raised by the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), it announced on Thursday.

FIFA's disciplinary committee will be asked to look into allegations of discrimination as the PFA has accused the IFA of complicity in violations of international law by the Israeli government, discrimination against Arab players and inclusion in its league of clubs located in Palestinian territory.

""The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offense of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,"" FIFA said in a statement. ""FIFA's Governance, Audit and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate... the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.""

Fox News has reached out to the PFA and IFA for comment.

The PFA previously proposed a suspension for Israel over the war in Gaza. The PFA proposal to 211 member federations called for ""appropriate sanctions, with immediate effect, against Israeli teams,"" according to FIFA documents released this year.

The proposal cited ""international law violations committed by the Israeli occupation in Palestine, particularly in Gaza"" and cited FIFA statutory commitments on human rights and against discrimination.

""All the football infrastructure in Gaza has been either destroyed, or seriously damaged, including the historic stadium of Al-Yarmuk,"" the PFA wrote, adding that it had support for the motion from the federations of Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Yemen.

The PFA's proposal was enough to convince FIFA to seek an independent legal council and hold a landmark council meeting to make a decision on whether to suspend Israel from international soccer because of the conflict with Hamas, said FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the FIFA congress in May.

""FIFA will mandate as of now, independent legal expertise to [analyze] the three requests [from the Palestinian FA] and ensure the statutes of FIFA are applied in the right way,"" Infantino said. ""Due to the urgency of the situation, an extraordinary FIFA Council will be convened and will take place before July 20 to review the results of the legal assessment and to take the decisions that are appropriate.""

FIFA said on Thursday that it won't suspend Israel but that the investigation into alleged discrimination will be carried out.

The most recent and prominent example of a country to have its athletes banned from major international sports competition was Russia at the Paris Olympics this summer.

ISRAELI WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAMS FLEE GAME AFTER IRANIAN MISSILE STRIKES

Russia was banned because it had invaded Ukraine just four days after the end of the 2022 Winter Olympics. The International Olympic Committee considered this attack a violation of the Olympic truce, which is a resolution that calls for all nations to lay down arms and not engage in conflict starting one week before the Olympics begin and ending one week after the end. The Russian Olympic Committee lost its appeal against its suspension by the International Olympic Committee in February.

Belarus, which was used as a staging ground for the invasion, was also not allowed to compete in Paris.

However, a total of 32 athletes from Russia and Belarus competed in Paris as neutral participants; 17 previously represented Belarus and 15 represented Russia. They were not allowed to boast their country's flag, but they were able to attend the closing ceremony.

Countries have also been banned from competing in the World Cup in the past, but those nation's players were never allowed to compete as neutrals.

Germany and Japan were banned from the 1950 World Cup after the end of World War II. South Africa was banned from 1966 to 1992 for violating FIFA's anti-discrimination charter due to apartheid. Mexico was even banned for two years after using overage players in qualifiers for the 1989 World Youth Championship.

FIFA's announcement comes the same week that Iran launched a massive missile strike against Israeli cities.

Iran's strikes on Israel forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday.

The barrage of aerial warfare was the first time in Israeli history that the country's densely populated cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - in the center of the biblical nation, faced such potentially devastating attacks. The Israeli military said most of the missiles were intercepted, per the Associated Press.

Iran also warned that a retaliatory strike could warrant further ballistic response.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said during the Asia Cooperation Dialogue summit this week that Israel must not believe it can act with ""impunity,"" according to Reuters.

""Any type of military attack, terrorist act or crossing our red lines will be met with a decisive response by our armed forces,"" said Pezeshkian.

This Monday marks the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas terrorists. Conflict between Israel and surrounding countries in the region since then has led to widespread tensions across the U.S. over concerns of a humanitarian crisis."
Fox News Politics: Jack Smith Strikes Back,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-jack-smith-strikes-back,2024-10-03T21:19:01Z,"Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter, featuring the latest political news from Washington, D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.

A federal judge on Wednesday unsealed a key filing from special counsel Jack Smith's updated election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia Tanya Chutkan unsealed Smith's 165-page filing, in which Smith argues that Trump is not immune from prosecution for his alleged criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results. Smith submitted the document after the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts.

""Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,"" Smith wrote. ""Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit, the government function by which votes are collected and counted -- a function in which the defendant, as President, had no official role."" ...Read more

2 teens detained following explosions near Denmark's Israeli Embassy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/2-teens-detained-explosions-denmarks-israeli-embassy,2024-10-03T20:04:08Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Two Swedish teenagers were jailed Thursday in pre-trial detention in connection with two predawn explosions in the vicinity of the Israeli Embassy in Copenhagen a day earlier. Prosecutors said investigators were establishing ""whether the motive could be a terror attack.""

No one was injured in the blasts on early Wednesday in a neighborhood with several foreign diplomatic missions, though the nearby Jewish school was closed following the explosions.

The pair, who cannot be identified under a court order, were ordered held for 27 days. They faced preliminary charges of possessing illegal weapons and carrying five hand grenades. Two of the grenades blew up when the suspects threw them at a house near the embassy, prosecutor Søren Harbo said.

""This was pretty close to the Israeli Embassy,"" Harbo said before Thursday's court hearing. The explosions caused damage to a roof terrace of a nearby house. The diplomatic mission was not harmed.

EUROPEAN LEADERS WEIGH IN ON 'LEGITIMATE' ISSUE OF ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION: 'MUST BE STOPPED'

Thursday's hearing was held behind closed doors after the preliminary charges were read. Reporting from inside the court room, Danish broadcaster DR said the teenagers, aged 16 and 19, are suspected of acting ""in association and together with prior agreement with one or more perpetrators.""

Both denied the charges, local media reported.

The two suspects were arrested Wednesday shortly before noon on a train at Copenhagen's central station. Danish media ran photos of a man in a white hazmat suit being taken away by police on a train platform at the station. A third suspect, aged 19, who had been arrested near the embassy, has been released, police said Thursday.

In Denmark, the charges are one step short of formal charges and allow authorities to keep criminal suspects in custody during an investigation.

Separately, shots were fired late Tuesday at the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm. No one was injured. No arrests have been made.

The Danish domestic security service, known by its acronym PET, said that ""Swedish authorities have assessed that at least one specific act directed at the Israeli embassy in Stockholm, which was carried out by young criminals in Sweden, has links to Iran.""

In May the Swedish domestic security agency SAPO accused Iran of using established criminal networks in Sweden as a proxy to target Israeli or Jewish people. The announcement came after the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm was sealed off in late January after what was then described as ""a dangerous object"" was found on the grounds of the diplomatic mission. Swedish media said the object was a hand grenade.

In a statement, PET said, ""if we have a state actor who gets young criminals to carry out actions aimed at Jewish targets in our neighboring country, then we can be concerned that this will also happen in Denmark.""

In Stockholm, the operative of Sweden's domestic security agency SAPO, Fredrik Hallström, said ""the latest incident at the Israeli embassy is not classified as a terrorist crime at the moment."" His counterpart at the Swedish police's National Operations Department, Johan Olsson, told the same press conference that the charges were of ""aggravated weapons offenses, causing danger or other serious illegal threats and damage."""
"Yazidi woman held hostage for 10 years in Gaza freed in Israel, US operation",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/yazidi-woman-held-captive-10-years-gaza-freed-israel-us-operation,2024-10-03T16:20:20Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A Yazidi woman held captive by Islamic terrorists for the last decade has been reunited with her family in Iraq following her escape and safe evacuation on Oct. 1 in a coordinated effort between Israeli and U.S. officials, the State Department confirmed to Fox News Digital on Thursday.

Fawzia Amin Sido, now 21, was just 11 years old when she was kidnapped by ISIS terrorists before she was sold and trafficked into Gaza, where she was forced to marry an alleged Hamas fighter.

Amin Sido was apparently able to escape after her captor was killed in what was believed to have been an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) strike, enabling her to flee to a ""hideout"" within the Gaza Strip.

CHILDREN ONCE HELD HOSTAGE STILL WORKING THROUGH TRAUMA: 'ARE THEY COMING FOR US AGAIN?'

""In a complex operation coordinated between Israel, the United States, and other international actors, she was recently rescued in a secret mission from the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing,"" the IDF said in a statement Thursday. ""Upon her entry into Israel, she continued to Jordan through the Allenby Bridge Crossing and from there-returned to her family in Iraq.""

The operation was led by the IDF's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories unit along with help provided by the U.S. Embassy in Israel, as well as other international actors, though the IDF did not detail who.

""Her story is heartbreaking, and we are glad that she will be reunited with her family in Iraq,"" a spokesperson for the State Department told Fox News Digital. ""As Secretary [Antony] Blinken has noted, '2,600 Yezidis remain missing and unaccounted for. We are determined to find them, to learn their fates, and to rescue those who remain alive'.""

The IDF said the coordinated trafficking efforts in Amin Sido's case are ""further evidence of the connection between the terrorist organization Hamas and ISIS.""

WHY NO ISIS MEMBER HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH GENOCIDE OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE FOR CRIMES AGAINST YAZIDIS

ISIS attacked Yazidi populations in the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar in August 2014, abducting some 6,400 people and killing another 1,200, according to a report by the Times of Israel.

Roughly half of the abductees have reportedly been able to escape or have been freed.

The growing ties between ISIS and other terrorist organizations like Hamas signify a growing shift in the Middle East in which extremist groups, despite prior differences, are increasingly expanding ties, often facilitated by the backing of Iran.

The IDF vowed to continue to counter the ""Hamas-ISIS terrorist organization"" by striking terrorist-based infrastructure sites and pledged to ""free all hostages in Hamas captivity.""

There are still 101 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including seven Americans, most of whom were taken during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks, though four of them were abducted in 2014 and 2015.

This figure does not include other Yazidi abductees mentioned by Blinken who may also be being held in Gaza."
"Wisconsin poll shows Harris leading Trump by 4, former president ahead on key issues",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/wisconsin-poll-shows-harris-leading-trump-4-former-president-ahead-key-issues,2024-10-03T11:47:44Z,"Dr. Linda Lee Tarver, a member of Black Americans for Trump, joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss former President Trump's popularity among the Black faith community in Michigan ahead of Election Day.

Vice President Kamala Harris is maintaining her lead over former President Trump in Wisconsin despite Trump leading on the key issues, according to a Wednesday poll.

The new poll from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump in a 52%-48% match-up. The poll also found that voters are deeply invested in the election, with 46% of respondents saying they have stopped talking to someone about politics due to the presidential race.

Marquette conducted the survey from Sept. 18-26, polling 882 Wisconsin registered voters and 798 likely voters. The poll advertises a margin of error of 4.4%.

Despite trailing in the polls, Trump leads Harris in the top issues in the race, including border security, the economy, and handling the Israel-Hamas war.

Trump enjoys a sizable 49-37% lead over Harris on immigration. Meanwhile, 50% of Wisconsinites say he will handle the economy better than Harris, with the vice president getting just 42% support. Trump also enjoys a 45%-33% lead when it comes to Israel's conflict in the Middle East. He also has a narrow lead over Harris when it comes to foreign relations more generally.

Harris does have a lead over Trump in a number of other issues, however, namely abortion and election concerns.

Another 49% said Harris would be better for ensuring a fair and accurate election, compared to Trump's 39%.

Wisconsin is among a handful of swing states that are likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. Other states like Ohio and Pennsylvania are also critical to either a Trump or Harris victory.

Iran's strikes on Israel forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday.

The barrage of aerial warfare was the first time in Israeli history that the country's densely populated cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - in the center of the biblical nation, faced such devastating attacks.

The only fatality from the Iranian barrage was the murder of a Palestinian man in the West Bank (known in Israel by its biblical regional name of Judea and Samaria).

President Biden said Wednesday that he would not support an attack by Israel on Iranian nuclear sites in retaliation for Iran's firing of 181 missiles at Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

""We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but all seven of us [G7 nations] agree that they have a right to respond, but they should respond proportionally,"" he said.

But when asked whether he would back Israel striking Iranian nuclear sites as it has long threatened, Biden told reporters, ""The answer is no.""

Here's the speech Biden should have given to a troubled United Nations,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/speech-biden-should-given-troubled-united-nations,2024-10-03T11:12:27Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In his speech before the United Nations General Assembly last week, President Biden proposed building a ""more effective and more inclusive U.N."" by ""bringing in new voices and new perspectives.""

What he should have said instead is that the U.N. has lost its way, and it will need to be seriously reimagined if it is to remain relevant.

To be sure, the creation of the U.N. system to reconstruct global order after World War II was inspired, and its specialized agencies, such as the Food and Agricultural Organization, have done important work for decades.

Today, however, the U.N. suffers from a fundamental flaw: it gives too much power to revisionist autocracies like China and Russia that want to tear down the U.S.-led global system. Beijing, Moscow and other revisionist authoritarians use their influence in the U.N. to turn the institution against its founding mission.

UN ABDICATES ROLE OF MIDDLE EAST PEACEMAKER BY BACKING TERRORISTS

The list of abuses is long.

Russia chaired a U.N. Security Council meeting on the situation in Ukraine as it was launching an invasion of that country. China continues to prevent the World Health Organization from investigating COVID-19's origins, making a future outbreak more likely.

Russia and China also use their seats in the U.N. Security Council to weaken sanctions efforts against the illegal nuclear programs in North Korea and Iran. The U.N. Human Rights Council includes repressive regimes - such as China - ensuring that these countries escape scrutiny for their barbaric human rights records.

And employees of the U.N. Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) participated in the Oct. 7 attacks against Israel.

These are only the most prominent examples.

END US FUNDING FOR UN AGENCY GIVING IMMUNITY TO ITS MURDEROUS HAMAS MEMBERS

Nevertheless, the proceedings last week demonstrate that many still believe the U.N. remains the best possible forum to bring countries together to address shared global challenges.

This is wishful thinking.

Biden is right when he says we are at an inflection point in history, but we will only rise to this challenge if the United States and its allies can revitalize and adapt multilateral institutions to reflect new realities.

Instead of Biden's platitudes about global cooperation, the next U.S. administration should acknowledge that America's adversaries have transformed the U.N. into another arena for competition between free nations and an axis of revisionist autocracies.

HAMAS LEADER KILLED IN LEBANON WAS UN EMPLOYEE, AGENCY CONFIRMS

They should use speeches at the General Assembly to call out the bad behavior of U.S. adversaries, such as China, Russia, Iran, North Korea and Venezuela, and encourage close allies to join in the condemnation. They should be unrelenting in opposing this axis' threats to their neighbors, their unfair trade practices and their abhorrent human rights abuses.

They should unrelentingly defend U.S. allies, like Israel, from unfair attacks, and acknowledge that the U.N. is becoming even more obsessively antisemitic.

In both 2022 and 2023, the number of U.N. General Assembly resolutions condemning Israel exceeded the combined total of those condemning all other countries. Yet, the body refrained from condemning Hamas after the abhorrent Oct. 7 attack - even after it fired nine UNRWA employees for likely involvement in an act of war.

To counter the U.N.'s capture by cynical autocracies, Washington and its allies should use their diplomatic weight to place U.S. and allied officials in leadership institutions in key U.N. bodies, including the Human Rights Council.

WHY BIDEN'S SPEECH AT UNGA SHOULD SET OFF ALARM BELLS ACROSS THE GLOBE

The United States provides one-third of U.N. funding, giving it enormous potential influence if it is willing to use it. But the U.S. should move from mandatory assessments to voluntary contributions in order to prioritize programs that advance U.S. interests and defund others.

In addition, Washington should advance multilateralism by selectively routing around the U.N. system in favor of institutions that include America's democratic allies and exclude authoritarian regimes such Russia and China. These groupings, like the G-7 and NATO, are often the only places where genuine international cooperation happens today.

Finally, there is no need to cling to the preexisting system. After WWII, there was an explosion of creativity as Washington and its allies invented new bodies from scratch. The world needs a new burst of such innovative thinking now to design the multilateral frameworks necessary to meet contemporary challenges.

Priority should be given to frameworks that bring together U.S. allies in North America, Europe and the Indo-Pacific. NATO, the Quad, AUKUS, IP4 (Australia, Japan, New Zealand and South Korea), and the American-Japanese-Korean trilateral pact are promising steps in this direction.

Last week's U.N. proceedings show that hope for multilateral cooperation remains alive. But to transform that spirit into effective governance, Washington will need to reimagine the U.N. and other global institutions to return them to their founding mission of promoting peace, prosperity and freedom.

Watch: Pro-Israel influencer recovers West Bank interview with Palestinian woman he was threatened to delete,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/pro-israel-influencer-recovers-west-bank-interview-with-palestinian-woman-that-he-was-threatened-to-delete,2024-10-03T09:09:30Z,"Zach Sage Fox traveled to the West Bank to see if Palestinian people truly support the Hamas terror group, but he almost didn't make it out alive.

Comedian and pro-Israel influencer Zach Sage Fox believes an interview he filmed in the West Bank could show Americans how Palestinian civilians truly feel about Jewish people - but it took him months to recover the footage after he was threatened to delete it.

Fox has been on a crusade to educate his followers since the terror attacks of October 7. He went viral earlier this year when his ""Gaza Graduation"" video featured anti-Israel protesters in New York City struggling to correctly answer basic questions about the Israel-Hamas war and decided to take his popular man-on-the-street style interviews to the West Bank, a contentious territory that Palestinians hope to establish as an independent state along with the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.

Fox, a ""loud and proud"" Jewish American, told anyone who asked that he was an Italian American and was able to cross the border into the West Bank without issue, because Israelis and Jewish people are not welcomed in the region.

INFLUENCER WENT TO THE WEST BANK TO SEE IF PALESTINIANS SUPPORT HAMAS - HE ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT ALIVE

Fox found several people walking West Bank streets who were quick to express support for the Hamas terror group and declared Israeli hostages should not be released, but things got dicey when he tried to interview a woman whose hair was fully covered. A ""very upset"" Palestinian man approached him and asked him to delete the footage.

""They're not used to anybody questioning their narrative that they've been brainwashed to believe. And you can see it ... I'm interviewing that girl just for several minutes and these men watching it, they can't even accept that you would be asking questions because it's not a free society,"" Fox told Fox News Digital.

Fox recalled the man yelling ""something about modesty,"" and that females shouldn't speak for all Palestinians. Fox attempted to ignore the man, but he only grew more agitated and started calling additional Palestinian men for support. He explained that he caved and deleted the footage when his Muslim cameraman said the angry group was threatening their lives.

Fox initially enlisted a team of IT specialists who were able to recover some of the footage, and every interview that was salvaged made the viral ""Wild West Bank"" video. But his conversation with the woman who sparked the conversation remained lost.

""Dozens of cyberhackers,"" additional IT specialists and even an Israel Defense Forces veteran with a passion for technology all tried unsuccessfully to restore the video. Fox was beginning to lose hope, but was eager to show the world what this woman had to say because she was ""emblematic of the mindset"" in the region.

She was ""clearly educated"" and spoke perfect English, dressed in designer clothes and said she was an engineer. Yet, she believed all Zionist should be killed.

FOX NEWS MEDIA DRAWS 10.4 MILLION FOR SIMULCAST OF THE CBS VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Another technology expert caught wind of the story and offered to help recover the video. Fox thought it was impossible and was reluctant to set himself up for further disappointment but eventually said ""f -- k it"" and gave them a shot.

""A week later I got a call that they recovered almost all of it. It was a miracle,"" Fox said.

Fox then watched the footage and ""couldn't believe his eyes.""

""To see that interview back after three months was insane... I didn't know when my cameraman stopped filming, so I didn't realize, one, that you could see the men starting to pull the other men in the into the thing. I didn't realize you could see that behind me,"" he said.

""I also didn't realize that my cameraman kept the camera going long enough so that you actually saw the people cut the camera off and stop the shoot,"" Fox added. ""So, that was like wild to me.""

Fox then published ""Wild West Bank: Deleted Scenes Exploded,"" allowing the world to see the footage the angry Palestinian men tried to scrub.

VIRAL INFLUENCER ZACH SAGE FOX PUT SPOTLIGHT ON CLUELESS ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS: 'NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING'

In the shocking video, the woman told him that most Palestinians support Hamas, she proudly declared being ""really satisfied"" with footage Hamas terrorists took on Oct. 7. She also denied Hamas killed babies and women during the attack and said no Israelis are ""innocent civilians."" She suggested she is a ""refugee"" despite her family living in the West Bank for multiple generations and flatly dismissed a two-state solution. Along the way, Fox politely pushed back on antisemitic claims and absurd talking points.

""I am an educated person, it's either us or us,"" she said when suggesting Jewish people need to leave Israel for good. When Fox told her there would ""never be peace"" with that mindset, she fired back, ""It's their problem.""

As a man began lurking in the background, Fox asked if she believes Zionists deserve to die.

""Cut, cut real quick,"" the man said. ""What side are you on?""

Fox calmly responded that he was simply asking questions, but the man demanded to know where he was from.

""I'm from the states,"" Fox answered as the man demanded the cameraman stop recording.

The video abruptly cuts off.

NETANYAHU RESPONDS TO HEZBOLLAH ATTACK THAT KILLED CHILDREN AT SOCCER FIELD: 'THIS WILL NOT GO UNANSWERED

Fox feels ""vindicated"" that he was able to share the footage.

""I just think this girl is really representative of how these people think,"" Fox said.

""I feel bad for her, I know that sounds crazy cause she's literally sitting there saying everyone who I love deserves to die,"" he continued. ""But my takeaway is that she's the perfect example of somebody who's not stupid. She's an engineer, she's a smart girl, but she's been brainwashed by the propaganda they're taught in Palestine.""

Earlier this year, the Department of State urged Americans to avoid the West Bank because of ""terrorism and civil unrest.""

Fox remains one of the only Americans to enter the West Bank and try to ask tough questions, but he doesn't believe State Department warnings are the thing keeping America journalists out of the region.

""I genuinely think that they know deep down, whether they want to admit it or not, that they would find... it totally negates their narrative, which is that, you know, 'Hamas is bad, but the Palestinians are separate,'"" Fox said.

""I wish that was the case. I truthfully didn't believe it myself until I went there that day,"" he added. ""They love Hamas."""
MORNING GLORY: The VP debate is an example of Kamala Harris's horrible judgment when it comes to picking staff,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-vp-debate-example-kamala-harriss-horrible-judgment-when-comes-picking-staff,2024-10-03T09:09:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The debate between the candidates for vice president -- GOP nominee Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz -- was dominated by Vance, and all but a handful of hardened partisan pundits agree on that conclusion.

Walz wobbled and panicked from the first question -- which everyone in the world knew would be about Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier in the day. Yet Walz still fumbled his response, and it got worse from there until the CBS moderators invoked the unwritten mercy rule for left-wing moderators watching the Democrat melt and tossed Walz some softballs on J6 at the debate's close, by which time the internet was howling and laughing at the Minnesota governor.

There were three important takeaways:

NEW YORK POST CALLS OUT CBS FOR 'RIDICULOUS' FACT-CHECK OF JD VANCE: 'SHAMEFUL MOMENT'

First, Vance is a superb and calm debater and a reassuring figure on the national stage.

Second, Walz is not, and he represents the one big decision Vice President Kamala Harris has had to make since President Joe Biden dropped out. It was a terrible decision. Imagine her Cabinet and White House staff if somehow, she wins.

Third, legacy media is irretrievably broken and cannot be reclaimed from its lurch into rote leftism and extreme partisanship, or even pulled back to a minimum level of seriousness on big occasions.

Do executives at these networks -- ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC -- not see what has happened? Americans don't trust the news divisions at the legacy networks. It's as if those divisions are run by a combination of fresh-from-campus-demonstration interns and hardened partisans from the Obama years.

The CBS debate was not, however, as overtly biased against Vance as ABC's earlier debate was against Trump, but it was still very, very biased against the center-right and conservative audience. Viewers saw the question set veer quickly from a world crisis and the border crisis to get to the left's favorite issue of abortion.

With the world tuning in only hours after Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, the moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan did open with an obligatory round of questions on that crisis. But, after 10 minutes, they plowed on to a quick exchange on immigration and the Biden-Harris massive fail on the relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene's savaging of North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia in order to get to ... abortion, which had been discussed at length in the ABC debate and about which there are zero mysteries.

Three rounds of questions on abortion, really? And three rounds marked by the rote framing favored by the hard left? Predictable but still shocking.

The debate ended in a morass of childcare questions and then the obligatory ""Wasn't January 6th terrible?"" questions.

What a farce. Not one question on China's vast military build-up and its threat against Taiwan and the Philippines. Not one question on the Chinese Communist Party spies shot through our country, including the office of New York's current and past governor. Not one question on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Yes, there was a quick dash through the consequences of more than 10 million illegal immigrants flowing across the southern border under the Biden-Harris regime, but also a quick cut-off when Vance began what was an obviously embarrassing factcheck of the CBS factcheck on the ""legal status"" of the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio. ""We have a lot to get to,"" was the trigger for cutting off anything uncomfortable.

Walz was asked about his lying about his trips to China -- sort of. It was left hanging. A knuckleheaded answer for a knuckleheaded team of debate organizers. Chinese President Xi Jinping is a sort of Voldemort for the networks -- never to be named -- perhaps because ABC and CBS all have corporate ties to companies that must do business there?

Look, whatever votes were moved by the debate moved toward the GOP because Vance hammered that the costs of everything from food to gas skyrocketed under Biden-Harris, gave a quick tutorial on why construction costs have soared and thus the price of houses, and repeatedly reminded the audience of Harris's failure in her job as ""border czar,"" while also stressing the need for more domestic energy production. Tim Walz provided comic relief.

The loser wasn't just Walz though. It was also CBS, which joined ABC in a legacy media hall of shame. When we get back to debates in four years, the good news is the ""debate commission"" is already dead and that, by 2028, the idea of the big networks hosting debates unchecked by center-right moderators will be as well. The candidates will call on C-SPAN and find some fair moderators. Siri could have done a better job in our past two debates this year.

What has to be dawning in the C Suites of networks -- if they are at all self-aware -- is that their product and their talent are awful, and their audiences have already left or will soon leave. Tuesday night was just the most recent example of why."

""I can't stand religion,"" Gifford told Fox News Digital. ""Religion puts people in chains. And Jesus comes to set us free.

""What do you want? You want to go someplace and sit in the same pew week after week after week and hear the same stuff that doesn't change your life at all. Or do you want to walk with a living creator of all things who loves you and has a plan for your life and only, only, only longs for you to have fellowship with Him? That's the only thing I'm interested in.""

Gifford has leaned on her faith and relationship with God in the toughest of times, saying, ""I could have never made it"" without it.

""I'd be in an insane asylum without Jesus,"" she said. ""I've been through a lot of crappy stuff in my life. I've been blessed beyond belief as well. But I've had a lot of things that ended up being very public too, that would have put me away for a long time and done a lot of damage to my family, to my everything.

""I was already holding Jesus' his hand. When you go through the kinds of things that I went through in the last, you know, 20 years, you just cling. You just cling tighter. You're already there. You already have them. And I know people always talk about, you know, people coming to God in a foxhole. Fine. Whenever you come to God, it's a good thing. The better thing is to come to know him early in your life and then cling to him for their whole life.""

""Religion puts people in chains. And Jesus comes to set us free.""

-- Kathie Lee Gifford

The 71-year-old has long been a student of the Bible, even missing her high school prom and graduation to travel to Israel for a conference on biblical prophecy.

""I'm far more annoying now because I've learned so much,"" she joked.

KATHIE LEE GIFFORD, NOW IN HER 'DREAM JOB,' BRINGS THE BIBLE TO LIFE THROUGH MUSIC IN 'THE WAY'

But studying was important to her.

""There are so many terrible translations of the Bible. And if you're studying a terrible translation, you're not going to learn anything that's going to build you up in your faith or give you power in your life. And so many of the churches around are -- that's what they're doing. They live on it. You can't grow unless you feast. And then the scripture talks about how my people perish for lack of knowledge. And I was perishing.""

Gifford focused on Greek and Hebrew teachings, which led her to the stories of King Herod, the focus of her recent book, ""Herod and Mary: The True Story of the Tyrant King and the Mother of the Risen Savior.""

""I learned so much about Herod that I came back, and I said to my son, I said, 'Cody, get me every book there is on Herod,'"" she recalled. ""If Jesus is the greatest story ever told, Herod is one of the greatest stories never, ever told.""

Cody encouraged his mother to write the story, which she originally conceived as a film, and helped her find a co-writer, Dr. Bryan M. Litfin, who has a Ph.D. in ancient Christianity from the University of Virginia.

The former ""Today"" host said the story is ultimately a thriller, based on the idea that ""evil has always been there.""

""What I sense in the world today is a far greater presence of is fear,"" she continued. ""People are terrified now. Even people that have a lot of money and live in beautiful homes behind huge gates and have people with guns protecting them are afraid.

But diving deep into Biblical studies doesn't just offer comfort. There's some entertainment in it too.

""The Bible's filled with incredible stories of drama and betrayal and, you know, bestiality, whatever you want. The Bible's got it. People just don't read it.

""We footnote every place in the story where we got it from a different place than scripture. We didn't make up anything. We just tried to base it truly on what stands up in church history. So, people could say, 'Well, it's not the Bible.' We didn't say it was, you know? Do you want a good story or what?""

The former ""Today"" host also recorded the audiobook edition of ""Herod and Mary"" just days before she had surgery on her hip.

Unfortunately, during her recovery, she also fell and fractured her pelvis falling down stairs ""because I was stupid.""

""I thought I was stronger than I was,"" Gifford explained, recalling that she moved ""300 books for a couple of hours"" to prepare for a signing nearby. Then, the next day, a friend was picking her up, and when she rushed to meet her, she fell and broke her pelvis in two places.

Gifford underwent physical therapy after eight days in the hospital and was walking and putting weight on her leg faster than expected.

A short time after that, she spoke with her doctor, who she described as ""a devout man of God,"" asking him why she wasn't feeling the ""excruciating pain"" typically associated with that kind of injury even though she wasn't even using painkillers.

Biden says he would not back Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-he-would-not-back-israeli-strike-irans-nuclear-sites,2024-10-03T01:06:58Z,"President Biden said Wednesday that he would not support an attack by Israel on Iranian nuclear sites in retaliation for Iran's firing of 181 missiles at Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

On Wednesday, a day after the massive attack and after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran would pay for the attack, Biden briefly spoke with reporters before boarding Air Force One.

He said all the leaders on a recent call - France, Canada, Japan, Britain, Italy and Germany - agreed that Israel had the right to ""proportionally"" respond to Iran's military strike.

""We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but all seven of us [G7 nations] agree that they have a right to respond, but they should respond proportionally,"" he said.

But when asked whether he would back Israel striking Iranian nuclear sites as it has long threatened, Biden told reporters, ""The answer is no.""

Biden said more sanctions would be imposed on Iran and that he would speak with Netanyahu soon.

""Obviously, Iran is way off course,"" he said.

Iran's missile attack escalated tensions in the region, where the Biden administration has for months led negotiations on a cease-fire in the nearly year-old Israel-Hamas war.

ISRAEL'S 'SWORN ENEMY' HEZBOLLAH TELLS IRAN IT WOULD FIGHT ALONE IF CONFLICT ESCALATES

The recent assault on Israel follows the Biden administration souring on the prospects of an end to the war between Israel and Hamas.

""We aren't any closer to that now than we were even a week ago,"" National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby previously told reporters. He called the prospects of a completed deal ""daunting.""

""No deal is imminent,"" one U.S. official told the Wall Street Journal. ""I'm not sure it ever gets done.""

During Tuesday's vice presidential debate with Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Democrat nominee Vice President Harris' ""steady leadership"" in the region is necessary.

""What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership. We've seen a calmness that is able to be able to draw on the coalitions, to bring them together, understanding that our allies matter. When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed,"" he said.

""And as the vice president said today, we will protect our forces and our allied forces, and there will be consequences,"" he said.

Vance voiced support for GOP nominee former President Trump's ""peace through strength"" policy toward Israel.

""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you need peace through strength,"" Vance said. ""They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

Vance said it is ""up to Israel"" how they choose to respond.

""Now, you asked about a preemptive strike, Margaret, and I want to answer the question,"" he said during the debate. ""Look, it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe,"" he said. ""And we should support our allies wherever they are when they're fighting the bad guys. I think that's the right approach to take with the Israel question.""

Florida Republican launches post-Helene rescue mission in North Carolina: 'Defined by We the People',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/florida-republican-launches-post-helene-rescue-mission-north-carolina-defined-we-people,2024-10-02T20:48:47Z,"Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., took matters into his own hands to help people on the ground who have been impacted by Hurricane Helene in North Carolina.

Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., took matters into his own hands and launched a rescue mission in North Carolina this week with other good Samaritans, providing crucial assistance to victims of Hurricane Helene and delivering essential supplies to those affected by the disaster.

""It makes sense that Americans come together in times of grief and strife and difficulty, and I don't think that's ever really changed,"" Mills, an Army combat veteran, told Fox News Digital in an interview. ""I mean, we're not defined by the federal government, we're defined by 'We the People.'""

This isn't the first time Mills has taken on a rescue mission. In addition to providing relief to Israelis after Oct. 7, he also provided support during Hurricanes Nicole and Ian in his own district and rescued 23 Americans along with 59 mentally and physically disabled children in Haiti. He also conducted one of the first successful overland rescues during the Afghanistan withdrawal, totaling around two to three dozen rescues in that region in 2021 alone.

RESCUE MISSIONS UNDERWAY IN NORTH CAROLINA AFTER HURRICANE HELENE BRINGS 'HISTORIC' FLOODING, LANDSLIDES

""The federal government, with its bureaucracy, moves too slow for the pace in which emergencies and often chaos actually moves,"" Mills said. ""And so, I think that it's good that since Afghanistan and the failed botched withdrawal in 2021 you've seen a larger group of civilians who are coming together, a lot of which are former military or law enforcement, to pick up a slack and help as needed.""

Mills partnered with a private helicopter company, Mercury One, to deliver food, water, diapers, non-perishables, insulin medication and oxygen since Monday. According to Mills, he and a small group have already delivered thousands of pounds of supplies in the region's hardest hit areas.

The congressman used two helicopters and also helped orchestrate search and rescues in Bernardsville, Poplar, Burnsville and the surrounding areas. He did a hoist operation of an elderly man on Tuesday, a spokesperson told Fox News Digital.

THOSE SUFFERING FROM HURRICANE HELENE'S IMPACT GET HELP FROM REV. FRANKLIN GRAHAM AND SAMARITAN'S PURSE

""Anytime there's any type of devastation or Americans that are in jeopardy, obviously it's, it's piqued my attention, and we need to be able to do a response to that in some way,"" Mills said. ""I feel like, as an elected official sort of like a responsibility to try and do what I can to help the American people, regardless if you live in Florida's 7th District or anywhere in the country.""

By partnering with some local response teams on the ground, Mills said he and his group mapped out a couple of different areas to target to bring much needed aid to those who are coming up on day five without essentials, including cell service.

Rescue teams have also been deployed to parts of eastern Tennessee, South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia and Florida - areas that were also devastated by the storm.

Hundreds of thousands more remain without power and cell service, which has led to delays in locals getting help and trying to get in touch with loved ones affected by the hurricane.

Helene's death toll for North Carolina and Tennessee is unknown as authorities continue to respond and get in touch with families before publicizing official numbers, but the lack of data roaming and cellphone service is making that difficult.

(Credit: U.S. Navy)

The U.S. Navy has released video showing the fiery launch of ballistic missile interceptors from two guided-missile destroyers in the Eastern Mediterranean to defend Israel from an Iranian missile barrage on Tuesday.

The USS Cole and USS Bulkeley fired about a dozen interceptors as Iran bombarded Israel with nearly 200 ballistic missiles in the regime's latest attack on the Jewish State, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Pat Ryder told reporters Tuesday.

""You don't launch that many missiles at a target without the intent on hitting something,"" Ryder said.

Capt. Bill Urban, lead spokesman for U.S. Naval Forces Europe/Africa, told Fox News in a statement on Wednesday that ""multiple"" Iranian missiles were believed to have been ""successfully engaged.""

US READINESS PLAYS 'SIGNIFICANT' ROLE IN FENDING OFF IRANIAN ATTACK ON ISRAEL

Both destroyers, which were stationed in the Eastern Mediterranean ahead of the Iranian barrage, are equipped with the aegis weapons system designed for ballistic missile defense, Urban said.

Three U.S. guided-missile destroyers have been positioned off the Eastern Mediterranean to help defend Israel, including the USS Arleigh Burke, USS Bulkeley and USS Cole.

In April, during the last major attack that Iran levied at Israel when it fired more than 300 drones and missiles, the USS Arleigh Burke and the USS Carney shot down more than 81 attack drones and at least six ballistic missiles using guided-missile destroyers.

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES ACROSS ISRAEL

U.S. Central Command has about twice as many aircraft, ships and missile defense systems in the region than it did in April. Additional air squadrons and air support crews deployed to the region on Tuesday arrived Wednesday while others are still en route, a U.S. defense official told Fox News.

As the Iranian attack against Israel unfolded on Tuesday, a U.S. defense official told Fox News in a statement: ""[In] accordance with our ironclad commitment to Israel's security, U.S. forces in the region are currently defending against Iranian-launched missiles targeting Israel.""

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) met on Wednesday following Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel, but overshadowing the meeting was Israel's announcement that it had banned the U.N. secretary-general due to his failure to condemn Iran.

""Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel does not deserve to step foot on Israeli soil,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said about the decision to declare U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as persona non grata.

""This is an anti-Israel secretary-general who lends support to terrorists, rapists and murderers,"" Katz argued. ""Guterres will be remembered as a stain on the history of the U.N. for generations to come.""

Iran on Tuesday fired over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel after the death of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah and after the Israel Defense Forces began focused incursions into Lebanon to hit the terrorist group.

ISRAEL URGES UN TO CONDEMN IRAN AFTER LATESTS ATTACKS

Guterres on Tuesday issued a brief statement following Iran's attack, calling it the ""latest attacks in the Middle East"" and broadly condemned the conflict as ""escalation after escalation.""

He also slammed Israel for its actions in Gaza and the West Bank, claiming that Israel has ""conducted in Gaza the most deadly and destructive military campaign in my years.""

""The suffering endured by the Palestinian people in Gaza is beyond imagination,"" Guterres said. ""At the same time, the situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, continues to deteriorate, with Israeli military operations.""

""Construction of settlements, evictions, land grabs and the intensification of settler attacks progressively undermine any possibility of a two-state solution, and simultaneously, armed Palestinian groups have also used violence,"" he said.

HAMAS LEADER KILLED IN LEBANON WAS UN EMPLOYEE, AGENCY CONFIRMS

Israel blasted Guterres for failing to ""unequivocally"" condemn Iran's attack or even name Iran while discussing the attack. Israel responded with the persona non grata declaration, effectively banning him from entering its borders.

""Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel, as nearly all the countries of the world have done, does not deserve to set foot on Israeli soil,"" Katz said.

""This is a secretary-general who has yet to denounce the massacre and sexual atrocities committed by Hamas murderers on Oct. 7 and has not led any resolutions to declare them a terrorist organization,"" Katz continued.

""A secretary-general who provides support to the terrorists, rapists and murderers of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and now Iran, the mothership of global terror, will be remembered as a stain on the history of the U.N. for generations to come,"" he added. ""Israel will continue to defend its citizens and uphold its national dignity, with or without António Guterres.""

BBC NEWS SPURS OUTRAGE AFTER COMMENTATOR DEFENDS HEZBOLLAH, IRAN: 'OPENLY PRO-TERRORIST'

And while it took nearly a day following the attacks to condemn Iran, Guterres seemed to get the message, telling council members: ""As I did in relation to the Iranian attack in April - and as should have been obvious yesterday in the context of the condemnation I expressed - I again strongly condemn yesterday's massive missile attack by Iran on Israel.""

Israel's decision to ban Guterres prompted anger from Algeria, which first expressed ""sincere gratitude... solidarity, admiration and support for the secretary-general.""

""This decision reflects a clear disdain of the U.N. system and the entire international community,"" the representative from Algeria said. ""For the Israeli authorities, no narrative nor truth exists except their own.""

However, some permanent members of the council expressed clear support for Israel and condemned Iran for the attack while urging Tehran to cease its support for terrorism through its proxy forces.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield ""unequivocally"" condemned Iran's attack and called for further sanctions against Tehran. She also explicitly tied Iran to the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, arguing that ""Iran was complicit... through its funding, training, capabilities and support for the military wing of Hamas.""

ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS REGULAR INFANTRY, ARMORED UNITS JOINING LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN SOUTHERN LEBANON

""After Hamas's horrific attack carried out nearly a year ago today, the United States sent a clear message to Iran: Don't exploit the situation in ways that would risk propelling the region into a broader war,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

""The IRGC flagrantly and repeatedly ignored this warning by encouraging and enabling the Houthis in Yemen to disrupt global shipping and launch attacks against Israel by supporting militant groups in Syria and Iraq,"" she continued.

""Iran's stated intention was to avenge the deaths of two IRGC-supported terrorist leaders and an IRGC commander by inflicting significant damage and death in Israel,"" she added. ""Thankfully, and through close coordination between the United States and Israel, Iran failed to achieve its objectives.""

""This outcome does not diminish the fact that this attack, intended to cause significant death and destruction, marked a significant escalation by Iran,"" she stressed.

The United Kingdom also condemned Iran's attack and expressed ""full support"" for Israel ""in exercising its right to defend itself against Iranian aggression.""

France urged Iran to ""abstain from any action that could lead to additional destabilization,"" going further to condemn the ""attack that targeted civilians in Jaffa.""

""Civilian populations are the first victims of this horrible situation,"" the French representative said. ""The situation is serious.""

Iran ultimately pleaded its case before the council, arguing that the Security Council has ""remained paralyzed due to the United States obstruction"" and accused permanent members France and the United Kingdom of acing as ""serious enablers"" of Israel who ""attempt to justify Israeli heinous crimes under the guise of self-defense, shifting the blame onto Iran."""

""It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring,"" used to just be a nursery rhyme. Today it is the frightening reality of our lack of leadership in the White House, as President Joe Biden old-man shuffles his way to the end of his misbegotten and only term as president.

On Wednesday, October 2, Biden is finally set to visit the site of devastation in North Carolina wrought by Hurricane Helene, even if he has to skip a nap or two. This comes amid real concerns that the federal response is lackluster and insufficient.

Then there is the ongoing war in the Middle East, which on Tuesday, October 1, saw Iran launch the largest ballistic missile attack in human history against Israel. This, despite the fact that, on several occasions when Biden seemed half cogent, he warned the mullahs by sternly saying, ""Don't""

BIDEN HAS 'PRIVATELY COMPLAINED' ABOUT HOW QUICKLY DEMOCRATS HAVE MOVED ON FROM HIM: REPORT

Well, they did anyway. And while, thankfully, owing to the military might of Israel and America, the Iranian onslaught carried all the devastation of a Nerf gun fight, it was still a slap in the face of our feckless president.

As if those two disasters weren't enough, this same week has also seen the International Longshoremen's Association go on strike from Maine to Texas, shutting down the supply line for everything from batteries to bananas, despite Biden's claim that a deal would be worked out.

Of all these crises, these latter may be the most devastating to Scranton Joe because it is something that, in his prime, Biden would have been able to clean up faster than a Swiffer.

There are only a handful of people alive who have the deep, long-lasting relationship and trust with organized labor that Biden has developed over the last 50 years. At one time, he was absolutely the man for this job. Today, he is simply absent.

This is why president by committee doesn't work. Longshoremen might have trusted Biden; they do not trust the faceless deep state blob that rules us today.

Americans know they currently have no functioning president, and have for some time. In August, Sam, a restaurateur in San Francisco told me, ""I don't know who's running the country, but it's not him."" In Virginia, Sarah, a Democrat, simply said, ""It's sad, but he's just gone.""

To be blunt, this situation is incredibly dangerous. We heard almost nothing from our president as Iran attempted to start World War III. Instead, we saw National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at the White House podium, the very man whose incompetence helped light the match of this conflagration.

You remember Sullivan, he was the guy who said days before the barbaric Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, that the Middle East was quieter than it had been in two decades.

Amazingly, Sullivan, who shouldn't even be managing a Dairy Queen, much less American foreign policy, still has his job. And why? Because he doesn't have a boss. Nobody in the administration does. I'm not convinced Biden can recognize Jake Sullivan, much less fire him.

It really is a fine mess the Democrats have gotten us into. The president is incapable of fulfilling his duties, and his vice president is now running for president. And by running, I mean as far away from Grandpa Joe as she can get.

In a sane world, our senile commander in chief would step down, and Vice President Kamala Harris would take the reins. But that can't happen because, if it did, she would suddenly be responsible for the haywire state of world and domestic affairs and might actually have to do a serious interview or two.

For all intents and purposes, the United States of America has no president. But what we do have is a host of crisis-level situations at home and abroad that are not being competently addressed.

There are only a handful of people alive who have the deep, long-lasting relationship and trust with organized labor that Biden has developed over the last 50 years. At one time, he was absolutely the man for this job. Today, he is simply absent.

IDF Arabic spokesperson Avichay Adraee warned residents of two dozen communities in southern Lebanon to evacuate Wednesday for their own safety.

IRAN'S ATTACK ON ISRAEL 'INEFFECTIVE' BUT A 'SIGNIFICANT ESCALATION,' WHITE HOUSE SAYS

""Hezbollah's activities are forcing the IDF to act forcefully against it. The IDF does not intend to harm you, and therefore, for your safety, you must evacuate your homes immediately and head north of the Awali River. Save your lives,"" he said on X.

""Anyone who is near Hezbollah members, installations, and combat equipment is putting his life at risk. Any home used by Hezbollah for its military needs is expected to be targeted,"" Adraee also said.

The Israeli military operation inside Lebanon comes after airstrikes last week killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other top members.

The IDF says so far, more than 150 ""terrorist infrastructure sites"" have been destroyed in Lebanon, including Hezbollah weapon storage facilities and rocket launchers.

Trump says Walz 'embarrassed himself' compared to Vance's 'brilliance' at VP debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-says-walz-embarrassed-himself-compared-vances-brilliance-vp-debate,2024-10-02T16:05:42Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Former President Trump said Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz ""embarrassed himself"" during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, while Sen. JD Vance's steady presentation ""reconfirmed"" his choice to make the senator from Ohio his running mate.

Trump spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital on Wednesday morning, hours after Vance, R-Ohio, and Walz faced off in the CBS News vice presidential debate in New York City. The two sparred on issues like foreign policy, border security, abortion and climate change, while introducing themselves and their records to the American people.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""JD was fantastic last night -- it just reconfirmed my choice,"" Trump told Fox News Digital. ""There was a brilliance to what he did.""

""On the other hand, Tim Walz proved to be a man that doesn't have it in any way shape or form for the office that he is seeking, though I would put him a large number of steps above Kamala,"" Trump said.

The former president and Republican presidential nominee said Walz ""embarrassed himself and the Democrat Party last night but was made to look even worse by JD's brilliant performance.""

""This is what the country needs; smart people, not people that can't put two sentences together,"" Trump said. ""We have to take our country back.""

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs. Tuesday began with nearly 50,000 unionized dockworkers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a rough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said, ""It is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe. And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys.""

Walz fired back. He slammed the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" adding Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last 3½ years? And the answer is, your running mate, not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, saying he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves, ""When was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border, a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no, told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking. Some of them, hopefully, are at homes with their families.

""Some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris' wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, 'You know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies.' I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they, frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now."""
Will Netanyahu 'take the fight directly to Iran' after massive missile strike across Israel?,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-weighs-israeli-response-irans-massive-missile-attack-amid-fears-all-out-war,2024-10-02T15:11:46Z,"JERUSALEM -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the heads of the country's security establishment on Wednesday following Iran's firing of 181 missiles into Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

Fox News Digital spoke to military and Iran experts about the growing chance of a wider confrontation between the Jewish state and the clerical regime in Tehran breaking out.

""After the Iranian missile attack against Israel there is no questioning anymore the basic understanding that Iran is the greatest generator of terror and death in the Middle East. Until now, Israel has been playing a whack-a-mole game with Iran's proxies - fighting Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and others,"" Yaakov Katz, the author of ""Shadow Strike: Inside Israel's Secret Mission to Eliminate Syrian Nuclear Power,"" told Fox News Digital.

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER TELLS US ONLY 'MILITARY ACTION' CAN RETURN PEOPLE TO HOMES AMID HEZBOLLAH THREAT

Katz, who is a senior fellow at the global think tank Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI), added, ""With Iran again attacking Israel directly, the time has come to take the fight directly to Iran. The ayatollahs there need to be made to pay a price.""

The headline by military analyst Amos Harel in the left-wing Haaretz paper read on Wednesday: ""After an unprecedented Iranian attack, we are in a regional war.""

The Islamic republic has been recognized as the center of Mideast volatility, terrorism and jingoism for decades. In 2010, Saudi Arabian King Abdullah told the United States to ""cut off the head of the snake"" by launching military strikes to eradicate Iran's reported nuclear weapons facilities.

Iran's strikes on Israel forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday. The barrage of aerial warfare was the first time in Israeli history that the country's densely populated cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - in the center of the biblical nation, faced such devastating attacks. The Israelis did not panic and stayed relatively calm under the pressure of the largely surprise attack.

The only fatality from the Iranian barrage was the murder of a Palestinian man in the West Bank (known in Israel by its biblical regional name of Judea and Samaria).

""Tonight Iran attempted to kill thousands of Israeli men, women and children but thanks to our miraculous defense system Iran failed miserably. Tehran is hurting after seeing its proxies in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen get crushed by Israel. Tehran made a huge mistake tonight and will pay a heavy price at the time and place of our choosing,"" Lt. Col. Yoni Chetboun, former deputy speaker of the Knesset and an IDF special forces operator in reserves, told Fox News Digital.

IRAN'S 'NUCLEAR ENERGY MOUNTAIN' IS 'FULLY SAFE' AFTER ISRAELI STRIKE: STATE MEDIA

Chetboun was a decorated special forces operator from the second Lebanon war, when Israel fought the Iran-backed terrorist movement Hezbollah in 2006.

Prior to Iran's military strike on Israel in April, Fox News Digital reported that the Biden-Harris administration released billions in sanctions relief to Iran that will flow into its proxies' war machines, according to experts.

The topic of funneling billions to Iran's regime surfaced during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday. Republican Sen. JD Vance said, ""Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration.

""What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies. And God forbid, launching against the United States as well.""

BIDEN ADMIN UNDER PRESSURE TO STOP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SANCTIONS RELIEF TO IRAN

Lisa Daftari, an expert on Iran, said, ""The conflict between the Iran regime and Israel did not commence today, in April, or on Oct. 7 of the previous year. Its origins trace back to 1979, when the mullahs ascended to power, promulgating a doctrine that demonized the 'Great Satan,' a term for the United States, and the 'Little Satan,' referring to Israel.

""Over the past 45 years, the Iran regime has persistently targeted American and Israeli interests, orchestrating terror proxies to execute its strategic objectives against both nations. More recently, U.S. policies that have enriched the mullahs have facilitated billions of dollars on establishing a formidable encirclement around Israel, via the regime's various proxies in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza and the West Bank.""

In April, Iran's regime launched a sprawling aerial attack, with over 300 suicide drones and missiles, on Israel. Jerusalem countered the Iranian swarm of missiles with a targeted strike against military installations in the Iranian province of Isfahan.

Daftari, editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk news website, added, ""Israel's recent military actions signal a departure from the more restrained posture observed in April, when the nation's defense capabilities against missile threats were deemed a victory. The recent strategic strikes in Lebanon underscore Israel's heightened efforts to neutralize enduring existential threats.""

She noted that it historically has engaged in tit-for-tat-like responses but noted, ""Israel is now poised to take decisive measures aimed at neutralizing this looming risk, with its focus now entirely on the regime in Tehran.""

NETANYAHU CALLS MIDEAST CONFLICTS CHOICE BETWEEN 'BLESSING OR A CURSE,' WARNS ABOUT ISRAEL'S 'LONG ARM'

David Wurmser, a former senior adviser for nonproliferation and Middle East strategy for former Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital, ""This is a war between Israel and Iran which began as a direct war on April 14. The war is a twilight struggle between a nation run by a tyranny that seeks to extinguish the other. Either Iran or Israel, but not both, will emerge from this war not only as victor but survivor.""

He said the so-called ""ring of fire that Iran built around Israel not only had an aggressive aim - to choke Israel to death by initiating a violent war of attrition and isolation, including closing ports and ending international airlines' flying to Israel - but also acted as a defensive deterrent against Israel, shielding Iran from any potential Israeli proactive action against Iran. With the destruction of Hezbollah, the strategic linchpin of the proxy network at the center of that ring of fire, as the greatest threat Israel faces, Iran was left fully exposed to the full weight of Israeli power.""

He echoed the strong language of Israel's military and political leadership, which ""promised to inflict severe pain on the regime of the Iran's supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Ali Khamenei... Iran will surely now feel the vulnerability as the Israelis without fear any more of Hezbollah or Iran will take the war from the defensive to the offensive against Iran's regime, "" said Wurmser.

He added ""The mistake Iran made, as do its proxies and its minions in the West protesting on campuses, is not that they underestimate Israel's capabilities and its unity, but that they internalized their own ideology that Israel is a fake, fragile colonial entity rather than a deeply rooted civilization. Israel has shown that despite its mistakes and setbacks, its internal strength transcend that of any of their neighbors."""
Majority of NY Times columnists agree JD Vance won debate: 'Much more forceful speaker',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/majority-ny-times-columnists-agree-jd-vance-won-debate-forceful-speaker,2024-10-02T14:38:02Z,"GOP, Democrat, and Independent voters react in real-time to Ohio Senator JD Vance's claims that he and former President Trump care about the environment during Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Credit: CBS)

A majority of the 13 columnists and contributors polled by The New York Times agreed that JD Vance won the debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night.

Multiple New York Times columnists, including Binyamin Appelbaum, said that Vance was overall effective in his presentation on the debate stage. Seven of the columnists and contributors said that Vance defeated Walz in the debate, with two saying that the face-off was a draw and three writers concluding that Walz won.

""He made Trumpism sound polite, calm and coherent,"" Appelbaum said of Vance.

GOP LAWMAKERS, LEADERS REACT TO VANCE, WALZ DEBATE: 'SPITTING COLD, HARD TRUTH'

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate. But as the debate went on, Vance stumbled on two issues -- abortion and the 2020 election -- where his rhetorical skill could not salvage the very unappealing material he was working with,"" Josh Barro, author of the newsletter Very Serious, wrote.

""Walz won,"" Times columnist Charles M. Blow wrote. ""You could tell that he was a teacher, because he clearly did his homework. Anyone afraid that Vance would roll over him could breathe easily.""

Newsletter writer Matt Labash said that ""Nobody truly dominated.""

""But I'm giving the slight edge to Walz, since Vance embarrassingly soft-pedaled Jan. 6 and Trump posted this to Truth Social during the debate: 'More Notes! Why Can't Walz just remember what he has to say? Low IQ!' Reminding us that Vance's boss should watch more Hallmark Channel, less Newsmax.""

VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF ON BORDER, CLIMATE CHANGE AND ABORTION DURING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Other writers said that the debate outcome was more even.

Contributing Times Opinion writer Jane Coaston wrote that ""Vance seemed smoother and more practiced, but 'won' is a very strong term here.""

Times columnist Gail Collins said that the debate was a ""draw"" because ""Walz was so bad in much of his delivery. Vance was a much more forceful speaker while spewing lies on everything from abortion to Biden's foreign policy.""

Contributing Times opinion writer Peter Wehner said that Vance proved he was ""sharp and in command and ... an excellent debater.""

""At times he tried too hard to appear likable; I came away more convinced that he's a hollow man, radioactive and incendiary one day, conciliatory and agreeable the next,"" Wehner said. ""But the 'good Vance' did a lot to repair his tattered image.""

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital, ""Senator JD Vance completely dominated the debate and showed why we need to return President Trump to the White House."" He added that Trump's vice presidential nominee ""gave clear answers how the Trump-Vance ticket will turn around our economy, secure our southern border, make our streets safe once again, and restore peace in the Middle East.""

Cheung continued by saying that Vance ""exposed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for being failed, radical leftists who are all slogans with zero substance.""

""He called out Kamala Harris for destroying our southern border. He called out Harris for creating the record inflation making life unaffordable for millions of Americans. And he called out Harris for enabling Iran, leading to the current attacks on Israel,"" the spokesman added.

A mother who was ""murdered while shielding her 9-month-old son"" has been identified by Israel as one of the victims of yesterday's terrorist attack at a train station outside of Tel Aviv.

Israel says the actions of Inbar Segev-Vigder in Jaffa on Tuesday ""saved"" the life of her child Ari.

""There are no words. Only heartbreak,"" Israel posted on X. ""May the memory of the victims be a blessing.""

Israeli police said Wednesday that a total of seven people were killed in a shooting that unfolded just minutes before Iran started launching ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for the recent killings of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

Two Palestinian men from the Israeli-occupied West Bank town of Hebron opened fire, including shooting directly into a light rail carriage crowded with passengers that was stopped at a station.

The suspects -- who police say had no prior arrests, although one had been involved in disturbing the peace at a demonstration -- were later shot and killed by security guards and armed pedestrians, according to The Associated Press. Police and paramedics who responded to the scene treated another 16 people injured from the shooting.

Segev-Vigder lived in Tel Aviv and operated a fitness and Pilates studio, while her husband, Yaari Vigder, is an Israeli reservist soldier, The Jerusalem Post reports.

""Ari was in a carrier that covered Inbar's entire upper body during the attack, he was not injured at all,"" the website cited Yaari Vigder as telling Israel's Channel 11 news.

""For the rest of his life -- may he feel the same love he received from Inbar,"" he reportedly added.

A witness told Ynetnews that the 33-year-old mother was gunned down while stepping off a train in Jaffa, according to The Jerusalem Post.

The website identified four other victims as Revital Bronstein, 24, Shahar Goldman, 30, Nadia Sokolenko, 40, and Ilya Nozadze, 42.

Sokolenko's family told Israel's TPS news agency that they were waiting for her to return home from grocery shopping Tuesday night and her friends started checking area hospitals after her phone stopped answering calls.

Sokolenko, a native of Moldova who worked as an office manager, was described by friends as ""a very creative person and very caring mom"" of a 6-year-old daughter, TPS added.

Greece's foreign ministry also said Wednesday that a Greek national who lived in Jerusalem was among the dead.

Israel Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X in the wake of the attack that ""I will now demand in the cabinet discussion that the family members of the abominable terrorists from Hebron who carried out the heinous attack in Jaffa be deported to Gaza tonight and their homes should be turned into ruins for them to see and see."""

House Speaker Mike Johnson slammed the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate moderators for their ""shameless"" fact-checking of Sen. JD Vance, calling them out for having anti-conservative bias on ""open display.""

""It's just shameless,"" Johnson said during ""Fox & Friends"" on Wednesday. ""Their bias, their disdain for any Republican candidate is just on open display. Everybody can see that... It was three against one and JD still won.""

ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT ON HARRIS

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

When Vance tried to push back on the fact-check, Brennan and her co-moderator Norah O'Donnell attempted to speak over Vance, insisting that they had to move on to the next question.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance reminded them. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""Senator, we have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Brennan said before urging O'Donnell again to move on to the next question.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" she added when Vance continued to respond.

Johnson commended Vance for his performance as he went head-to-head against the Minnesota governor, praising him for shedding light on the Biden-Harris administration's ""open"" border policies.

""The immigration policy is basically nonexistent,"" Johnson said. ""They opened the border. They're allowing everyone in. They put out the welcome mat, and the catastrophe that this has been to our country in every metric of public policy, with the fentanyl poisonings of it being the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 49.

"Amid soaring threats from Iran, Russia against US homeland, Biden-Harris must focus on protecting us all",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/amid-soaring-threats-from-iran-russia-against-us-homeland-biden-harris-must-focus-protecting-us-all,2024-10-02T11:15:19Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In his remarks during last week's United Nations General Assembly, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian, claimed that Iran wants to ""live in peace."" He demanded ""a world free of nuclear weapons,"" and declared that Iran ""is ready to disarm,"" if Israel does the same.

But just two weeks prior, Iran and its fellow dictatorship Russia were slapped with new economic sanctions by the Biden-Harris administration for Tehran's delivery of ballistic missiles to Moscow. In fact, the national security community is increasingly concerned about the growing relations between two of America's top adversaries. However, as Team Biden-Harris is hyper-focused on the threat this unholy alliance poses elsewhere in the world - Ukraine, the Middle East - what about us? Is anyone in charge of protecting our homeland?

As a former U.S. intelligence analyst who led Red Teams during war games, my team's job was to come up with, thinking like our adversaries, out-of-the-ordinary ideas - no matter how implausible - that Red Force (Russia, Iran, etc.) could use against Blue Force (U.S. and Allied militaries). The goal was to enable the president, the Pentagon and other decision makers to develop plans for countering our adversaries and protecting the homeland. Here are a few insights, from the intelligence perspective, that make the Iran-Russia threat even bigger than most Americans realize.

First, neither Russian nor Iranian leaders respect the Biden-Harris administration, making them more likely to act more aggressively against the United States. As a clear sign of indifference to Washington's ire, two days after the new sanctions went into effect, Russian President Vladimir Putin held a meeting with Ali Ahmadian, secretary of the Supreme National Security Council of Iran. In it, he praised the supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Ayatollah Seyyed Ali Khamenei, for fostering ""additional momentum"" in Russian-Iranian relations and thanked Pezeshkian's team for making the relationship a ""priority."" Five days later, Putin dispatched his top security official, Sergei Shoigu, to Tehran, where Shoigu held secret talks with Pezeshkian.

WHY RUSSIAN STATE MEDIA IS OBSESSING ABOUT THE DEMOCRATIC NATIONAL CONVENTION AND PRAISING WALZ

Neither Russia nor Iran is afraid of economic sanctions. They've used loopholes in the sanctions regime to circumvent them and found alternative ways to finance their policy priorities and military programs. Despite the fact that the U.S., European Union (EU) and its Western allies banned nearly all Russian imports at the start of the war in Ukraine, Western nations purchased $2 billion worth of Russian oil indirectly through Turkey.

In 2023, the Biden-Harris administration released $6 billion in unfrozen assets to Iran as part of the deal to release five American hostages in exchange for five Iranians held in U.S. prisons. It is almost a certainty that some of those funds were diverted by Iran toward its military programs and to train and equip its proxy terrorist groups, such as Hamas, Hezbollah and the Houthis.

Sanctions, therefore, are an optics instrument that politicians use to virtue signal that they are doing something in response to hostile foreign activities. They have not and will not change the behavior of our adversaries.

Second, both Putin and the ayatollahs understand that as Team Biden-Harris is focused on European and Ukrainian security, security inside the homeland isn't taken seriously, presenting a vulnerability to be exploited. Explaining the decision for the new sanctions package, Secretary of State Antony Blinken expressed concern that Moscow will ""likely use... Iranian ballistic missiles... against Ukraine."" Blinken characterized the weapons trade between Moscow and Tehran as a ""threat to European security.""

The Biden-Harris administration has approved billions of dollars for Ukraine to aid its defense against Russia, even as our own Secret Service is in crisis due to staffing shortages, high levels of turnover, inadequate training and incompetence of some of its personnel.

RUSSIA, CHINA, IRAN, NORTH KOREA RATCHETING UP THREATS AGAINST US. WHAT WE NEED TO KNOW

Two failed assassination attempts on former President Trump, during which would-be assassins were able to penetrate the security perimeter of the protectee, clearly demonstrate that the level of protection the Secret Service delivers is low. If security for a former president, with all the law enforcement personnel surrounding him 24/7, can be breached by an amateur, an operative trained and resourced by a state-actor like Iran or Russia, can do so much more damage. It also means that other targets - government buildings, military installations, critical infrastructure - are likely to be equally vulnerable. Saying nothing of soft targets, such as shopping malls and other public spaces.

Third, Russia and Iran have the capabilities and political will to conduct hostile clandestine operations inside the U.S. The recent arrest in New York of a Iranian-linked Pakistani man who plotted to kill American leaders, highly likely including Trump, is just one example of Iran's ongoing policy of infiltrating operatives inside the U.S. for nefarious purposes.

Moreover, according to a 2024 report by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, Iran has been developing ""surrogate networks inside the United States"" for ""more than a decade."" This assessment is consistent with a warning contained in another report about Iran's plans to attack strategic security assets and institutions in the U.S. The report, titled ""The Unseen Threat of the Mapping Project,"" claims that Iranian elements have identified 298 American strategic security assets and institutions, as well as personnel, for attacks, kidnappings and assassinations.

Couple this with the fact that Russia, for decades, has been running an ""illegals"" program aimed at maintaining networks of deep-cover sleeper agents inside the United States. In 2010, the FBI had to pull the plug on a 10-year counter-intelligence operation aimed at rooting out such a spy network inside the United States because one of the female spies was moving uncomfortably close in access to then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, her husband Bill Clinton, and members of their inner circle. The Russians almost certainly keep this program alive, now that the Biden-Harris open border policy has made it so much easier to infiltrate foreign operatives.

The Iranian regime has been funding anti-Israel protests on university campuses across the country. These ostensibly ""grassroots activist"" groups, which sometimes don't know who is behind them, present a vast pool of resources that could be weaponized, with the help of foreign clandestine operatives. What Putin and the ayatollahs want is to foment social unrest inside the United States, consistent with the Russian doctrine of ""controlled instability.""

Fourth, should Russia and Iran join forces in strategic capabilities, the threat to homeland security could be catastrophic. The U.S. government investigation in the aftermath of the 9/11 terrorist attacks concluded that the government's principal error was a failure to ""connect the dots."" In other words, the pieces of the puzzle were to be found in many corners of the U.S. government. Yet no one connected the dots, making it impossible to predict and preempt the attacks.

We are now living in a similar period. Our security apparatus is stretched thin, with analysts being pulled in many different directions - Ukraine, the Middle East, China. The same failure of imagination that plagued our intelligence in 2001 could prevent us from visualizing an impending threat coming from Iran-Russia cooperation. Below, I will connect the dots.

Putin spokesperson Dmitriy Peskov acknowledged that the two countries are cooperating, including on ""the most sensitive"" areas,"" which he didn't specify. As someone who spent my intelligence career tracking threats to our homeland, here they are - cyber attacks, space warfare and WMD. We are vulnerable in these areas due to our reliance on technology in military operations and civilian life.

Russia has the world's most extensive nuclear know how, some of which it is likely sharing with Iran, which is already extremely close to operationalizing its atomic weapons. Russia is also sharing space launch technology with Iran, helping Tehran place its satellites into orbit. A multi-mission satellite network is a pre-requisite for missile warning, targeting, and command and control, including the employment of nuclear weapons.

Russia has developed a comprehensive suite of counter-space weapons to target U.S. satellites during wartime and electronic warfare capabilities to disrupt the functioning of U.S. satellites in peacetime. Moscow has already used some of these capabilities during its war on Ukraine. It probably will share some of these technologies with Iran, which already has demonstrated jamming capabilities.

U.S. airlines, which rely on GPS for flight navigation, are already concerned about becoming targets of GPS spoofing. Spoofing attacks have surged over the past six months, with most of them originating from electronic-warfare transmitters in Russia, Ukraine and Israel.

Russia already poses a chemical and biological weapons (CBW) threat and retains an undeclared chemical weapons program, having used them at least twice in recent years, according to a 2024 intelligence report. Iran continues ""research and development of chemical and biological agents for offensive purposes."" ""Iranian military scientists have researched chemicals, toxins, and bioregulators, all of which have a wide range of sedation, dissociation, and amnestic incapacitating effects.""

Military ties between Moscow and Tehran are indeed the closest they've ever been, having strengthened dramatically on Biden-Harris' watch. As we are nearing the presidential election and Team Biden-Harris continues to prioritize someone else's security, Americans must decide which future president is more likely to place America's security first."
Jews prepare to observe Rosh Hashanah as group steps up to secure community amid huge rise in antisemitism,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/jews-prepare-observe-rosh-hashanah-group-steps-up-secure-community-amid-huge-rise-antisemitism,2024-10-02T11:08:29Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As the Jewish community approaches the High Holiday season, many are concerned about rising antisemitism in the U.S. stemming from Hamas' Oct 7, 2023, terror attacks on Israel, which resulted in the murder of about 1,200 Israelis and hundreds of innocents taken hostage to the Gaza Strip.

This year's celebrations of Rosh Hashanah, Oct. 2-4, and Yom Kippur, Oct. 11-12, fall on either side of the one-year anniversary of the attack as Israel fights a multifront war that continues to stoke tensions at home.

The FBI hate crime statistics for 2023, released last week, demonstrate a considerable uptick in antisemitic hate crimes since Oct. 7. The FBI Crime Data Explorer shows a total of 1,951 anti-Jewish hate crimes in 2023, a 55% increase from 1,257 incidents reported in 2022. Of these, 980 incidents occurred between January and September. In the final three months of the year, 971 incidents were reported, an increase of more than 300% over the 318 incidents tallied during the same period in 2022.

GOV WHITMER CONDEMNS 'SQUAD' MEMBER'S 'ANTISEMITIC' ATTACK AGAINST MICHIGAN'S JEWISH AG: 'HATEFUL RHETORIC'

Amid this startling rise in hate, Community Security Service (CSS) CEO Richard Priem told Fox News Digital that he wants Jewish Americans to ""be reassured that there's a lot of competent organizations and individuals, both in government and within the community, proactively working to make sure that these High Holidays will be safe and enjoyable.""

The explosion of intolerance has spawned growth within CSS. It took Priem's nonprofit about a decade to train volunteers to support just under 300 Jewish institutions. Now, CSS partners with 470 institutions, an increase of ""30% over the course of 10 months,"" Priem said.

Some of CSS's new growth is on college campuses, where anti-Israel protests and encampments created hostile environments for Jewish students throughout the previous academic year and continue to cause chaos this year.

Priem said the CSS campus program, now present on a dozen campuses, is ""providing self-defense, awareness and de-escalation training for Jewish students"" as part of the larger CSS mission ""to make sure that Jewish life can continue unimpeded.""

BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY FACULTY VOTES 'NO CONFIDENCE' IN PRESIDENT AFTER 'EXCESSIVE' CRACKDOWN ON STUDENT PROTESTS

The CSS model focuses on ""empowering Jewish community members to become experts"" in securing their institutions. Now, more than 5,000 volunteers stand ready to protect their facilities, which is up from the less than 3,000 last year. With this effort to respond to community needs, ""[W]e are stretching the resources that we have to the maximum,"" Priem said.

But the work has paid off. Priem noted that his team ""reports hundreds of incidents every year, many of which are being investigated by law enforcement, some of which actually lead to arrests and federal charges."" While most of those incidents went uncovered by the media, ABC 7 Washington, D.C., reported on Dec. 17 that CSS volunteers stopped an attack on Jewish worshipers outside the Kesher Israel Synagogue in Georgetown.

NEW YORK ANTI-ISRAEL RALLY AT UN FEATURES SIGN SUPPORTING TERROR GROUP HEZBOLLAH

CSS volunteers were outside the synagogue when a stranger stepped out of a U-Haul parked near the synagogue entrance, shouted ""Gas the Jews"" and sprayed worshipers with a substance that was later revealed to be merely fart spray. CSS volunteers documented the incident and engaged law enforcement, which arrested perpetrator Brent Wood. In August, the U.S. Attorney for Washington, D.C., secured an indictment charging Wood, now a fugitive from the law, with ""three counts of obstructing by force or threat of force a person's enjoyment of their free exercise of religious beliefs, while using a dangerous weapon.""

The primary force behind the escalating threat to the Jewish community since Oct. 7 is the spillover of hate from continued conflict in the Middle East.

""Because of what's going on between Israel and Hamas and Hezbollah, there might be people coming to target that synagogue because of something politically they disagree with around a foreign country, but they feel justified in targeting a Jewish institution to express their hatred,"" Priem said.

Priem said CSS volunteers have not taken their eye off other threats, like the homegrown extremism of white supremacists like Robert Bowers, who perpetrated an attack that killed 11 congregants at Pittsburg's Tree of Life Synagogue in October 2018. The radical Islamic threat posed by groups like ISIS and al Qaeda also remains a serious concern. On Sept. 4, a Pakistani man pledging support to ISIS was arrested in Canada as he traveled to the U.S. to carry out planned attacks on a New York Jewish center on either Oct. 7 or Oct. 11.

While these threats are diverse and serious, Priem said CSS volunteers are prepared ""to work with law enforcement and make sure that [members of the Jewish community] can still enter and arrive to synagogue safely"" during Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur."
The seeds of today's Middle East strife were planted in Beirut,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/seeds-todays-middle-east-strife-were-planted-beirut,2024-10-02T10:16:36Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As Israeli forces prepare for what officials characterize as a limited ground incursion into Lebanon, the world is bracing for the possibility that the conflict will expand into a larger regional war, a greater likelihood in the wake of Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

The two sides have clashed for close to a year, dating back to Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The skirmishes have led to hundreds of deaths along the border and the displacement of thousands more.

The violence reflects the damage that Iranian-backed militant groups, like Hamas and Hezbollah, have done in the Middle East for four decades. The roots of their capacity to inflict harm lie in the October 1983 suicide bombing of the U.S. Marine headquarters in Beirut, which was the largest non-nuclear blast the FBI ever investigated.

Though the attack, which killed 241 soldiers, sailors, and Marines, horrified President Ronald Reagan, he never retaliated against the then-fledgling Hezbollah.

ISRAEL UNBOUND

This decision to forego a military response, coupled with America's withdrawal from Lebanon, sent a message that terrorism worked. Small and relatively inexpensive acts of extraordinary violence could effectively defeat major militaries and superpowers. This emboldened these groups, as well as their Iranian sponsors. The results have been catastrophic for the region and the cause of peace.

By the early 1980s, Lebanon had been torn apart by years of civil war and sectarian violence that had resulted from a political tug-of-war between the nation's Christians, Sunnis and Shiites. Adding to the bloodshed was the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had moved into Beirut after being driven out of Jordan in 1971.

The PLO, upset over the loss of land during Israel's 1967 war against its Arab neighbors, fought a guerrilla campaign against Israel in an effort to obtain a homeland for the Palestinian people.

END US FUNDING FOR UN AGENCY GIVING IMMUNITY TO ITS MURDEROUS HAMAS MEMBERS

In June 1982, Israel invaded, pummeling Beirut with artillery in an attempt to eradicate the PLO, which had been attacking it from Lebanese territory. The rain of Israeli fire devastated entire city blocks. ""Even in Lebanon,"" wrote columnist Jack Anderson, ""a land inured to catastrophe, the bombardment of West Beirut was a horror beyond endurance.""

Israel's bloody war in Lebanon alarmed many, including Reagan, who worked to broker a deal to end the violence, remove the PLO, and send in U.S. Marines as peacekeepers to stabilize the region.

But American troops were not the only foreign military force to arrive in Lebanon that year. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Shiite religious leader who rose to power in Iran in 1979, saw an opportunity to capitalize on the chaos, to export and propagate his revolution.

UN ABDICATES ROLE OF MIDDLE EAST PEACEMAKER BY BACKING TERRORISTS

With that goal in mind, Khomeini sent an army of 800 elite Revolutionary Guards into Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, a lawless region near Syria. The Iranian soldiers fanned out through the impoverished Shiite communities in southern Lebanon, attending mosque, giving speeches, and recruiting disenfranchised young men to fight against American and Israeli forces.

These efforts helped produce two homegrown Shiite terror organizations: Islamic Amal and the Islamic Jihad Organization. These two Iranian-backed groups would soon merge, however, and become known simply as Hezbollah or the Party of God, aided by Iranian money, training and weapons.

Hezbollah's first strike against the U.S. came on April 18, 1983, when a suicide car bomber crashed into the front of the American Embassy in Beirut. The blast collapsed the entire front of the building, killing 63 people including 17 Americans.

IRAN'S OPTIONS DWINDLE AS IT PREPARES RETALIATION FOR DEATH OF NASRALLAH

But that attack paled in comparison to the one that would follow 188 days later.

At dawn on a Sunday morning in October 1983, a bomber in a Mercedes truck crashed through security and penetrated the lobby of the four-story Battalion Landing Team headquarters in Beirut, where some 350 American soldiers, sailors and Marines were asleep.

The blast, which investigators later determined exceeded 12,000 pounds of TNT, collapsed the building into a pile of broken concrete and twisted rebar. ""It was,"" as one survivor later recounted, ""like every atom in the universe blew apart.""

The screams from buried victims prompted one of the greatest rescue efforts in modern memory, as troops attacked the rubble pile with shovels, Ka-Bar knives and their bare hands.

IRAN SUPPORTS KAMALA HARRIS, BUT AMERICANS WHO WANT A SAFER WORLD HAVE A BETTER CHOICE

For those Marines trapped underground, it was hell. Among them was Chaplain Danny Wheeler, who spent five hours buried in a concrete crypt before rescuers finally found him. ""The next thing I knew, I felt a hand on my hand,"" Wheeler recalled. ""I held it.""

Wheeler was the last survivor rescued, and one of the lucky few. All told, the bombing killed 220 Marines, 18 sailors and three soldiers, wounding another 112.

The attack shocked Reagan, who initially resisted pressure from many in Congress and the public to pull American forces out of Lebanon. In a nationally televised speech on Oct. 27, the president instead recommitted America to stabilizing the area.

""Brave young men have been taken away from us. Many others have been grievously wounded. Are we to tell them their sacrifice was wasted?"" Reagan said. ""We're a nation with global responsibilities.""

WHY BIDEN'S SPEECH AT UNGA SHOULD SET OFF ALARM BELLS ACROSS THE GLOBE

But that resolve faded in early 1984, when the Lebanese national government and military ultimately collapsed. On Feb. 7, Reagan announced that he planned to send American troops back to their ships.

In an effort to avoid drawing attention to America's sudden reversal and withdrawal, he skipped the televised speech, instead releasing a written statement to reporters. On March 30, Reagan notified Congress that he planned to officially terminate America's peacekeeping mission.

This withdrawal created a vacuum that Hezbollah capitalized on to gain power and influence, eventually becoming the dominant political party in Lebanon.

WHAT IF ISRAELIS COULD VOTE IN US ELECTIONS?

Additionally, America's abrupt departure coincided with the administration's refusal to retaliate for the bombing of the U.S. Embassy or the Marine headquarters. In the wake of the October bombing, members of the National Security Council drew up a plan to target Iran's terror camp in the Bekaa Valley.

Reagan initially supported it, but Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger convinced the president to backtrack, arguing that retaliatory action demanded the type of conclusive proof of the identity of the attackers that is often elusive in terror attacks. ""I'm not,"" Weinberger later said, ""an eye for an eye man.""

Whatever the merits of Weinberger's thinking, the results of Reagan's decision were calamitous. For the small cost of a truck, some explosives and the single life of a terrorist, Iran successfully drove the U.S. from Lebanon and suffered no consequences.

That was the critical lesson our enemies learned from this tragedy, a fact the CIA zeroed in on in a 1987 report. ""Many Iranian leaders use this precedent as proof that terrorism can break U.S. resolve.""

The agency also concluded that Iranian leaders exploited the uncertainty that had troubled Weinberger. ""Compared with overt military attacks, terrorism and sabotage also offer a degree of plausible deniability and present the United States with a less clear-cut justification for retaliation.""

America's failure to respond to the killing and wounding of hundreds of our diplomats and service members in Beirut served as a green light for Iran to continue and even escalate its proxy war of terrorism that menaces the region.

And it is a price America, Israel and our allies continue to pay four decades later.

Col. Timothy Geraghty, who was the commander of the Marines in Lebanon in October 1983 and later worked for the CIA, understands that better than anyone. ""Our timidity,"" he concluded, ""whetted the jihadists' appetite.""

Gen. Joseph Votel, former CENTCOM commanding general, discusses Iran's latest attack and Israel's potential response on 'Your World.'

BBC News was accused of being a ""pro-terrorist"" news organization after a guest on the British network defended Iran following its attack on Israel on Tuesday.

Iran launched hundreds of ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel, according to U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan. The strikes were ""ineffective"" but a ""significant escalation"" in the ongoing regional conflict. Iran says the attacks were in response to the deaths of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders. The move comes after weeks of Israeli strikes against Tehran's proxies in the region.

Middle East expert Dr. Andreas Krieg, a senior lecturer in security studies at King's College in London, cautioned Israel about escalating violence in its response to the attack during an interview on BBC World News.

He spurred outrage on social media after suggesting that Israel had been the aggressor and Hezbollah and Iran had been ""fairly rational"" in the ongoing conflict.

IRAN ATTACK ON ISRAEL 'INEFFECTIVE' BUT A 'SIGNIFICANT ESCALATION': WHITE HOUSE

""Something's gotta give. I mean, Israel has to send a response, but -- this is not for Israel to decide. I think the international community has to make sure that whatever Israel does is not upending the regional order, as we know it. And the U.S. has a responsibility. So we've been in this cause for 12 months now of, constantly red lines being crossed, mostly by the Israelis,"" he argued.

""Hezbollah and Iran have played it fairly rationally, trying to always be very cautious in how they respond, trying to leave off-ramps where they could,"" he added. ""The Netanyahu government has kind of lost the opportunity at every sort of junction to use an off-ramp that was given to them.""

BBC Radio 5 Live contributor Lee Harris shared part of the interview on X, calling the lecturer's comments ""disgraceful.""

""Thought I would check out how the BBC are reporting on what's happening. I would say I can't believe what I'm hearing, but it's pretty much what you would expect from them. The anti-Israel bias is insane. Disgraceful,"" he wrote.

""This is unf -- believable. Enough is enough. The BBC is now an openly pro-terrorist organization,"" UK presenter and The Sun columnist Julia Hartley-Brewer reacted.

Vance vs. Walz debate: Top takeaways from VP candidates' face-off,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/vance-vs-walz-debate-top-takeaways-from-vp-candidates-face-off,2024-10-02T05:50:19Z,"In recent weeks, Tim Walz' team tried to lower expectations for his debate with rival JD Vance. Now we know why.

Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Walz did not turn in a disastrous performance on the debate stage, but he was clearly outclassed by Ohio Sen. Vance. Trump supporters who have questioned the young Ohio senator's qualifications for the nation's second-highest office, or asked why the former president chose him to be his running mate, slept better on Tuesday night. He was sharp, appealing, and policy-savvy. Most important, Vance totally upended the media's unflattering characterization of him by being sympathetic, respectful and likeable.

Vance had the advantage of having held dozens of press interviews in recent weeks; he was ready and tested. By contrast, Walz has done almost no unscripted encounters with the media since he became the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate; his inability to go beyond talking points and delve deep into policy was not surprising.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

Walz spent much of the debate talking about programs he claimed to have successfully enacted in Minnesota, like paid family leave. What he was supposed to do on Tuesday night was make the case for running mate Vice President Kamala Harris.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

As with the ABC presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the CBS News moderators embarrassed themselves by clearly favoring the Democrat contestant. Moreover, CBS' Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell affected a grating school-marmish tone, overly eager to chaperone what was an extremely orderly debate.

Their questions featured well-worn Democrat priorities (climate change, abortion) and they largely avoided topics that could have played well for Vance, like crime. O'Donnell challenged the senator on Trump formerly calling climate change a ""hoax"" and then asserted gratuitously that ""the overwhelming consensus is that the climate is changing.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Moreover, having said they would not fact-check the candidates, the two women intervened more than once to question a response from Vance, while doing so only one time with Walz.

Unhappily for the Minnesota governor, that one probing question was calamitous. Asked why he had falsely claimed to be in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Walz launched into a word salad that would have made Kamala Harris proud, talking about his experiences traveling in China. Asked again to answer why he had been untruthful, Walz misfired and looked stunned. In effect, he was caught out in a lie. Since he has a history of spinning falsehoods about his past, and especially about his military rank, this was not helpful.

Vance, like Walz, was meant to argue the case for his running mate, and that he did. When the moderators and Walz derided Trump's claim during the presidential debate that he had the ""concept of a plan"" on health care, Vance said that Trump did not have a plan - he had a record. More than once during the evening he reminded the audience that during Trump's presidency inflation was low, the border was closed and the world was at peace.

KAMALA HARRIS MAKES A DESPERATE MOVE ON A CRITICAL ISSUE TO SAVE A SINKING CAMPAIGN

When moderator Margaret Brennan pushed Vance to explain why Trump had abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, thus purportedly allowing the terror state to speed up its efforts to build a nuclear weapon, Vance noted that for the past three-plus years Harris and Biden have been in charge. He rightly pointed out that they helped rebuild Iran's ability to wage war by not enforcing the Trump sanctions, thus allowing the mullahs to grow their income by $100 billion. With Iran just having attacked Israel with 180 missiles, Vance's referencing the Reagan-Trump doctrine of peace through strength resonated.

While Walz repeated Harris' vague promises about making life better for middle class families, Vance reminded the audience that take-home pay had risen under Trump and inflation was low, while under Harris, prices on everything from food to housing had shot up more than 20%. When Walz claimed economists backed Harris' plan over Trump's, Vance responded that Trump didn't have Ph.D.s on his team, he had common sense.

When Walz accused Trump of wanting to enact tariffs on imports, which would serve as a new tax on Americans, Vance congratulated President Joe Biden on keeping the former president's tariffs on China in place, defusing the issue.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

Vance clearly won the dispute over the border, noting that Harris had bragged for three years about undoing all the restrictions that Trump put in place. When Brennan challenged Vance on how Trump would handle separating families while carrying out deportations, Vance referred to the horrifying report that the Department of Homeland Security has lost track of more than 320,000 children brought across the border illegally - a damning and heartbreaking situation that has resulted from Harris' open border.

Not surprisingly, the debate got heated on the subject of abortion. Vance criticized the Minnesota law signed by Walz that does not require the doctor to do everything necessary for the care of a baby that survives a late-term abortion. Walz disputed the characterization, but Vance is correct. Walz, meanwhile, charged Vance with having earlier backed a 15-week national abortion ban. Vance explained that he shares Trump's view that the states are now charged with setting the regulations.

The candidates sparred on other topics, and took expected swipes at each other's running mates, but both maintained their composure and even agreed that on some issues, like school safety, they could likely find some common ground. Especially given the Harris-Walz strategy of avoiding scrutiny and trying to hide their progressive agendas, it was an unusually useful event for America's voters.

The winner of the night, without a doubt, was JD Vance. Will it matter? After all, many argue that no one votes for the V.P. But voters tell pollsters they do not enough about Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz's performances at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

The largely civil and arguably quite informative debate between Democratic nominee Gov. Tim Walz and Republican nominee Sen. JD Vance on Tuesday night has underscored one thing. We need another presidential debate.

Both Walz and Vance stuck to familiar positions on the issues on the debate stage, whether it was on the economy, health care, energy or immigration. No new ground was broken, no dramatic changes in policy were unveiled.

Still, the debate, in my estimation, was very important for a fundamental reason: it was civil, it was informative, and it included a surprisingly high degree of bipartisanship that has been noticeably absent from the 2024 presidential race.

It is certain that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump watched the debate. And both, I am sure, concluded that their respective running mates did an excellent job in both underscoring their core positions as well as attacking their rivals.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

But most importantly, on Tuesday night there was a comment that I think both candidates underscored in their own way: That we can do better as Americans, we can solve our problems and provide leadership as people who disagree, and sometimes vigorously, but have a broader purpose beyond our narrow partisan concerns.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

This is not simply a homily. It's much more. It is a large-scale call for a different kind of politics, even if implicitly made by both candidates, it is a recognition of the extraordinary challenges we face, both domestically and internationally, in the wake of Iran's attack on Israel. And most of all, it underscores to me why both presidential candidates need to quickly accept the invitation of various news networks for another debate or more debates in the final 35 days of this campaign.

It's virtually certain that no minds were changed on Tuesday night.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

To be sure, the pundits will be vetting what the candidates said or didn't say about immigration and abortion. Two topics on which they disagree vehemently. But the two vice presidential candidates were largely repeating and underscoring what their respective nominees have said and believe.

The key now is for the media to focus on what the American people want and require as this extraordinary race comes down to the finish line. The two presidential campaigns need to face off, at least once, if not more times, to discuss and debate their positions on the issues with a greater degree of specificity and precision than they have done previously.

The 2024 presidential race is now an effective statistical tie. This is especially true when one looks at the seven key swing states in this election. There is a degree of uncertainty about precisely where the candidates stand on the important issues facing our country after a raucous presidential debate last month that was more personally divisive than it was informative.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

For us to make an informed choice as Americans, we need to replicate what happened on Tuesday night with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The two presidential candidates need to tell us, in programmatic terms, what they will do on the economy, immigration, crime, health care, energy and, of course, on foreign affairs, a critical topic which did not get anywhere near the attention it deserved and required.

The level of dissatisfaction of the American electorate with the candidates and with the political process cannot be overestimated. We saw what the American people deserve but have not received until now in this presidential election.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

Both vice presidential candidates were likable on Tuesday night. Vance had heretofore not been seen that way. On the debate stage, it was hard not to empathize with him, even if you disagreed with him. Likewise, Walz delivered as a likable everyman figure.

I came away from the presidential debate last month not wanting to have dinner with either Trump or Harris. After the V.P. debate, I wanted to get to know both candidates better.

My takeaway from Tuesday night is that, for virtually the first time in this election cycle, Vance and Walz quietly acknowledged that the electorate requires something more before Election Day. It's up to Trump and Harris to give it to them--in person--at least one more time, if not more."

Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democrat vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off Tuesday night in their first -- and only -- debate, sparring over issues from foreign policy to border security; abortion to climate change; and introducing themselves and their records to the American people with just five weeks to Election Day.

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5th, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs, on a day that began with nearly 50,000 unionized dock workers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a tough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

""And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys,"" Vance said.

Walz fired back, slamming the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" while saying Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

But Vance fired back.

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years? And the answer is, your running mate -- not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, said he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves ""when was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border -- a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no. told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking; some of them, hopefully are at homes with their families; some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules,"" Vance said. ""The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, you know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies. I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

Walz pushed back, saying children have not been used as ""drug mules,"" and defending Harris, saying she was attorney general in California and ""prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drugs.""

Walz also hit Vance over claims he had made about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying he had demonized them.

""Look in Springfield Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans,"" Vance said.

At that point, moderators tried to correct Vance--but the GOP vice presidential nominee pushed back, reminding that the moderators said they would not fact-check the candidates.

The moderators said that many Haitian residents in Springfield, Ohio have legal temporary status. Vance jumped in to ""say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process and tying it to a Harris-backed process, the moderators spoke over him, sarcastically thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""We have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Margaret Brennan said before asking her co-moderator to ask the next question.

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American People's Trust back on this issue, where they frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now.""

Vance echoed Trump's view of abortion--supporting the Supreme Court's decision to return the issue of abortion back to the states, while supporting exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON 2 TOP ISSUES AHEAD OF VP DEBATE

""The proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions,"" Vance said. ""Let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big a very diverse. And let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.""

Meanwhile, the moderators switched to questions of leadership -- with the moderators pressing Walz on whether he was actually in China for the Tiananmen Square protests, like he claimed.

A visibly nervous Walz attempted to explain the discrepancy, ultimately saying he ""misspoke"" and was not there until later that year.

And the question for Vance was about his past criticisms of Trump.

Vance said, at the time, he disliked Trump because he ""believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record.""

""Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take-home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans, a secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it,"" Vance said.

Meanwhile, Vance offered his sympathies to Walz during the section of the debate focused on gun violence, when he learned that Walz's son had witnessed a shooting.

Walz said his 17-year-old son ""witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball.""

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting. I'm sorry about that -- Christ, have mercy,"" Vance said.

The two spoke about school shootings and their plans to solve gun violence.

""We have to make the doors locked better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger, and of course, we've got to increase school resource officers. Because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience,"" Vance said.

Walz said the conversation was a good start but had to go further.

""Even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country, there are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there, it just doesn't make any sense,"" he said.

And on another top issue this cycle: democracy.

Vance was pushed on his past comments, in which he said he would not have voted to certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021.

Vance fired back at the assertion that Trump could pose a ""threat to democracy,"" saying that he believes ""we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country.""

""But unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens,"" Vance said.

Walz redirected the discussion back to Jan. 6, 2021, blasting Trump and Republicans for allegedly denying the events of that day.

""I will tell you this, that when this is over, we need to shake hands this election and the winner needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It's tearing our country apart,"" Walz said.

But Vance replied, saying it is ""really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th.""

""As we have done for 250 years in this country, we are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election. And of course, I hope that we win, and I think we're going to win,"" Vance said. ""But if Tim Walz is the next vice president, he'll have my prayers. He'll have my best wishes and he'll have my help whenever he wants it.""

But Vance reminded Americans that ""for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections.""

""Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board,"" Vance said. ""But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor.""

As the debate came to a close, Vance and Walz both promised voters a new direction for the United States.

""Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward,"" Walz said. ""She's bringing us a politics of joy. She's bringing real solutions for the middle class. And she's centering you at the heart of that, all the while asking everyone, join this movement. Make your voices heard.""

Vance also gave a message of change to the voters.

""We need change. We need a new direction. We need a president who has already done this once before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump,"" Vance said. ""And whether you vote for me or vote for Tim Walz, I just want to say I'm so proud to be doing this and I'm rooting for you.

Walz came into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating. Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable.

Heading into the debate, Vance had been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Both running mates get right back on the campaign trail on Wednesday in two of the key seven battleground states that will likely determine whether Harris or Trump succeed President Biden in the White House.

Vance holds campaign events in Auburn Hills and Marne, Michigan. And Walz takes part in a campaign bus tour swing through parts of central Pennsylvania which kicks off at the airport in Harrisburg, the state capital."

Israeli women's basketball teams flee game after Iranian missile strikes,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/israeli-womens-basketball-teams-forced-flee-game-upon-iranian-missile-strikes,2024-10-02T02:26:05Z,"A basketball game between two Israeli women's teams was evacuated after Iranian missiles struck the country Tuesday.

Iran launched dozens of missiles against Israel in a barrage of strikes it says are in response to the deaths of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

Hapoel Lev Jerusalem was playing Hapoel Kfar Saba in the 2024-25 Preseason Winner Tournament at Malha Arena in Jersualem when the attacks began, according to The Jerusalem Post. The explosions began in the second quarter, with Hapoel Lev up 20. Then sirens rang out, and the players and coaches fled to a nearby bomb shelter. There were no reported casualties for either team.

""It's a crazy situation and reality that we are in,"" said veteran Hapoel Lev player Shir Tirosh. ""It's crazy that we are still in this reality a year later, and it's tough to begin the new season like this. And it's very sad. There are sirens in Jerusalem, sirens in Tel Aviv, sirens in the entire country. It's just a crazy reality. I think that what is keeping me level-headed is the fact that I am helping the foreigners on the team stay calm, because they are certainly more nervous than we are. I'm here to help them and stay positive about the situation that we are all in.""

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned citizens to shelter in place and follow instructions from the Home Front Command as the Jewish State's Iron Dome antimissile defense system works to intercept incoming rockets.

Tirosh added that she and her teammates have become more accustomed to preparing for attacks from foreign threats dating back to October 2023.

""The import players that are here are, for the most part, calm and understand what has been going on,"" she said. ""When they arrived, they spoke to us that they weren't that afraid to come to Israel despite the situation that the country has been in.

""We have been speaking to them a lot about what is going on. Last year, after Oct. 7, when we weren't really prepared with how to deal with the situation, we had to act on our instincts with the foreigners. So, now we are much more prepared to handle that aspect. We are always explaining to them what is going on.""

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said this latest barrage of missiles is in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike late last week and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard warned in a statement released by Iranian state media that if Israel responds to the missile barrage, ""it will face crushing attacks.""

At least six Israeli people are already reported dead from Tuesday's attacks during a shooting in Tel Aviv.

Tirosh's teammate, Zoe Wadoux, said the fear of playing in Jersualem has been a strain on her and her family, but she wants them to know she is safe.

""I made the decision during the summer, and at that moment, the war wasn't that bad. And when I got here, it got worse. Obviously, it's tough on my family and friends and all of the people that love me at home to know that I am here. I tried to call them and reach out to them everyday to say that I am OK and that I am safe. But with these types of events, that will, of course, worry. But I am here, and I will try to do as much as I can to be safe and let them know that I am safe.""

Jewish American leaders on Tuesday afternoon reacted to Iran's unprecedented missile attack against Israel, saying the Islamist regime will pay.

""The United States stands with its only democratic ally in the Middle East, Israel, as it defends itself and its people against evil,"" Ohio Republican Rep. Max Miller told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""Iran and its proxies must stop threatening the world.""

In a Sept. 30 statement, Miller said, ""Israel's efforts to dismantle Hezbollah are making the world a safer place."""

Tim Walz has the capacity to be 'sharp' during the CBS Vice Presidential Debate on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz kicked off his debate against Ohio Sen. JD Vance on shaky footing when he was first asked about his foreign policy platform in the Middle East.

""Governor Walz, if you were the final voice in the Situation Room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran?"" CBS' Margaret Brennan asked Walz on Tuesday evening in New York City during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

Walz thanked the moderators for hosting him before delivering a halting and stammering answer while calling for ""steady leadership.""

""Iran, our I, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental. Getting its hostages back, fundamental. And ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute fundamental necessity for the United States to have to steady leadership there. You saw it experienced today where along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, able to stop the incoming attack,"" Walz responded, taking a few pauses between words.

ISRAEL UNDER ATTACK: IRAN LAUNCHES MISSILES, GUNMEN KILL AT LEAST 8 NEAR TEL AVIV

Earlier Tuesday, Iran launched more than 100 ballistic missiles at Israel. War broke out in Israel nearly one year ago on Oct. 7 when Hamas launched attacks on the nation.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter. It's clear. And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment,"" Walz continued.

GOP LEADER SAYS VANCE 'ABSOLUTELY PREPARED' FOR VP DEBATE SHOWDOWN WITH WALZ

Walz continued his response by taking shots at former President Donald Trump and his former administration officials.

""His chief of staff, John Kelly, said that he was the most flawed human being you'd ever met. And both of his secretaries of defense and his national security advisers said he should be nowhere near the White House. Now, the person closest to them... said he's unfit for the highest office. That was Sen. Vance,"" Walz said, referring to Vance's previous criticisms of Trump before he was elected to the White House in 2016.

""What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership.

CNN chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour insisted Tuesday that Iran does not want conflict to escalate between itself and Israel, or the United States.

Amanpour made the statement during network coverage of Iran launching missile strikes into Israel in retaliation for the country's airstrike that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon last week.

""Nobody, nobody - not the Lebanese nor the Iranians, want this to escalate even further. Iran does not want an Israeli or a U.S. war against it,"" Amanpour told CNN anchor Dana Bash on Tuesday morning, suggesting the current rocket barrage was calculated to prompt minimal response from Israeli forces.

NETANYAHU CALLS MIDEAST CONFLICTS CHOICE BETWEEN 'BLESSING OR A CURSE,' WARNS ABOUT ISRAEL'S 'LONG ARM'

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said this barrage of hundreds of missiles is in retaliation for the killing of the terror group leader Nasrallah in Beirut last week, and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July.

The military group warned in a statement released by Iranian state media that if Israel responds to the missile barrage, ""it will face crushing attacks.""

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei had vowed to strike back in retaliation for Nasrallah's death, saying, ""The blood of the martyr shall not go unavenged.""

During her appearance on CNN, Amanpour reported that Iranian leaders have been trying to show restraint so they can avoid a larger war.

""It's incredibly important to be absolutely precise about what's going on. So far, there is no evidence that anything has landed, that it is being intercepted, according to our correspondents on the ground. And also, the United States and Israel said that they assessed that the targets would be three Israeli air bases, and an intelligence base,"" she began.

""That's very important to keep in mind,"" Amanpour said.

ISRAEL TARGETS HEZBOLLAH LEADER NASRALLAH IN STRIKE ON BEIRUT HEADQUARTERS

IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari confirmed Tuesday that Israel's forces did carry out ""quite a few interceptions,"" and noted they're ""unaware of casualties."" Still, he revealed that there were ""some impacts in the center and areas in the south of the country.""

About Iran and Lebanon's perspective on this conflict, Amanpour continued, ""The Iranian foreign minister told me in New York during the United Nations that they were showing - and this is again before Friday's assassination - that they were showing restraint and that Hezbollah was showing restraint as well, and that it wanted, you know, to de-escalate all of this.""

The correspondent noted that, prior to Nasrallah's death, both countries felt they were ""being entrapped and they're trying to resist the notion of being trapped into this war.""

""So then comes the assassination of their client, Hassan Nasrallah,"" she said, adding, ""Hezbollah is meant to be the frontline troops of Iran. So this response from Iran is more likely because it feels it has been left no choice.""

Despite Amanpour's point that Iran and Lebanon don't want things to escalate, U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan called the attack ""a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event"" in a White House briefing."

Hours before the vice presidential debate, former President Donald Trump addressed a crowd at his campaign rally in Wisconsin and bashed the Biden administration over Iran's historic attack on Israel.

""A short time ago, Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at Israel... I've been talking about World War III for a long time, and I don't want to make predictions because the predictions always come true.

Trump's comments come after Israel said Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at the country, marking the largest ballistic missile attack in history.

Trump claimed Biden and Harris made Iran rich in a very short period of time.

""They have $300 billion now. They're rich. I mean, they pay 6 billion every time they have somebody that was kidnaped, it's always $6 billion,"" Trump said.

""Iran was on the verge of bankruptcy. They had no money left. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah.

""U.S. naval destroyers joined Israeli Air Defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles. President Biden and Vice President Harris monitored the attack and the response from the White House Situation Room, joined in person and remotely by their national security team,"" Sullivan said.

Sullivan characterized the attack as a ""significant escalation"" while speaking at a White House briefing on Tuesday.

Sullivan said no deaths were reported on the Israeli side, although the White House is monitoring the reported death of a Palestinian civilian in Jericho in the West Bank.

Many missiles were intercepted by Israel's missile defense systems, while others did hit the ground.

The Pentagon says the U.S. fired approximately 12 interceptors against Iranian missiles.

Antony Blinken does victory lap on Biden-Harris' 'stronger' foreign policy same day Iran attacks Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/antony-blinken-op-ed-touts-biden-harris-foreign-policy-renewal-same-day-iran-attacks-israel,2024-10-01T22:09:19Z,"Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest on Israel's possible response after the Iran missile attack on 'Your World.'

Secretary of State Antony Blinken published an op-ed Tuesday touting the Biden-Harris administration's foreign policy record, stating they took drastic deviations from former President Trump, the same day Iran directly attacked Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles.

Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel Tuesday evening local time in what the administration called a ""signigicant escalation by Iran."" The indiscriminate rocket fire were part of the Shia regime's response to Israel assassinating nearly all of Hezbollah senior leadership, including long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Hours before Iran's attack, Blinken's op-ed touted how Biden-Harris' ""renewal"" strategy post-Trump was working and strengthening America's interests abroad.

""The Biden administration's strategy has put the United States in a much stronger geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,"" Blinken said.

PENTAGON SENDING A 'FEW THOUSAND' PERSONNEL TO MIDDLE EAST DAY AFTER BIDEN SAID HE WOULDN'T ADD COMBAT TROOPS

Blinken said the administration prioritized international cooperation and avoided making decisions abroad in isolation.

""From day one, President Biden and Vice President Harris made a foundational choice that in a more competitive and combustible world, the United States cannot go it alone. If America wants to protect its security and create opportunities for its people, it must stand with those who have a stake in a free, open, secure, and prosperous world and stand up to those who threaten that world,"" he wrote. ""President Biden and Vice President Harris pursued a strategy of renewal, pairing historic investments in competitiveness at home with an intensive diplomatic campaign to revitalize partnerships abroad,"" he said. ""This twin-pillared strategy, they believed, was the best way to disabuse competitors of their assumptions that the United States was declining and diffident.""

Blinken also stated the war in Gaza is interconnected to Iran's maligned behavior.

""Without an end to the war in Gaza and a time-bound, credible path to statehood that addresses the Palestinians' legitimate aspirations and Israel's security needs, normalization cannot move forward. But if these efforts succeed, normalization would join Israel to a regional security architecture, unlock economic opportunities across the region, and isolate Iran and its proxies,"" he continued. ""Glimmers of such integration were on display in the coalition of countries, including Arab states, that helped Israel defend itself against an unprecedented direct attack from Iran in April.""

The State Department referred Fox News Digital to the department's briefing when asked for comment.

House Republicans have described Biden-Harris foreign policy as one aiming at ""appeasement,"" particularly towards Iran.

""CBS Mornings"" anchor Tony Dokoupil grilled author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates over whether he believed Israel had ""a right to exist"" in a tense interview on Monday.

Coates appeared on the show to preview his new book, ""The Message,"" which is a collection of new essays by the best-selling author about his travels to different parts of the world.

""In the book's longest section, Coates travels to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how easily we are misled by nationalist narratives, and the tragedy that lies in the clash between the stories we tell and the reality of life on the ground,"" the book summary says.

Dokoupil confronted Coates on this section of the book, telling him bluntly that it read like something you would find in ""the backpack of an extremist.""

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES ACROSS ISRAEL

""I have to say, when I read the book, I imagine if I took your name out of it, took away the awards, the acclaim, took the cover off the book, publishing house goes away, the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,"" Dokoupil said.

""So then I found myself wondering, why does Ta'Nehisi Coates, who I've known for a long time, read his work for a long time, very talented, smart guy, leave out so much? Why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it? Why leave out that Israel deals with terror groups that want to eliminate it? Why not detail anything of the first and the second Intifada, the café bombings, the bus bombings, the little kids blown to bits. Is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?"" the CBS anchor continued.

Coates defended the book, saying he sought to give a voice to the Palestinian people, whose views he argued were underrepresented in the American media.

""I would say the perspective that you just outlined, there is no shortage of that perspective in American media,"" Coates replied.

""I have asked repeatedly in my interviews whether there is a single network, mainstream organization, in America with a Palestinian-American bureau chief or correspondent who actually has a voice to articulate that part the world. I've been a reporter for 20 years. The reporters are those who believe more sympathetically about Israel and its right to exist don't have a problem getting their voice out. But what I saw in Palestine, what I saw on the West Bank, what I saw in Haifa in Israel, what I saw in the South Hebron Hills, those were the stories I have not heard. Those were the stories that I was most occupied with,"" he continued.

Coates also said the 260-page book was not meant to be a ""treatise on the entirety of the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis.""

Dokoupil continued to press the far-left author, claiming his book would leave readers questioning why Israel even existed.

""But if you were to read this book you would be left wondering why does any of Israel exist? What a horrific place committing horrific acts on a daily basis. So I think the question is central and key: If Israel has a right to exist. And if your answer is no, then I guess the question becomes why do the Palestinians have a right to exist? Why do 20 different Muslim countries have a right to exist?"" Dokoupil asked.

Coates rejected the question, saying that countries are established by force, not rights, and that Israel already exists.

Dokoupil said the author's book ""delegitimizes"" Israel's foundation and ""seems like an effort to topple the whole building of it.""

""What is it that so particularly offends you about the existence of a Jewish state, that is a Jewish safe place, and not any of the other states out there?"" he asked Coates.

""There's nothing that offends me about a Jewish state,"" Coates retorted. ""I am offended by the idea of states built on ethnocracy, no matter where they are.""

""Muslim included?"" Dokoupil asked.

""I would not want a state where any group of people laid down their citizenship rights based on ethnicity,"" Coates said. He explained how he personally witnessed the ""two-tier system"" in Israel, where Palestinians had less freedom and access to resources in ""occupied territories"" than Israelis.

""I'm working with the person that is guiding me, a Palestinian whose father, whose grandfather and grandmother was born in this town. And I have more freedom to walk than he does. He can't ride on certain roads. He can't get water in the same way that Israeli citizens who live less than a mile away from him can,"" Coates said.

The two continued to spar as Dokoupil suggested Coates had portrayed a one-sided view of the conflict.

""But why is that?"" the anchor pressed. ""Why is there no agency in this book for the Palestinians? They exist in your narrative merely as victims of the Israelis, as though they were not offered peace at any juncture, as though they don't have a stake in this -- "" he asked.

Coates appealed to his own ancestry and America's history with racism to defend his particular viewpoint on the conflict in Gaza.

""I have a very, very, very moral compass about this. Again, perhaps it's because of my ancestry. Either apartheid is right or it's wrong. It's really, really simple. Either what I saw was right or it's wrong,"" he explained.

""I am against a state that discriminates against people on the basis of ethnicity. I'm against that. There is nothing the Palestinians could do that would make that okay for me. My book is not based on the hyper-morality of the Palestinian people,"" he went on to say.

Coates' new book was released on Tuesday, the same day that Iran launched dozens of missiles against Israel.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said its latest barrage of missiles is in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike late last week and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned citizens to shelter in place and follow instructions from the Home Front Command as the Jewish State's Iron Dome anti-missile defense system works to intercept incoming rockets."
US readiness plays 'significant' role in fending off Iranian attack on Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-readiness-plays-significant-role-fending-off-iranian-attack-israel,2024-10-01T19:49:58Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The ""significant"" role the U.S. played in helping Israel fend off Iran's aerial assault on Tuesday came just hours after Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin assured Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant that the U.S. had ""increased force readiness"" and stood ready.

""This is a significant escalation by Iran,"" White House National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan told reporters Tuesday. ""It is equally significant that we were able to step up with Israel and create a situation in which no one was killed in this attack in Israel.""

The comments were made following massive missile strike fired by Iran in which some 180 missiles were fired at Israel.

According to Iranian state media, the Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) said the attack was in retaliation for the Friday assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed alongside IRGC commander and military advisor Brig. Gen. Abbas Nilforushan, as well as Ismail Haniyeh, the leader of Hamas who was killed in July during a visit to Tehran.

""In response to the martyrdom of Ismail Haniyeh, Seyyed Hassan Nasrallah and Martyr Nilfroshan, we targeted the heart of the occupied territories,"" the IRGC said in a statement reported by Iranian media. ""If the Zionist regime reacts to Iran's operations, it will face crushing attacks.""

Following the attacks, Israel closed its airspace, residents in Tel Aviv and Jerusalem were ordered to shelter in place and the Israeli security cabinet said it would convene Tuesday night in a bunker in Jerusalem, according to Israeli news outlet the Jerusalem Post.

It remains unclear if Iranian missiles had made contact with any targets, though the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) told Fox News Digital that no casualties were yet known.

In a statement to Fox News, a U.S. defense official said, ""[In] accordance with our ironclad commitment to Israel's security, U.S. forces in the region are currently defending against Iranian-launched missiles targeting Israel.

""Our forces remain postured to provide additional defensive support and to protect U.S. forces operating in the region,"" the official added.

ISRAELI MINISTERS FRUSTRATED OVER US, IDF LEAK ON LEBANON OPERATION: REPORT

Earlier on Tuesday, the Pentagon said in a readout regarding the second call Austin has held with Gallant in the last 24 hours, that the secretary ""made it clear that the United States is well-postured to defend U.S. personnel, allies, and partners in the face of threats from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist organizations and is determined to prevent any actor from exploiting tensions or expanding the conflict in the region.""

Three U.S. guided-missile destroyers have been positioned off the eastern Mediterranean to help defend Israel, including the USS Arleigh Burke, USS Bulkeley and USS Cole -- which reportedly played a closely coordinated role in defending against the Iranian attack on Tuesday.

""Today, Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel. The United States military coordinated closely with the Israeli Defense Forces to help defend Israel against this attack,"" Sullivan said. ""U.S. naval destroyers joined Israeli Air Defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles.""

In April, during the last major attack that Iran levied at Israel when it fired more than 300 drones and missiles, the USS Arleigh Burke and the USS Carney shot down more than 81 attack drones and at least six ballistic missiles using guided-missile destroyers.

The ballistic missiles were shot down using the SM-3 ballistic missile interceptors from the ships that were also positioned in the eastern Mediterranean at the time. The SM-3 has a range of up to 1,550 miles.

Israel has several of its own defense systems outside of what its offshore allies provide, including the infamous Iron Dome which is designed to intercept short-range rockets and artillery shells fired from distances of two to 43 miles away.

But it also has systems that are capable of stopping missiles fired from greater distances, like its Arrow Missile Defense System, which can intercept missiles fired from up to 1,500 miles away and above the earth's atmosphere.

The air defense system known as David's Sling is also designed to intercept enemy planes, drones, tactical ballistic missiles, medium to long-range rockets and cruise missiles fired at a range of 25 to 190 miles away.

IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said that it was believed the Iranian strikes had stopped, and told Israelis it was safe to leave their shelters.

""During the defense, we carried out quite a few interceptions. There are some impacts in the center and areas in the south of the country,"" Hagari said Tuesday night local time. ""At this stage we are still carrying out an assessment [of the attack], but we are unaware of casualties."""

Jewish American leaders on Tuesday afternoon reacted to Iran's unprecedented missile attack against Israel.

The attack, which included more than a hundred missiles, according to Israel, came in response to the recent deaths of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

""The United States stands with its only democratic ally in the Middle East, Israel, as it defends itself and its people against evil,"" Ohio Republican Rep. Max Miller told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""Iran and its proxies must stop threatening the world.""

In a Sept. 30 statement, Miller said that ""Israel's efforts to dismantle Hezbollah are making the world a safer place.""

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES AGAINST ISRAEL

""I commend the effort to eliminate Hezbollah's Secretary General, Hassan Nasrallah, who is responsible for the deaths of Americans and countless innocent civilians,"" Miller wrote. ""Civilians in Lebanon continue to suffer as Hezbollah, acting under Iran's direction, drags the country into war. The responsibility for this death and destruction rests with Hezbollah and those who seek to sow chaos and dysfunction at the behest of Tehran.""

Democratic Florida Rep. Jared Moskowitz said Iran ""made a mistake"" in a Tuesday post to his personal X account, adding that the country ""has put its nuclear facilities on the board as fair game.""

From his official congressional account, Moskowitz said his ""thoughts are with the people of Israel tonight.""

""Iran's horrific attack, so close to October 7th, is a reminder of the threat that Israel faces every single day and why America must stand with our ally against the Iranian regime and its terrorist proxies,"" the Florida congressman said.

New York Democratic Rep. Dan Goldman said in a Tuesday post on X that ""Hezbollah's presence at the border is in violation of UN Security Council Resolution 1701, which was the basis for a ceasefire in 2006.""

""If the UN and international community will not enforce 1701, then Israel must do so to prevent Hezbollah from continuing to attack Israel,"" he wrote.

Dov Hikind, former Democratic New York State assemblyman, said ""Iran's [n]uclear sites must be destroyed"" in a Tuesday post on X.

""Would like to know who the hell is the President of the United States at this moment,"" Hikind said in another post. ""My son Shmuel is in a shelter, an American citizen by the way. Let me be clear. We will win, we will endure, and we have ultimate faith that is unshakable. Wish I could be in Israel right now.""

The Republican Jewish Coalition also posted a statement on X following Iran's attack, saying the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal, or Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), ""allowed Tehran to develop ballistic missiles, which are now being used to indiscriminately target 10 million Israeli civilians.""

""Kamala Harris proudly supported the disastrously flawed deal. She would be a total disaster as Commander-in-Chief,"" the group wrote."

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan says that the Iranian missile attack on Israel was ""defeated and ineffective"" and that the U.S. military coordinated with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to repel the strikes.

Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel on Tuesday, Sullivan said at a Tuesday White House briefing, noting the move was a ""significant escalation.""

The strikes were in response to the deaths of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders, Iran says. The move comes after weeks of Israeli strikes against Tehran's proxies in the region.

Sullivan said no deaths were reported on the Israeli side, although the White House is monitoring the reported death of a Palestinian civilian in Jericho in the West Bank.

""U.S. naval destroyers joined Israeli Air Defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles. President Biden and Vice President Harris monitored the attack and the response from the White House Situation Room, joined in person and remotely by their national security team,"" Sullivan said.

""We do not know of any damage to aircraft or strategic military assets in Israel. In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective. The word fog of war was invented for a situation like this. This is a fluid situation.""

Many missiles were intercepted by Israel's missile defense systems, while others did hit the ground.

The Pentagon says the U.S. fired approximately 12 interceptors against Iranian missiles.

""This is a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event, and it is equally significant that we were able to step up with Israel and create a situation in which no one was killed in this attack in Israel... We are now going to look at what the appropriate next steps are to secure, first and foremost, American interests and then to promote stability to the maximum extent possible as we go forward,"" Sullivan said.

He said the U.S. will consult with the Israelis on next steps in terms of response and how to deal with the Iranian attack.

The White House is particularly focused on protecting U.S. service members in the region and implored American citizens in Lebanon to follow the State Department's guidance of finding civilian commercial means to leave the country, Sullivan said.

Sullivan also expressed his condolences to the victims who were killed in a shooting in the Israeli city of Jaffa, located near Tel Aviv on Tuesday. At least eight people were killed and at least seven injured, local officials have told Fox News.

The incident, which is believed to be a terror attack, took place Tuesday outside a newly built light rail station on Jerusalem Street. Authorities say at least two individuals who opened fire on a crowd of people have been neutralized.

Reporter Taylor Lorenz announced she left The Washington Post on Tuesday after being absent for weeks following a viral controversy involving her calling President Biden a ""war criminal.""

Lorenz went viral in August after a screenshot obtained by the New York Post's Jon Levine appeared to show her calling President Biden a ""war criminal"" in an Instagram post while attending a White House event. Lorenz initially implied the caption was edited by someone else before admitting that she shared the post herself.

As part of the launch of her User Magazine Substack, she explained ""why I'm leaving legacy media,"" saying her type of reporting ""has become increasingly difficult to do in corporate media.""

The Post confirmed her exit.

WASHINGTON POST'S TAYLOR LORENZ SAYS BIDEN 'WAR CRIMINAL' POST WAS 'OBVIOUS MEME' AFTER CLAIMING IT WAS EDITED

""We are grateful for the work Taylor has produced at The Washington Post. She has resigned to pursue a career in independent journalism, and we wish her the best,"" a spokesperson for The Washington Post told Fox News Digital.

For several weeks, The Post remained mum about whether Lorenz had been suspended from the paper over the controversy. Lorenz had not had anything published since Aug. 7. A spokesperson from the paper previously said it was ""looking into"" Lorenz's post but did not provide any updates until Oct. 1, confirming Lorenz's exit from the paper.

WASHINGTON POST LOOKING INTO ALLEGATIONS TAYLOR LORENZ PUBLISHED INSTAGRAM POST CALLING BIDEN A 'WAR CRIMINAL'

Lorenz previously told Fox News Digital that she was on an overseas vacation and implied she would be back to work at The Post the week of Sept. 30.

Meanwhile, Lorenz has remained active via her personal Substack newsletter as well as her podcast, which is produced by Vox.

It remains unclear whether Lorenz was officially suspended over her Instagram post.

The controversy began when Lorenz attended the White House Creator Economy Conference last month, where Biden made an appearance.

In the viral image shared by Levine, a masked Lorenz was seen taking a selfie with Biden speaking in the background. Included was a caption that read ""War criminal"" with a frowny face.

Fox News Digital learned the post was made in an Instagram story specifically using the ""close friends"" feature as indicated by the green star icon, meaning it was not posted publicly and could only have been seen by a select group of Instagram users of her choosing.

Lorenz initially denied the post's authenticity, replying to Levine, ""You people will fall for any dumba-- edit someone makes.""

However, not only did Lorenz later admit it was real, she insisted it was a joke.

""I literally never denied it was real,'"" Lorenz told one critic on X. She told another that it was an ""obvious meme.""

There had been speculation online that Lorenz was making an obscure reference to musician Lucy Dacus, who called former President Obama a ""war criminal"" on social media last year, also with a frowny face.

NPR previously reported that ""four people with direct knowledge"" of the post ""confirmed its authenticity.""

""Only about 7 people saw the actual close friends post (I have very few people on CF) and almost all are my normie non-media friends. So [I don't know] who this guy is talking about [to be honest],"" Lorenz reacted to NPR's reporting.

The Israel Defense Force (IDF) has met little resistance since announcing its ""limited"" invasion of southern Lebanon early Tuesday morning local time, a move aimed to subvert Hezbollah's buildup along the shared border.

Israel has been increasing its strikes for weeks against the terrorist organization in southern Lebanon, as well as with targeted strikes in Beirut.

On Tuesday, the IDF confirmed in a statement shared with Fox News Digital that since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel - after which Hezbollah began striking military posts along Israel's northern border - the IDF has conducted dozens of ""targeted operations"" to ""dismantle Hezbollah's terrorist capabilities"" that pose a threat to civilians in the north.

ISRAELI MINISTERS FRUSTRATED OVER US, IDF LEAK ON LEBANON OPERATION: REPORT

IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Tuesday that IDF special forces have entered Hezbollah compounds in ""dozens of locations"" along the Israel-Lebanon border, collected intelligence and dismantled positional strongholds.

""Our soldiers entered Hezbollah's underground infrastructures, exposed Hezbollah's hidden weapon caches, and seized and destroyed the weapons, including advanced Iranian-made weapons,"" Hagari said. ""Overall, IDF soldiers exposed and dismantled over 700 Hezbollah terror assets during these operations. And there's a lot more work to do.""

Since the war began nearly a year ago, Israeli special forces reportedly began conducting small raids in southern Lebanon, in some cases utilizing the very tunnels Israel seized from the terrorist group years prior, and renewed attention has been brought to how the Hezbollah network operates.

The terrorist group for years has relied on its heavy entanglement in civilian life, particularly in southern Lebanon, where it has rented civilian infrastructure to serve as weapons depots and even missile launcher sites. Civilian buildings have also been used to cover entrances to the group's sophisticated tunnel network that is estimated to stretch over 100 miles in length cumulatively across the region.

But despite the feared all-out war that had the potential to erupt upon Israel's invasion of its northern neighbor, Hezbollah's resistance has been minimal.

PENTAGON SENDING A 'FEW THOUSAND' PERSONNEL TO MIDDLE EAST DAY AFTER BIDEN SAID HE WOULDN'T ADD COMBAT TROOPS

Security experts feared Hezbollah's longtime backing from Iran would enable it to levy as many as 8,000 rockets per day in a worse case scenario, and its more than 50,000 operatives, including the elite Radwan forces, could pose a significant threat against an Israeli ground campaign.

Hagari confirmed to reporters Tuesday that IDF forces were actively working to dismantle Radwan infrastructure near the border in southern Lebanon.

""We need to take care of it because we will not let another 7th of October occur next to our border,"" he said.

In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks, the IDF assessed that some 2,400 Radwan terrorists, along with another 500 Palestinian Jihadists trained by the elite force, were positioned in villages across southern Lebanon poised to attack.

But the IDF on Tuesday also highlighted that Hezbollah failed to mount a counter force in response to Israel's incursion.

Jonathan Conricus, former IDF spokesperson and current senior fellow for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah's near-complete lack of a counter force could be explained by several reasons.

""The IDF conducted hundreds of special operations during the last months to map and analyze Hezbollah's hostile infrastructure in civilian houses in southern Lebanon, as well as targeted aerial campaigns against Hezbollah personnel,"" he said. ""Hezbollah terrorists sustained severe casualties and started to flee from southern Lebanon.

""It remains unclear how many Hezbollah militants remain in the south,"" he added.

Given the unknown number of terrorists who fled the south, most likely to other strongholds in Beirut and in central Lebanon, reporters questioned the current IDF spokesman if this could mean that Israel will need to expand its operations north.

""We're not going to Beirut,"" Hagari told reporters, emphasizing Israel's stated goal to return its citizens to their northern homes. ""We are focusing in the area of those villages, the area next to [the] border. And we will do, in this area, what is necessary to dismantle and demolish Hezbollah's infrastructure.""

Hagari would not provide specifics on the operational timeline but said Israel's campaign in Lebanon would be conducted in ""days [to] weeks."""

""The United States has indications that Iran is preparing to imminently launch a ballistic missile attack against Israel,"" the official said. ""We are actively supporting defensive preparations to defend Israel against this attack. A direct military attack from Iran against Israel will carry severe consequences for Iran.""

Another U.S. official told Fox News that Iran could launch its attack as soon as Tuesday afternoon, saying that the U.S. has seen additional movement of missiles in Iran to prepare for the now ""imminent"" attack.

The official added that Iran's attack could look like the one it launched in April against Israel, which had more than 300 ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones.

While the U.S. official did not know what the exact scope or size will be, the official said that Iran has been at a state of readiness to launch an attack on Israel within 12 to 24 hours since early August following the July 31st assassination of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

Iran already launched an unprecedented direct attack on Israel in April, though the regime's proxies, Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon, have traded attacks with Israel since the Israel-Hamas war began on Oct. 7.

On Tuesday, Israel was beginning a limited ground invasion into southern Lebanon against Hezbollah targets. Hezbollah, the most powerful armed group in the Middle East, has been reeling from weeks of targeted strikes that killed its leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several of his top commanders.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are hours away from the first and only vice presidential debate.

As the latest Fox News Power Rankings reveal, Vance starts the evening with a lead on the economy and immigration, while Walz has an advantage on abortion.

Vice presidential hopefuls do not attract as much attention as their bosses when they debate, but as Fox News' Arnon Mishkin argued Monday, they have changed the direction of at least six elections in the last 50 years.

In most cases, these debates are won on policy. Voters are not as familiar with these nominees as they are with former President Donald Trump or even Vice President Kamala Harris, and they do not need to make their choice.

The smart play for these vice presidential candidates is to focus on the major issues at stake and how their administrations would solve them.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS TICKS UP AND SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE

That is especially true for Walz on the economy and immigration, since the Harris campaign continues to lag on those issues. Vance, meanwhile, has struggled with poor favorability ratings, so his challenge is to hammer the popular parts of the Trump agenda and avoid wading into the culture war trenches.

There are also style points up for grabs. Many voters will only ever see this debate in short clips on social media, so acting like a policy wonk is less likely than ever to get the job done.

Trump continues to hold an advantage on two of the top three issues in this campaign. He leads on the economy by nine points and immigration by 11.

Those numbers have barely budged since Harris and Trump debated. In August, when the Power Rankings last looked at the major issues, the former president led on the economy by eight and immigration by 13.

Harris is far out in front on abortion. She leads by 17 points on that issue, also a negligible movement since the last tracker (Harris +18).

This tracker includes polls from Fox News, Quinnipiac, CNN/SSRS, NBC News and the New York Times/Siena.

Trump lost a point in the horse race after his debate with Harris while the vice president gained one; these modest shifts mirrored those after the first debate in 2020.

Together, these results suggest that the cause of Trump's slight decline was style rather than substance.

Conversely, while Harris won the debate and held on to her advantage on abortion, she has not consistently closed the issues gap, particularly on immigration.

That is not ideal for her, given the economy (38%) and immigration (17%) are two of the top three issues for voters. A recent Fox News national survey showed those issues and abortion (16%) were the only three that a double-digit percentage of voters called their ""most important"" issue in deciding their vote.

According to the same survey, Harris has strong leads in issues outside the top three. That includes health care, helping the middle class and climate change. These are ""bread and butter"" issues that the left has relied on to drag out base voters in previous elections.

The Democratic candidate also has a lead in uniting the country and, as consistent with previous trackers, having the right temperament for the job.

The candidates are evenly divided on national security. Neither has an advantage in handling a crisis that puts the country at risk, being commander in chief or decisions about using nuclear weapons. Trump's temperament deficit should give Harris an opportunity to lead on some of these qualities, but that has not materialized.

ARNON MISHKIN: JD VANCE IS AN EXCELLENT DEBATER AND PRACTICES FOR THE DEBATE EVERY SUNDAY

Finally, voters prefer Trump on foreign policy. He has a six-point lead in handling the Israel/Hamas war and an eight-point lead on the Ukraine/Russia war.

Tuesday is debate night. Walz and Vance will face off at an event hosted by CBS News in New York City. Fox News will simulcast the debate with special coverage anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum at 8:20 p.m. ET.

Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate to be moderated by MacCallum and Baier in October.

Voters can now cast a ballot in more than half of all states, including Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin and North Carolina.

Israel orders Lebanon evacuations as limited ground operation against Hezbollah is underway,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/live-news/israel-lebanon-invasion-hezbollah-oct-1,2024-10-01T10:32:36Z,"IDF tells Lebanon residents to 'save your lives and evacuate your homes immediately'

The Israel Defense Forces' Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee is urging residents of dozens of villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate their homes Tuesday as the limited ground operation against Hezbollah is underway.

""Hezbollah's activities are forcing the IDF to act against it. The IDF does not want to harm you, and for your safety, you must evacuate your homes immediately,"" he wrote on X. ""Anyone who is near Hezbollah members, installations, and combat equipment is putting [their] life at risk. Any home used by Hezbollah for its military needs is expected to be targeted.

""You must immediately head north of the Awali River. Save your lives and evacuate your homes immediately,"" he added. ""Be careful, you are not allowed to head south. Any head south could put your life at risk. We will let you know when it is safe to return home.""

The IDF announced earlier Tuesday that it was carrying out ""limited and targeted"" raids along Israel's northern border against the terrorist group Hezbollah.

The raids come after Israeli airstrikes over the last week killed multiple top members of Hezbollah, including the group's leader, Hassan Nasrallah."

"Minnesota comfort-food classic, hot beef commercial, is the 'most delicious thing you can eat'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/minnesota-comfort-food-classic-hot-beef-commercial-delicious-thing-you-can-eat,2024-10-01T09:49:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Hot beef commercial is the perfect comforter to blanket the belly during cold northern autumns and winters.

""It's just the most delicious thing you can eat,"" said Minnesota native Greg Urban.

The nightclub owner, who lives in St. Paul, fondly recalls savoring the beef, mashed potato and gravy sandwiches at Charlie's Café in Freeport, while on trips to the family's North Woods cabin with his grandfather.

TWIN CITIES TAVERNS TURN THE CHEESEBURGER INSIDE OUT: 'OOEY, GOOEY SENSATION'

Hot beef commercial is a casual-dining classic common in the pubs, sports bars and family restaurants of Minnesota.

It's found straight west across Interstate 90 all the way to the Black Hills of South Dakota.

Hot beef commercial is essentially chopped or shredded beef served on slices of good ol' white bread with mashed potatoes -- then doused with a generous pool of thick beef gravy.

Hardly haute cuisine.

""But it don't get much better,"" added Urban, owner of Wild Greg's Saloons in Florida and Texas.

He closed his original Minneapolis location amid the fallout from Black Lives Matter riots and COVID-19 restrictions.

BOAR'S HEAD DITCHES LIVERWURST, A ONCE-POPULAR SANDWICH STAPLE THAT AMERICANS NO LONGER STOMACH

The culinary idiom hot beef commercial has many origin stories.

""Traveling salesmen, traveling for commercial business, eat commercials,"" food writer Dara Moskowitz Grumdahl reported in a 2019 hot beef commercial treatise for Mpls.St.Paul Magazine.

""It don't get much better.""

That account was relayed to her by the owner of hot beef commercial hot spot Bump's Family Restaurant in Glencoe.

Ashley Revering, the manager of Charlie's Café, believes the name grew out of a popular local commercial jingle that promoted hot beef sandwiches decades ago.

Any advertising is gone, but hot beef commercial remains the most popular item at Charlie's Café, the manager said.

ISRAEL'S FAVORITE COMFORT FOOD, SHAKSHUKA, IS A HOT TASTE TREND RICH IN TRADITION, GLOBAL INFLUENCES

The most likely origin story is that the hearty comfort-food sandwiches were traditionally made with low-quality or ""commercial"" grade beef.

Braised slow and low like a pot roast and doused in gravy, the tougher-cut meat was rendered tender and delicious.

Its traditional popularity in Minnesota appears to trace its roots to the state's hearty lumberjack and farming legacy.

""Men on farms get hungry. That's the rough shape of what I heard again and again,"" wrote Grumdahl.

Some fear now that the hot beef commercial tradition is waning as Minnesotans, and humans in general, lose connection with harder lives that require heartier food.

""For the first half of the 20th century, Minnesotans lived - and ate - modestly,"" wrote Grumdahl.

""We made our bread at home. We mashed our own potatoes. We bought the second-best beef. And, with a little flour and a lot of time, we made something wonderful for it: gravy."""
State Department diplomat worked on project claiming Hezbollah's aim is to 'achieve social justice',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/state-department-diplomat-previously-wrote-puff-pieces-on-radical-islamic-terrorists-social-justice,2024-10-01T09:23:31Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A U.S. State Department diplomat was previously involved in a project spotlighting influential figures in the Middle East, which included descriptions of some designated terrorists as individuals aiming to achieve ""social justice.""

Usra Ghazi is a foreign service officer, who got her first stint in the department during the Obama administration in 2015, briefly leaving in 2018. She returned again in 2019 as a diplomat.

The State Department's security clearance process for this role is rigorous; Fox News Digital asked the State Department how Ghazi's process went. ""Due to privacy considerations, the Department cannot provide any information regarding any current or former employees' security clearance,"" they said in a statement, which also confirmed she is currently an employee.

From 2009-2010, Ghazi edited and prepared two of the first editions of a textbook publication called ""The 500 Most Influential Muslims."" The text harshly criticizes attempts to reform traditional Islam, calling modernism ""an object of derision and ridicule [that] is scorned by traditional Muslims and fundamentalists alike.""

STATE DEPARTMENT MANDATES SUPPORT FOR DEI IDEOLOGY AS PREREQUISITE FOR PROMOTIONS: 'YOU ARE JUDGED'

Ghazi worked on the textbook while she studied abroad in Amman, Jordan, at the ""Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre"" from 2009-2010, according to her LinkedIn.

Ghazi went abroad as a participant in an international exchange program sponsored by the Clinton Global Initaitive and the office of Queen Rania of Jordan.

The academic work at times used soft language surrounding America-hating terrorists, like Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

The publication Ghazi worked on described the terror group Hezbollah as a ""social justice"" movement and an ""International Symbol of Resistance Against Israel,"" according to the publication.

""Hezbollah is a Shi'a Islamic political party and paramilitary organization based in Lebanon. Hezbollah's ideology is based on seeking social justice through Islamic ideals,"" the publication spotlighting the influence of Hassan Nasrallah said.

The long-time Hezbollah leader Nasrallah was killed last week in an Israeli airstrike.

""Political and military successes have made Nasrallah a vastly influential figure in Lebanon, and in the Middle East more broadly. Nasrallah and Hezbollah are also controversial; the US and Canada list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization,"" the description continued.

It then went on to tout Hezbollah's social justice mission.

""Israel remains a key issue for the Muslim world and Hezbollah's aim to achieve social justice there is central to its activities,"" the text said.

""Hezbollah has also won significant grassroots support by cultivating a social welfare system that provides schools, clinics, and housing in the predominantly Shi'a parts of Lebanon, and also in others. These welfare activities are run with efficiency and rival those carried out by the state, giving the organization even broader appeal,"" it continued.

The State Department said its position on Hezbollah was ""quite clear"" and referred Fox News Digital to Monday's State Department briefing, where spokesperson Matt Miller condemned the group as a terrorist organization and stressed Israel's right to defend itself.

PENTAGON EQUITY CHIEF PRAISES BOOK CALLING 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS 'MENACES' AS SHE PUSHES FOR 'REVOLUTION'

The 2009 edition of ""500 Most Influential Muslims"" spotlighted Khaled Mashaal, describing him as one of the most prominent leaders of Hamas, as a ""Fighter for Social Justice"" and ""Pioneer."" The blurb did mention, as the one noted above, that the U.S. considers Hamas a terrorist organization.

""Since becoming head of Hamas, Mashaal has seen the organization through multiple attempts at a roadmap to peace and a major Israeli siege of the Gaza Strip,"" it said.

""Mashaal has been recognized for his persistence with Hamas's efforts -- at present leading in exile from Syria. His determination is combined with a unique effort at diplomacy,"" it said. ""Mashaal has been one of the most direct, and candid leaders in dialogue and confrontation with Israel and this has garnered international recognition.""

In addition to working at the State Department, Ghazi is currently involved in ""America Indivisible"" as a senior adviser, according to her LinkedIn. She was previously its director from 2018-2019. America Indivisible currently promotes its publication from 2020 on its site, recommending that people read ""credible sources"" like ""MuslimGirl"" in order to combat religious intolerance.

MuslimGirl's objective is to draw awareness ""to the Qur'an's message of gender equality and Islam's principle of peace,"" according to the website's description.

Fox News Digital's previous review of MuslimGirl found that it was filled with articles containing pro-Palestinian propaganda from 2016 to the present.

NEW STATE DEPARTMENT DIVERSITY CHIEF BELIEVES US IS A 'FAILED HISTORIC MODEL' WITH A 'COLONIZING PAST'

For example, one week after the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, MuslimGirl published an article which said, ""Was it plausible to believe that [the Palestinians] would remain passive forever?""

The piece also questioned whether associating Hamas with terrorism was political.

""The term 'terrorist'... warrants careful consideration,"" the article said. ""How... can this label be applied to those defending their homeland...""

""MuslimGirl Staff"" published an article in May 2021 that said that evangelical Christians were a ""threat,"" while also claiming that evangelicals are more dangerous to Jews than Palestinians.

Fox News Digital contacted the State Department for comment in March asking questions about Ghazi's affiliation with America Indivisible, particularly given its recommendation of MuslimGirl. In the months that followed, Ghazi had not changed her public affiliation with America Indivisible."
Morning Glory: Israel unbound,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-israel-unbound,2024-10-01T09:20:06Z,"'Special Report' panelists discuss the latest presidential polling in key battleground states as Election Day inches closer.

When Israeli Prime Minister visited the United States at the invitation of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) this past summer, the Congressional leaders intended the visit to be a gesture of support for our embattled ally.

But Vice President Harris, who ought to have presided at the joint session of Congress in her role as President of the Senate along with Speaker Johnson -- with both seated behind Netanyahu -- instead skipped the Israeli PM's address to the joint session of Congress on July 24. Harris thus sent a very public message to her supporters -- she did not care to reschedule previous commitments though Netanyahu's visit was long in planning -- and then met with Netanyahu privately as did President Biden.

Whatever the President and Vice President said to the Prime Minister after what the Vice President did by way of very visible messaging, Netanyahu embraced a different strategy for Israel after his return to Jerusalem. Two months later, when Netanyahu returned to the states to deliver a fiery address the United Nations General Assembly last week, that new strategy had already rolled out in large part in the region, though it is crescendoing still.

First, Israel took the war everywhere in Gaza, and Hamas is all but obliterated as an organized fighting force though 101 hostages remain in the terrorists' tunnel network and the condition of Yahya Sinwar is unknown. Sinwar's military commander, Mohammed Deif, was killed in an Israeli air raid in southern Gaza on July 13, though that news was not confirmed until after Netanyahu's visit to Congress.

Not long after Netanyahu's return to Israel, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated on July 31 along with his personal bodyguard while in the Iran's capital of Tehran.

Fuad Shukr, a senior commander in Iran's proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, was killed by the Israeli Air Force a day earlier, on July 30. Hezbollah's top military commander thereafter, Ibrahim Aqil, and 10 other senior commanders of Hezbollah's elite ""Radwan Force"" -- structured as special operation forces trained to invade Israel and hold terriroty -- were killed in an air strike on September 20.

On September 28 the leader of Hezbollah, its ""Secretary General"" for four decades, Hassan Nasrallah, and at least 10 other senior members of the terror organization were killed in a massive Israeli air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Among the dead was also at least one senior general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iranian state media confirmed General Abbas Nilforoushan, 58, had been at the doomed conference in Nasrallah's underground bunker.

HAMAS LEADER KILLED IN LEBANON WAS UN EMPLOYEE, AGENCY CONFIRMS

In the middle of these strikes at all of the senior terror leadership in Lebanon, hundreds if not thousands of Hezbollah terrorists and their accomplices in Lebanon were killed or wounded in the beeper and walkie-talkie attack that astonished the world. (Israel has not claimed responsibility for this attack.)

Over the weekend, strikes continued on the remaining senior leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and other terror groups and a second round of punishing air strikes on significant assets in Yemen were conducted by the Israeli Air Force in reprisals for that country's ruling terrorists attacks on Israeli via ballistic missiles.

There were also reports on Monday that the Israeli special forces had been conducting raids in southern Lebanon, including inside of Hezbollah's vast tunnel network, in preparation for ground operations to secure northern Israel from the threat of ongoing attacks against the Jewish State which began on October 8th, the day after the barbaric Hamas massacre of 1,200 inside the southern border of Israel (and the kidnapping of 250 more, more than a hundred of whom have been rescued or released via negotiations last fall.) A desperate and disorganized Hamas seems incapable of even responding to proposals for hostage exchanges and the IDF is going about methodically destroying Gaza's 500 miles of terrorist tunnels.

Netanyahu and his governing coalition got stronger this weekend as a former ally turned rival became an ally again as Gideon Saar brought his ""New Hope"" party into the governing coalition led by Netanyahu and his Likud party.

What this week and the next four that follow right up to the United States presidential election will bring in Israel, Lebanon, Gaza and the entire region is unknown, but what is clear is that Israel does not feel in the least constrained by President Biden and his team and their mantra of ""de-escalation.""

Israel tried every tactic requested by the United States, did its best to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage deal, and was repeatedly spurned by the terrorists in Gaza. (The consequences of the U.S.-enforced delays will be assessed after the wars conclude.) Though Vice President Harris had ""studied the maps"" of Rafah and publicly concluded that Israel could not evacuate the more than a million Palestinians taking refuge there, Israel in fact did just that, and without loss of innocent life save those of the soldiers of the IDF killed in the Rafah operations and six hostages Hamas terrorists ruthlessly executed, including an American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin.

At the same time as the Gaza War intensified, Israel hammered Iran's other proxies in Lebanon and Yemen, both of which -- Hezbollah and the Houthis -- had kept up a barrage of rocket, drone and missile strikes on the Jewish State.

After Netanyahu's visit to the Congress and his snub by the possible next president, it seems clear he returned to Israel resolved to prosecute Israel's seven front war on his terms, not those of the United States, which itself continues to be subject to missile and drone barrages against its fleet and land forces in the region and to reply only intermittently. Nothing the United States has done can compare with Israel's withering counter-attacks. Israel is restoring deterrence in the region and Iran, which threatened to strike back against Israel, has not yet attempted a reprise of its direct assault on Israel in April.

Whatever Biden and Harris and all their senior officials intended Israel to do, unless they recommended Netanyahu do all of the above, then Israel has shrugged off the demands made of it by the appeasement-driven Biden-Harris administration.

Perhaps Netanyahu is simply unwilling to risk what are widely expected to be the anti-Israel policies of Harris should she win. Perhaps he took the measure of President Biden and concluded the American Commander-on-Chief is spent and not really in command at all.

Correlation is, of course, not causation. But whatever Biden and Harris said to Netanyahu in July, unless it was ""Go get them,"" the Israeli Prime Minister has decided to protect his people and not his friendships with the clueless foreign policy blob inside the Beltway."
"Hezbollah terrorists engaged in sex slavery, rape, mass murder of Syrians",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-terrorists-engaged-sex-slavery-rape-mass-murder-syrians,2024-10-01T08:07:05Z,"JERUSALEM -- Photos of Syrians celebrating the assassination of Hezbollah terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah last week put the spotlight on the brutal activities of the terror group's role in sex slavery, mass starvation and kidnappings in the Syrian civil war which led to the deaths of over half a million Syrians.

Walid Phares, a leading expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah has ""committed ethnic cleansing"" in Syria. He said Hezbollah ""was behind the uprooting of millions of Syrians, of all communities, mainly Sunni. They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Israel's targeted assassination of Nasrallah last weekend has prompted greater interest in the inner workings of the Shiite terrorist organization that is widely considered the de facto ruler over Lebanon.

IRAN OFFICIAL ADMITS COUNTRY'S ROLE IN TERROR BOMBING THAT KILLED 241 US MILITARY MEMBERS: REPORT

The Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist entity is mainly known in America for bombing the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people in 1983, and the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut also in 1983, resulting in the murders of 241 U.S. military personnel.

A new investigative video series by the Center for Peace Communications (CPC) shines a rare light on the U.S.-designated terrorist movement Hezbollah's role in sexual slavery, rape and mass murder. The shocking expose about Hezbollah's enslavement of a Syrian woman aired days after Israel reportedly launched devastating explosions of pagers held by thousands of Hezbollah terrorists across Lebanon in September.

CPC President Joseph Braude told Fox News Digital ""Hezbollah's war on Israel obscures its larger war to subjugate much of the region -- as a tyrant in Lebanon, an occupier in Syria, a mafia of sex and drug trafficking, and the nerve center of Iran's Arab empire. Millions of Arabs whose lives have been shattered by the militia want a different future. Hezbollah does not want the world to hear their voices.""

CPC's previous series, called ""Whispered in Gaza,"" which was viewed over 20 million times, led to a Fatwa being issued against Hamas by Iraqi and Pakistani clerics. It was used by Gaza anti-Hamas activists during the July 2023 street protests against the terror organization's rule.

He added ""'Hezbollah's Hostages,' an eight-part series produced by the Center for Peace Communications and presented by The Free Press, features the actual recorded testimony of Lebanese and Syrian civilians in Hezbollah's grip. To protect their identities and honor their lives, each recorded interview is accompanied visually by creative images and animation.""

One video depicts the kidnapping and sexual enslavement of Alya, a married 20-year-old woman from the northern Syrian city of Raqqa. She reveals how Yusuf, a member of Hezbollah, ""stalked"" her for months and eventually took her hostage.

Hezbollah took the side of the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad after civilians launched a protest movement in 2011 to secure democracy in the highly repressive nation.

Hezbollah terrorists aided Assad in his scorched-earth campaign to wipe out opposition to his regime, resulting in the killing of over 500,000 people. Syria is now a fragmented and war-ravaged country.

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

""They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Hezbollah's ally, the Sunni terrorist movement Hamas, engaged in rapes and sustained sexual assaults of Israeli women and men after the jihadi terrorist organization invaded Israel on Oct. 7.

Hezbollah joined Hamas' war against Israel on Oct. 8 when it launched rockets into northern Israel. Hamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people on Oct. 7, including over 30 Americans.

The fundamental corruption and mafia-style criminality of Hezbollah's global organization has been examined by Matthew Levitt, the director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at The Washington Institute.

He published a 2018 report on ""Hezbollah's Corruption Crisis Runs Deep."" Levitt noted that ""some prominent figures in Hezbollah are involved in horrific criminal enterprises, including trafficking in sex and human beings."" He cited the example of Hezbollah official Ali Hussein Zeaiter, who according to media reports, was linked to ""a large prostitution network, mainly employing Syrian women.""

Hezbollah's criminal enterprise and terrorism continue to impact Americans.

HOW LEBANON'S HEZBOLLAH GROUP BECAME A CRITICAL PLAYER IN THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Zoya Fakhoury, executive director of the Amer Foundation, told Fox News Digital that ""Hezbollah is a proxy group of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that has the blood of thousands of innocent individuals, including American citizens, on their hands. The death of Hassan Nasrallah is a significant step towards accountability for many individuals but particularly for my family. My father, Amer Fakhoury, was a former U.S. hostage unlawfully detained under direct orders from Hassan Nasrallah.""

She continued, ""He was used a political pawn by Hezbollah and died because of the torture he faced in Lebanon. We hope to see the Lebanese government take this opportunity of the dismantling of Hezbollah to free Lebanon from the occupation of the Islamic Republic and work towards a path of peace.""

In August, Fox News Digital reported the new book by Fakhoury's four daughters covering a first-hand account of his detainment and the harrowing rescue operation to bring him back home to the United States in their book, ""Silenced in Beirut: American Businessman Amer Fakhour's Six-Month Ordeal as a Hostage In Lebanon.""

Walid Phares, a leading expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah has ""committed ethnic cleansing"" in Syria. He said Hezbollah ""was behind the uprooting of millions of Syrians, of all communities, mainly Sunni. They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Phares, who has advised U.S. presidential candidates on Mideast foreign policy, said the Hezbollah jihadis defend their hostage taking of women as under Islamist Sharia law that they can take women from the ""enemy camp.""

ISRAEL DEGRADES IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS IN SPECTACULAR PAGER EXPLOSION OPERATION: EXPERTS

He said there is no doubt that if Hezbollah captured Israeli women, they would treat them the same way as the enslaved Syrian women. Phares added that if Hezbollah captured a kibbutz, village or town in Israel, one ""can expect that they will kill the males and the capture the women. Some would be raped and killed and other Israeli women would be kept by Hezbollah.""

Hezbollah is not different from the Islamic state in applying jihadi ideology, said Phares. Hezbollah ""is a global threat. Look at how they treat their own women and how they separate them and organize them in the service of jihadists.""

Braude said that ""'Hezbollah's Hostages' debuted on Sept. 16, one day before pagers exploded across Lebanon. A new episode debuts every Monday through Nov. 4. In forthcoming episodes, we will probe the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahiyeh, just outside Beirut, with help from Shi'ite civilians who live there.""

He added ""Dahiyeh is the shadow capital of Lebanon -- home of Hezbollah's intelligence apparatus, politburo, and prisons -- as well as the central node to all Iran's proxies in the region, from the Houthis of Yemen to Iraq's militias to Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas. Yet the same landscape is also home to some of Hezbollah's many opponents - and in later episodes, we meet them too: Shiite veterans of the countrywide 2019 street protests, who dared to demand a different future; civic activists striving to end the war on Israel, liberate young minds, and restore the rule of law in Lebanon."""
Pennsylvania deadlock: Why Kamala picked the wrong running mate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/shows/media-buzz/pennsylvania-deadlock-why-kamala-picked-wrong-running-mate,2024-10-01T07:07:51Z,"Harris 2024 senior adviser Ian Sams reacts to reports Tim Walz is 'nervous' about the vice presidential debate and discusses VP Kamala Harris' stance on the looming port strike on 'The Story.'

If Kamala Harris loses Pennsylvania, Donald Trump is the 47th President of the United States.

Now you could say the same about Michigan or Wisconsin, but it especially seems that a Democratic candidate should be able to carry the Keystone State.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN 'UNDERWATER' IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE, DEM REP WARNS DONORS

And that's why, in my view, Kamala should have picked Josh Shapiro, its popular governor.

I have nothing against Tim Walz, of football coach fame, but I don't see what he's done for the ticket. There's a reason the campaign hasn't let him do any solo interviews - a stark contrast with JD Vance, who is constantly doing interviews and holding press conferences.

In fact, Vance now frequently takes reporters' questions in front of supporters, who boo the journalists, sometimes even before they start speaking.

We'll find out whether Walz can think on his feet when he faces off against Vance in tonight's VP debate. The most generous thing I can say is that the Coach will be rusty.

Let's look at the latest numbers.

The Real Clear Politics average has Trump leading Harris by a miniscule margin, 48.1% to 47.9%, which of course is a statistical tie.

At 538, the micro-margin in Pennsylvania is flipped, with Harris averaging 47.9% and Trump at 47.1%, another tie.

Now imagine that Shapiro, who is more of a moderate liberal than the uber-progressive Walz, was the running mate. And let's say Shapiro had brought in another 50,000 votes as the home-state guy. You can see where that would tip the balance.

Kamala didn't pick Josh for two reasons. They had a rough conversation when she interviewed him, with the governor insisting on an influential role if he were to relinquish his current job. But so what? Presidents and their veeps often don't see eye to eye. She preferred the image of Walz, hunter and fisherman, to the prospect of two East Coast lawyers.

But the more important reason is more troubling. Harris was under pressure from the anti-Israel faction in her party not to tap Shapiro, who is Jewish and a strong supporter of the Jewish state.

So the vice president effectively handed veto power to this minority faction, which basically backs the Hamas terrorists who would wipe out Israel, and would have faced a week or two of controversy as a result. I said at the time this would be a world-class mistake if she lost Pennsylvania.

The reason Harris has spent so much time in the Pittsburgh area is that the western end of the state is much more conservative than the eastern section anchored by Philadelphia. Her goal is to hold down Trump's margin in a part of the state that he'll easily win.

KAMALA HARRIS IS GETTING 'OUTHUSTLED' AND 'OUTCLASSED': JESSE WATTERS

One problem Harris faces right now is that she makes little news. By picking ""friendly"" interviewers, such as MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle, who has trashed Trump as a danger to democracy, she avoids tough questions and followups.

Visiting the Mexican border was a smart move, not just because Trump has a major lead on immigration, but because Harris broke into the news cycle, where images can count more than words, and attempted to position herself as tougher than Joe Biden on the issue.

Otherwise, I'm just hearing chunks of her stump speech in response to questions, starting with how her mother raised her. Repetition is important in politics, but if you don't throw in a few new lines, the press is left without a headline.

Meanwhile, Trump over the weekend called Harris ""mentally impaired,"" saying Biden just got old but she was born that way. He also said Harris should be impeached, and maybe prosecuted, for the way she helped run the country.

Now that is classic Trump. By using over-the-top rhetoric, he sparks a media debate about whether he's gone too far, and that debate revolves around the words ""Kamala"" and ""mentally impaired.""

IN HYPERPARTISAN ENVIRONMENT, MSNBC DRAWING FIRE FOR ANTI-TRUMP, PRO-HARRIS PROGRAMMING

Harris has wisely not responded to every Trump jab. But remember, Trump benefits from negative coverage as much as positive coverage because he's driving the news agenda.

Here's a pool report from Harris at a West Coast political event over the weekend: ""She then switched her remarks to talking about the need for comprehensive immigration reform. VP Harris remarks on the issue were very similar to her remarks in Arizona on Friday."" In other words, no news.

Think about this: Trump has been absolutely pummeled by a hostile press corps, is a twice-impeached convicted felon and carries the burden of Jan. 6. Harris has been riding an extraordinary wave of positive press, and yet she's slipped slightly in the polls and is tied in Pennsylvania.

And there's no question that if she loses there, the election is over."
Pentagon sending a 'few thousand' personnel to Middle East day after Biden said he wouldn't add combat troops,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-sending-few-thousand-us-troops-middle-east-one-day-after-biden-promised-he-wouldnt,2024-10-01T02:00:03Z,"DOD spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Monday the additional troops are to augment U.S. forces already there on heightened alert.

The Pentagon announced on Monday that it is sending a ""few thousand"" U.S. personnel to the Middle East to support Air Force squadrons a day after President Biden vowed not to send combat troops to the region.

Speaking at a press gaggle with reporters on Monday, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the U.S. was sending a ""few thousand"" more troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to defend Israel, if needed.

Biden gave a firm ""no"" when asked Sunday if he planned to deploy additional combat troops to the Middle East.

This increased presence is to include multiple warplane squadrons, complimenting the F-15s, F-16s, A-10s and F-22s already stationed in the region.

ISRAEL WILL LAUNCH 'LIMITED' GROUND INVASION IN LEBANON 'IMMINENTLY' US OFFICIAL SAYS

The planes were initially supposed to rotate in and replace the squadrons stationed there. Instead, both the current and new squadrons are to remain in place to double the available airpower because of increased tensions in the region and concern that Iran might respond to Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader last week in Lebanon.

Singh said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ""increased the readiness of additional U.S. forces to deploy, elevating our preparedness to respond to various contingencies. And DOD (Department of Defense) maintains robust and integrated air-defense capabilities across the Middle East, ensuring the protection of U.S. forces operating in the region.""

The few thousand additional personnel are not combat troops but rather maintenance crews and those who can help with the air defense mission and refueling. The additional forces would raise the total number of U.S. personnel in the region to as many as 43,000.

The Pentagon's announcement follows word that Israel has already launched limited raids across its northern border into Lebanon amid an anticipated wider ground invasion.

It also follows recent strikes into Lebanon and the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist organization. Israel is also engaged in an ongoing war in the south against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after the Palestinian terrorist group sparked the conflict with its bloody incursion into southern Israel in October 2023.

Secretary Austin announced Sunday he was temporarily extending the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and its embarked air wing in the region. A U.S. official said the extension would be for about a month.

HEZBOLLAH SAYS IT WILL CHOOSE NASRALLAH'S SUCCESSOR 'AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY'

A second U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman, sailed from Virginia last week and is en route to Europe. It will head to the Mediterranean Sea and again provide a two-carrier presence in the broader region. It's not expected to arrive for at least another week.

Biden told reporters on Monday, ""I'm more aware than you might know"" about reports that Israel is planning a limited ground campaign in Lebanon after nearly a year of trading attacks with Hezbollah in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, and he said he wants an immediate cease-fire.

When asked about the reports, Biden said he was ""comfortable with them stopping"" and that ""We should have a cease-fire now."""
Will Israel Attack Iran's Nuclear Program? Here's What To Know As Ex-PM Calls For Strikes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/10/08/will-israel-attack-irans-nuclear-program-heres-what-to-know-as-ex-pm-calls-for-strikes/,2024-10-08T21:39:57Z,"While Iran does not yet have nuclear arms, analysts believe the country's nuclear development program might be a prime target for Israeli retaliation -- despite U.S. opposition -- following Iran's missile launches at Israel, as a former Israeli prime minister argues for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

Israel and Iran are archrivals with a history of terse relations dating back to Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. A corresponding decades-long shadow war -- fueled by Iran's years of supporting Lebanese Shia militia Hezbollah and Islamist militant group Hamas -- has become a direct conflict as tensions spiked in recent years, particularly after Hamas' attack on Israel last year and Israel's intense invasion of Gaza. Israel -- alongside the U.S. and the U.N. -- has been concerned with Iranian nuclear progress since Iran started its weapons program in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Israel has spent the decades since targeting the program to prevent nuclear development through Israeli-connected missions like stealing nuclear secrets, sabotaging explosions and launching drone attacks. While Israel never took responsibility, Iran accused the country of assassinating top Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020. Iran has enough weapons-grade nuclear fuel to make three bombs and is one of the only countries without nuclear weapons that can produce 60%-enriched uranium, a quality of enriched uranium close to the 90% needed for weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal. Russian ties to Iran have deepened in recent years, and Bloomberg has reported the U.S. is concerned about the sharing of information and technology between the two countries -- a potential boon to Iran's nuclear interest. Israel is considered an undeclared nuclear weapons power because it is believed to have nuclear arms but has not confirmed possession of them, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

While hitting it would be viewed as a major escalation, Israel has long watched Iran's nuclear enrichment plant in Natanz, an enrichment facility buried in the desert with thousands of centrifuges, according to the New York Times. Other facilities, like the enrichment plant buried under a mountain in Fordow, represent another potential target, yet U.S. officials have historically blocked Israel from getting the bomber planes and weapons powerful enough for an attack so deep underground, The Times reports. But Israel's methods have used other methods than bombings or missile attacks. Israel has a strong cyberdefense program -- exhibited recently when it launched an attack that exploded wireless devices owned by Hezbollah members. Another attack believed to be from the U.S. and Iran happened in the early 2000s -- called ""Olympic Games"" and known commonly the Stuxnet virus -- was a cyberattack that used digital ""worms"" to disrupt Natanz's facility operations.

Matthew Bunn, a professor of energy, national security and foreign policy at Harvard, told Forbes that there would be no nuclear fallout, or spreading of radioactive material, from attacking a uranium enrichment facility like Natanz or Fordow. These facilities deal with uranium that has not been irradiated in a nuclear reactor, meaning it's less radioactive. In an attack, some areas may suffer ecological damage, but the result would be isolated to the limited quantity of uranium at the locations, he said.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

In mid-2018, former President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Under the Obama administration deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities and permit U.N. inspections, and in return, economic and financial sanctions set by the EU, U.S. and U.N. were lifted. The deal outlined three main points: reducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium (a key ingredient in making bombs) by 98%, stopping production of higher-grade enriched uranium for 15 years and removing two-thirds of its more than 19,000 centrifuges (machines that enrich uranium). Under the deal, it would take Iran about 12 months to make a nuclear weapon. Trump was outspoken against the deal, calling it ""too much in exchange for too little."" Since 2018, Iran has significantly advanced its nuclear program, and while there is no evidence of nuclear-armed missiles, officials are concerned about metallurgy and computer modeling research related to weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Iran's nuclear capacity is playing out as a point of contention in the 2024 presidential campaign and was the leading question posed in Tuesday's vice presidential debate, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz arguing Trump was incapable of de-escalating tensions and did not put adequate nuclear protections in place when he pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, argued the Biden-Harris administration has supported Iran financially and that ""Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure."" Trump said on Oct. 4 at a campaign event in North Carolina that Israel should ""hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later."" When asked in a 60 Minutes interview on Oct.7, Vice President Kamala Harris responded that Iran was the U.S.'s greatest foreign adversary."
On X Iran's Exiled Crown Prince Called For Peace In The Middle East,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/08/on-x-irans-exiled-crown-prince-called-for-peace-in-the-middle-east/,2024-10-08T19:16:34Z,"The exiled crown prince and self-proclaimed advocate for a secular democratic Iran shared a ""message to the friends of the Iranian people"" on Monday, calling for an end to the sectarian conflict in the Middle East and an end to the current regime in his homeland. Reza Pahlavi, who fled Iran with his family following the 1979 Islamic Revolution, took to social media to emphasize that the current fighting is ""not the Iranian people's war.""

Pahlavi further suggested that Iran bears the responsibility for the October 7, 2023, terrorist attacks on Israel and is fueling the regional conflicts.

""So I say to you, our friends across the Middle East -- our region deserves so much better. But in order to succeed, first, this regime, that has held us hostage for nearly half a century, must go,"" said Pahlavi. ""The Middle East is all too familiar with turmoil and upheaval. So, I know, you might fear change will bring chaos. But fear not -- we will not allow a power vacuum to follow the collapse of this regime.""

The exiled crown prince, who has more than 1.4 million followers on the platform formerly known as Twitter, also suggested: ""Peace is neither a relic of history, nor a distant dream, it is a promise we owe to ourselves and our children, and together we can make it a reality.""

His nearly four-and-a-half-minute-long video has been seen more than 7.7 million times since it was posted on Monday. It is unclear how many of those views could have been from within the Islamic Republic, given how tightly Tehran controls access to outside media, but the youth especially has sought out ways to access X and other Western social media platforms.

""Iran has explicitly blocked X since 2009, but it's estimated that some 70% of Iranians use VPNs to get around the general block on social media sites,"" explained Dr. Matthew Schmidt, professor of national security and political science at the University of New Haven.

""Maybe five to seven million are estimated to use X, but these are highly suspect numbers,"" added Schmidt. ""In any case, Pahlavi's message on X was repeated on many other sites, especially Telegram, which is probably the most popular banned app in Iran. Some estimates say there are as many as 45 million users, which would be roughly half the population.""

Today, Pahlavi has no official standing in the Iranian government, while his family's history is also one with a fair amount of controversy.

""His message surely got through to enough Iranians to be widely spread through one means or another. What effect it might have despite this is another story,"" said Schmidt, who acknowledged that the Pehlavi family is historically not well-liked.

""But the Crown Prince has significant support today according to a number of surveys and experts. His platform of human rights and a liberal government garner considerable support,"" Schmidt noted. ""Millions of Iranians separate their hatred of his father from the son, and his message is a call to stand up for that liberal vision, to not fear the tumult of a revolution, and to look toward the different future he is trying to represent to Iranians.""

While his calls for change may be noble, some would suggest any future Iran may not want to include members of the exiled royal family.

""Reza Pahlavi is not who he appears to be,"" warned geopolitical analyst Irina Tsukerman, president of Scarab Rising. She questioned his leadership abilities given ""the fact that he has had no professional much less government experience of any kind that would make him suitable for leadership position.""

Pahlavi has shown to be quite effective in employing social media to amplify his messaging, and according to his critics even to increase the appearance of popularity. However, some of the efforts have only divided the opposition in his homeland.

""The Iranian regime has used Pahlavi's messaging effectively to discredit any sort of opposition, divide Iranians and foster internal hatred and amplify this message and downplay alternative opposition voices which call for a liberal federalized democracy or an equitable approach to governance that would include pluralistic voices of different backgrounds,"" said Tsukerman.

It is also unlikely that this recent video message or even dozens of similar messages from the one voice would be enough to start an Iranian spring -- and not because the calendar notes that it is October.

""In theory, social media should be effective in disseminating talking points, bypassing censorship, advancing cultural knowledge and understanding, and fostering interpersonal relationships,"" said Tsukerman. ""In reality, due to the many misconceptions about the nature of the society, the Western-centric approach, the Western fixation on identifying the one 'perfect' dissident or opposition group while ignoring the diversity of voices in Iran, and the exploitation of the medium and algorithms by nefarious actors, positive and measurable impact is very difficult to achieve.""

In other words, the medium may be only as good as the understanding and the policy behind it.

In this case, the Western perception of Iran and the pragmatic approaches that bypass frauds and wishful thinking is something that needs to realign first, added Tsukerman.

""Only then can the policymakers figure out how to reach the public rather than have the conversations hijacked by bots and assorted operatives,"" she continued. ""That requires a very dedicated and nuanced approach to both intelligence gathering and communications strategy. And of course, any sort of effective discourse will be undercut by regime efforts to shut down Internet access.""

Yet, social media could still find a way of spreading anti-regime information to those desperate for change within the Islamic Republic.

""Such messages bear repeating,"" said Schmidt, ""And in what is really best understood as a political campaign conducted from afar, that message is now being carried in the best possible way: face to face, across kitchen tables one conversation at a time."""
Changemakers: Women Entrepreneurs Shaping A Better Future For Girls,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhernholm/2024/10/08/changemakers-women-entrepreneurs-shaping-a-better-future-for-girls/,2024-10-08T17:29:59Z,"The International Day of the Girl, observed on October 11, is a global day dedicated to highlighting the unique challenges girls face around the world. It serves as a platform to advocate for equal opportunities in education, healthcare and leadership, aiming to create a brighter, more equitable future for girls everywhere.

As we celebrate this day, the inspiring stories of everyday women can remind us of the power women have to make change in their communities and beyond. Each of these entrepreneurs has forged her path through resilience, creativity and a commitment to empowering others. Their journeys exemplify the limitless potential of women who pursue their passions while uplifting those around them.

PIZZA + PURPOSE

Caroline D'Amore's career trajectory has taken her from DJing around the world to walking the runways of Diane von Furstenberg to becoming a finalist on Gordon Ramsey's ""Food Stars"" in 2023, to now being known as the pink-haired activist Pizza Girl,

Prior to the pandemic, her products were sold in over 100 stores, but given the challenges that came with sourcing organic ingredients during the pandemic, she had to stop production.

D'Amore credits her daughter with inspiring her to re-launch Pizza Girl in 2021. D'Amore now has built a successful brand of pasta sauces and a countertop pizza oven, which sold out within days of the launch. She opened a store in Venice Beach, California, with a second location slated for early 2025. Her company champions quality, authenticity and social responsibility. She challenges the status quo, showing that women can lead in any industry they choose, from the boardroom to the kitchen and beyond.

D'Amore didn't always feel this confident. ""Pizza Girl started out of the frustration of not feeling heard as a young girl in my Italian pizza family,"" she explained. She was even admonished not to put the word ""Girl"" in the name of her company. Her response? Not only is it called ""Pizza Girl,"" everything from the pizza boxes to the ovens are pink.

D'Amore started using her Instagram platform to talk about more than just pizza after the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023. By sharing personal experiences from her visits to Israel in December 2023 and February 2024, D'Amore has used her business platform for broader social impact. Her dedication to justice and stance against hate form a core theme, inspiring audiences and showcasing a powerful model of purpose-driven business leadership, ""Standing up for what's right against all forms of hatred is crucial because it inspires others to be courageous in the face of injustice,"" she said.

D'Amore's story serves as an inspiring reminder that every girl has the potential to become a changemaker. She can be found on Instagram @pizzagirl and @carolinedamore and also as a guest on podcasts and stages around the world. Sharing her entrepreneurial journey and standing up against hate, D'Amore provides inspiration for girls everywhere. As she put it: ""Being able to inspire others has given my time on this earth more meaning than I ever thought possible, and it all started with one little video on Instagram asking the world to stop the hatred and calling it out as I saw it unfolding. There is no voice too small. Speaking your truth can take you places you never even imagined.""

ROOTED IN FAMILY

Chelsea Bowers and Emily O'Neill, two native Montanans, are forging their own path. Growing up with strong entrepreneurial spirits, both had businesses rooted in hard work and long hours -- Chelsea with a professional house-painting business and also assisting with hunting trips, and Emily with a catering and Dutch Oven camp cooking venture. When Chelsea married Emily's brother Phillip in 2010, the two became not only sisters-in-law but also powerful business partners.

In 2017, Chelsea and her mother, Denise, decided to start a flower shop in Livingston, Montana. The venture soon blossomed into Rooted in Montana. Though Denise eventually left due to health issues, Chelsea and Emily took a leap of faith. They credit prayer, perseverance and adaptability for helping them transform Rooted in Montana into a thriving business.

Since its inception, Rooted in Montana has expanded to offer houseplants, event florals and custom wedding designs. The sisters-in-law, now seasoned entrepreneurs, have designed flowers for almost 300 weddings and overcome challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which required them to step up their leadership and advocate for themselves and their customers.

O'Neill remembers that time: ""We were persistent when it came to the covid shutdowns in our little town. I actually called the governor's office and said that I thought that our business was an 'essential' business. This was after I got off the phone with a woman whose father passed away in Livingston, and they lived on the East Coast and weren't able to fly."" O'Neill wanted to help the woman honor her father's memory at a time when life was greatly disrupted.

Residents of the town of Livingston were adamant that businesses should be open while being respectful about safety concerns. Eventually, O'Neill heard back from the governor's office that while they could not have customers in their shop, they could offer contactless delivery. ""That was a really good day,"" recalled O'Neill.

Chelsea Bowers and Emily O'Neill's journey embodies the determination that defines so many women entrepreneurs. Their story is a powerful reminder on International Day of the Girl of how important it is to empower young girls to dream big, take risks and forge their own paths in business and beyond.

HITTING THE AIRWAYS

Julia Howe, the inspiring teen founder of the podcast Hitting The Wall, is a powerful example of how young women can make an impact in today's world. While enrolled in WIT - Whatever It Takes, a mentorship and training program for teenage entrepreneurs, Howe created the podcast to shed light on issues that often go unnoticed -- mental-health struggles, societal pressures and the importance of self-care, especially among young women.

Howe's stories of being an endurance athlete fuel meaningful conversations and demonstrate the resilience and strength that align with the values celebrated on International Day of The Girl. Her mission resonates with young girls worldwide, encouraging them to embrace their vulnerabilities and turn them into strengths. Howe's work was recently recognized as a ""force for good"" by Frigo Cheese Heads Build a Bright Future program.

Through Hitting The Wall, Howe provides a platform for voices that are often silenced. Not only does she share her own experiences on the podcast, but she also invites experts and advocates to provide listeners with practical advice and support, particularly connected to self-worth tied to body performance and appearance.

In sports, many girls push beyond their limits, with 8 in 10 showing signs of Relative Energy Deficiency, including disordered eating, menstrual issues, and risks to cardiovascular and bone health. This harmful cycle forces them to prioritize performance over well-being, leading to unhealthy training habits.

By equipping the Hitting The Wall audience -- primarily young women -- with the knowledge and tools to navigate these complexities, Howe is inspiring a global community of young women. Her work embodies the spirit of International Day of The Girl, which focuses on advocating for girls' rights, challenging gender norms, and ensuring that young women everywhere are heard, valued and empowered to make a difference. Howe explained, ""On the podcast, we talk about the things people often shy away from: disordered eating, burnout, body image. We show girls that they aren't alone in these experiences but also give them strategies to navigate them. What we most want to show these girls is that strength doesn't just come from winning races. True strength is knowing when to prioritize your health, your mind, and your well-being.""

In a world that still grapples with gender inequality and societal expectations, the achievements of these women serve as powerful reminders of the importance of empowering young girls. Their stories reflect not only personal triumphs but also a collective movement toward a future where women can lead in any industry they choose. As we honor the International Day of the Girl, let us take inspiration from these change makers and strive to create a supportive environment where every girl can dream big, embrace her unique journey and become a catalyst for change."
How CFOs Are Preparing For The Future Amid Election Uncertainty,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2024/10/08/how-cfos-are-preparing-for-the-future-amid-election-uncertainty/,2024-10-08T16:05:40Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

CFOs are taking on bigger leadership roles and more responsibility throughout the business world. A new IDC InfoBrief study commissioned by Billtrust that focuses on the order-to-cash area of business shows one area in which CFOs are leading: AI adoption.

The study surveyed several top leaders in businesses, which included some CFOs. Nearly nine in 10 respondents said CFOs are becoming more critical to their organizations because of the economic downturn and financial uncertainty, and almost as many said that digital transformation across the OTC process is critical to the survival of their businesses. More CFOs agreed that digital transformation is needed, and more are optimistic about generative AI's potential to bring some of that transformation. Two-thirds of CFOs said generative AI will have a large impact on their organization, as opposed to 59% of all people surveyed. And 44% of CFOs said generative AI will help them do their jobs faster, 9% more than the 35% of all surveyed positions.

These results show that it's time to let CFOs lead on generative AI. They've researched the possibilities and know what it can do. And as a virtue of their position and expertise, they know the financial and strategic options their companies should take to weather the current uncertainty. Companies that want to see the financial part of their business become more effective and efficient should give the CFO the respect the position is now commanding. A bonus: Other studies have shown that CFOs who are able to lead on company strategy tend to significantly outperform their peers.

Deloitte conducts a quarterly CFO survey and found in its latest results that 58% think next month's election will be at least very consequential to their organizations. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global and U.S. leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what this means for CFO planning in Q4 and beyond. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are still open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

The upbeat job data also turned the stock market upwards on Friday, but markets came crashing down Monday afternoon as crude oil prices and government bond yields rose to multiweek highs. Monday was the anniversary of the current Israel and Hamas war in the Middle East, which has recently escalated to include Lebanon and Iran, and has sent defense stocks and oil prices up. The rise in bond yields has been somewhat unexpected, though some analysts have predicted it's in response to increasing oil prices, while others have predicted it's responding to the dwindling likelihood of another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month.

According to CME FedWatch, 88.2% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.8% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Last week, organized labor seemingly notched another victory as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike. On Thursday, the U.S. Maritime Alliance offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port workers wanted a 77% wage increase and a ban on many kinds of automation. There are no proposals made public from USMX on automation, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for the time being.

Meanwhile, Boeing is back at the bargaining table with members of the International Association of Machinists union, though local news station KOMO reported negotiations appear to be at a standstill. More than 30,000 members of the union that work in the aerospace giant's factories have been off the job going on four weeks. In a note reported on by Quartz, analysts at Oxford Economics wrote the Boeing strike could impact GDP growth in Q4, similar to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene -- which caused a wide swath of devastation in the Carolinas and Florida.

The roller coaster ride for Nvidia stock continues, with the company surging to become the world's second most valuable, surpassing Microsoft, on Monday. At the close of markets on Monday, Nvidia was worth $3.132 trillion. Nvidia's stock and market capitalization has seen dramatic rises and falls in the last month and a half. After its most recent earnings report at the end of August -- in which the AI processor company delivered record earnings and smashed expectations -- its stock price tumbled because it didn't project as much growth in the next quarter as some might have wanted to see. But since then, relatively small events have caused Nvidia's stock to spike. At a Goldman Sachs conference in mid-September, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia's soon-to-come Blackwell processors was ""so great,"" leading the stock value to pop 8%. And another leap in value came last week when Huang said on a CNBC interview that demand for the new chip was ""insane."" Monday's rally came courtesy of Super Micro Computer's announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products alongside Nvidia's GPUs were strong. This seems to be proof that the AI effect is still strong on markets. The sell off in August looked like investors were stepping back until they saw that Nvidia was worth the share price. But their behavior since then -- buying up the stock whenever there is any potentially positive news -- shows they are still overly eager about the technology's possibilities.

Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey showed that most people in the position view November's election as consequential to their organizations. Even if there weren't an election featuring two candidates with wildly differing policy ideas, there are a host of significant geopolitical and economic issues CFOs need to deal with. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what that might mean. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

Considering the state of U.S. politics, geopolitics and the economy, was there anything surprising about how CFOs responded to the survey?

Gallucci: There were some things that we pulled from the data that were interesting. For example, while CFOs are still very risk averse -- less than 15% said that this was a good time to take risk -- a lot of them were actually upbeat quarter-on-quarter around the capital markets. This data was collected before the rate cut, but there was a strong expectation [of one], and all signals indicated that rates will continue to trend downward in the next four quarters. That was a pivot over the last seven or eight quarters, as rates were rising, the capital markets were very inactive. When capital markets are inactive, there's less capital spending, there's less M&A.

More than half -- 58% -- said the election will be at least very consequential for their businesses. How does that impact how CFOs run their businesses and planning?

On the day-to-day running of the business, that particular stat has not shifted. In the longer term, a lot of scenario planning is happening. When you step back and think about where we might be from a policy perspective in six months to a year, it could look different from a tariff perspective. It could look different from a labor perspective.

CFOs more broadly have built into their psyche, [and] they approach their roles with an expectation that there will be shocks to the system that come from all angles: geopolitical shocks, certainly elections. [About] 45% of the world's GDP is electing a new leader this year. CFOs have built in an attribute of being agile and able to pivot. If you trace that back, you're going to go to the pandemic. That shock threw everybody for a loop. We haven't had a world pandemic in a hundred years, per se. [Consider] how that impacted business and supply chains, particularly things like semiconductors and computer chips, and being able to get that type of product. When you lob on top of that some of the geopolitical conflicts that we've been dealing with the last couple of years, all have contributed to a much more dynamic type of environment that chief financial officers across all industries and sectors have had to manage.

Do you think most CFOs have been expecting this wildly changing stock market, and are considering that when they're looking ahead?

Without question. They're looking at a whole host of factors in terms of making decisions around capital spending, M&A, new projects. [There is] a lot of variability in all those areas -- the economy, geopolitics, consumer spending -- which gets back to some of the data that we're taking in around being less risk averse, less bullish, et cetera. You put all these factors in a basket and then you have to make business decisions.

Let's take interest rates, for example. As the Fed was on a plan to raise interest rates to fight inflation, there was a lot of unpredictability: When is it going to peak? When is it going to top out? What we have right now is a little more clarity in terms of it's on the way down. They've stated that they want to get to somewhere around two point half percent and the FOMC rate. That gives a little more certainty towards CFOs in that particular area of the private markets. They can start to plan around that. Once you have clarity in a particular area and a sense that things have less unpredictability, you'll start to see some more actions on the part of corporates and CFOs, specifically, around things like M&A and capital spending.

Some of these big question marks will be figured out six months from now. We will have another president. That person will be in office and their economic policies could be stabilizing. How do you see CFOs responding to a similar survey then?

If you look historically post-election, there's a little more certainty in terms of where things will go in the near to medium term. It's hard to handicap what all that will look like. We'll continue to be in a descending rate capital market. With that, you'll see all indications are a much more robust capital market in the way of M&A and bond issues and whatnot.

History would tell you that there could be some type of bounce and there could be more optimism. There could be another geopolitical conflict that could send the markets into a tizzy. We're dealing with things like natural disasters throughout the globe, and that has an impact. I have to hedge with what we know and we don't know.

Is The Oil Market Underestimating The Risk Of Middle East Conflict?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/guneyyildiz/2024/10/07/is-the-oil-market-underestimating-the-risk-of-middle-east-conflict/,2024-10-08T03:07:43Z,"Calm amid chaos. That's the paradox we observe in today's oil markets. Despite escalating tensions between Israel and Iran, oil prices have only seen modest increases, a departure from historical patterns. Is this a sign of maturity in the market or a dangerous complacency?

In this context, John Maynard Keynes' famous warning -- that ""the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent"" -- gains renewed relevance. As tensions between Iran and Israel rise, there is upward pressure on oil prices. On October 7, 2024, Brent crude rose 1.4% to $79.16, and WTI crude climbed 1.7% to $75.66. While prices surged last week by over 8% for Brent and 9% for WTI, the market's reaction -- while notable -- has not matched the dramatic shifts seen in previous crises. This raises the question: Is the market adequately pricing in these risks?

Geopolitical tensions in the Middle East have historically triggered significant oil price spikes. The 1973 Arab-Israeli War, for instance, quadrupled oil prices due to an embargo. Yet despite Iran's largest military strike against Israel and looming retaliatory threats, oil prices have only modestly increased.

Several factors explain this relative calm:

The Middle East remains the epicenter of global oil supply. Iran produces 3.2 million barrels per day, with 1.4 million barrels exported . The Strait of Hormuz, through which 20 million barrels pass daily, accounts for nearly 30% of global oil trade. Critical chokepoints like the Strait of Hormuz, Bab el-Mandeb, and the Suez Canal are vital arteries for the global energy supply. Additionally, the region is a key player in the production of liquefied natural gas (LNG), with about one-third of the world's LNG passing through its waters. Disruption here would be catastrophic, yet traders remain unperturbed.

Recent diplomatic efforts suggest that Iran may be cautious about disrupting regional oil flows. The Iranian President's meetings with the Saudi Foreign Minister and Qatar's Emir indicate a desire to maintain stable relations with Gulf neighbors. Recent diplomatic engagements support this view. Iran's President met with Saudi Arabia's Foreign Minister and Qatar's Emir, signaling a desire to keep relations stable. Saudi Arabia, has been pursuing a complex and rational foreign policy, and has had a political rapprochement with Tehran in recent years. This conciliation with Iran. This diplomatic balancing act could be disrupted by a major conflict, potentially impacting oil flows.

While the market's calm might seem rational given current supply-demand fundamentals, it's worth remembering the oil market's failure to predict the Russian invasion of Ukraine which serves as a stark reminder of the potential for ""black swan"" events.

Could a similar oversight be happening now? While the market relies on data and trends geopolitical events often defy prediction.

Today's oil market is often seen as dominated by algorithmic trading, where machines -- not humans -- drive price action. These sophisticated models process vast amounts of data, from inventory levels to shipping schedules, making decisions without the emotional influence of geopolitical events.

This raises an important question: Are algorithms truly in control, and does their reliance on data lead to an underestimation of geopolitical risks? Critics argue that while algorithms excel at analyzing supply-demand fundamentals, they may overlook or miscalculate the potential for black swan events -- those unpredictable occurrences that can disrupt markets.

Moreover, these systems rely on historical data, making them inherently backward-looking and ill-equipped to anticipate sudden shifts in geopolitical motivations. Treating a conflict as significant as a potential war between Iran and Israel as a ""non-event"" illustrates a flaw in algorithmic trading; these machines may miss crucial signals that could trigger the next market shock.

Is the market being complacent? Traders aren't aggressively hedging against a potential Iran-Israel conflict, treating it as a low-probability event. However, if tensions escalate, sharp price spikes could follow.

Hedge funds could shift from short to long positions, driving prices higher. However, without clear signals of such escalation, these players remain cautious.

The current calm in oil prices reflects rational analysis of supply-demand fundamentals, but it may also reveal a blind spot in assessing geopolitical risks. Markets driven by algorithms may overlook human-driven political shifts, leaving them vulnerable to shocks. As tensions in the Middle East simmer, the stakes are high, and a sudden escalation could rapidly upend market expectations.

Whether the oil market's bet on stability in the region is prudent or misguided remains to be seen. What's certain is that the consequences of a miscalculation could be severe."
Keren Nechmad & Swell Ariel Or Dive Into Netflix's 'Kissufim'  --  The Israeli 'Dazed And Confused',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshweiss/2024/10/07/keren-nechmad--swell-ariel-or-dive-into-netflixs-kissufim---the-israeli-dazed-and-confused/,2024-10-07T21:01:28Z,"Keren Nechmad didn't set out to make Israel's answer to Dazed and Confused, but that's exactly what she's done with Kissufim.

""It's a happy coincidence,"" the first-time director, a graduate of NYU's renowned film school, tells me over Zoom when I bring up the comparison between her unforgettably confident feature debut and the Richard Linklater classic. ""My intention was just to give an understanding of what it is to live on a kibbutz and how time doesn't really move much. You're just going through life. I really wanted to do an ensemble as well; to show the different types of people there are in Israel.""

Now streaming exclusively on Netflix, the coming-of-age drama takes place on the titular, Gaza-adjacent kibbutz (a collective, agrarian-based community rooted in the country's founding Socialist principles), circa 1977, where a tight-knit group of young soldiers confront an uncertain future as they finish up their requisite military service through the volunteer program known as Nachal.

Grappling with the physical and psychological trauma of the Yom Kippur War four years prior, the soldiers dream of lasting peace with their neighbors, particularly in the wake of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat making a historic détente visit to Jerusalem. Embodying that sense of optimism is Eli, a free-spirited young woman loosely based on real-world terror victim, Elian Gazit, and portrayed by Swell Ariel Or (The Beauty Queen of Jerusalem). ""It's not a war film, except at the end,"" she says. ""You don't see blood and explosions and armies fighting each other. It's very delicate and it's more around the experience of Israelis. It's a film that humanizes Israelis without even trying.""

When it came to playing a real person, Or says she wanted to capture ""the essence"" of the individual rather than get bogged down in minutiae. ""It was more important to share her heart and how she would have lived her life if she didn't die. I focused more on that and after the film came out, her mother and sister approached me. That's the most important thing when you play a character based on [a real person] who still has living relatives; when they reach out and are moved by what you did.""

Like any great Bildungsroman put to screen -- whether it's American Graffiti or Dazed and Confused -- Kissufim eschews the traditional character arc format in favor of an anti-plot comprised of laid back vignettes centered around the bittersweet, yet intoxicating, milestones along the road to adulthood: first love, crushing heartache, wild rites of passage, playing pranks on friends, mocking authority figures, boozy parties, and everything in between. ""It worked against everything I learned and I loved it,"" Nechmad says of the unorthodox screenplay she co-wrote alongside Hadar Arazi and Yonatan Bar-Ilan. ""It freed me from the structure I was taught.""

To foster an organic sense of camaraderie that would show up on-camera, Nechmad made her cast spend as much time together as possible. ""I blamed Covid-19 and said, 'We need to be safe, so we need to just spend time with each other and nobody else,'"" she reveals. ""And they listened. Everybody was getting along so well and they became a core group. Because we spent a week-and-a-half filming on location [on the kibbutz], we all lived in the same cabins. Every night, we would sit together after filming and talk until someone came out of their room and shushed us.""

""It was a summer camp for grown-ups,"" agrees Or, ""which included a lot of going out and going to the beach and drinking and dancing. It was really fun.""

The key difference between this film and its genre predecessors, of course, is that these main characters are reluctantly forced to grow up before their time, having been born in one of the most embattled regions on the planet. It's something Nechmad hopes to impress upon viewers from countries lucky enough to avoid the specter of regular conflict.

""I grew up listening to my father's stories and, as child, I was like, 'Oh, another story from the army, another story of you growing up,'"" she recalls. ""But then I went to the army and I was like, 'Wait, all the stories he told me are resonating with what I'm going through.' This story of young people trying to find adulthood in Israel and maturity in the face of war is a multigenerational thing. You put your dreams on hold or process them in a different way and grow up and learn responsibility; learn there's something bigger than you -- for the good and the bad.""

To that end, Kissufim was always meant to be a timeless story. Despite its late '70s setting, Nechmad wasn't too worried about using period-specific lingo or music. ""I wanted the old meets the new to come to life in the film because it's telling a story that's outside of the timeframe in a sense. It could be anywhere, anytime. I think I could [set] it anywhere,"" the director adds. ""I think I could put it in 2050 -- I hope I'm wrong -- and it could resonate with that generation, [too].""

While it was originally filmed in 2021 amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, Kissufim retroactively took on a tragic significance following the Hamas terror attack in the south of Israel last October, not least of all because the eponymous kibbutz was among the affected communities. As a result, the movie's release was delayed from fall 2023 to summer 2024. ""It's been very strange to see how close to reality it came, especially in Kissufim itself,"" Nechmad admits. ""I kept waiting for a phone call [from Netflix saying], 'Listen, it's too political -- we can't do it.'""

""I think they're probably the bravest streamer in the market right now in terms of films and shows that they're buying and broadcasting,"" echoes Or, who hopes the film can broaden ideological horizons beyond the echo chamber of news networks and social media. ""You get so many different accounts telling you so many different things. But if you read a book or watch a film or listen to an album ... the effort [to make them was enormous]. It took so much work to create this thing, that it's probably a little bit more truthful than a short video on TikTok.""

""We consume art from people that might not think the same way we do,"" Nechmad concludes. ""Our opinion changes all the time. It's not like we're constructed to one thing."""
Google Stock Could Fall If TikTok's Digital Ad Share Rises,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petercohan/2024/10/07/google-stock-could-fall-if-tiktoks-digital-ad-share-rises/,2024-10-07T15:20:13Z,"Does Google monopolize the advertising market? The answer remains in limbo as the Virginia bench trial pitting the Department of Justice and some U.S. attorneys general against Google will resume next month when both sides present findings of fact and deliver closing arguments in December, according to the Associated Press.

The parties disagree on Google's market share. Last month, the DOJ alleged Google controls ""91% of the market for publisher ad servers and 87% of the market for advertising ad networks,"" AP noted.

Google countered -- claiming, in part, the DOJ's definition of the relevant market is outdated and overly narrow. Taking into account all online display advertising, Google controls a mere 10% of the market, argued Mark Israel, an economist who prepared an expert report on Google's behalf, according to AP.

Competition in the nearly $300 billion search advertising market is heating up. Powered by artificial intelligence and social video, rivals like Amazon and TikTok are growing faster than Google as the latter's share declines, according to the Wall Street Journal.

Will these rivals win digital market market share from Google? The answer is yes, if three things happen:

While the first one is clearly happening now, despite TikTok's gains, Google still offers a higher return on ad investment and Google's AI strategy and other measures could counter TikTok.

For now, the possibility of a Google break up by the Virginia judge could loom as a larger threat to investors.

I have contacted Google and TikTok and will update this post should I receive comment.

Judge Leonie Brinkema of the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia will decide this question -- probably this December -- after both sides ""summarize their cases in writing and deliver closing arguments"" in November, on Nov. 25. according to the New York Times.

The DOJ charged Google with abusing control of its ad technology to violate antitrust law while Google countered -- claiming the government ignored the intense rivalry in the digital advertising market, noted the Times

More specifically, the DOJ alleged Google use the market power it achieved following the 2008 acquisition of advertising software provider DoubleClick to raise raising advertising prices and harm publishers by taking too large a share of each sale, noted the Times.

Google's arguments featured a stream of experts who claimed the search giant was competing against large rivals and created value for advertisers while taking a fair cut of digital ad revenues. These experts' arguments included the following:

Google's search advertising market share has continued to fall since 2018 as rivals have increased their market position. Here's how much

Amazon's ad revenue is growing faster than Google's. Specifically, in 2024 the etailer is forecast to enjoy 17.6% growth in advertising revenue to Google's 7.6% growth, according to the Journal.

While Google has a large lead in search advertising and ample resources, advertisers are happy about the competition. ""For the first time in probably 15 years, we will have viable alternatives to Google,"" Nii Ahene, a veteran digital-advertising executive, told the Journal.

Competition is coming from the popular short-form videos from TikTok which recently allowed advertisers to aim ads based on users' search queries. Meanwhile Perplexity, the AI search startup funded by Jeff Bezos, intends to make ads available under its AI-generated answers, the Journal noted.

The far larger Google -- which handles some two trillion search a year to 340 million queries for Perplexity in September 2024 -- began this month to offer advertising next to its AI-generated summaries, the Journal reported.

Google expects to generate revenue from these advertisements. For example, in response to a query: ""How do I get a grass stain out of jeans?"" Google provided an AI response and showed a listing for a Tide pen available on the Albertsons website.

""We're confident in this approach to monetizing our AI-powered experiences,"" Brendon Kraham, a Google vice president overseeing the search ads business, told the Journal.

TikTok has a far smaller share of the U.S. ad market, yet its ad revenue is growing much faster than Amazon's and Google's. Specifically, the short-video platform provider's share of the ad market is only 3.4% -- yet its ad revenue is forecast to grow 38.1%, according to eMarketer.

One digital advertising agency has many clients moving ad budgets to TikTok -- which said 23% of users search for something within 30 seconds of getting on the platform. Almost 24 clients of digital ad firm Tinuiti -- in consumer electronics, apparel and beauty -- are currently buying the new TikTok ads, noted the Journal.

""We are seeing performance on return on ad spending that sometimes rivals what we are seeing on Google,"" Tinuiti President Jeremy Cornfeldt told the Journal. Given the low volume relative to Google, the real test is TikTok's ability to compete will become clearer "" when more advertisers compete for keywords and ad prices go up,"" he added.

While Google has a big lead, the threat from TikTok and Amazon -- abetted by Perplexity -- could grow in the future. If Google can create a significant new revenue stream from AI summaries, the company could start to reverse that decline.

However, if Google's ad tech antitrust woes result in a breakup of its advertising operation, Google investors could be in a world of hurt."

Hugo Basilotta and his wife, Cristina Fernández, run Guaymallen, the Argentinian snack brand that her father started in 1945. Basilotta, 72, says he has received multiple buyout offers but refuses to sell the family business, which now employs members of the third and fourth generation. The company produces almost 3 million sandwich cookies -- called alfajores -- per day and exports to the U.S. and Europe.

Onetime U.S. Open champion Dominic Thiem announced in May that he will retire from tennis by the end of the year. The 31-year-old, whose career earnings exceed $30 million, says he is ""full of energy"" for his career off the court. His business endeavors include a line of sunglasses, investment in a healthier chocolate brand called Neoh and ongoing sponsorship deals with Adidas and Rolex. He has also recently teamed up with solar energy startup Solah to start selling electricity generated from housetop solar panels via ThiemEnergy.

Kate Kallot, whose family hails from the Central African Republic, appears on the cover of Forbes Afrique for her Kenyan data-collection startup, Amini. Kallot, 34, has raised $6 million and hired a team of 24 since 2022 to gather and distribute reliable information that can inform and democratize decision making across the continent. ""If data is the new oil, we need to extract value from it here [in Africa],"" she says. Amini's AI technology has analyzed satellite imagery to identify areas of drought in East Africa where irrigation solutions can reduce farming losses and insurance costs. Kallot previously worked for Nvidia in New York on expansion into emerging markets.

JSW Sports recruits the country's most promising athletes to its training facility in the southwestern state of Karnataka and helps them with nutrition, coaching and arrangements for international competitions. The company, which sponsored the Olympic uniforms for the Indian delegation this summer, supports 41 of the 117 athletes from India who qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics.

After Hamas' deadly attack on Israel in October 2023, Forbes Israel postponed its tenth annual ""Best Doctors"" list that had been scheduled to publish that month. The ranking was then reimagined and released in mid-2024 highlighting ""angels in white"" -- brave medical professionals working amid the ongoing regional conflict. Dentist Esi Sharon-Sagie (right), for instance, has been appointed by Israeli police to lead dental forensics and help identify human remains through oral examinations.

Forbes Korea calls Soojong Kim the ""Rocket Man"" of South Korea.

Occidental And Humana Are On The Casualty List,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johndorfman/2024/10/07/occidental-and-humana-are-on-the-casualty-list/,2024-10-07T13:19:06Z,"""I can only buy on train wrecks,"" famed money manager John Neff once said.

Neff's lament was that his fund (the Windsor Fund) had grown so large that he normally couldn't buy a stock without pushing the price up. Accordingly, he felt that he could only buy on bad news.

Most of us don't have the problem that afflicted Neff. But buying good stocks on bad news is a wise investment technique for almost anyone.

That's the goal of my quarterly Casualty List. It comprises stocks that have been roughed up in the latest quarterly, and that I think can bounce back strongly.

In the third quarter, the stock market was up but many stocks still took it on the chin. Here are four that I feel have excellent recovery potential.

Occidental Petroleum Corp. (OXY), based in Houston, Texas, is on investors' radar because Berkshire Hathaway, run by Warren Buffett, owns about 28% of its stock. Betting with Buffett, often considered the premiere investor in the U.S., is often a good idea.

But investors went the other way in the third quarter, knocking down a slew of oil stocks as the price of oil fell from $83 a barrel to $69. OXY fell 18% in the quarter.

I believe that oil and gas will be energy mainstays for the U.S. well into the 2030s. In addition, the war between Israel and its neighbors poses a risk to world oil supplies - a risk that I don't believe is fully reflected in the price of oil as of early October.

Humana Inc. (HUM), with headquarters in Louisville, Kentucky, is one of the country's largest health insurers. Its strength - and its weakness, too - is that it specializes in insurance for people covered by Medicare, Medicaid, and the U.S. military program called Tricare.

Reliant on the government, Humana was grievously hurt when the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services gave many of its health plans low grades in a review in early October. This could cripple future enrollment in Humana's plans. The shares dropped 12% on October 1 after falling 15% in the third quarter.

This is terrible news, but Humana has been profitable for 24 years in a row. Over the past decade, it has grown its revenue by close to 12% per year. I think that management, led by new CEO Jim Rechtin, can probably right the ship.

Amkor Technology Inc. (AMKR) does semiconductor testing and packaging. Its largest customers are Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Qualcomm Inc. (QCOM). Apple alone is nearly 28% of sales.

The word Amkor stems from America and Korea. The company was founded in Korea in 1968 and now has its headquarters in Tempe, Arizona.

In the past year Amkor's sales fell about 8%, and profits (always more volatile than sales) dropped about 34%.

As a result, Amkor shares fell 23% in the third quarter. Of the 10 analysts who cover it, six rate it a ""buy.""

Visteon Corp. (VC), out of Buren Township, Michigan, is an auto-parts maker that Ford Motor Co. spun off in 2000. Today Visteon sells parts to Ford, BMW, Honda, Mazda, Nissan, Renault, and Ford's longtime arch rival General Motors. Instrument clusters and electronics are its specialties.

The stock fell 11% in the third quarter after sales dipped slightly. More than 80% of new cars are financed, and interest rates in the past year have fairly high. Now the Federal Reserve is moving to reduce rates, which I figure will help car sales.

The Record

This column is the 86 one in my quarterly Casualty List series. One-year returns can be calculated for 82 columns.

The average 12-month return on my recommendations has been 14.9%, compared to 11.3% for the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index.

That's good news. The bad news is that only 39 of the 82 columns have beaten the S&P 500. So far, fifty-two have shown a profit, and 30 a loss.

Bear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn't be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn't predict the future.

My picks from a year ago racked up a 33.6% return. That makes me happy, but it failed to beat the surging S&P, which came in at 35.1%.

My best pick from a year ago was RTX Corp. (RTX), up 78% as geopolitical tensions and wars sparked a rise in defense stocks. My worst pick was United Parks and Resorts Inc. (PRKS, formerly SeaWorld Entertainment Inc.), up 7%.

Disclosure: I own Apple shares personally and for most of my clients. I own Amkor Technology personally and for some clients. My wife, a portfolio manager, owns Qualcomm personally and for some of her clients."
Earnings Kickoff And World Conflicts Highlight The Week,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/07/earnings-kickoff-and-world-conflicts-highlight-the-week/,2024-10-07T12:47:57Z,"Oil Surge And Inflation Fears Threaten Economic Stability And Markets

A stronger than expected jobs report on Friday further eased fears of a slowing economy and allowed markets to stage impressive rallies to end the week. The S&P 500 closed higher by 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite gained 1.2%. For the week; however, markets were little changed. That came despite a wide trading range overall. As we head into this week, the expected move in the S&P 500 is 86 points, which means we could see a total trading range even bigger than last week.

It's going to be a data heavy week with much of it being of the qualitative variety. Fed members will be speaking throughout the week but what I think will be most interesting is the release of minutes from the last Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, due out Wednesday. These will be the minutes from the meeting at which the Fed decided to cut rates by half a point. With another Fed meeting not scheduled until November, I think a lot of investors are eager for a closer view into the last meeting and what members were thinking moving forward. I think this is especially true in the wake of Friday's jobs report and the response out of the bond market where we've seen yields on the 10-year note climb back above 4% for the first time since August. Then later in the week, on Thursday and Friday, we'll get the most recent Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports.

Also on Friday, we'll kick off earnings season. JP Morgan and Wells Fargo are both scheduled to announce earnings and each bank offers a slightly nuanced view into the health of the economy. JP Morgan will likely discuss the health of consumers, spending habits and credit card debt. Wells Fargo often provides a look into the housing sector given their presence in the mortgage market.

As we prepare for a deluge of earnings over the next few weeks, it's worth noting the expectations for the quarter have fallen. At the end of June, estimates for third quarter earnings were a growth rate of 7.8% on a year-over-year basis. However, those estimates have since fallen and now stand at 4.2%, according to FactSet. While it is common to see estimates revised downward, these revisions are slightly larger than the average drop of around 3.3%. It's also worth noting that the S&P 500 is currently trading at 21.4x its expected 12-month forward-looking earnings, which is above its historical 10-year average of 18x and 5-year average of 19.5x. In other words, much like we saw at the end of the second quarter, stocks are fundamentally valued at levels above their norm.

The revised earnings growth rates and fundamental valuations may also explain the tempered enthusiasm for company stock purchases by insiders. An article in today's Wall Street Journal says insider purchases by officers and directors were at their lowest level in a decade. While purchases upticked in August and September, they are still below their 10-year average.

In addition to the economic news and earnings, we also have a couple other externalities that could make their way into the market this week. Oil, which was up 1% on Friday and 8% for the week, is something I'll be watching as the world continues to await possible continued escalation between Israel and Iran. Also, back here at home, we are less than thirty days away from the election and I would not be surprised if we see market volatility hold its current level of even increase as the election nears.

A couple individual stocks worth watching today include Chevron and Pfizer. Chevron is selling off some Canadian assets as part of a plan intended to divest between $10 to $15 billion by 2028. That stock is higher by just over 1% in premarket. Shares of Pfizer are higher by nearly 3% in premarket after it was announced that activist investor Starboard Value has taken a $1 billion position in the company.

For today, I am keeping my eye on oil and any news out of the Middle East. I think markets are already bracing for the economic data and upcoming earnings, but the geopolitical situation is the wildcard I'm most focused on. No one is entirely sure what response to expect from Israel and I think that adds a bit of volatility that's more difficult to quantify. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."

Today marks one year since Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, leading Israel to retaliate and catalyzing the war in Gaza. Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians.

Despite calls for a ceasefire from the U.S. and allies, the Middle East is on the precipice of a broader war as tensions escalate between Israel and Iran. About 31% of Americans believe Israel's military operations in Gaza are going too far, a slight increase from last December, according to a new Pew Research Center poll.

Meanwhile, the share of Americans who believe Israel is doing enough or should be doing more has fallen in the last 10 months.

The U.S. added far more jobs than expected in September, and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%. The Labor Department data delivered good news for investors on edge after July and August saw far weaker labor market expansion than expected.

MORE: Leading stock indexes saw gains Friday on the heels of the jobs report: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 0.8%, the S&P 500 climbed as much as 0.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq bounced as much as 1.2%. But labor market resilience dampened hopes for a second aggressive interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month.

Tencent Holdings is considering acquiring Ubisoft Entertainment with the Guillemot family, which founded the French video game publisher, sending Ubisoft's stock soaring Friday after it falling to a decade-low in late September. Rumors about a takeover of Ubisoft, behind video games like Assassin's Creed and Just Dance, have swirled for years, and private equity firms like Blackstone and KKR & Co. have previously considered buying out the company.

Compare price/earnings to a growth rate and you get PEG, the classic formula for measuring the price tag of a growth stock. But PEG has deep flaws. The superior Super PEG measures how much you pay now to get a certain level of earning power down the road, and then compares that to what you pay to get future earning power from the S&P 500 index.

The ultra-swank Yellowstone Club, located on a remote patch of Montana wilderness, is one of the world's most exclusive clubs: Those who want to be admitted must buy land, a home or a condo, which will set you back $10 million, even for the least expensive undeveloped plot. The club has fewer than 900 homeowners, worth more than a combined $290 billion, including Melinda French Gates and hedge fund tycoon Bill Ackman.

The Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people has been published every year since 1982, and out of the total 1,739 featured, just 11 have made the list every year. They include Warren Buffett, worth $145.5 billion; Charles Koch, worth $67.5 billion; and Nike's Phil Knight, with a net worth of $36.5 billion.

Alphabet's self-driving car venture Waymo, the only commercial robotaxi service in the U.S., signed a ""multiyear"" agreement with Hyundai Motor to add electric Ioniq 5 hatchbacks to its Waymo One fleet starting next year. Currently, its U.S. fleet includes at least 1,000 electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs, and reducing costs is critical for Waymo to reach profitability, as it is quickly expanding its service area.

At a recruitment event for his fledgling AI company xAI, billionaire Elon Musk pitched the firm as the anti-OpenAI, calling the ChatGPT maker ""closed"" and profit-obsessed. Musk cofounded OpenAI with Sam Altman, but he has since left and sued the company twice, accusing OpenAI of abandoning its mission to build artificial intelligence to benefit humanity.

Out of office and back on the campaign trail, former President Donald Trump earned an estimated $218 million in operating income last year, roughly double what he made during his final year in the White House. Trump's golf portfolio now generates huge profits, with his golf-connected properties generating $74 million more in operating income last year than they did in 2020.

Perpetua Resources is set to resurrect a shuttered Idaho mine that will once again supply the Pentagon with vital weapons-grade antimony, bust a Chinese monopoly, and underwrite the rehabilitation of 20 miles of backcountry salmon streams. The surge in the price of gold since the pandemic is also propelling Perpetua, which expects to produce an average 300,000 ounces of gold per year at an average all-in cost of $650/oz and eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual profits.

Shares of Spirit Airlines fell 26% Friday after reports indicated the low-cost airline was exploring bankruptcy. In January, a federal judge blocked a $3.8 billion merger between Spirit and JetBlue, ruling it would eliminate the airline industry's popular discounted flight options and drive up prices.

If you need to renew your passport, now is the time: The average wait time is the shortest it's been in decades. The State Department said Thursday that the average processing time for passports has dropped to four to six weeks, which is a third as long as it took in 2021 during the pandemic backlog.

TOPLINE Over the last several months, joint state and federal task forces have raided more than 100 vape and smoke shops, hemp product manufacturers and distributors in North Carolina, alleging that they are selling marijuana disguised as hemp.

The 2018 Farm Bill allows the production of hemp and all its derivatives so long as it contains 0.3% of THC or less. In 2022, hemp-derived cannabinoid product sales hit $28 billion overall, while legal marijuana products generated $26 billion in sales during that same period, according to cannabis data firm Whitney Economics.

But hemp farmers, Whitney Economics estimates, have lost about $3.1 billion in annual sales due to the state bans and legal confusion that has followed.

Despite what the Farm Bill states, there is plenty of debate about whether hemp-derived THC products are legal under federal law. That's because hemp-derived cannabinoids -- including delta-9 THC and delta-8 THC (a less potent compound that is affectionately called ""weed lite"" or ""decaf kush"") -- are legal under the Farm Bill if those compounds are found naturally in the plant.

Yet most intoxicating hemp products on the market are made by converting hemp-derived CBD isolate into delta-9 THC or delta-8 THC using a chemical process.

North Carolina's crusade against hemp is not the only front in this war on drugs. Late last month, California Governor Gavin Newsom banned hemp-derived THC through an emergency order. Newsom said that the move was to prevent the sale of intoxicating hemp products to children.

But California also views hemp products as a threat to its struggling $5 billion legal marijuana market.

WHY IT MATTERS ""What's going on in the hemp industry right now shows how complicated and nuanced the legalization of cannabis can be,"" says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. ""Even though marijuana and hemp are variations of the same plant -- Cannabis sativa L -- marijuana is still illegal at the federal level while hemp is legal.""

It's important not only to save for retirement but also to plan for the non-financial aspects. For instance, if you enjoy what you are doing or the social aspect of your job, consider working part-time to transition to full retirement. Take the time to build social connections outside of work, join community groups and develop hobbies. And don't wait until you retire to start traveling: Go when you can, because no one's health is guaranteed.

"FC Barcelona Coach Flick Punished Star Player In This Way, Reports SPORT",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomsanderson/2024/10/07/fc-barcelona-coach-flick-punished-star-player-in-this-way-reports-sport/,2024-10-07T08:05:19Z,"FC Barcelona head coach Hansi Flick punished one of his star players in Vitoria-Gasteiz, ahead of the Catalans beating local side Deportivo Alaves 3-0 on Sunday according to SPORT, which cited anonymous sources.

The German was delighted with his team following the rousing victory, which was brought about by a Robert Lewandowski hat trick and managing to keep a clean sheet at the other end.

""I am happy to be the coach of this team, as is my team [with me coaching it], but in football things can change very quickly. We value what we have, and it's great to see how things work out,"" he said at full time.

Before kick off, however, Flick had to be the disciplinarian by punishing one of his players.

As SPORT explains, the plan had been to include Jules Kounde in the starting line up, who was previously one of Flick's ""untouchable"" stars playing 900 of all 900 minutes available thus far in 2024/2025 at right back.

As the Frenchman turned up late for a prematch talk, however, Flick set an example by dropping him from the line up and instead giving the nod to Hector Fort.

Ever classy and perhaps unwilling to leak internal secrets to the press, Flick told reporters post match that Kounde had been benched because he ""needed rest"".

This also checks out given how much Kounde has been used with another international break upon us, but it doesn't seem to be entirely accurate.

Flick made it clear when inheriting the reigns from predecessor Xavi Hernandez that he would run a tight ship, and also issued a warning about the importance of punctuality with consequences for those who don't toe the line.

On Matchday 9, we saw Flick keep his word, as Kounde was only introduced 25 minutes before the end prior to going off to represent Les Bleus in UEFA Nations League matches against Israel and Belgium.

Thankfully Hector held the Fort on the back line which managed to keep Alaves at bay despite two goals being ruled for offside.

And on the Blaugrana's return to club action on October 20, Kounde could start against his former employers Sevilla."

In an excerpt of Harris' interview with CBS' 60 Minutes released on Sunday, the vice president addressed U.S. military aid to Israel, saying: ""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel. And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents Iran, I think that it is without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks."""

The Gaza Health Ministry has struggled to maintain accurate tallies due to the destruction of data-keeping technology and infrastructure in the war, according to analysis published by The Lancet, which noted an estimated 10,000 victims are likely still buried in the rubble of destroyed buildings. Some of the dead also go uncounted because ""what we've seen in Gaza is entire families just being wiped out,"" so there is no one to report them dead, Emily Tripp, the director of Airwars, a watchdog group that tracks war casualties, told Nature.

The non-governmental organization, Airwars, has also determined the death toll is likely underestimated after finding some victims' names are missing from the list released by the Ministry. Some experts, including Israel-based independent researcher Mark Zlochin, believe the death toll is overcounted because it likely includes people who are missing, but not dead, he told the scientific journal Nature.

The Ministry updated its breakdown of the fatalities in May to clarify that approximately 25,000 of the 35,000 reported dead at the time were ""people who have been fully identified."" The Ministry revised its count of women and children estimated to be dead to about 60% of all reported fatalities, down from a previous estimate of about 70%, sparking allegations of inaccuracies from Israeli officials. The World Health Organization, however, expressed confidence in the new tally amid the dispute, noting that it's a ""step forward"" that 25,000 bodies have been identified, World Health Organization spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said during a press briefing at the time that it's ""normal"" for death tolls to shift in conflict.

Nearly every day. The death toll doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. The death toll includes nearly 16,756 children and more than 10,000 people who are missing.

More than 97,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

1,139 have been killed and at least 8,730 have been injured, as of Sunday, according to Israeli officials.

At least 742 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and more than 6,250 have been injured.

Hamas invaded Israel in a surprise land, sea and air attack launched from the Gaza Strip in what was the deadliest day in Israeli history, and for Jews since the Holocaust, following decades of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Hamas militants took more than 240 people hostage; 154 of whom have been freed or rescued, with 97 remaining in Gaza, including 33 believed to be dead. Israel declared a state of war the day after the attack and launched air strikes, followed by a ground invasion, on Gaza. The Israeli invasion has spawned a humanitarian crisis as the dismantling of critical infrastructure and the Israeli occupation has blocked routes into Gaza, restricting the flow of aid. The outpouring of international support for Israel has dwindled since the start of the war as a broad coalition of its allies, including the U.S., have called for a cease-fire. The war has since expanded to Lebanon as tensions between Hezbollah and Israel reached a tipping point in July when a rocket attack Israel says Hezbollah carried out killed 12 children playing soccer in the Golan Heights region. Israel has retaliated with air strikes followed by a ground invasion, killing Hezbollah's' longtime leader and other top officials, and Hezbollah has vowed its strikes will continue unless there's a cease-fire in Gaza.

56%. That's the share of Israelis who want to see an end to the war if all hostages are returned, according to a July poll by the Israel Democracy Institute.

Iran Launches Missile Strike On Israel, Israeli Military Says (Forbes)"
"Oil's Security Premium Could Rise, But Is Unlikely To Persist",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaellynch/2024/10/06/oils-security-premium-could-rise-but-is-unlikely-to-persist/,2024-10-06T11:41:51Z,"In summary, the worst case (for the oil market) would be an Israeli attack that reduced Iranian oil exports, and then the issue becomes whether the Saudis raise production to compensate or seek to draw down global inventories in support of prices, which would mean Brent stays over $80. Absent such an attack, the security premium will be only temporary and weakness in the fundamentals will reassert themselves; Brent would sink below $75 again.

At this point, it appears that the conflict in the Middle East is morphing into a 'forever war,' with Israel attempting to destroy Hamas and Hezbollah, something which is almost certainly impossible, and to cow Iran into reducing its support for members of the 'axis of resistance.' To date, the damage done in both Iran and Israel from ongoing missile attacks has been minimal, but concerns that the situation might escalate has been keeping oil prices elevated, our old friend the security premium making a reappearance. Prices that had been under pressure from fundamentals have instead risen by $5 to $8 a barrel in recent days. Given the possible direction of the conflict, what do the different paths mean for oil prices?

First, it's important to keep in mind that while fundamentals tend to move slowly, geopolitical events can change abruptly and drastically. Although oil supply sometimes drops sharply, demand evolves only gradually: next month, next quarter, will not be substantially different from current levels. In effect, geopolitics are fast, fundamentals slow but more persistent.

That said, consider the different political/military decisions going forward. It should be taken for granted that Israel will continue to prosecute the war against Hamas and Hezbollah, but their response to the latest Iranian missile attack remains unclear. There are four likely choices: a minimal attack, such as after the April barrage from Iran, would ease tensions and see oil prices pull back quickly. Israeli rhetoric at this point implies this is unlikely.

Next, a larger attack from Israel that targets Iranian military bases and infrastructure, such as weapons depots or factories, is possible. Given recent developments, Israel clearly has good intelligence on its adversaries, so such an attack is doable, although the long-term effects would be minimal. However, Iran would almost certainly respond with another missile attack which would mean that the tit-for-tat exchanges would continue the security premium on oil prices would remain elevated.

A third choice would be for Israel to go after Iranian nuclear facilities, something that Israel has supposedly long wanted to do but been restrained from attempting by the U.S. However, with U.S. influence clearly at a low point, Netanyahu might be tempted to undertake this, seeing a successful attack as a crowning achievement to his long political career. There is uncertainty about Israel's ability to launch such an attack without U.S. help and many caution that Iranian facilities are not vulnerable to air strikes. Even so, Israel might feel that inflicting minor damage on those sites would provide a demonstration effect and serve as a deterrent to further Iranian retaliation. Again, this would translate into continuing violence, keeping the oil price's security premium high.

Finally, some have been suggesting Israel might attack Iranian oil infrastructure, including refineries or export facilities. Reducing Iran's oil income would seem desirable from Israel's point of view, and while the U.S. would presumably discourage such a move, especially the Biden Administration which doesn't want an October surprise of higher oil prices, U.S. political clout appears at a low point.

Expectations of an Israeli attack on the Iranian oil industry explains much of the recent elevation in prices, since that is the only likely development that would have a direct impact on world oil markets. However, even the destruction of the Abadan and Bandar Abbas refineries, with 700 tb/d of capacity, while no doubt generating impressive videos of spectacular fires and explosions, would not have a major effect on world oil markets.

In 1951, the Iranian nationalization of BP's holdings and the shutdown of Abadan raised Asian oil prices by approximately 30%, because at that time, Abadan was providing a large fraction of Asian product demand. Now, those two refineries together provide less than 1% of world capacity and could easily be replaced. The figure below shows global refinery capacity and throughput with an implied 20 mb/d of surplus but overstates the available capacity. A more realistic estimate would be about 3-5 mb/d of surplus capacity, at any rate, more than enough to replace any disruption to Iranian operations. There would be some rebalancing and Iran would lose money, but aside from that the impact would be minor.

An attack on Iranian oil fields would also look impressive, generating massive blazes but having only a limited effect on supplies given the dispersed nature of production. Destroying the tanker loading facilities at Kharg Island would be more serious and could reduce Iranian oil exports by perhaps 1 mb/d in the worst case scenario. Then, the question becomes whether or not the Saudis replace the lost supply. They have ample spare capacity, but might prefer to let markets tighten, inventories drop, and prices firm. In that case, Brent would remain at or above $80.

In essence, there are three paths forward: the level of violence remains roughly constant or declines, in which case the security premium would fade as traders get crisis fatigue, Brent sliding back towards $70-75. Alternatively, an escalation with continuing missile attacks and/or assassinations would mean traders remain fearful of an oil supply disruption and the price would remain elevated, as it is now (Brent about $78). Finally, any attack on Iranian oil facilities would boost Brent above $80, if and only if Iranian exports dip significantly and the Saudis refuse to raise production.

Overall, then, the prospect is for prices to return to the levels of September, sooner rather than later, and the chances for Brent to remain above $80 for any period appears slim. Even so, wagering on peace in the Middle East is never for the faint-hearted."

About 3 in 10 (31%) Americans believe Israel's military operations in Gaza are going too far, a slight increase from last December, according to a new Pew Research Center poll, which shows a plurality of Americans, 36% to be exact, are unsure about Israel's handling of its war with Hamas. Meanwhile, 20% of Americans believe Israel is doing enough while 12% say Israel should be doing more -- but both of those numbers have declined in the past 10 months, from 25% and 16%, respectively.

The Pew Research Center poll also found more Americans in September said the U.S. should play a role in resolving the war diplomatically (61%) than they did in February (55%). And Republicans in September remained more likely than Democrats (25% vs. 13%) to say the U.S. should not be involved in the diplomatic resolution of the war, according to the Pew Research Center, a drop from the 32% of Republicans and 21% of Democrats who said in February there should be no U.S. involvement in the war's resolution.

A new survey from the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 25% sympathize more with Israelis, and 15% sympathize more with Palestinians. Most -- 31% -- claimed to have equal sympathy for both sides, and another 26% report having no sympathy for either. These numbers also have not changed much since before the attack on Israel last year.

The Associated Press-NORC survey marked an increase in the number of Americans who support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, up to about 29% now compared to 22% before the Oct. 7 attacks, in August 2023. Around half of the Americans surveyed said they neither favor or oppose an independent state (a drop from 58% in August 2023), while 17% were opposed, about what it was (15%) in 2023.

About 4 in 10 Americans say the U.S. is spending too much on military aid for Israel, very consistent with polls in February and November, according to the Pearson and AP survey.

Even before the Oct. 7 attack -- and Israel's two-front war in Gaza and Lebanon -- a whopping 79% of Americans were either concerned or very concerned about the Israel-Hamas war leading to a larger Middle East conflict, according to a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll published a year ago.

""The mix of U.S. opinions on the Gaza war reflects the complexity of a conflict where Americans may see bad actors and innocent victims on both sides,"" the Associated Press reported, citing Paul Poast, a political scientist at the University of Chicago and a research affiliate of the Pearson Institute. Poast added the conflict's nuances have lended to ""very strong views on both sides.""

The U.S. has remained a large player in the Israel-Hamas war despite stopping short of putting American boots on the ground in Gaza or Lebanon. President Joe Biden has laid out multiple ceasefire proposals in the last year that have largely failed to materialize, while also trying to walk the rope between supporting Israel's war against Hamas and providing humanitarian support for the people of Gaza, who continue to face strikes from Israel, famine and mass displacement. American concern about a larger conflict in the Middle East has proven relevant, as Israel's attacks against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have raised the ire of Iran, which launched missile strikes at Israel this week. Biden has continued calling for ceasefires as the conflicts escalate, though it remains unclear how much influence the U.S. will have on Israeli military operations given that the two allies have seemingly been on different pages multiple times in the last year. The White House said last month it was not notified about Israel's strikes in Lebanon that killed longtime Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and provoked retaliatory strikes from Iran.

Iran Launches Missile Strike On Israel, Israeli Military Says (Forbes)"
Iraqi Militia Drone Attack On Israeli Troops Echoes Tower 22 Incident,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2024/10/05/iraqi-militia-drone-attack-on-israeli-troops-echoes-tower-22-incident/,2024-10-05T15:16:55Z,"Israel revealed Friday that a drone launched from Iraq on Thursday killed two Israeli troops and injured 24, two of them severely, in an army base in the Israeli-annexed Golan Heights. The attack was the first time a drone launched from Iraq at Israel resulted in any fatalities. It also has many noticeable similarities with another drone attack earlier this year against American troops based in neighboring Jordan.

The Israeli military military investigation into Thursday's incident revealed that the militias used two explosive drones in the attack. Israeli air defenses successfully downed one. However, the second struck its target undetected minutes later, causing the casualties. The military noted the soldiers did not receive any alert to take cover and is investigating why that was the case.

The Islamic Resistance of Iraq, IRI, claimed responsibility for the attack. The IRI is the umbrella term for Iran-backed Iraqi militias that oppose Israel and the U.S. military presence in Iraq and Syria.

U.S. troops in the Tower 22 facility in northeast Jordan on the Syrian border similarly received no warning when an IRI drone launched from Syria hit their base on January 28. Three U.S. troops perished when the explosive drone hit their living quarters as they slept, with another 47 suffering injuries.

The initial U.S. military assessment of the attack concluded that U.S. forces likely did not detect the militia drone ""due to its low flight path."" Furthermore, the facility lacked adequate air defense for combating such threats. Nevertheless, as with the Israeli troops in the Golan on Thursday, those American personnel had no forewarning or any chance to take cover.

Both incidents were the first out of hundreds of IRI attacks against Israel and U.S. troops that caused fatalities. The IRI began firing rockets and drones at U.S. bases in Iraq and Syria shortly after the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip started in October 2023. At least 150 attacks against U.S. troops in these countries preceded the Tower 22 attack, with some causing injuries.

The IRI also launched several drones and cruise missiles against Israel in the months preceding Thursday's incident, invariably exaggerating the effectiveness of many of these attacks. Overall, in the past year, they have claimed 170 attacks on Israeli targets. Interestingly, an estimated 70 percent of these have occurred this September, coinciding with the beginning of the ongoing Israel-Hezbollah conflict in Lebanon.

The U.S. retaliated for the Tower 22 attack on February 2. In a series of devastating strikes carried out by drones and B-1 Lancer heavy bombers, the U.S. Air Force struck 85 suspected militia targets in seven locations in Syria and Iraq; four in the former and three in the latter. The attacks killed an estimated 40 IRI militiamen.

As of writing, Israel has not directly responded to the IRI drone attack. It's unclear whether Israel will respond with a rare strike on Iraqi territory since the drones came from there. Israel has repeatedly targeted IRI and a plethora of other Iran-backed militias and Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Syria over the past decade. That campaign markedly intensified since October 2023. It did bomb Iran-backed militias in Iraq back in 2019, but those strikes seem to have been a one-off.

The U.S. may want to dissuade Israel from striking back in Iraq. Unlike its 900-strong troop presence in Syria, the U.S. deployment in Iraq is under agreement and coordination with the central government in Baghdad. Furthermore, the U.S. and Iraq have been negotiating the future status of U.S. troops in the country, over a decade after they returned to the country to help Baghdad fight the notorious Islamic State group. Israeli strikes on Iraqi territory amidst a U.S. drawdown could complicate things for Washington there and politically pressure Baghdad to take a firm stance against the American military presence.

Following Iran's unprecedented ballistic missile attack against Israel on Tuesday, these Iran-backed Iraqi groups bluntly warned that U.S. bases in Iraq would once again come under fire if the U.S. joins any Israeli retaliation against Iran or if Israel uses Iraqi airspace for attacks against Iran. Israeli fighter jets may have used Iraqi airspace to fire air-launched ballistic missiles into Iran in retaliation to Tehran's first direct missile and drone attack against Israel in April.

Interestingly, the Middle East Eye outlet published an interesting report on Thursday revealing that pro-Iran political and armed factions in Iraq are wary of incurring any Israeli attack on the country, fearful that it could lead to a government collapse. Iraq's Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani ""has been striving to deprive the Israelis of any pretext that could be used to strike Iraq,"" an advisor told the outlet.

""Any ill-considered action in the coming days will have a high price and could burn everything,"" the advisor added.

Thursday's attack could well give Israel a pretext to strike. Whether or not it will do so has yet to be seen as the wider region lurches closer than ever to the calamity of an all-out war."
U.S. Arms on Both Sides of War in Lebanon,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhartung/2024/10/05/us-arms-on-both-sides-of-war-in-lebanon/,2024-10-05T12:48:49Z,"Not for the first time, a war has broken out in which U.S. arms are present on both sides of the conflict, this time in Lebanon. The billions of dollars in weaponry Washington has supplied the Netanyahu government to sustain its wars in Gaza and Lebanon are widely known about, but many Americans might be surprised to learn that the United States has also supplied significant amounts of arms and training to the Lebanese armed forces. While the Lebanese army is not the primary target of the Israeli invasion, a clash between the IDF and official Lebanese government forces is still a possibility.

Nick Turse, writing in The Intercept, notes that ""[s]ince 2006, America has provided more than $5.5 billion in foreign assistance to Lebanon, including $3 billion in military aid."" Items supplied have included ""light attack aircraft, helicopters, and Hellfire missiles. The U.S. separately provided Lebanon with 130 armored and tactical ground vehicles."" Seth Binder, director of advocacy at the Middle East Democracy Center, told Turse that the U.S. supplies have not had the intended effect: ""Despite the assistance, however, the country remains incredibly unstable and its security forces remain unable to respond to Hezbollah's domestic or regional operations.""

The U.S. government's reasons for arming the Lebanese military are not entirely clear. In one notice to Congress of a sale to Lebanon, the Pentagon relied on vague rationales, stating that it would ""enhance the foreign policy and national security of the United States by helping to improve the security of a strategic partner."" Equally vaguely, the notice went on to say that the sale would ""improve Lebanon's capability to meet current and future threats. Lebanon will use the enhanced capability to strengthen its homeland defense and to replenish existing stock levels."" The ""threat"" is never named, but the current threat to Lebanon emanates from a U.S. ally, Israel, not from Hezbollah or a designated adversary like Iran.

As noted above, the Lebanese army is not the main focus of Israel's attacks - that is Hezbollah. The Lebanese army has retreated from the south of the country since the Israeli invasion, concentrating its forces in the north. While they would no doubt like to avoid direct combat with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF), analyst Aram Nerguizian of the Center for Strategic and International Studies has suggested that the Lebanese forces might engage in defensive actions against the IDF. But for the most part it appears that the Lebanese army is standing back as their country is bombarded by its neighbor, leaving it as a fight between Israel and Hezbollah- with the people of Lebanon paying the real price.

Unfortunately, the phenomenon of the U.S. arming both sides of a conflict is nothing new, and in many cases U.S. arms have gone to the direct combatants in the war, not to one direct party like Israel plus a secondary force like the Lebanese army. This history of runaway weapons sales goes back at least to the 1970s, when American arms were used by both Greek and Turkish forces in their war over Cyprus. This reality was one of the things that prompted Congress to pass the Arms Export Control Act (AECA) of 1978.

More recently, in 2019, Turkey's U.S.-supplied air force bombarded the U.S.-trained and armed Kurdish opposition forces in Turkey.

The role of U.S. arms in fueling conflict - whether the weapons to both sides or just one - is business-as-usual. In a December 2022 paper I did for the Quincy Institute, I found that the United States had supplied arms to one of both sides of over two-thirds of the world's active conflicts as of that date.

None of the above accounts for cases where U.S. supplied-arms have fallen into the hands of U.S. adversaries, as happened during the wars in Iraq, Afghanistan, and Yemen. Most disturbingly of all, some of the U.S. arms supplied to extremist groups in Afghanistan fighting Soviet occupation forces ended up in the hands of Osama Bin Laden's cohorts in al-Qaida, and ISIS captured large quantities of U.S. arms from the Iraqi armed forces in its 2014 invasion of Iraq.

It's long past time to take a hard look at claims that U.S. weapons supplies are a ""force for stability"" around the world. The historical record suggests otherwise. The current war in the Middle East offers an opportunity to change course, and finally acknowledge that trading in weapons of war is not a guarantee of peace and stability, but an enabler of more war, with all the tragic human consequences that entails."
Alex Pereira Calls Out His Easiest Potential World Champion Opponent,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/10/04/alex-pereira-calls-out-his-easiest-potential-world-champion-opponent/,2024-10-05T00:06:16Z,"Alex Pereira could have his hands full with Khalil Rountree Jr. in the main event of UFC 307, but he was asked about a bevy of other potential opponents. Pereira rated them all on a scale of 1-10, with 10 being the most formidable potential opponent.

While some fighters like current heavyweight champion Jon Jones ranked as a nine with Pereira, he only rated current middleweight champion Dricus Du Plessis as a ""4.""

The disrespect is real, and so is the potency of the seeds the Brazilian is planting ahead of a potential clash with DDP at 185 or 205 pounds. Here is a look at the video from ESPN MMA:

The disrespect did not go unnoticed. One fan replied, ""The absolute disrespect for Dricus is going to get him to fire off a spicy tweet.""

After DDP defeated Israel Adensanya to retain his UFC middleweight title, Pereira talked about returning to middleweight to face him to regain the belt. DDP wasn't keen on the fight happening at 185 pounds and instead told Pereira he would see him one day at 205 pounds.

That fight is the most likely scenario if the two men ever meet. While a ""4"" is pretty harsh considering DDP is a legit world champion who has defeated Robert Whittaker, Sean Strickland, and Adesanya, stylistically, you can see why Pereira may believe he has such a decisive advantage. DDP is a kickboxer at his core, but he has also been able to add wrestling and submissions to his arsenal.

He submitted Adesanya to win their long-awaited matchup. That said, DDP's striking defense isn't superb. Opponents have landed 46% of the significant strikes thrown at him in the UFC. While the middleweight champion has proven to have a chin and is as tough as they come, getting hit by Pereira is different.

Pereira was starving himself to get to 185 pounds, and light heavyweight is a much more natural weight cut for him. If DDP moves up and faces Pereira, chances are, he will not be able to absorb the shots from him that he has taken from others.

Pereira's comfort in his natural weight class could be a factor. DDP would need to fight a wrestle-heavy style to beat Pereira, and that seems like something the latter would be prepared for if they meet. I've learned more and more not to doubt DDP's ability to pull out wins you might not have expected him to earn, but this one against Pereira feels like a very tough ask.

However, DDP's potential to surprise would make for an intriguing buildup to the event."
AppYea Unveils Vibrating Wristband Designed To Curb Snoring,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbes-personal-shopper/2024/10/04/appysleep-anti-snore-smart-wristband-launch/,2024-10-04T18:50:15Z,"If your bed partner is a snorer, you might be used to nudging them throughout the night (politely or not so politely) in an attempt to get them to roll over. Why? Well, you've seen firsthand that helping them to briefly wake up or even shift positions can effectively stop their snoring and allow you to get some rest. Fortunately, your days of manual intervention might be over. A new vibrating smartwatch, known as the AppySleep Wristband, offers to make that entire process much easier -- and its ultimate goal is to prevent wake-ups altogether.

Editor's note: You should consult with a medical professional before using any anti-snoring devices if you have sleep apnea or snoring concerns.

The watch and its corresponding app were developed by AppYea Inc., a healthtech company with headquarters in the U.S. and Israel. The company claims that the device is one of the first products on the market that uses AI to aid in the treatment of snoring. (There are others -- we've also tested a smart, AI-powered anti-snore pillow -- but the watch is certainly one of only a few). AppYea says the wristband is also capable of detecting irregular breathing -- acknowledging that snoring is often more than just an annoyance -- it can be a sign of potentially more serious conditions, such as Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA).

While the watch's corresponding app is free to download, you will, of course need to purchase a wristband first, either directly through the company's site or via Amazon. The wristband currently has an introductory launch price of $150, and it comes with free three-day shipping. Some of its key features are:

As part of the launch, shoppers who purchase the wristband get free access to their ""personal cloud"" within the app, which is compatible with both iPhone and Android devices. This section stores statistics and customized graphs on the user's sleep history and quality.

""Snoring is a common issue, particularly for individuals over the age of 35,"" says chairman of AppySleep, Bary Molchadsky. ""Yet there have been no comfortable solutions."" AppySleep's watch is designed to monitor breathing patterns, and if snoring is detected, it responds by sending a vibration through the wristband, gently prompting the user to move into a different sleeping position. That's helpful enough on its own, but the overarching idea here is that over time, users will learn to more naturally adopt sleep positions that reduce snoring.

The company has stated that it's currently working on an app to help diagnose sleep apnea without the need for a sleep study in a sleep lab, which they hope to submit for FDA approval in 2025.

Dr. Kanwar Kelley, a California-based ENT and cofounder and CEO of Side Health, says technology like this could, in fact, really work -- given that there isn't more going on than meets the eye (or ear). ""Devices that remind us to roll to the other side or close our mouth and breathe through our nose will work,"" he says. ""However, there are some issues that this device will not solve, such as anatomical blocking, which may require more intensive therapies.""

First, it's important to understand what starts -- and stops -- snoring in the first place. Kelley says there can be several causes of snoring, which can work either alone or in combination with one another.""From the nasal passages, nasal blockage or congestion can cause sound through blocked airflow or tissue collapsing,"" he says. ""This also occurs in the throat, where muscles relax while asleep and vibrate more intensely. Anything that narrows the airway may cause snoring. Increased amounts of fatty tissue around the neck and neck circumference can collapse the airway."" Ultimately, ""snoring is due to relaxation or looseness of the soft tissues that vibrate as air passes to the lungs.""

The watch's premise -- that changing positions can decrease snoring -- is rooted in research. ""Changing your position if you snore may help due to the difference in the shape of the airway,"" Kelley says. ""When you lay on your back, gravity works against you, allowing the soft tissues to collapse more. When you roll on your side, or your stomach, the shape of the airway is more open.""

Snoring can be serious -- and slapping on a wearable in place of medical intervention isn't a great idea. Kelley suggests that people first find out the source of their snoring, especially to address the possibility of OSA. ""Snoring does not always mean you have sleep apnea,"" he says. ""But it can be a sign that you may not be breathing as well as you sleep. The combination of snoring and other symptoms would be the best hint that something is going on."" That said, any new device that means higher quality sleep for you and/or your bed partner could be worth a try, as long as you consult with your doctor first."
Iran Refuses To Back Down As Its Proxies Endure Unprecedented Attacks,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2024/10/04/iran-refuses-to-back-down-as-its-proxies-endure-unprecedented-attacks/,2024-10-04T16:03:18Z,"Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, appeared in public on Friday to announce Iran will continue supporting its regional proxies against Israel despite them coming under unprecedented attack and pressure.

""The resistance in the region will not back down even with the killing of its leaders,"" Khamenei declared at Friday prayers in Tehran.

The supreme leader, who has the final say in all affairs in Iran since 1989, also dubiously claimed that Israel ""cannot seriously harm"" neither Hezbollah nor Hamas and said the latter's fight against Israel provides a ""vital service for the entire region.""

His appearance came less than a week after Iran launched its largest-ever ballistic missile strike against Israel on Tuesday. It also follows a deadly Israeli air and ground campaign in Lebanon, suspected Israeli sabotage of Hezbollah communications with explosive-packed pagers, the assassination of longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, and airstrikes and a rare commando raid in Syria.

These actions badly hurt Iran's most militarily powerful regional proxy, prompting Tehran to lash out with Tuesday's strike, launching a massive barrage of at least 180 ballistic missiles, including some of its most advanced models. That attack ultimately caused minor damage to Israeli homes and a large airbase but no casualties inside Israel -- although falling shrapnel did kill a 38-year-old Palestinian in the West Bank. While none of its military capabilities, the targeted airbase houses many of Israel's most advanced fifth-generation F-35 aircraft, were destroyed in the attack, Israel had to expend several multi-million-dollar Arrow interceptor missiles to counter the incoming missiles.

Following the attack, a senior Israeli military official said, ""We should expect to strike government centers and possibly eliminate figures like Khamenei in Iran."" Pro-government media in Iran lauded the supreme leader for appearing in public in light of such threats and Israel's more general track record of successfully assassinating senior figures inside Iran.

Khamenei reportedly warned Nasrallah in the days leading up to his September 27 assassination to leave Lebanon. Following the simultaneous detonation of thousands of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies on September 17-18 -- injuring thousands of members and disrupting the group's communications -- Khamenei sent a brigadier general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Abbas Nilforoushan, to Beirut to convince Nasrallah. Nilforoushan subsequently perished in the same devastating Israeli strike that killed Nasrallah.

As Hezbollah's secretary-general since February 1992, Nasrallah was undoubtedly and the single most important figure in Iran's regional militia proxies, the self-styled Axis of Resistance. For Khamenei, his loss was as consequential, if not more so, than the US assassination of the IRGC extraterritorial Quds Force commander, Qassem Soleimani, in a January 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad.

Israel is also believed to have targeted Nasrallah's presumed successor, Hashem Safieddine, in heavy airstrikes on a bunker in Beirut on Thursday night.

Israel has also been busy afflicting potentially mortal blows against Hezbollah's powerful rocket and missile arsenal, estimated to number anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 surface-to-surface projectiles, including long-range and precision-guided munitions.

Israel launched its current offensive against Hezbollah -- dubbed Operation Northern Arrows -- on September 23, with the Israeli Air Force executing its most extensive airstrikes ever, using 250 fighter jets to strike 1,600 Hezbollah targets on that day. While undoubtedly devastating, the Israeli military said at the beginning of the campaign that reports of these airstrikes destroying 50 percent of Hezbollah's rockets were most likely exaggerated.

However, by October 1, senior Israeli and American officials assessed that the Israeli air campaign has destroyed half of the militia's missiles and rockets. However, they again noted that the surviving half of arsenal could still pose a significant threat to Israel.

For years, analysts assessed that a Third Lebanon War could see Hezbollah unleash an enormous missile and rocket barrage, overwhelming Israel's multilayered air defense and causing significant casualties and extensive damage. For example, veteran journalist and Hezbollah expert Nicholas Blanford predicted that such a scenario could see Israel's home front ""experience its greatest destruction and loss of life since the 1948 war"" while Lebanon would become a parking lot.

Since September 23, as it potentially faces a ""use it or lose it"" scenario with its arsenal, Hezbollah has mainly used short-range rockets, only launching a single ballistic missile toward Tel Aviv on September 25, which Israeli air defenses swiftly intercepted. Iran had helped Hezbollah to build up this arsenal primarily to deter an Israeli airstrike against its nuclear program. It's widely speculated that one reason Hezbollah did not unleash more missiles since it was awaiting authorization from Tehran. On the other hand, Israeli attacks on and sabotage of its command, control, and communications could have also been the primary factor.

While Israel is unlikely to prove capable of destroying this entire arsenal with airstrikes alone, it could severely cripple it, stripping Hezbollah of its main strategic asset and Iran of its main regional deterrent against Israel. Furthermore, Hezbollah may find it difficult to replenish its losses in the short term if the current fighting stops soon.

As The New York Times reported, the current Israeli campaign -- which also includes an ongoing ground incursion into South Lebanon that has already resulted in deadly clashes, with eight Israeli soldiers killed on Wednesday -- did not begin in Lebanon but next door in Syria.

More than a week before the pager explosions, Israel launched airstrikes against Syria on September 8, itself not unusual. However, this time, an estimated 100 helicopter-borne commandos raided an underground Hezbollah missile production facility deep near northwestern Syria's Masyaf, not far from the Lebanese border.

The facility previously belonged to the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, which manufactured Syria's notorious chemical weapons. It was built too deep underground for bunker-buster bombs, like the ones believed to have been used to kill Nasrallah in his Beirut bunker, to damage sufficiently. So, the commandos raided the facility, planting explosives to destroy the equipment used to manufacture Hezbollah missile components. They were in and out in only 15 minutes.

""It initially looked to be a one-off attack on a Hezbollah weapons facility, but it now appears to have been the opening salvo in a covert-in-name-only campaign against the Iranian proxy group,"" the Times report noted.

How all of this ends is impossible to predict. Khamenei's reiteration on Friday that his regime won't back down comes as Israel has vowed to retaliate directly against Iran for Tuesday's missile attack, which could see this already deadly Middle East conflagration spread even further.

For now, it seems clear that Iran's regional proxies may well have endured their deadliest days ever and mightn't fully recuperate their former strength and many of the military capabilities they possessed just over a mere week ago."
Is It A Goldilocks Economy?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/04/is-it-a-goldilocks-economy/,2024-10-04T13:06:32Z,"Temporary Strike Resolution Offers Short-Term Relief For Impacted Industries

Stocks were relatively quiet on Thursday as markets awaited this morning's employment situation report. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was flat. Small cap stocks were the biggest movers for the day, falling over 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%.

This morning, the Labor Department released the latest employment report. Forecasts were calling for 147 thousand new jobs and an unchanged unemployment rate of 4.2%. The actual numbers were 254 thousand new jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. We also saw upward revisions for both July and August, suggesting the economy continues to show strength. We'll get the latest Consumer Price Index late next week and a chance to see if prices are continuing on their trajectory of moderating. Thus far though, the net effect of recent data implies an economy continuing on target for a soft landing. However, there is one potential caveat to that, oil.

On Thursday, oil was up over 5% as the world awaits Israel's response to Iran's missile attack earlier in the week. For the week, crude oil prices are up nearly 10% and that is something with the potential to upset the progress made vis-a-vis inflation. If there is one commodity that has the potential to jumpstart inflation, it is oil. Therefore, in addition to both the humanitarian and geopolitical repercussions, there is the potential for economic upheaval as well. The 200-day moving average for crude oil is right around $75 and that is a level I'll be watching. A close above that could be bullish for those who are long but bearish for inflation.

The other big story on Thursday was the temporary end to the strike at ports along the East Coast. Employers offered workers a pay increase of 62% spread out over six years. The International Longshoremen's Association and port operators said this agreement will last until late January as the two sides work on a long-term deal. One of the main sticking points in the negotiations is automation and how that will impact jobs. Seeing as how the strike lasted just three days, any economic impact was likely muted. However, this is an issue we may hear about again come early next year. In the meantime, we're seeing some of the companies that could have been negatively impacted by a prolonged strike trading higher in premarket activity. Shares of Walmart are up 0.5% along with Target, which is trading higher by nearly 1%.

For today, I'm keeping an eye on how the jobs data report is spun and oil. The market's initial reaction to the jobs number has been bullish. Index futures jumped when the report was released. Heading into this morning's report, sentiment was largely in the camp that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by a quarter point when they meet in November. Expectations for that quarter point cut were relatively unchanged after the employment number was released. One other thing I'll be watching today is the VIX. Last Friday, volatility increased right near the end of the day. I believe that was largely due to the situation in the Middle East and investor concern about the potential for increased hostilities over the weekend. Given the state of affairs as of Friday morning, I would not be surprised if we saw a similar situation today. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
Oil Prices Shot Up This Week. How High Will They Go?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidblackmon/2024/10/04/oil-prices-shot-up-this-week-how-high-will-they-go/,2024-10-04T12:44:49Z,"The only truly predictable thing about predicting oil prices is that they are stubbornly unpredictable. Anyone able to accurately and consistently predict the direction of oil prices would soon become a billionaire by trading in the commodity.

I learned that lesson for about the 100th time this week when, one day after I wrote a piece about the potential price-depressing impacts from an apparent shift in strategic direction by Saudi Arabia on October 1, oil prices began shooting up in the wake of Iran's decision to launch a ballistic missile attack into Israel. As of this writing on the morning of October 4, the international Brent price for crude oil is up 11% for the week and still rising in Friday trading.

Oil markets have remained unusually stable over the past year since the October 7, 2023 attacks by Hamas on Israel, mainly due to the lack of any threat to the free flow of oil out of the Persian Gulf. But the prospect of Israel launching a major retaliation that would target Iran's oil production and export infrastructure has traders on higher alert.

Where will oil prices go from here? As always, that is anyone's guess, and guesses are the only things available to us. Prices will rise or drop based on a wide variety of factors, including the following:

Will Israel retaliate, and what would such a countermove look like? - Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, vowed to retaliate directly against Iran in the wake of the missile attack, saying his government will adhere to ""the rule we established: Whoever attacks, we will attack them.""

Should Israel decide to strike at Iran's refining and export infrastructure, oil prices would almost certainly rise significantly.

Would OPEC+ respond by raising exports? - It is certainly possible, perhaps likely that some or all OPEC+ participants would respond to a major disruption in Iranian exports by increasing their own export volumes to fill the gap. While many OPEC+ members would like to see prices rise back up into the $90/barrel range - a $12/barrel increase from Friday's opening level - a major price spike to higher levels could have long-term demand killing impacts that the cartel wishes to avoid.

Will rising crude prices further slow economic growth in China and other major importing countries? - One reason OPEC+ would likely seek to fill any major gap in Iranian supplies is the probability that a major price spike would further slow economic growth in China and across the rest of the world, thus further slowing oil demand growth.

What others are saying. - Daan Struyven, co-head of global commodities research at Goldman Sachs, told the hosts of CNBC's Squawkbox Asia program Friday morning, ""If you were to see a sustained 1 million barrels per day drop in Iranian production, then you would see a peak boost to oil prices next year of around $20 per barrel,"" adding that price impacts would be less significant should OPEC+ step in to fill some of the gap.

Iran's exports have topped 3.2 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2024, their highest levels since 2018, as the US and global community have eased sanctions invoked during the Donald Trump administration. Obviously, a major Israeli strike that shuts down Iran's ability to export onto the global market would send oil prices soaring. But Amrita Sen, co-founder of Energy Aspects, told Reuters this week that, ""In theory, if we lost all Iranian production - which is not our base case - OPEC+ has enough spare capacity to make up for the shock.""

Andy Critchlow, EMEA head of news at S&P Global Commodity Insights, told CNBC's Street Signs Europe hosts that OPEC claims to have roughly 5.6 million bpd in excess capacity, with Saudia Arbia controlling most of that volume. ""These are dangerous times for oil markets at the moment,"" Critchlow said, ""It's hard for anyone in the market to really gauge the direction when you look at the amount of geopolitical risk that is out there.""

Critchlow's final comment really summarizes the bottom line on this situation: Many experts like those quoted here have keen insights to offer, and many observers have informed opinions on the future direction of oil prices. But the only thing we really know for sure about the question is that no one really knows for sure."
"Why Biden's ""Off The Cuff"" Quip On Israel Targeting Iran's Oil Has Rattled Market",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2024/10/04/why-bidens-off-the-cuff-quip-on-israel-targeting-irans-oil-has-rattled-market/,2024-10-04T12:44:43Z,"An already spooked oil market received further jitters on Friday after U.S. President Joe Biden suggested Israel possibly targeting Iran's energy infrastructure was under discussion.

Have risen by over 5% in overnight U.S. trading, crude oil futures continued their upward trajectory in Asian and European trading. At 07:14am EDT on Friday, the Brent front-month contract was up another 1.52% or $2.07 to $78.63 per barrel, while the West Texas Intermediate was trading at $74.92, up 1.57% or $1.48 intraday.

Market speculation was already rife on how Israel may respond following a ballistic missile attack by Iran on it late on Tuesday. Tehran said it had attacked Israel in response to its ""aggressive acts,"" including the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon.

In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had ""made a big mistake and will pay for it"". Major Iranian oil facilities could possibly be in Israel's sights. But there has been little indication on what retaliatory route Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu would take.

However, when asked by journalists on Thursday if the U.S. would support Israel striking Iran's oil facilities, President Biden said: ""We're discussing that."" The President's aides have since described the remarks as ""off the cuff"" but the cumulative effect of rising tension in the Middle East and the comments have seen oil prices jump by over 10% since Monday, using Brent crude as a benchmark.

In a sentiment-driven crude market, there is now a heightened risk premium level, although whether it lasts or not depends on how Israel chooses to respond.

Nonetheless, Brent prices are still comfortably below $85 levels seen in October 2023 and hit lows last seen in 2021 less than four weeks ago. That's because there are legitimate concerns in the market about a supply surplus early in 2025 and an uncertain demand climate.

Iran currently exports around 1.7 million barrels per day, with bulk of these heading to China. However, there is plenty of oil there to meet the shortfall if all of this gets taken out.

According to the International Energy Agency's latest market assessment, the world's oil supply rose by 80,000 bpd to 103.5 million bpd in August, with outages caused by a political dispute in Libya combined with maintenance in Norway and Kazakhstan offset by higher flows from the U.S., Guyana, Brazil and elsewhere.

The U.S. is currently the world's largest crude oil producer. The agency sees annual gains strengthen from 660,000 bpd this year to 2.1 million bd in 2025, primarily thanks to non-OPEC supply but OPEC too has plenty of spare capacity if needed.

Meanwhile, as Chinese crude import levels continue to disappoint and global economic uncertainties persist, even the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries -- considered to be among the more bullish demand forecasters out in the market -- now expects lower demand growth both in 2024 and 2025.

As does the IEA, though both continue to offer vastly divergent oil demand growth forecasts for 2024 of less than 1 million bpd in the agency's case, and just over 2 million bpd in OPEC's case. This is likely to keep a lid on prices.

However, a prolonged conflict in the Middle East that does impact energy infrastructure and upends oil shipments carries the potential for prices spiking to $100 per barrel over the near-term."
Forbes Daily: Toyota's Latest $500 Million Bet On Flying Taxis,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/10/04/forbes-daily-toyotas-latest-500-million-bet-on-flying-taxis/,2024-10-04T12:22:11Z,"This is a published version of the Forbes Daily newsletter, you can sign-up to get Forbes Daily in your inbox here.

The Forbes Billionaires List reached a new milestone: For the first time, it has four members worth $200 billion or more.

Mark Zuckerberg joined the elite $200 billion club Thursday after his net worth rose by $3 billion as Meta shares ticked up 1.7%. His fortune of $201.5 billion puts him just ahead of Jeff Bezos, worth $200.2 billion, but behind Larry Ellison, worth $203.3 billion, and the world's richest person, Elon Musk, with a net worth of $258.7 billion.

The Meta cofounder's wealth has rebounded significantly since a 2022 low point for the company's shares when Zuckerberg's net worth was just $57.7 billion. But Meta's had a banner year, with shares up 68% so far in 2024.

Nvidia chief Jensen Huang said during a recent interview with CNBC that there's ""insane"" demand for its upcoming Blackwell ""Superchip,"" sending shares of the tech giant up more than 3% on Thursday. ""Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first,"" he said. Nvidia's stock is up more than 147% since the start of the year.

Striking dockworkers and port employers reached a tentative agreement Thursday that will end the work stoppage, after the strike halted about half of the ocean shipping conducted by the U.S and raised concerns of potential economic shocks. The tentative agreement includes a 62% wage increase over six years, according to The Wall Street Journal, but the matter of automation in dock work is still up for negotiation.

When Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow started brand empire Goop in 2008 as a simple newsletter from her kitchen table, her lack of formal business training initially led to moments of self-doubt. But at the 2024 Forbes Power Women's Summit, she said that her willingness to embrace vulnerability became key to her leadership style. ""The difficult things and the difficult conversations are the only ones really worth having,"" she says.

Toyota will invest $500 million in U.S. electric air taxi company Joby Aviation for its launch of commercial passenger services, which are slated to begin as soon as 2025. It's Toyota's latest bet on futuristic transportation technologies, and Morgan Stanley has said electric flying taxis could be a more than $1 trillion market by 2040.

A federal judge on Wednesday ruled that the Biden Administration can resume its student loan forgiveness program, which, once finalized, would forgive student loan debt for more than 25 million Americans. It would partially or fully forgive the debt of borrowers whose loans exceed the amount they initially borrowed after interest, those with loans older than 20 or 25 years, those who attended career-training programs that resulted in high debt or low earnings, and those who are eligible for forgiveness programs but never applied.

It was a record-breaking year in the music business: Forbes estimates that the top 10 touring acts collectively grossed more than $3 billion from January through the end of August, a nearly 10% increase from the same period last year. Taylor Swift's Eras Tour was the top-earning summer concert tour for the second year in a row, earning approximately $400 million, followed by Coldplay, whose Music of the Spheres tour earned the band an estimated $131 million.

While Iran does not yet have nuclear arms, analysts believe the country's nuclear development program might be a prime target for Israeli retaliation following Iran's missile launches at Israel, despite U.S. opposition. Iran's attack ""greenlights a counterstrike by Israel, potentially the final showdown blow that Prime Minister Netanyahu has been seeking for years,"" possibly targeting Iran's nuclear or oil facilities, says Laura Blumenfeld, an author and Middle East analyst at Johns Hopkins University.

Community colleges were hit harder by Covid-era enrollment declines than any other type of higher education institution, but a new report from S&P Global Ratings finds that those steep drops are over, and the finances of the community colleges it tracks have stabilized. Many of the enrollment bumps can be attributed to an uptick in students who take community college classes while they're still in high school, according to one expert.

TOPLINE For the first time, Forbes dug into how many superyachts are owned by America's 400 richest people and how much they're truly worth.

While the largest -- and most valuable -- yachts in the world are owned by Middle Eastern royals and Russian oligarchs, Americans own the most, with roughly one out of four of all superyachts -- commonly defined as those larger than 40 meters (131 feet) -- belonging to an American. That's three times as many as Russians, the second-largest group of yacht owners, according to industry publication SuperYacht Times.

Collectively, Forbes estimates that 40 members of the Forbes 400 own at least 60 yachts worth more than $6 billion, according to yacht valuation experts VesselsValue. Some own multiple, while others focus on one extravagant build, which can cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

These ships range from the modest -- Igor Olenicoff's 118-foot, $2 million Rusalka -- to the grandiose, such as David Geffen's Rising Sun. The 18th-largest yacht in the world at 453 feet and the biggest one owned by an American, Rising Sun comes with a basketball court that converts to a helipad and has hosted celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and fellow billionaire Oprah Winfrey.

The most valuable American-owned yacht is Jeff Bezos' Koru, a custom-built 417-foot sailing yacht that's worth an estimated $500 million.

WHY IT MATTERS ""America's 400 richest people are now wealthier than they've ever been, worth a collective $5.4 trillion,"" says Forbes staff writer Giacomo Tognini. ""As their fortunes have grown, these billionaires have increasingly been spending on lavish purchases, from luxury real estate to megayachts. And while yachts aren't great investments -- they tend to depreciate around 10% in the first year after purchase -- that hasn't stopped America's richest from dedicating hundreds of millions of dollars to build opulent, custom-made yachts, with Jeff Bezos spending an estimated $500 million on his superyacht Koru, the second-largest sail yacht in the world, which was delivered in 2023.""

Record-low birth rates among American women and an overall decrease in the world's population growth rate have become a hot topic this election cycle, especially among conservatives. More politicians are looking to offer tax and other benefits for parents:

$5,000: The amount per child that Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance has suggested as a tax credit, while Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed a $6,000 tax credit to parents of newborns

As exciting as it is to land a job interview, it's important to evaluate whether the organization is a place where you can grow in your career. Ask questions about how the company helps its employees grow and develop their skills, and inquire about the average tenure of team members. Frequent turnover could mean employees are overworked. Ask your interviewers what they like most about working at the company, and pay attention to how they describe the workplace culture.

A strong solar flare is expected to cause Northern Lights sightings across several states as the sun's solar cycle is approaching its anticipated peak. How long is the cycle?

Russia's Latest Move Reveals The Moral Bankruptcy Of The Biden-Harris Foreign Policy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2024/10/04/russias-latest-move-reveals-the-moral-bankruptcy-of-the-biden-harris-foreign-policy/,2024-10-04T10:04:16Z,"After a year-long series of bloody attacks, Russian forces finally captured a Ukrainian stronghold in the eastern part of the country. Putin's invaders are grinding out territorial gains at immense cost in casualties because the Biden-Harris Administration refuses to provide Kyiv the needed weapons systems and munitions to throw back the invaders. Why? Because the White House doesn't want to overly upset Putin, who thinks he can still win this war.

The same mindset has the Biden-Harris team constantly trying to force Israel into ill-conceived ceasefires with Hamas and Hezbollah and responding meekly to China's relentless efforts to establish control over the South China Sea.

This episode of What's Ahead makes the case that our weakness and lack of a strategic direction are creating conditions for war on a global scale."
Oil Surges On Israel-Iran Tensions: OPEC+ Strategy Shifts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertdaugherty/2024/10/03/oil-surges-on-israel-iran-tensions-opec-strategy-shifts/,2024-10-03T21:42:38Z,"In the span of 24 hours, President Biden met to discuss an Israeli attack on Iranian facilities causing oil prices to surge while the Saudi oil minister has said prices could drop to as low as $50 per barrel if so-called cheaters within OPEC+ don't stick to agreed-upon production limits, according to delegates in the cartel. Benchmark U.S. crude saw its largest one-day gain in a year, jumping 5.1% to $73.71. The news also impacted U.S. stock indexes negatively. The Saudi oil minister's remarks were interpreted by other producers as a veiled threat that the kingdom is willing to launch a price war to keep its market share if other countries don't abide by the group's agreements.

This stark juxtaposition of geopolitical tensions and internal OPEC+ dynamics underscores the complex forces at play in the global oil market. As the threat of conflict pushes prices up, internal disagreements within OPEC+ threaten to pull them down, creating a volatile environment for oil prices. Daniel Yergin, the legendary authority on energy, geopolitics and the global economy, has consistently shared insights about oil prices. He notes, ""Energy is a strategic commodity, and those who control its production and distribution wield considerable power"" and ""If a war started, the oil price probably would go up until you saw other oil from the extra supplies that are available elsewhere coming into the world, into the market.""

As tensions escalate in the Middle East, with Israel retaliating against Iran's recent launch of 200 missiles (most of which were intercepted or landed in unoccupied areas), the global oil market finds itself on edge. The potential for conflict in this volatile region raises concerns about disruptions to the world's oil supply, with implications that extend far beyond the immediate participants. Iran, a key player in this unfolding drama, contributes significantly to the global oil market. Producing approximately 3.99 million barrels per day, Iran accounts for about 4% of the world's oil supply.

Any disruption to this output could have immediate and far-reaching consequences for global energy markets. Iran's smuggling network is sophisticated; the country's petroleum business is run by the National Iran Oil Company (NIOC), a state monopoly. Its main customer is China -- not the country's large, state-owned firms, which are exposed to Western sanctions, but ""teapot refineries"" that snap up 95% of Iranian supplies. However, the concerns don't stop at Iran's borders. The fear of a wider regional conflict looms large, potentially impacting other major oil-producing nations in the area. Saudi Arabia, the world's second-largest oil producer, contributes a staggering 11% to global supply. Iraq and the United Arab Emirates each account for 4%, while Kuwait adds another 3%. Collectively, these Middle Eastern nations form the backbone of global oil production.

The interconnected nature of the global oil market means that disruptions in one area can quickly ripple across the entire industry. The potential for price volatility extends beyond the immediate term. If a conflict were to escalate and impact multiple producing countries, the effect on oil prices could be much more dramatic. Historical precedents, such as the 1973 oil crisis, serve as stark reminders of how geopolitical events in the Middle East can send shockwaves through the global economy. Furthermore, as Yergin points out, higher prices tend to incentivize increased production from other sources. This market response can help to balance supply and demand over time, though the process is neither immediate nor without its own complexities.

The impact of oil price fluctuations extends far beyond the energy sector. Transportation costs, manufacturing, and consumer goods prices are all influenced by the cost of oil. Central banks and policymakers watch oil prices closely, as significant increases can contribute to inflationary pressures and impact economic growth. For oil-importing nations, particularly in the developing world, sustained high oil prices can pose significant challenges to economic stability and growth. Conversely, for oil-exporting countries, including those in the Middle East, higher prices can boost government revenues but may also intensify regional tensions.

For investors looking to capitalize on potential oil price increases, especially if further hostilities break out in the Middle East with direct conflict involving producing nations, two stocks stand out as potentially beneficial: Exxon (ticker: XOM) and Imperial Oil (ticker: IMO). Both of these companies are poised to benefit from higher oil prices and have less exposure to activities in the region than major oil producers operating directly in the Middle East. However, as with all investments, thorough research and consideration of one's individual financial situation and risk tolerance is advised before making any investment decisions."
Will Israel Attack Iran's Nuclear Program? Here's What To Know About Iran's Nuclear Capacity,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/10/03/will-israel-attack-irans-nuclear-program-heres-what-to-know-about-irans-nuclear-capacity/,2024-10-03T14:29:30Z,"While Iran does not yet have nuclear arms, analysts believe the country's nuclear development program might be a prime target for Israeli retaliation -- despite U.S. opposition -- following Iran's missile launches at Israel.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

Israel (alongside the U.S. and the U.N.) has been concerned with Iranian nuclear progress since Iran started its weapons program in the late 1990s and early 2000s and has seemingly spent the decades since targeting the program to prevent nuclear development through Israeli-connected clandestine attacks like sabotaging explosions, sophisticated cyberattacks and theft of nuclear secrets. While Israel never took responsibility, Iran accused them of assassinating top Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020. Iran has enough weapons-grades nuclear fuel to make three bombs and is one of the only countries without nuclear weapons that can produce 60%-enriched uranium, a quality of enriched uranium close to the 90% needed for weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal. Reuters reports that Russian ties to Iran have deepened in recent years, and Bloomberg has reported that the U.S. is concerned about the sharing of information and technology between the two countries -- a potential boon to Iran's nuclear interest. Israel is considered an undeclared nuclear weapons power because it is believed to have nuclear arms but has not confirmed possession of them, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

In mid-2018, former President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Under the Obama administration deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities and permit U.N. inspections, and in return, economic and financial sanctions set by the EU, U.S. and U.N. were lifted. The deal outlined three main points: reducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium (a key ingredient in making bombs) by 98%, stopping production of higher-grade enriched uranium for 15 years and removing two-thirds of its more than 19,000 centrifuges (machines that enrich uranium). Under the deal, it would take Iran about 12 months to make a nuclear weapon. Trump was outspoken against the deal, calling it ""too much in exchange for too little."" Since 2018, Iran has significantly advanced its nuclear program, and while there is no evidence of nuclear-armed missiles, officials are concerned about metallurgy and computer modeling research related to weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Iran's nuclear capacity is playing out as a point of contention in the 2024 presidential campaign and was the leading question posed in Tuesday's vice presidential debate, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz arguing Trump is incapable of de-escalating tensions and did not put adequate nuclear protections in place when he pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, argued the Biden-Harris administration has supported Iran financially and that ""Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure."""
Protecting Blackchin Guitarfish Along Israel's Coast,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissacristinamarquez/2024/10/03/protecting-blackchin-guitarfish-along-israels-coast/,2024-10-03T11:28:40Z,"Good news has emerged from a long-term study at the Leon H. Charney School of Marine Sciences at the University of Haifa: the coast between Ma'agan Michael and Dor Beach serves as a vital nursery ground for the endangered blackchin guitarfish (Rhinobatos cemiculus). The study, led by doctoral student Eynav Cohen and her colleagues, shows that this area offers crucial support for the early stages of life for these cartilaginous predators. According to Cohen: ""A nursery ground is a natural area where animals, particularly marine species, gather during the early stages of life. A nursery ground is defined as an area that enhances the animals' chances of survival during the sensitive early stage of life by providing optimum conditions in terms of food, protection against predators, and shelter from extreme environmental conditions. Following the study findings, we hope this area will be declared a nature reserve when the young guitarfish gather here so they can be protected.""

Globally, guitarfish populations are in a constant state of decline, with the Mediterranean Sea being particularly affected, largely due to the pressures of net fishing. The International Union for Conservation of Nature has classified the blackchin guitarfish as critically endangered, underscoring the urgency of conservation measures. In 2017, NOAA Fisheries listed the species as threatened under the Endangered Species Act. One of the major challenges in understanding and protecting these fish is the limited biological and ecological knowledge available, especially concerning their population sizes both along Israel's coastline and worldwide. Most existing data is derived from commercial fishing activities, which do not provide a comprehensive view of the species' health or distribution.

Published in Frontiers in Marine Science and funded by the Blue Marine Foundation, this new study was conducted at the Morris Kahn Marine Research Station at the University of Haifa. The initiative began with research student Barak Azrieli from the Sharks in Israel non-profit organization during his Master's program and was supervised by Dr. Aviad Scheinin and Professor Dan Tchernov. This marked the establishment of the first monitoring program for guitarfish in Israel; following Azrieli's groundwork, Cohen, along with Dr. Leigh Livne, Dr. Scheinin, and Professor Tchernov, continued the work with the aim of advancing conservation efforts and securing recognition for the Ma'agan Michael coast as a nursery ground for blackchin guitarfish.

To achieve, however, the researchers needed to meet three specific criteria established in 2007 by Dr. Michelle Heupel. The first criterion requires that juveniles of the species in question are found in higher concentrations in the proposed nursery area compared to surrounding regions. The second? Stipulates that these young cartilaginous fish must continue to utilize the area for extended periods, specifically over two weeks. Lastly, this phenomenon is consistently observed across multiple years.

The researchers began conducting preliminary visual surveys along Israel's coast in 2017, revealing that the concentration of juvenile guitarfish at Ma'agan Michael is significantly higher than that of the adjacent coast near Caesarea, thereby meeting the first criterion. The surveys also indicated a strong presence of juvenile guitarfish from the end of August through early November. Boom, that satisfies the second criteria needed for this designation. And thanks to ongoing monitoring efforts over recent years, the researchers were able to fulfill the third criterion by consistently documenting these patterns over multiple seasons.

With this research providing robust evidence that the coast at Ma'agan Michael functions as a nursery ground for the blackchin guitarfish, the team is optimistic that their findings will prompt regional and national regulatory bodies to declare this area a marine nature reserve during the times when the juvenile guitarfish congregate. With this title, not only would the species' current young be safeguarded, but the designation plays a crucial role in the broader efforts to conserve this endangered fish and its habitat. Protecting the nursery ground is an essential step towards ensuring the future of the blackchin guitarfish... now will those in charge take it?"
This U.S. Company Is Cashing In On Ukraine's War With Killer Drones That Fit In A Backpack,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeremybogaisky/2024/10/03/aerovironment-russia-ukraine-drones/,2024-10-03T10:34:58Z,"The Russia-Ukraine war has ushered in a new era of unmanned combat. Investors and the Pentagon are betting that AeroVironment can produce deadly drones at an industrial scale.

a hot August morning in the foothills of the Santa Susana Mountains north of Los Angeles, Wahid Nawabi, the CEO of drone maker AeroVironment, is bouncing down a dirt road in a Chevy Traverse. Somewhere in the skies overhead, one of his company's gull-winged Puma electric surveillance planes is hunting for us - quietly and autonomously.

The trim, affable Nawabi shares the screen of a tablet computer that shows an aerial view of the grassy canyon we're driving through relayed from the Puma, 1,300 of which have been supplied to Ukraine for the price tag of $318 million. It's using computer vision to navigate, comparing landmarks to internal maps as it zeros in on a target it can autonomously seek: a tank, rocket launcher or in this case, a white SUV. They're capabilities AeroVironment deployed in Ukraine last year to overcome Russian jamming of GPS signals and communications links.

""Look, it found us,"" says Nawabi, pointing out our vehicle, which now appears on the tablet display outlined in a white box.

In the Russo-Ukrainian war, what might come next is a pinpoint strike from the deadly Switchblade, a weapon central to Nawabi's ambitions to make AeroVironment a multibillion-dollar company in the next three to five years, up from $717 million in revenue in its fiscal 2024.

Switchblade is a loitering munition, an expensive type of one-way kamikaze drone designed to circle the battlefield awaiting a good opportunity to obliterate its target. Both the Russians and Ukrainians are using them in a war where dense networks of antiaircraft systems have pushed fighter jets and bombers to the margins.

Starting in 2022, the U.S. supplied Ukraine with 700 Switchblade 300s, a $50,000 missile small enough to be carried in a soldier's rucksack and launched with minimal effort. It was quietly used by U.S. special forces in Iraq and Afghanistan in the past decade to take down ""high-value"" insurgents at a distance of as much as 6 miles. More recently, Ukraine has been hunting valuable Russian air defense batteries with a newer, larger version, the Switchblade 600, a $200,000 weapon with 25-mile range. Ukraine has received hundreds, with another 600 promised in a recent U.S. aid package.

The Ukraine war has been a buzzing laboratory for unmanned aircraft, where makers test and improve their designs. AeroVironment's got off to a rough start against Russian electronic warfare, which reportedly has hampered many sophisticated Western drones, but the company is now looking like one of the winners. (Nawabi says modifications to overcome jamming and better training have pushed Switchblade's effectiveness rate north of 80%.)

Last month, the Army handed AeroVironment a contract worth up to $990 million - the company's largest ever - to cover Switchblade purchases through 2029. And the company is in the running for contracts from other branches of the military and foreign allies as they accelerate their adoption of drones based on their deadly effectiveness in Ukraine.

Plenty of companies are chasing the opportunity: A study last year by the Vertical Flight Society counted 123 entities in 32 countries that were producing one-way attack drones. They include the Israeli pioneers of loitering munitions, like Elbit Systems, and buzzy defense-tech startups like Anduril, which has supplied a larger, longer-range, winged drone, the Altius 600, to Ukraine in undisclosed numbers. Anduril recently raised $1.5 billion and is plowing some of that into building a giant 1.5-million square foot factory called Arsenal-1.

But AeroVironment, which has quietly been the Defense Department's main supplier of small drones for the past two decades, may have the relationships, technology and industrial experience to better satisfy the U.S. military's sudden desire for unmanned systems en masse.

""There's no free lunch in manufacturing and the rigor that goes into making products at the U.S. DOD level,"" says Nawabi. ""A lot of competitors claim they're going to make thousands of these overnight. They just don't know what they're talking about.""

In May the Pentagon awarded AeroVironment a contract to build Switchblades for its Replicator project, which aims to enlist defense contractors and startups to crank out thousands of autonomous drones by mid-2025 for the U.S. military to use against China if it invades Taiwan. AeroVironment is so far the only company that's been named publicly as having been tapped for such a deal. The funding will speed up the Army's acquisition of Switchblade 600, which will give infantry the ability to independently knock out tanks from long range.

The Marines are also outfitting rifle squads with an upgraded version of Switchblade 300 that can attack armor as well as troops. It's a key part of a force redesign in which the leathernecks are dumping heavy weapons like tanks and much of their artillery to make expeditionary units faster and harder to target.

And the interest in loitering munitions goes beyond ground troops: the Navy, Marines and Army are experimenting with packing them into launchers on boats, helicopters and armored vehicles.

There are also growth opportunities for AeroVironment's surveillance drones and small ground robots, which last year rang up $448 million in sales, 60% of total revenues. The company is in the running for potentially lucrative Army programs to field new medium- and long-range recon drones.

Meanwhile, international sales are gearing up: The United Kingdom, France and Lithuania have made initial purchases of Switchblade, and the State Department in June approved a $60 million sale to Taiwan. AeroVironment says over 20 countries are seeking to buy Switchblade.

Investors are keen on the opportunities for the only public pure-play supplier of drones to the Pentagon. They've pumped AeroVironment's stock up almost fourfold since Russia invaded Ukraine in Feb. 2022, giving the company a $5.9 billion market capitalization. The company reported $60 million in net income for its fiscal 2024, which ended April 30, on nearly double its 2020 revenue, with loitering munition sales up 60% to $193 million. AeroVironment is so confident in its prospects, it's promised Wall Street at least 20% annual sales growth for the next three years.

If peace were to break out tomorrow between Russia and Ukraine, AeroVironment would still have big opportunities in a world where the thinking has changed about how wars can be fought, defense analysts say.

""For a country that can't easily afford squadrons of $100 million airplanes or attack helicopters at $30 or $40 million, this is a solution to a problem,"" said Byron Callan, managing director at Capital Alpha Partners.

's a heady turn for the company, which is nominally headquartered in Arlington, Virginia but remains centered in its birthplace of Southern California. For decades after AeroVironment's 1971 founding, it cultivated a reputation as an environmentally friendly, grant-funded R&D shop with a spotty record on commercializing the cutting-edge technology its engineers developed.

Founder Paul MacCready had a knack for designing energy efficient vehicles - he built the first human-powered aircraft capable of sustained flight to win a cash prize and pay off a $100,000 debt. In the 1980s AeroVironment built solar-powered planes and designed a solar-powered car for General Motors that won a race across Australia in 1987. It followed up by designing an electric car for GM that became the focus of environmentalists' conspiracy theories when the automaker in 1998 aborted a plan to bring it to market.

But AeroVironment scored big after 9/11 with the Raven, a 4-pound, hand-launched electric airplane that was small enough to be carried in a rucksack by soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan. For the first time it gave ground troops the ability to independently get a bird's eye view over the hill of their surroundings.

When the company went public in 2007, the same year MacCready passed away, its small drone business was thriving, booking $146 million in revenue. By 2013, the company could boast that it had made 86% of the drones in the DoD's inventory. Most of those were Ravens: AeroVironment has made 25,000, which the company says makes it the most-produced military aircraft in history.

With the Switchblade 300, which debuted in 2012, AeroVironment for the first time gave soldiers a backpackable weapon (three rounds and a launcher weighed under 25 pounds) that allowed them to attack enemies at a distance that had previously required calling in an airstrike or artillery. The Pentagon bought 6,000 of them in the following decade, but officials didn't buy AeroVironment's pitch that the weapon could be useful beyond counterinsurgency operations.

The war in Ukraine changed that, providing vindication for AeroVironment and Nawabi, who made a perilous escape from Soviet-controlled Afghanistan in 1981 at age 14. Nawabi's father was a government official who had become suspect due to his U.S. education, and his parents booked a flight to Delhi without their children to reduce suspicion they were fleeing. Nawabi says he and his three sisters traveled together overland, evading police patrols, for 58 days as they made their way from Kabul through Pakistan to India. Nawabi takes satisfaction in paying it back: ""Fast forward, here I am, making Switchblade, kicking Russians' ass.""

He believes the world is just now catching up to the future he's been preparing for since taking over as CEO of AeroVironment in 2016, when he sold off its electric vehicle charging division, doubling down on unmanned aircraft. A future where militaries increasingly rely on drones to ferry supplies, scout enemy positions and attack - with little human involvement.

""We're at an inflection point because what we bet on the last seven, eight years is becoming a reality,"" he said.

But AeroVironment doesn't have a lock on the market.. In the U.S., AeroVironment is facing competition from Teledyne Flir and Anduril for the Marines' infantry loitering munitions program -- the three won exploratory contracts in May. Uvision, an Israeli competitor, has racked up sales of its Hero loitering munitions to U.S. special forces and foreign militaries. But the Marines quietly canceled a contract UVision won in 2021 for a vehicle-mounted version of Hero because it didn't meet the service's expectations, Forbes has learned, opening up the possibility AeroVironment could take the business. Uvision's U.S. partner, Mistral, said the problems involved a command and control system and radio from other suppliers, not the Hero.

Then there's Aevex Aerospace, maker of a mysterious, low-cost family of drones called Phoenix Ghost of which not even photos have been seen publicly that the Pentagon rushed into Ukraine early in the war. The California company says it's taking lessons from Ukraine to compete for U.S. loitering munitions contracts.

Despite proliferating competition, Nawabi believes AeroVironment is uniquely positioned to dominate the market. He argues the company can innovate faster than larger defense contractors like Lockheed Martin, whose Terminator loitering munition Switchblade 300 beat out for repeat Army buys. Those companies typically wait for the Department of Defense to fund development of a prototype; AeroVironment risks its own capital to develop products before the Pentagon asks. This year Nawabi says the company will spend a whopping 30% of its expected $800 million in revenue on R&D, which includes funds the DoD has provided for research.

Meanwhile defense tech startups may be able to field flashy prototypes, but they don't have the know-how AeroVironment has developed to turn them into something that can be manufactured at scale, he says.

In a bet more orders are coming, AeroVironment is in the middle of doubling production at its Switchblade plant to 6,000 a year, and it plans to build another factory by 2027 to raise output to 10,000. That would mean about $1 billion in revenue at full rate. It's also doubling production capacity of its surveillance drones so it can crank out $1 billion worth of them each year.

There's big money at play. Teal Group predicts the world military drone market will expand 50% over the next 9 years to $30.9 billion in 2033 -- and that excludes loitering munitions; the consultancy says it's too early to forecast since the DoD has yet to publicly signal where its strategy lies on the curve from cheap and numerous to more accurate, jamming-proof and expensive.

Ukraine has pulled the lever on cheap and numerous: small companies and volunteer groups in the country are churning out $500 first person-view drones based on hobby racing quadcopters by the tens of thousands a month. These short-range, jury-rigged systems, which often carry modified grenades and RPG warheads, have made it so the Ukrainians don't need a Switchblade 300 to attack nearby machine gun nests and entrenched grenade launchers, the company admits. But Nawabi said the garage-built drones aren't much of a threat to his business: The higher prices of AeroVironment's loitering munitions are a direct result of the more sophisticated features that the Pentagon requests. Half the cost of a Switchblade comes from the powerful warhead and its sharper sensor systems, he said.

That said, the company is quietly working to provide the Pentagon with more for less. Executives guardedly discussed a weapon under development that's suitable for use over the vast reaches of the Pacific, one that can fly hundreds of kilometers and could be mass produced for a price under $50,000.

And continuing the company's long heritage in efficient flight, it's been working since 2019 to perfect a solar-powered plane capable of staying aloft 12 miles high in the stratosphere for weeks at a time. The effort is being funded by SoftBank, which wants to use the aircraft to deliver 5G mobile service to the 2 billion people outside the range of cellular towers. If it works, it could be a multibillion-dollar opportunity, said Nawabi.

But AeroVironment doesn't have to win on all the opportunities it's pursuing to prosper, he said. ""Fundamentally, our strategy is that if we make one or two of these shots on the goal, we will be multiple sizes bigger than we are today."""

The bitcoin price has dropped to almost $60,000 per bitcoin, wiping away much of the gains it made following China's bombshell.

Now, after Elon Musk revealed the details of his secret meeting with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, the Tesla billionaire has warned the U.S. heading for bankruptcy after U.S. debt jumped $204 billion in one day.

""America is headed for bankruptcy,"" Musk posted to X, the social media platform he bought and rebranded from Twitter, linking to a report of U.S. debt surging on October 1.

""Federal debt explodes on 1st day of the new fiscal year, jumping $204 billion to new record of $35.669 trillion, but it gets worse: Treasury also had to draw down its cash balance by $72 billion -- that's over $275 billion in the red for just one day,"" EJ Antoni, an economist with the conservative Heritage Foundation, posted.

Last month, Musk met with El Salvador's bitcoin-backing president Nayib Bukele, who made history when he adopted bitcoin as legal tender in El Salvador in 2021, with Bukele predicting the U.S.'s days could be numbered.

U.S. debt interest payments are forecast to hit $870 billion this year, according to an analysis by the Congressional Budget Office earlier this year after runaway inflation pushed the Federal Reserve to hike interest rates at a never-before-seen clip in the aftermath of huge Covid-era spending and money-printing.

U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures.

Earlier this year, Bank of America analysts warned the U.S. debt load is about to ramp up to add $1 trillion every 100 days -- potentially fueling a bitcoin price surge -- and could reach $36 trillion by the end of 2024.

Last month, the Fed kicked off its interest rate cutting cycle, taking the market somewhat by surprise with a 50 basis point reduction and fueling expectations of a similar sized cut in November -- described as ""crazy"" by BlackRock's chief executive.

""Observers of bitcoin prices this week would once again note that it is not a safe haven against geopolitical concerns,"" Geoff Kendrick, head of crypto research at Standard Chartered Bank, wrote in an emailed note.

India Uses Lessons From Russia-Ukraine War To Modernize Its Military,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vikrammittal/2024/10/03/india-uses-lessons-from-russia-ukraine-war-to-modernize-its-military/,2024-10-03T10:09:56Z,"The concepts underlying modern warfare have evolved over the past two years due to the intense and dynamic conflict between Russia and Ukraine. In particular, both sides adapted their military doctrine and tactics to better leverage the new technologies fielded onto the battlefield. Observing these developments, many countries have launched efforts to modernize their militaries based on insights gained from this conflict. Notably, India has undertaken several large initiatives to enhance its military systems, drawing from key lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war.

India is in a precarious position, sharing its northwest boundary with Pakistan and its northeast boundary with China, both of which have historically strained relationships with India. India and Pakistan have fought a series of four wars with the most recent being in 1999. Their current relationship is adversarial, fueled by territorial disputes, terrorism, and ceasefire violations, with nuclear deterrence preventing full-scale conflict. Meanwhile, multiple regions along India's 2,167-mile border with China have been disputed since the 1960s, following the Sino-Indian War. These disputes continue to lead to periodic low-level skirmishes, the most recent of which occurred in December 2022.

India, in an effort to better secure these borders, has taken lessons from the Russia-Ukraine war, which has particularly highlighted the importance of standoff. Maintaining standoff allows defenders to target and neutralize threats before they can come within striking range, creating a buffer zone that complicates any offensive push. Offensive troop formations, such as supply depots and command posts, must be positioned well beyond this buffer zone. Therefore, the assaulting force must cross this extended zone, exposing themselves to sustained, long-range fire, which results in significant losses before they can even engage with the defensive positions. Both the Russian and Ukrainian militaries have successfully achieved standoff through the use of artillery firepower coupled with drone strikes, effectively disrupting their adversary's offensive operations.

Given the importance of artillery in standoff, India has accelerated its modernization effort for their artillery systems. Similar to Ukraine, India is standardizing its heavy artillery to 155mm, the round size used by most Western countries. The Indian arsenal already includes some 155mm artillery pieces procured from Sweden and the United Kingdom. Further, India has an effort to replace many of its older 105mm cannons used along the Pakistani border, with newer 155mm Dhanush howitzers. Meanwhile, there has been an ongoing initiative by the Defence Research and Development Organization to develop the 155mm Advanced Towed Artillery Gun System to replace the Soviet-era 130mm M-46 field gun. The decade-long development effort is transitioning into fielding, as India plans to deploy the ATAGS along the Chinese and Pakistani border. Additionally, there are ongoing efforts to modify the ATAGS for vehicle mounting, although this initiative is still in its early stages.

While artillery has been the dominant weapon system in the Russia-Ukraine war, the war has also been characterized by its increasing use of drones. Drones were used for targeting and performing precision strikes often in conjunction with artillery to maintain standoff. India's fleet of drones is limited, consisting primarily of Heron drones, medium-altitude, long-endurance systems procured from Israel. India is pursuing three separate initiatives to enhance its drone capabilities. First, it is acquiring 31 MQ-9 Reaper drones from the United States to boost surveillance and strike capabilities. Second, India is developing its own drones under the ""Make-in-India"" initiative. Specifically, they are developing the Rustom series of medium-altitude, long-endurance drones. Lastly, India is upgrading its existing Heron drones, improving their sensors and resilience against counter-drone systems, in partnership with Israel Aerospace Industries. These efforts aim to build a stronger, more versatile drone fleet for India's defense needs.

Loitering munitions, often referred to as ""kamikaze drones,"" have been increasingly used by both Russia and Ukraine to augment their artillery capabilities, enabling precision strikes. The Indian arsenal currently includes the Harop loitering munition, which is also procured from Israel. The Harop has a payload of approximately 23 kg, making it significantly larger than the Switchblades used by Ukraine but smaller than the Shahed-136 used by Russia. Additionally, India has launched an effort to bolster its supply of loitering munitions domestically. Artemon Aerospace, an Indian aerospace company, has partnered with Munitions India Limited to develop an advanced loitering munition system for the Indian Armed Forces.

Sun Tzu stated in The Art of War, ""In peace, prepare for war; in war, prepare for peace."" Since India is not currently engaged in a conflict with Pakistan or China, it is the right time for them to prepare for such conflicts. The future battlefield is shaped by the current battlefield, so many of the technologies and tactics used in the Russia-Ukraine war will play a role in the next major conflict. As such, India is using the lessons learned from the war, including the importance of maintaining standoff through artillery and drones, to better prepare its national defenses."
Iranian Media Claims Israeli F-35 Fighters Destroyed In Missile Strike,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/02/iranian-media-claims-israeli-f-35-fighters-destroyed-in-missile-strike/,2024-10-02T16:46:50Z,"Iran launched its largest attack on Israel to date, firing upwards of 180 missiles on Tuesday. Experts have suggested it was larger and more complex than the strikes conducted in April, and the attack employed the Islamic Republic's Fattah-1 and Kheybarshekan missiles. Israel has claimed that most of the incoming missiles were shot down, and no Israelis were killed -- although Palestinian officials reported that a Palestinian man was killed by falling debris.

Damage was also reported to be minimal, but on social media on Wednesday, many pro-Iranian supporters echoed reports from Iranian state media that the missiles successfully struck Israeli airbases. Claims were made that the attack destroyed entire squadrons of the Lockheed Martin F-35I Adir -- the Israeli Air Force's fifth-generation fighter.

Videos on social media showed missiles targeting Tel Aviv, and showing the devastation that the IAF's F-35s were purported to cause in Gaza. Iranian propagandists have also alleged that Nevatim Air Base, the home of two F-35I squadrons, was also ""completely destroyed"" in the attack.

Yet another post claimed Palestinian activists disrupted domestic F-35 production by damaging a manufacturing facility. When and where the video was filmed hasn't been confirmed.

Together, these are the latest attempts to spread misinformation and propaganda without supporting evidence.

""Some of the missiles fired at Israel seem to have hit Israeli airbases, but the claim that dozens of F-35s were destroyed appears to be completely fabricated,"" explained Dr. Kurt Braddock, assistant professor of public communication in the School of Communication at American University. ""The protest at Teledyne seems to have been very minor in scope, and there is no evidence that it will slow down production of any materials.""

Though it would appear that Tuesday's missile strike was largely thwarted, the commentary on social media suggested it was a huge military success. The news was shared by those who may have believed the original posts, making it seem even more credible.

""The spread of these posts can be considered either misinformation or disinformation. In the case of the former, people on social media may see the videos/images and simply think they are true, and re-post them because they feel they are sharing true news without critiquing it,"" added Braddock.

Iranian state media presented a fictional narrative, and it also likely employed operatives on social media to post their own claims -- which served to provide confirmation for an event that didn't occur.

""The originators of the posts are engaged in spreading disinformation -- the purposeful spread of false information for strategic purposes,"" Braddock suggested.

""The goal of most mis/dis-information is not to convince people that something that didn't happen -- dozens of F-35s destroyed -- happened,"" explained Dr. Matthew Schmidt, associate professor in the National Security Department at the University of New Haven.

""It's designed to flood the mediascape with false information that causes a psychological response where people are overloaded with contradictory information and respond to this cognitively by questioning all the information in the mediascape, true and outlandishly false alike,"" warned Schmidt. ""The attackers hack our brains by flooding us with information and trigger a cognitive response based on the volume of data coming at us, regardless of its veracity.""

The result is that even easily verifiable true information may be doubted, including any factual information that reaches the target audience. Moreover, facts can be attacked and dismissed.

Schmidt said it can be exhausting, and many simply quit trying to find any truth in the ocean of disinformation.

""This creates a benefit for the attacker, because it creates a psychological environment where future lies will be ignored, because the audience has been made too exhausted to do the work to identify and counter them,"" he added.

Even if Israel offers its own social media response that shows largely undamaged bases, such photos and videos are to be equally dismissed as misinformation/disinformation. And that could play into Tehran's favor, at least in the short term.

""The goal was largely to sow doubt about claims by the Israelis that the Iranian attack was largely ineffective -- which is what seems to be the truth,"" said Braddock.

""Reports indicate that although not all Iranian missiles were intercepted, the ones that did land did minimal damage with no Israeli casualties,"" Braddock emphasized. ""That could be seen as an embarrassment for Iran and a show of strength for the Israeli defensive measures. By spreading disinformation that seems to suggest the missiles were more effective than they actually were, the posters are trying to communicate the 'effectiveness' of the Iranian attack."""
Israel Considers Cancelling Lebanon Gas Deal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danielmarkind/2024/10/02/israel-considers-cancelling-lebanon-gas-deal/,2024-10-02T14:11:27Z,"With the whole world watching events in Lebanon to see if Israel next launches a threatened ground invasion into that country, following its recent ""culling"" of the entire Hezbollah high command, another area that bears watching concerns what will now happen to the Israel/Lebanon natural gas deal reached in 2022 that, for a time, held a glimmer of hope for eventual peace in the Middle East, or at least between these two countries.

For those who may not recall that deal had demarcated the maritime border in the Mediterranean Sea between the two countries and gave Israel full rights to the ""Karish"" gas field and Lebanon most rights to the ""Qana"" field, with some revenue from the latter to go to the Israelis.

Recently, Israeli government officials have been broaching the idea of ""finding a loophole"" to invalidate the gas agreement. Even more recently, Israeli Energy Minister Eli Cohen openly called the deal a ""mistake"" and urged it to be rescinded.

From the time it was signed, many in Israel thought the gas deal was merely a giveaway - that Israel had basically just accepted Hezbollah's position on where to demarcate the maritime border - and that Israel had gotten very little from it, especially considering that the deal, by itself, did nothing to resolve the decades of hostility between the two countries. Since October 8, 2023, when Hezbollah began firing over 9000 rockets into Israel, ostensibly in support of Hamas in Gaza, calls in Israel's energy sector have been growing to declare the agreement invalid. Since Israel started aggressively hitting Hezbollah two weeks ago with the now infamous ""pager attack,"" those calls have now reached ministerial level.

Israel's critics claim that cancelling the deal would fit a decades long pattern of ""Israeli expansionism,"" and that Israel really wants to take all the disputed gas fields for itself. However, given the mood in Israel following the October 7, 2023, massacre, and the Hezbollah rockets, that criticism likely will fall on deaf ears. As TotalEnergies, the French energy consortium, is one of the developers of the Lebanese gas field, Israel might be prepared to scuttle that development as retaliation for what it perceives as untimely actions and certain comments on the situation by French President Emanuel Macron that are perceived, at least to some in Israel, to be pro Lebanese in nature.

Of course, such a move by Israel would come with substantial risks, both domestically and internationally. For one thing, it could make the Jewish State seem less reliable in its agreements and international business affairs generally. That could be economically devastating for a small country with a very limited domestic market. It also could make it more difficult for Israel to develop and find markets for its own natural gas in the future, with further unknown consequences.

In any event, the natural gas story is worth watching for any student of the Middle East or those whose lives are wrapped up in it. As events may continue to deteriorate, natural gas exploration on the Israeli/Lebanese maritime frontier, having once so promising a future for those who earnestly want to see the fighting and hostility replaced by a lasting peace, looks like it may become another casualty of the seemingly endless regional instability. One can only hope that, in the future, after a time when cooler heads and economic realities may eventually prevail, it will be among the first symbols of regional restoration as well."
Wars And Strikes Put Market On Edge,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/02/wars-and-strikes-put-market-on-edge/,2024-10-02T12:40:53Z,"Jerome Powell Hints At Smaller Rate Cuts Amid Rising Uncertainty

Stocks got off to an auspicious start for October as tensions in the Middle East ratcheted higher and a dockworkers' strike injected and extra dose of volatility. The S&P 500 fell 0.9% and the Nasdaq Composite dropped 1.5%. Small cap stocks were also hit with the Russell 2000 dropping 1.5%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the best performing industry, but it too was down 0.4%.

Tuesday morning began with a mixture of economic news that showed prices moderating further but a higher than forecast number of job openings in the most recent JOLTs report. However, markets barely had time to digest that data before escalating hostilities in the Middle East took center stage when Iran launched a barrage of missiles aimed at Israel. While damage was limited, the increasing hostilities sent November crude oil futures higher by as much as 5% before settling down some and closing up nearly 4%. Israel has vowed retaliation against Iran and the question now becomes, just how bad the situation will become. In premarket, oil is trading higher by more than 3%.

At the same time, back here at homes, workers from the International Longshoremen Association (ILA) went on strike shutting down ports along the East and Gulf Coasts. According to The Wall Street Journal the ILA unloads around 60%, or $588 billion, of all containerized trade that comes through those coastal ports. Ports will often shut down for things such as hurricanes and therefore, a day or two of closures would have a nominal impact on the economy. However, as the strike lingers, estimates range widely for just what an extended work stoppage would mean.

For markets, I think the most concerning aspect of an extended strike and conflict in the Middle East is the potential for it to reintroduce inflation at a time where it seems like the Fed may have actually achieved a soft landing. In his remarks Monday, Jerome Powell talked about further rate cuts but suggested they may not be as aggressive as September's half-point cut. Currently, the CME Fed Watch Tool is assigning a 63% probability of a quarter-point cut in November and 37% chance of a half-point. This is something I'm keeping my eye on.

Some individual stocks I'm watching include Humana. That stock is down in premarket trading by 24% as membership in high-rating Medicare plans is expected to fall. Apple is lower by 0.5% after analyst downgrades. Meantime, Home Depot is higher following an increased price target of $455 from Piper Sandler. That is up from $387. The narrative here is that with interest rates lower, homeowners will look at making repairs prior to putting their homes on the market. If that does turn out to be the case, I'll be interested to see if other companies such as Lowe's also see upgrades. Finally, shares of Nike are down 7% in premarket following their earnings. Revenues fell 10% and profits were down 28% year-over-year. The company also was unwilling to offer a full year forecast after recently replacing their CEO.

For today, markets will likely be preoccupied with the situation in the Middle East, and the slightly stronger than expected ADP payroll number. The conflict between Israel and Iran is very much in danger of becoming more widespread as we await the next move. Between China's slowing economy and resultant stimulus measures, a strike that could reignite inflation, the upcoming U.S. election, wars on multiple fronts, earnings season just over a week away and wide-ranging speculation as to the state of our own economy, it should come as no surprise that volatility is increasing. The VIX is trading near 19.5 in premarket and with Friday's employment report looming, I would not be surprised to see it hold here or potentially even increase. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
Oil Facilities In Iran That Could Be In Israel's Sights,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/gauravsharma/2024/10/02/oil-facilities-in-iran-that-could-be-in-israels-sights/,2024-10-02T12:40:40Z,"After Iran attacked Israel with nearly 200 missiles late on Tuesday and the latter vowed to retaliate, oil prices surged upwards from their recent lows on heightened tension in the Middle East.

At 7:50am EDT on Wednesday, the Brent front-month futures contract was trading at $75.63 per barrel up $2.07 or 2.80% while the West Texas Intermediate was up $2.21 or 3.16% to $72.04 per barrel.

Iran said it had attacked Israel in response to its ""aggressive acts"", including the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon. In response, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Iran had ""made a big mistake and will pay for it"".

This may be a coded warning that Israel will go after in Iran's oil facilities. According to industry data aggregator and research firm Kpler, Iran exported 1.194 million barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil and gas condensate in spring 2023, a figure that rose to a five-year high of 1.65 million bpd in the first five months of 2024.

So, the industry is an obvious target for Israel should it choose to, and the extent of the market impact depends on chosen targets and the scale of the response. In this respect, four sites of strategic importance come to mind.

The first of these is the Kharg Oil Terminal, situated on Kharg Island, 15 miles off Iran's Northern Coast. It handles over 90% of the country's global crude oil exports.

The second could be a number of oil terminals in the Southern province of Hormozgan. It also has two free trade zones on Kish and Qeshm Islands. Kish is also home of the Iranian oil bourse - the only exchange of its kind that does not trade oil and derivatives in U.S. dollars.

The third, and more domestically focused site, is the Abadan Refinery located across Shatt Al-Arab River on the border between Iraq and Iran. Reliable up-to-date data on the refinery's production capacity is hard to find. But estimates and local sources suggest it could be producing around 400,000 bpd. As Iran's oldest processing facility, originally built in 1909 by Anglo-Persian oil (which later became BP), it services around 25% of Iran's domestic fuel demand.

Mahshahr Oil Terminal, an oil port located on the Khor Musa Channel, is the fourth site. It stores and shifts products from the Abadan Refinery, and serves as an engineering and jetty construction hub for Iran.

All these sites were targeted by Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein during the Iran-Iraq war and severely crippled the Iranian economy. It makes them obvious potential target for Israel and will likely have an impact on the global oil market to varying degrees.

The most devastating Israeli strike carrying global implications would be an attack on Kharg Oil Terminal. Such an attack will likely result in a short-term crude price spike of around 5% as it carries the potential for international disruption, primarily to Iran's exports to China - the world's largest importer of oil.

On the other hand, an attack on Hormozgan oil facilities will likely be more about symbolism given that many of the province's terminals are largely unused due to sanctions, creaking infrastructure and years of Western sanctions on Iranian oil. Israel may attack these to send a message.

Should Abadan Refinery be targeted, it will largely break Iran's domestic fuel supply chain but perhaps does not carry any significant international implications. However, should the nearby Mahshahr Oil Terminal be subject to an Israeli strike, again both crude and product supply chain issues will likely arise.

If these real-time geopolitical developments were clouding the market a decade ago, most observers would factor in a double-digit near-term uptick in oil prices. However, despite all what the current year has thrown at the oil market, prices - using Brent as a benchmark - are still nearly $10 lower than October last year, and at one point hit lows last seen in 2021 earlier this month.

That's because unlike a decade ago, oil production outside the Middle East has steadily risen. The U.S. is currently the world's largest crude oil producer. Production in Brazil, Canada, Guyana and Norway is also at record levels. Furthermore, the Saudis are holding back substantial spare capacity.

All of this is occurring at a time of uncertain oil demand and global macroeconomic challenges. Even the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) - considered to be among the more bullish demand forecasters out in the market - now expects lower demand growth both in 2024 and 2025.

As does the International Energy Agency (IEA), though both continue to offer vastly divergent oil demand growth forecasts for 2024 of less than 1 million bpd in the agency's case, and just over 2 million bpd in OPEC's case.

So while geopolitical tension in the Middle East may not be new, today's oil market doesn't even remotely resemble that of the last decade. Always remember that when oil futures reflect a geopolitical ""risk premium"", it is based on fears of a potentially imminent loss of supply as is the case at the moment.

Once the loss does happen - say following a potential Israeli attack - it morphs from being a risk to market reality and corrective mechanisms kick in both on the supply as well as pricing side. That's unless there is further loss of supply which is the unknown variable for the market.

Ultimately, elevated tension between Iran and Israel and the wider conflict in Gaza and Lebanon is something the oil market could well do without, but is one that it currently appears capable of handling with all eyes now on what Israel will do next."

Iran fired rockets at Israel Tuesday, the Israeli military said, potentially escalating the war in the Middle East as Iran took responsibility for the attack and warned it is only a ""first wave."" In a statement read on state television, Iran said the attack was retaliation for the killings of multiple Hezbollah leaders, according to the Associated Press.

Aerospace and defense stocks reached all-time highs, a grim market reaction to the latest escalation of tensions in the Middle East, as the Israeli military reported missile strikes from Iran a day after Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon. Defense stocks typically see gains during times of heightened conflict as the companies' revenues rely heavily on U.S. government contracts.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, faced off in a mostly polite yet policy-heavy vice presidential debate Tuesday night. But one of the more tense moments was a heated back-and-forth related to the false claims Vance spread about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, leading CBS News to cut Vance and Walz's mics.

MORE: Forbes recently looked at how the two candidates compare on assets like real estate, pensions, salaries and more. Vance's earnings from his bestseller Hillbilly Elegy helped him amass an estimated $10 million compared to former public school teacher Walz's wealth of about $1 million.

A massive dockworker strike that began Tuesday comes ahead of the holiday season and as policy makers look to turn the page on inflation, but experts are split on whether it will have a major impact on the economy. The strike could cost the U.S. economy between $3 billion and $4.5 billion daily, according to estimates from Jefferies and JPMorgan, but significant fallout would only occur if the strike lasts more than the ""base case"" of a ""few days,"" Bank of America analysts led by Nathan Gee noted.

TOPLINE Palantir, which builds software to help other businesses gather, manage and analyze their data, at first with secretive government agencies like the CIA and now also with commercial customers, had a banner year.

Palantir took off, with annual revenue increasing more than 20% over the last year to $2.5 billion, and it flipped the switch on profitability -- going from a net loss of $50 million in June 2023 to net income of $400 million a year later. The record year was capped by its addition to the S&P 500 in September.

The company's growth is in part because many of its data software products meshed with the wave of AI hype.

No surprise then that shares are up 134% over the past year, making Palantir the most expensive stock in the S&P in terms of revenue multiples -- more so even than chip design darling Nvidia. Palantir's meteoric rise has earned CEO Alex Karp a spot on The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans for the first time, worth an estimated $3.6 billion, thanks to his Palantir stake and $1 billion or so in cash from stock sales as of September 1, the day we finalized net worths for our list.

But should it be that expensive, trading at a market valuation that's 36 times its annual revenue? Analysts aren't sure: only five of the 20 that cover Palantir give the company a ""buy"" rating, with the remainder split between hold and sell ratings.

D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria drew a parallel between the company and Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, when the EV company was trading at all-time highs in 2021. ""Tesla for a very long period of time traded well above any valuation or comparable metric that you could point to. The reason was people were really excited about the mission and about the prospects.""

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Forbes 400, the definitive ranking of America's richest people, is important because enormous wealth comes with immense power, and the public should know who is doing what with their power,"" says Forbes reporter Phoebe Liu.

""As such, Karp's addition to The Forbes 400 and Palantir's too-high valuation show that what he and his company stand for -- Western values, American defense and artificial intelligence -- are especially relevant in today's economic, cultural and geopolitical landscape. It's worth watching what happens with the ever-controversial, ever-secretive (despite being publicly traded!) firm in the coming months and years.""

LGBTQ+ people who undergo ""conversion therapy"" are more likely to experience poor mental health than those who haven't, a new study found. While scientifically discredited, the practice is still prevalent in some states:

149: The number of participants studied who had experienced conversion therapy aimed at altering their sexual orientation

23: The number of states that ban conversion therapy for minors, including Washington D.C.

1,320: The number of conversion therapy practices across 48 states and Washington, D.C., according to 2023 research from the Trevor Project

A slew of new retirement rules and changes to tax law will affect almost everyone. For instance, starting in 2026, employees 50 and older who are deemed 'high-earning' will only be able to make catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account. And if you have money left over in a 529 college savings plan, a law went into effect this year allowing penalty-free rollovers from 529 plans to a Roth IRA.

"Bitcoin Falls To Almost $60,000 As Middle Eastern Concerns Roil Markets",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/01/bitcoin-falls-to-almost-60000-as-middle-eastern-concerns-roil-markets/,2024-10-02T01:08:07Z,"Bitcoin prices plunged today, dropping to nearly $60,000 after global investors responded to the latest developments signaling rising tensions in the Middle East.

The world's most prominent digital currency fell to roughly $60,150 in the late afternoon, according to Coinbase data provided by TradingView.

At this point, the cryptocurrency had declined close to 9% since reaching more than $66,000 roughly 48 hours earlier, and was trading at its lowest value since approximately September 18, additional Coinbase figures offered by TradingView reveal.

Stocks also tumbled. At the time of this writing, the benchmark S&P 500 was down close to 1% for the day, according to Google Finance. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, an index containing 30 stocks, had fallen 0.41%, additional Google Finance figures reveal.

Brent futures contracts, on the other hand, pushed higher, rising around 2.6% to settle above $73, according to Reuters.

When explaining these latest price movements, several analysts highlighted the recent geopolitical turmoil that has taken place in the Middle East.

Earlier today, Iran attacked Israel, launching dozens of missiles at crucial targets in the latter nation, according to Al Jazeera.

In response, Benjamin Netanyahu, Israel's prime minister, pledged to retaliate, Reuters reported.

""Concerns from investors over global instability, including in the middle east, have shaken the risk-on markets from the S&P 500 to the Nasdaq to Bitcoin,"" Joe DiPasquale, CEO of cryptocurrency hedge fund manager BitBull Capital, said via email.

Julio Moreno, head of research for CryptoQuant, offered a similar assessment.

""Hello Charles, today's price action seems to be dominated by the situation in the Middle East,"" he said via Telegram.

""It also hit the stock market and oil (to the upside),"" Moreno added.

While the aforementioned analysts focused on geopolitical developments, another analyst took a different view.

""This drop is a bit of a strange one,"" Tim Enneking, managing partner of Psalion, stated through email.

""Part of the reason is due to end-of-month profit taking, especially after a month which has historically been the worst for BTC and other tokens; part is due to options expiring, again at the end of the month; and part is due to BTC being overbought, especially in relation to other tokens as BTC dominance hit a yearly high,"" he clarified.

""In short, it's a bit of a breather after an unexpectedly solid month,"" Enneking added."
Iran Missile Strike On Israel Sparks Fears In Global Oil Markets,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rrapier/2024/10/01/iran-missile-strike-on-israel-sparks-fears-in-global-oil-markets/,2024-10-01T20:09:58Z,"Oil futures surged nearly 5% on Tuesday after reports emerged that Iran launched missiles toward Israel, intensifying tensions in the Middle East and raising concerns about potential disruptions to global crude supplies. The escalating conflict adds a layer of uncertainty to an already volatile energy market, where fears of supply shortages often lead to swift price hikes.

West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude for November delivery rose 4.7% to $71.31 a barrel, marking its largest daily percentage gain since October 2023. Brent crude for December delivery also gained 4.2% to reach $74.71 a barrel. This rally reflects growing apprehension among market participants about the future of oil supplies from a region that holds some of the world's largest reserves.

Following the missile strikes, air raid sirens blared across Israel, with numerous missiles observed over Tel Aviv, Jerusalem, and Haifa. Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps claimed responsibility, stating that the attack targeted Israeli security and military sites in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and other key figures. The Israeli military, which initially estimated that around 180 missiles were fired, warned that this act of aggression ""will have consequences,"" hinting at the possibility of further escalation.

If Israel retaliates by targeting Iran's refining and oil production facilities, it could result in significant disruptions to the global oil supply. Iran's oil industry plays a critical role in the world's energy markets, given its vast reserves and production capacity.

According to the Statistical Review of World Energy, Iran produced approximately 3.9 million barrels per day in 2023, ranking as the seventh-largest oil producer globally and contributing nearly 5% of total global output. This substantial production means any prolonged disruption could have far-reaching consequences for the stability of global energy supplies and the prices consumers ultimately pay for fuel.

Iran also holds the world's fourth-largest proven crude oil reserves and is a major member of OPEC, historically producing around 3-4 million barrels per day. This makes Iran a key player in maintaining a balanced global oil supply and influencing market prices.

However, the country's oil exports have faced significant hurdles due to international sanctions, particularly by the U.S. and European countries. Despite these restrictions, Iran's oil potential continues to have a significant impact on global energy markets.

Any changes in sanctions, production levels, or geopolitical events involving Iran can lead to substantial fluctuations in oil prices, especially considering the possible addition or removal of millions of barrels of crude from the global market. The current tension underscores how crucial Iran's oil industry remains for the stability of energy markets, particularly during times of political unrest or potential supply shortages.

The recent escalation between Iran and Israel highlights the fragility of global oil supply chains and the significant influence that geopolitical events can have on energy markets. The uncertainty surrounding potential retaliations and disruptions to Iran's oil production underscores the need for a diversified global energy strategy that can withstand shocks from major producers.

Investors and policymakers alike should closely monitor these developments, as any sustained conflict could lead to prolonged instability in oil prices, impacting economies worldwide."
Defense Stocks Hit All-Time Highs Amid Middle East Escalation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/01/defense-stocks-hit-all-time-highs-amid-middle-east-escalation/,2024-10-01T19:35:38Z,"In a predictably grim phenomenon tied to outbreaks of global violence, aerospace and defense stocks climbed to record prices in an otherwise down day for the stock market, as Wall Street reacted to the latest escalation in the Middle East by anticipating larger contracts for military suppliers.

5%. That's how much prices for international oil benchmark Brent crude oil rose Tuesday by about 1:15 p.m. EDT, which would have been by far the largest single-day gain of 2024, according to FactSet data. The oil surge moderated quickly, with Brent up less than 1% by 3:15 p.m. EDT.

Defense stocks typically gain during times of heightened conflict as the companies' revenues rely heavily on U.S. government contracts, which often grow when allies like Israel and Ukraine are at war. Tuesday's market backdrop evoked unpleasant memories of the setup in late 2021 and 2022, when supply chain issues and military conflict (Russia's invasion of Ukraine) caused global inflation to surge and stocks to fall as central banks rolled out growth-stifling interest rate hikes to slow price increases. But economists largely believe the U.S. port strike won't have the same impact on inflation as the 2021-22 supply chain snags.

Wall Street's fear gauge rose to its highest level in three weeks Tuesday, as the CBOE volatility index (VIX) climbed 10% as traders dealt with new concerns in addition to fears about a potential U.S. economic slowdown. But ""although the VIX is edging higher it remains sufficiently just below 20 to suggest that markets...do not yet envision an all-out military scenario"" in the Middle East, noted LPL Financial's chief global strategist Quincy Krosby in a Tuesday note to clients."
Houthis And Iraqi Militias Target Israel Amidst Lebanon Escalation,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2024/10/01/houthis-and-iraqi-militias-target-israel-amidst-lebanon-escalation/,2024-10-01T17:05:25Z,"The Houthis in Yemen and the Iran-backed Iraqi militias that operate under the banner of the self-styled Islamic Resistance of Iraq, IRI, are continuing their long-range missile and drone attacks against Israel. Their latest attacks coincide with Israel's assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and its ground incursion into South Lebanon. They are unlikely to weaken Israel nor substantially distract it from its Lebanon offensive.

Houthi spokesperson Brig. Gen. Yahya Saree boasted in a televised speech on Tuesday that the group launched drones against military targets in Israel's financial hub, Tel Aviv, and the southern port city of Eilat. Israeli media speculated that Saree was referring to drones intercepted by the Israeli Air Force over the Mediterranean Sea off the country's coast.

Despite incurring Israeli retaliatory airstrikes, the Houthis have continued their drone and missile campaign.

The same day Israel assassinated Nasrallah -- Friday, September 27 -- Saree announced the group targeted Tel Aviv and Ashkelon with drones and missiles, vowing to continue such attacks until Israel ceases operations in Lebanon and the Gaza Strip. Israel intercepted a missile launched from Yemen that same day.

The next day, Israel intercepted another missile. The Houthis later claimed they had fired it at Tel Aviv's Ben Gurion International Airport to coincide with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's return flight from the United Nations. Israel responded Sunday by bombing Yemen in retaliation for those two attacks, killing four people and wounding 29.

The IRI also claimed Sunday that it dispatched a drone toward Eilat, its first since Nasrallah's assassination.

Even before the Hezbollah leader's demise, the IRI vowed to militarily support Hezbollah, especially following the September 17-18 Hezbollah pager and walkie-talkie explosions across Lebanon and Israel's intensified and devastating air campaign against the group.

For example, one of the most powerful groups in the IRI, Kataib Hezbollah, promptly declared it was ""fully prepared to go with them until the end, sending fighters and equipment and support, whether on the technical or logistical level.""

On September 20, a Kaitab Hezbollah commander, Abu Haider al-Khafaji, was killed by a suspected Israeli drone attack on his vehicle at Damascus airport.

When Hezbollah launched its first ballistic missile aimed at Tel Aviv on September 25, the IRI seemingly followed suit by launching drones at Eilat hours later. The IRI attack lightly injured two civilians and caused light damage. Israeli air defenses intercepted the lone Hezbollah missile.

Two days earlier, the IRI launched an estimated six attacks in 24 hours, using cruise missiles and drones. They were either intercepted or did not reach their targets.

The IRI primarily use Iranian-made Shahed 101 and Samad loitering munitions -- informally referred to as suicide or kamikaze drones -- and Al-Arqab cruise missiles, a variant of Iran's Paveh, in their attacks targeting Israel. Overall, the IRI claims it has launched more than 100 missile and drones against Israel since Hamas' fateful October 7, 2023, attacks ignited the current, ongoing hostilities throughout the region.

Iran also supplied these Iraqi militias with short-range ballistic missiles beginning in 2018. It doesn't seem the IRI has used any SRBMs, likely cognizant of the escalatory potential doing so could pose.

""The Iraqi armed factions are still cautious in getting fully involved in the conflict as they're well aware of the risks,"" wrote Middle East analyst Mohammed Salih in a post on X on September 25. ""But they seem to be steadily on course to intensify their attacks, based on their calculations, evaluation of the circumstances, and the level of support they believe is necessary to ease the pressure on Lebanese Hezbollah.""

Israel's first attack against Yemen targeted the Hodeidah port on July 20, killing 14 people, mostly port employees. It had launched the attack a day after a Houthi Samad drone struck Tel Aviv for the first time, killing one civilian. The drone had evaded Israeli air defenses by approaching Israel from its Mediterranean coast. Israel's intercept of a drone from that same general direction Tuesday morning indicates it learned from that fatal incident.

When the Houthis launched what they dubiously claimed was a hypersonic missile directly at Tel Aviv on September 15, Israeli air defenses also intercepted it. Netanyahu referenced the prior Hodeidah strike when warning the group it would pay ""a heavy price"" for such actions but did not launch any subsequent strikes until the one on Sunday mentioned above.

Unlike the Houthis in Yemen, Israel has not retaliated for any of the IRI attacks by striking those militias on Iraqi territory. It may seek to avoid making the situation for U.S. troops stationed in Iraq, who have come under repeated fire by the IRI since October 2023, more precarious, especially at a time when Washington is negotiating a troop drawdown with Baghdad. That could change if any of these attacks cause significant casualties or damage or if the IRI follows in the Houthis footsteps and fires SRBMs directly at Tel Aviv from Iraqi soil.

Following the IRI drone and cruise missile launches on September 22-23, reporters asked Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari whether Israel might retaliate with an attack in Iraq. ""We are following the threat from Iraq,"" he stated. ""We are looking at it during our situation assessment, collecting intelligence and we will do whatever is necessary to deal with the situation.""

The IRI and the Houthis claimed they carried out joint attacks against Israel in recent months, with the Yemen-based group recently opening an office in Baghdad. However, these moves seem more politically symbolic than strategic.

With Hezbollah under immense pressure in Lebanon, these groups are likely to continue firing their drones and missiles at Israel. While these attacks are an irritant for Israel, they are unlikely to pose a serious enough threat for it to divert substantial military resources away from the Lebanon front, at least in the short to medium term. For now, it will rely on its extensive, multi-layered air and missile defenses to shoot down incoming targets and, at least in the case of Yemen, its air force to launch occasional strikes in response."
New Book 'Hiding Mengele' Brings Unique Brazilian POV To Real-World Nazi Conspiracy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshweiss/2024/10/01/betina-anton-brings-brazilian-pov-to-real-world-nazi-conspiracy-with-new-book-hiding-mengele/,2024-10-01T16:40:51Z,"Even at the age of six-years-old, Betina Anton knew something strange was going on when her teacher, a woman lovingly referred to as ""Tante Liselotte,"" abruptly left the school in the middle of the semester, never to be seen again.

""It's one of my earliest memories,"" the award-winning Brazilian author/journalist recalls over Zoom, speaking to me from her home in São Paulo. ""I didn't have the notion it was something with a global impact. I didn't know that at the time, of course, but I knew that something very big happened. I could feel that.""

The year was 1985 and unbeknownst to the young Ms. Anton, authorities had just discovered that beloved ""Aunt Liselotte"" (real name: Liselotte Bossert) and her husband, Wolfram, had played a key role in hiding one of the most sought-after Nazi war criminals of all time; a man who skirted justice for over three decades.

His name? Josef Mengele.

Synonymous with the depravity of the Holocaust, Josef Mengele served as an SS doctor at the notorious Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, where he sent countless victims to the gas chambers and performed sadistic medical experiments on inmates -- twins being his favorite test subjects. His methods were so cruel and callous, that Mengele earned himself the macabre nickname ""Angel of Death.""

Having escaped Allied capture in the confusion of post-World War II Europe, the unrepentant and racist physician eventually relocated to South America, living there until he drowned off the coast of Brazil in early 1979. Even in death, however, the Nazi remained anonymous, deliberately buried under a false name by Liselotte, who never once imagined the scandal would ever see the light of day. That assumption proved to be unfounded six years later when the truth came to light and Mengele's remains were exhumed for analysis by international experts.

But how, unlike Adolf Eichmann, was the man successful in evading ardent Nazi hunters like Simon Wiesenthal, Beate Klarsfeld, and the agents of Mossad?

That is the core focus of Anton's Hiding Mengele (on sale from Diversion Books today), a tremendous work of non-fiction and, perhaps, the most significant book on the subject to ever come out of Brazil. While Mengele had already been the focus of numerous historical works, a bestselling thriller, and even a mock trial in Jerusalem (ironically held just a handful of months before the Nazi's public exhumation), Anton had not seen an exploration rooted in the very place where the saga came to an end.

""I never read anything from someone in my community talking about this guy who lived very close to me. I wanted to know more,"" explains the author, who grew up in a Lutheran enclave of São Paulo founded by German immigrants at the turn of the 19th century. ""It's my view as an insider who lives in Brazil, who knows the German community, who knows many of the places where Mengele used to go.""

The process of putting the book together took around six years of intense research and interviews all over the world, with Anton tracking down invaluable respondents like Rafi Eitan, a former Mossad operative who took part in the kidnap of Eichmann and was also tasked with finding Mengele (to no avail). ""This is a 90-year-old guy who had lived five lives in one lifetime,"" she says of the ex-spy, who died in 2019. ""He was a Mossad commander, a businessman, a [government] minister, and he was still working. He had a wonderful memory and told me things that I'd never read before ... It was very interesting to talk to someone who really lived history firsthand.""

The Israeli operation to find and bring the Angel of Death in front of a war crimes tribunal was continually stymied by budgetary and geopolitical factors. Despite the fact that he always feared the same fate as Eichmann, Mengele turned out to be one lucky fugitive. The SS doctor's mythical, boogeyman-like status worked in his favor as the hunt intensified and led to many false leads, dead ends, and empty theories. ""They had too many clues and most of them were false,"" Anton says.

His spartan lifestyle, which stood in direct contrast to the public's imagination of Nazis hiding out in South America, also played a factor in his ability to remain a ghost for so long. Where the version of the concentration camp doctor in Ira Levin's The Boys from Brazil enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, the actual Mengele ""was poor, living in the periphery among humble people,"" Anton explains.

Moreover, he was not aided and abetted by the apocryphal Odessa network, but kept afloat by his affluent family and a small chain of ex-Nazis and their sympathizers. Not exactly the far-reaching cabal of Third Reich fanatics often depicted in popular media, but that doesn't mean the secrets and danger surrounding the conspiracy to hide Mengele were no less real. A year into her research, Anton managed to track down Liselotte Bossert (then in her early 90s) in the hopes of getting the full story. Instead, the veteran journalist received a cryptic warning. ""She started saying things you don't ever expect a former teacher to tell you: 'This is a very, very dangerous subject. I think you should research something else.' I was really scared.""

One can only guess why Bossert wanted her off the trail, but thankfully, Anton continued on, disregarding the old woman's vague threats, as well as personal doubts over what the community might think. ""Many people said, 'We are of German descent. Everybody says we are Nazis. Why are you going to reinforce this image?'"" she remembers. ""But [in the end] most people liked it. I'm very relived."""
Leaders Who Flip Around Backwards Thinking Can Heal The World,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ginnywhitelaw/2024/10/01/leaders-who-flip-around-backwards-thinking-can-heal-the-world/,2024-10-01T14:57:18Z,"A friend wrote to me from Israel yesterday. She went there to do peace work and, in the midst of an intimate Israeli-Palestinian gathering for peace, the skies filled with war planes taking off. How can we bring healing to this part of the world, she asked. Or to Ukraine? Or Sudan? Or to any number of places where violence and fear prevail? Even here in the United States, there is talk of violence and disaster if the coming election does not go this way or that. Meanwhile, the climate clock keeps ticking toward irreversible tipping points, AI keeps racing toward an unrecognizable future, and we keep living and working wildly out of sync with nature, grabbing for ourselves what we need and perhaps what we can.

It's almost as if we think we're separate.

Indeed, that is the illusion underwriting all of these tumultuous conditions. We think we are separate from one another, separate from nature, separate from this whole messy picture. We may even want to separate ourselves further from thinking about it: everything is churning ""out there"" while we remain relatively unchanging ""in here."" The illusion is natural; it comes with having an ego, which all healthy human beings have and need to keep them alive. But our mistake is thinking our ego boundary defines who we are and we miss our profound interconnectedness. In our illusory, egocentric thinking we get everything backwards, creating or playing into suffering to get our needs met. We find life and death struggles everywhere, from fighting wars against people, to fighting illnesses or fighting competitors in the marketplace. Strategies arising from egocentric thinking will only perpetuate the turmoil. Leaders who flip around this backward thinking can develop strategies that heal.

This practice of flipping around backwards thinking is at the heart of Zen Leadership because Zen trains the body to see through illusion. The result is a radical reframe in our sense of self from egocentric to cosmocentric; from a particular self-in-a skin trying to make its way and difference in the world to being the whole picture with a particular body that can co-create with reality and be the difference that's needed. We go from being ""a drop in the ocean,"" as the poet, Rumi, would say, to being ""the ocean in a drop.""

Science as well points to the fallacy of our conventional, egocentric thinking. Even though it may appear that the world is changing ""out there"" while ""I"" am a relatively fixed self ""in here,"" biology and physics show us there is no way this can be true. No form in the natural world is unchanging, much less a biological form like us that can only exist by metabolizing energy. Moreover, quantum physics shows us that every moment of perception is an interaction -- a resonance -- between consciousness and a field that particularizes a reality. Resonance is a relationship, which is to vibrate with. It is both a universal principle of change and highly specific. Not everything vibrates with everything else but is tuned by what it can sense and be changed by. Just as an AM radio antenna doesn't pick up (i.e., vibrate with) FM frequencies, so our ears don't hear light.

Every one of our senses operates through resonance. Our sense organs vibrate with specific forms of energy or matter (with matter being but a dense form of energy) and set off a chain reaction that turns into information, interpretation, actions and so forth. Our eyes are tuned to light frequencies; our ears resonate with lower frequency sound waves, we have taste buds that light up with the denser form of salt and so forth. Even senses and higher order thinking that we don't name, such as sensing the ""vibe"" of a relationship, knowing the right time to act or being inspired by nature are based in resonance.

When resonance happens, like waves coming together on water, both are changed. It would be physically impossible for us to sense things without being changed by them. Among the changes they generate ""in"" us is our subjective experience of the world. Put another way: by resonating with collective fields of energy we have antenna for and participate in, we bring a temporary subjective world into being. Each and every one of us is creating our reality and changing the field by what we resonate with.

What this flipped view offers us is a boundaryless sense of who we are. We are both matter and energy, both in our skin and not in our skin, both creating a subjective experience and feeding the field from which others draw their subjective experiences. Our physical bodies are not the limits of our self, but rather antenna for boundaryless dynamic interaction with what physics would call the quantum field, what Jung labeled as the collective unconscious and Buddhism would call universal Mind.

What this means for leadership is far-reaching. For starters, putting ourselves in service of the whole picture -- since we are also that whole picture -- is not an act of altruism, but the most natural orientation in the world. The ego that we once considered the center of our existence is recast into a supporting role that helps integrate our experience and keep us alive, yet by no means is the sum total of who we are. In seeing both its usefulness and limitations, we can increasingly see through the ego, rather than be bound by its conditioning. In leadership, this might show up as a flip from certainty to curiosity, from knowing to creativity or from arrogance to sincere listening.

Settling into this cosmocentric sense of self changes the way leaders approach opportunities and challenges. For example, in the discovery phase of a project we recognize there is no privileged perspective or all-knowing interpretation of the field of possibility, so we cultivate and honor diversity (rather than tolerate it) to get the broadest possible information. In working through conflicting perspectives and inevitable paradoxes in decision making, we don't get stuck in one-sided points of view but look to how we can use differences like the poles of a battery to power a greater good. In launching a project into the world, we accept that we don't get to control outcomes, but we do get to control the sincerity of our effort and the quality of feedback we gather to see where our efforts are resonating or need adjusting. Feel how different these approaches are from the warmongering produced by egocentric thinking. These are strategies that heal.

But perhaps the most valuable corollary to this flipped around leadership perspective is that we know: to change the world, we change ourselves. Imagining a desired future we want to bring into the present, the question becomes: how do we need to change as receivers/transmitters in the field in order that our subjective experience of the world matches that future? For example, who are we working with in that desired future whom we're not working with now? How do we spend time differently? What do we know that we don't know now? Each inquiry can show us how we need to change and may trigger adjustments. If we can't match the ""us"" of that future, that future is not possible. Inasmuch as we do match it, we bring it into now both for ourselves and others.

Discovering how we need to change as leaders to be healing is exactly what brings healing into the world."

JD Vance, R-Ohio, will likely be asked about his opinions on abortion and other major policy issues when he faces off against Minnesota Gov.

Vance told The New York Times in February that his populist economic vision can be described as ""applying as much upward pressure on wages and as much downward pressure on the services that the people use as possible."" The senator said he supports raising the minimum wage as an incentive to get workers back in the workforce -- and has co-sponsored legislation to raise it -- and other government intervention to boost industries, like providing subsidies or tax credits. He does not support more stringent government regulations on private businesses, however, telling The Times that to boost the economy, ""there's a lot you can do on the regulatory side -- make building nuclear facilities easier, make building natural gas pipelines easier, make building housing easier -- that doesn't cost money and in fact brings in money."" Vance also supports tariffs that impose taxes on foreign goods, saying that while that can result in higher prices, ""when you are forced to do more with your domestic labor force, you have all of these positive dynamic effects."" He told The Times that while he wouldn't want to raise taxes on middle class Americans, he isn't necessarily opposed to raising taxes on the wealthy, but asked, ""How much revenue does that actually raise?"" Vance is also a big proponent of cryptocurrency, holding bitcoin himself and drafting legislation that would help the cryptocurrency industry.

Vance told The Times he supports Social Security, saying, ""I don't know why people think that you solve many problems by taking a bunch of elderly people and saying, 'You're on your own.'"" The senator suggested he believes in raising more money for the program through a combination of tariffs and bolstering the American labor force, arguing that if more Americans are working rather than relying on public assistance, it would mean more money can go toward Social Security.

Vance has been widely criticized for his views on abortion. In 2022 he said he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally"" and opposed the idea that pregnant people could simply cross state lines to obtain an abortion if the state where they reside banned the procedure. He has also compared abortion to slavery, saying in 2021, ""While the people who obviously suffer the most are those subjected to it, I think it has this morally distorting effect on the entire society."" The senator was part of a broader group of GOP lawmakers who asked Attorney General Merrick Garland to enforce the Comstock Act in 2023, a long-dormant law from the 19th century that would ban the mailing of anything related to abortion. While the letter specifically asked to stop the mailing of abortion pills, experts have suggested the law could be interpreted more broadly to ban the mailing of abortion-related equipment altogether, which would effectively ban the procedure in practice by ensuring physicians can't get the necessary materials to perform it. Vance has more recently downplayed his former support for restricting abortion and endorsed Trump's view of leaving the issue up to the states.

Vance has echoed Trump in calling for mass deportations of immigrants from the U.S. and criticized the Biden administration for allowing an influx of undocumented immigrants. He also helped spread false rumors against Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, and disapproved of the Biden administration extending temporary legal protections to Haitian migrants. The senator has denounced using immigrants for cheaper labor in the U.S., saying business owners should instead increase incentives to lure American workers.

Vance has perhaps garnered the most attention for his attacks on childless Americans, with comments resurfacing from 2021 in which he complained about Democrats being ""childless cat ladies"" who ""want to make the rest of the country miserable too"" and don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future. While Vance has claimed his comments were a joke, they do reflect his broader views, as the senator has pushed policies that would incentivize people to have children and benefit families. He has suggested there should be a higher tax rate for childless adults and even said in 2021 parents should have more voting power than voters without children, and has touted a policy in Hungary that provides loans to married couples and then forgives those loans if the couple has children. Vance has supported ""universal childbirth"" policies that would provide healthcare coverage for childbirth, though he has opposed ""universal childcare"" proposals, which he said in 2021 are a ""massive subsidy to the lifestyle preferences of the affluent over the preferences of the middle and working class."" He has also supported expanding child tax credits for low-income families, but has been criticized for missing a Senate vote on the issue. The senator made comments in 2021 suggesting he was against no-fault divorce -- though he did not explicitly call for repealing it -- claiming that ""children suffered"" because of more relaxed views around divorce and calling for a return to viewing marriage as ""sacred"" in order to preserve American families.

Vance has deep ties to the Heritage Foundation, the conservative think tank spearheading the controversial Project 2025 policy agenda proposing an extreme overhaul of the executive branch should Trump win the election. The senator authored the introduction to Heritage president Kevin Roberts' forthcoming book -- which calls for a ""second American Revolution"" and says ""it's time to circle the wagons and load the muskets"" -- and has long been allied with the organization, with Roberts telling Politico in March Vance is ""absolutely going to be one of the leaders -- if not the leader -- of our movement."" Prior to joining Congress, Vance penned the introduction to a Heritage Foundation report that endorses many of the policies also mentioned in Project 2025, promoting heterosexual nuclear families and decrying abortion and public assistance programs. He has also expressed support for a key pillar of the Project 2025 agenda, which calls for replacing career civil servants with political appointees. Vance has not explicitly endorsed Project 2025, however, particularly as the Trump campaign has tried to distance itself from its proposals. He said in July, prior to becoming Trump's running mate, that he thinks ""there's some good ideas in"" Project 2025's policy blueprint, but it also has ""some things I disagree with.""

LGBTQ+ advocacy groups criticized Vance's nomination as Trump's running mate due to his record on LGBTQ+ rights. As a senator, Vance introduced legislation opposing transgender rights, authoring bills that would classify gender-affirming care for minors as a felony and ban ""X"" from being used as a neutral gender designation on U.S. passports. Vance also said in 2022 he would vote no on legislation to legalize same-sex marriage nationwide, and has voiced support for policies like Florida's law known as ""Don't Say Gay,"" which restrict what schools can say about sexual orientation and gender identity.

Vance is one of the GOP lawmakers who has vocally opposed providing additional aid to Ukraine, and has come under fire for saying in 2022 that he ""do[esn't] really care what happens to"" the eastern European country. The senator called at the Republican National Convention for the U.S.'s allies to ""share in the burden of securing world peace,"" saying there should be ""no more free rides for nations that betray the generosity of the American taxpayer,"" and told The Times in June the U.S. ""should be dealing with other countries based on whether they're good or bad for America's interests."" He criticized the Biden administration's Ukraine policy to The Times, saying the U.S. was not sufficiently working to deter China from invading Taiwan because ""we're sending all the damn weapons to Ukraine,"" though also acknowledged that handling the situation in Ukraine means ""there's going to have to be some American security assistance over the long term."" Vance also agreed that Russia gaining control of Ukraine is ""is not in our interest."" The senator has expressed strong support for Israel in its war against Hamas, saying at a rally on Saturday that his peace plan is ""elect Donald Trump"" and suggesting he aligns with Trump's view that ""the only way to get to peace is to destroy Hamas and let Israel finish the job.""

Vance's views stand in stark contrast to Democratic rival Walz, who has championed progressive policies including abortion rights, LGBTQ+ rights and opposing climate changes. Walz is a gun owner but is strongly in favor of gun control measures like universal background checks and banning bump stocks, in contrast to Vance, whom the National Rifle Association described as ""a true Second Amendment champion"" and has opposed gun control reforms. As governor of Minnesota, Walz has signed bills into law that include free meals for school children, expanded protections for workers, restoring voting rights for the formerly incarcerated, climate change initiatives and legalizing marijuana, among other measures. Like Vance, Walz supports expanding the child tax credit, and he helped enact a nation-leading $1,750 tax credit in Minnesota after a federal tax credit expired. Walz's administration also eliminated many beneficiaries' income taxes on Social Security benefits, which Trump has also called for.

While Vance's economic philosophy has a strong emphasis on bolstering the American worker, the senator has come under fire from the left for his mixed record on supporting labor unions. Though Vance made headlines for visiting striking United Auto Workers union members on the picket line, the senator opposed the PRO Act that would have strengthened protections for unionized workers and codified the collective bargaining process. He told Politico in March that he opposed the legislation in part because he favors a system where industries negotiate union deals, rather than individual workplaces or companies, and because he ""think[s] it's dumb to hand over a lot of power to a union leadership that is aggressively anti-Republican.""

Vance has reached across the aisle for several of his efforts in Congress, working with Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, on a bill to improve rail safety standards after the train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio, and with Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., on legislation regarding banking regulations. The vice presidential candidate told Politico in March that his wariness of big corporations often aligns him with progressive Democrats even as he disagrees with them on other issues, saying, ""If you look at the people that I've worked with most successfully, it's people who, even though they're from the left, recognize that something's pretty fundamentally broken about American society."" Warren, for example, is ""at least thinking deeply about what's going on in the country and why things seem to be going off the rails,"" Vance said. In his June interview with The Times, Vance said ""Bernie Bros"" are the group on the left ""whose politics I'm open to,"" while criticizing ""center-left liberals who are doing very well,"" arguing them and their center-right counterparts ""have an incredible blind spot about how much their success is built on a system that is not serving people who they should be serving.""

34.7%. That's the average number of U.S. adults who have a favorable view of Vance as of Monday, according to a compilation of polls by FiveThirtyEight, versus 45.7% of Americans who have a negative view of him. Polling suggests the Ohio senator is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential candidate in at least the past 20 years, according to FiveThirtyEight."
"Forbes Daily: Ahead Of Debate, How Much Are Vance And Walz Worth?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/10/01/forbes-daily-ahead-of-debate-how-much-are-vance-and-walz-worth/,2024-10-01T12:11:37Z,"You don't just need to be a billionaire to make this year's Forbes 400 list. The cutoff for the 2024 list of America's 400 wealthiest is $3.3 billion.

In fact, for the first time, there are more American billionaires not on the list than are on it. But many of those who did make the cut are familiar faces: Elon Musk is the richest person in America for a third-straight year, followed by Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.

Perhaps the most notable person to make the list, despite falling off of it last year, is Donald Trump, who has cashed in on the presidency more than anyone else, and benefitted from the shaky stock market run of Truth Social's parent company.

The S&P 500 had its best start to the year through September since 1997, gaining 21% so far this year. Big tech stocks benefitting from the generative AI boom have performed best, though the market has shifted slightly in recent months as investors anticipated and reacted to this month's supersized interest rate cut.

Dockworkers along the East and Gulf Coasts walked out on strike early Tuesday, a stoppage that one economist estimated could cost the economy up to $7.5 billion per week. The International Longshoremen's Association is requesting a wage increase as part of a new contract with the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents shipping companies.

If former President Donald Trump wins in November, it could hamper the Chinese stock market's recent rally, JPMorgan Chase strategists cautioned Monday. The risk of a Trump presidency for emerging market stocks is tied to his hawkish trade policies, especially toward China. Still, the strategists noted that emerging market stocks could be at a ""turning point.""

Fintech heavyweights like Jack Dorsey's Block and payments giant Stripe are joining a new compliance coalition for fintechs, in an effort to avoid the missteps of recent years -- which have led to everything from the dramatic collapse of Synapse to a surge in regulatory enforcement actions against fintech sponsor banks. ""Fintechs need to step it up and understand that regulatory requirements are real,"" says former startup CEO Sima Gandhi, a lawyer and former Department of Treasury official who organized the effort.

Aerospace and defense firm Sierra Nevada Corp. landed a $13.1 billion contract to build the next nuclear-ready 'Doomsday' planes, a game-changer for the privately-held company. The Doomsday project will help define the legacy of chairwoman and co-owner Eren Ozmen and her husband, who are worth a combined $7.8 billion. ""Taking smart risks is very important,"" says Ozmen. ""Without that, really, you're just following what's happening -- you're not leading.""

Video game company Epic Games accused Google and Samsung in a federal lawsuit of colluding to harm third-party app stores on smartphones running Google's Android operating system. Epic has taken on both Google and Apple in recent years, alleging that the companies abused their dominant position in the smartphone market to charge excessive fees to app makers.

X, formerly known as Twitter, is worth a little more than one-fifth of the $44 billion Elon Musk paid to acquire it in 2022, according to Fidelity. Fidelity's stake in the social media platform is now worth about $4.19 million, valuing X at $9.4 billion, according to recent disclosures from the financial services company.

Before JD Vance and Tim Walz face off in the vice presidential debate tonight, Forbes took a look at how the candidates stack up financially. While Vance is worth $10 million, exceeding Walz's net worth of just over $1 million, both candidates are less wealthy than their potential bosses: Donald Trump is worth $3.9 billion, while Kamala Harris has a net worth of $7 million.

As Donald Trump became perhaps the most polarizing and controversial president in recent memory, hotels began removing the Trump brand -- but he still made millions. The most likely explanation? Breakup fees. It's tough to say exactly how much all the breakup fees add up to, but Forbes estimates it was at least $15 million and could have been as high as $25 million.

The Israeli Defense Forces began ""limited, localized, and targeted ground raids ... in southern Lebanon"" against Hezbollah targets and infrastructure Monday -- escalating the conflict in the Middle East after Israel killed a number of Hezbollah leaders. The IDF said that the operations were ""approved and carried out in accordance with the decision of the political echelon.""

TOPLINE It was another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months -- some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars.

In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400.

This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500's 27% return.

Much of the gains come from two people: Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They're two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits.

Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after Forbes increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Forbes 400 is a roadmap of America's great wealth,"" says Forbes senior editor Chase Peterson-Withorn. ""The 400 richest people in the nation are richer, and thus in many ways more powerful, than ever. It's crucial to investigate who they are, how they made it, where they spend it and how they choose to (or, as is often the case, choose not to) donate it.""

Huge Spike In Russian Drone Attacks For Winter With Chinese Help,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidhambling/2024/10/01/huge-spike-in-russian-drone-attacks-for-winter-with-chinese-help/,2024-10-01T09:16:27Z,"Russia's strategic drone assault on Ukraine is has reached a new intensity. Attacks which were rising gradually through 2024 but have spiked dramatically, with over 1300 Shahed long-range drones reported in September, far higher than any previous month. This is the first month that drone attacks have been recorded every single day, as the details painstakingly compiled by ShahedTracker show. While most drones are shot down, some get through and cause significant damage.

Although Ukraine reports all these drones simply as as 'Shaheds' there are increasing signs that the Iranian-designed Shahed are being supplemented by at least three other types, some reportedly supplied directly by China.

These attacks are of critical strategic importance. Ukraine's power infrastructure is already severely damaged. As the Washington Post noted this week: ""The best-case scenario is just four hours of power cuts a day, but it could also end up being 20 hours of darkness or more a day in the depths of Ukraine's frigid winter.""

If the attacks continue at this increased level through the winter they could have a major impact on Ukraine's economy and morale. What weapons is Russia bringing to bear in this long-range bombardment?

The mainstay of the assault is the Shahed-136, known in Russia as Geran-2 (""Geranium-2""). The Shahed-136 is a one-way attack drone developed by Iran, with a seven-foot wingspan, a warhead of around 100 pounds and a range in excess of 600 miles. A propeller engine with 115 mph cruising speed means the Shahed is slower, less powerful and easier to shoot down than traditional cruise missiles, but it costs much less and can be produced at scale. Russia makes Shaheds in a giant new factory in Alabuga with cheap labor -- students drafted in from a nearby technical college and workers brought in from Africa.

We have seen several modifications from the basic Shahed. New versions have at least three types of warhead, and some carry 4G cell modems which communicate via the Ukrainian cellphone network; more recently a Shahed was found with Starlink communications. Black, supposedly radar-absorbing coating, probably to make them less visible at night is now standard.

Earlier waves of Shaheds came in at very low level, now with the prevalence of mobile air defence groups they approach at high altitude until they reach their target, so they can only be brought down by expensive missiles or by aircraft and helicopters.

According to an estimate in the Wall Street Journal, Russia aims to produce 500 Shaheds per month. The numbers of drones now being launched suggest other types are now involved.

As we reported in August 2023, the tenants were evicted from the Italmas shopping mall, 700 miles east of Moscow when the Aersocan company acquired it as a drone factory. The factory is for a new model, Izdelie 54 ('Product 54') described a loitering munition with a range of over 200 kilometers. Product 52 and Product 53 from Aersocan subsidiary ZALA are two versions of the highly successful Lancet tactical kamikaze drone, while Product 55 is a 'jam-proof' kamikaze FPV.

Product-54 was seen in the background of TV news footage when Putin visited an Aersocan facility in September 2023. It has a delta-wing layout similar to the Shahed.

Towards the end of 2023 Russian media reported the new drones in action though this was not confirmed. The drones were described as being smaller than the familiar Shaheds, and their engine makes a different noise; this was identified at Product-54 and has been given the nickname Italmas. Others call them 'lawnmowers' from the engine sound, to distinguish them from Shaheds, which are called 'mopeds'.

The Italmas has a DLE 60-type engine, a popular 60 cc engine for hobby drones from Chinese makers DLE engines. This delivers a fraction of the power of the Shahed's MD550 engine, reinforcing the impression that Italmas is a lighter, cheaper drone with a small warhead, thrown in to add to the numbers and confuse defenders.

Images of another new Russian drone appeared on social media sites in July. This is also smaller than the Shahed and as a different configuration with a conventional tail.

A Russian unit called Stalin's Falcons posted further details in a video later that month. They say the new drone is called Gerbera (another flower), and can carry out reconnaissance or decoy missions in addition to kamikaze attacks. Gerbera has a camera in its nose, and the video shows it can be guided visually to the target. A captured unit also had a SIM card and modem, so in theory it could be guided from long range via the cellphone network. It is a product of the Gastello Design Bureau, rather than any of the majors; the name 'Gastello,' from a famous Soviet pilot, was previously used for a Russian FPV which may be from the same makers.

Gerbera is described as Shahed's 'little sister', again implying a smaller payload. Further details such as warhead and range are unknown, but given that a Gerbera was brought down outside Kyiv it can travel several hundred kilometers at least. Ukrainian sources suggest that Gerberas main role is as a decoy.

The most alarming new drone is the Garpiya-3 (""Harpy-3""). According to a report in Reuters, the Garpiya-3 was designed by a subsidiary of Russian state-owned weapons company Almaz-Antey and has a range of about 2,000 km / 1200 miles with a warhead of 50 kilos / 110 lbs .

According to Reuters, Garpiya-3 does not just use Chinese components but will be produced ""at scale at a factory in China.""

We already knew that China made Shahed-type attack drones. A video from September 2023 shows the test of a Chinese Sunflower-200 drone - another flower name, and apparently a straight copy of the Shahed. One Chinese company even briefly offered another Shahed clone in the Ali Baba online marketplace. Officially sold for 'surveying, mapping, inspection' the $57,000 XHZ-50 with its 50 kilo / 110-pound payload offered strategic attack capability for the price of an SUV.

If China actually uses its industrial drone capacity to supply Russia with strategic weapons, then the number of drones will be limited only by Russia's ability to pay for them. Reuters have seen documents indicating that two Garpiya-3s have already been delivered to Almaz-Antey in Russia via a Russian intermediary. The delivery dates were not known, so larger shipments may already have been made.

Ukraine has beaten back waves of 400-600 Shaheds a month. Fighting off twice or three times that number with dwindling reserves of surface-to-air missiles will be a bigger challenge. The infrastructure has taken a pummeling over the last two and a half years, and further intense bombardment could tear holes in it.

Greater discrimination is important. If the defenders can separate the smaller Gerbera and Italmas they can concentrate their efforts on the real threat. And if new FPV interceptor drones, which have been effective against Russian reconnaissance drones, prove effective against Shaheds they will be a game changer.

Two things are clear. One is that Ukraine needs better air defenses, something the West can help with. Another is that no country, except possibly Israel, is ready for the sort of massed long-range drone barrage likely to feature in any future war anywhere in the world."
