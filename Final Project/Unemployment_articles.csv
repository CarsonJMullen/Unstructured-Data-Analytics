Azerbaijan's human-rights record is under fire as it prepares to host UN climate talks,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5145637/azerbaijan-human-rights-climate-change-cop29,2024-10-08T21:28:09Z,"Human rights activists and lawmakers in the United States are calling for Azerbaijan to end alleged abuses of civil society groups and ethnic Armenians ahead of a global climate change summit the country will host in November.

A new report from Human Rights Watch and Freedom Now says Azerbaijan is carrying out an ""escalating crackdown"" on government critics and activists. That includes the arrest this spring of human-rights advocate Anar Mammadli, who co-founded a group to work on issues related to climate justice.

The report was published days after dozens of U.S. lawmakers urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken to push for the release of political prisoners and hostages in Azerbaijan, a major oil and gas producer on the Caspian Sea that borders Russia, Iran and Armenia. The lawmakers said Azerbaijan carried out an ethnic cleansing last year in Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-majority enclave. And they pointed to a State Department report that found ""significant human rights issues"" in the country, including credible reports of arbitrary detentions and unlawful or arbitrary killings.

U.S. lawmakers told Blinken that the upcoming COP29 climate negotiations in Azerbaijan offer ""a pivotal platform"" to promote energy security in the region and to help countries like Armenia cut their dependence on Russia for natural gas. The criticism of Azerbaijan also comes against the backdrop of growing concern globally that grassroots efforts to limit and adapt to climate change are being met with state pushback and human rights abuses.

""When civic space is actively shut down, the voices of those most affected by the climate crisis are at risk of being excluded from the negotiations,"" Myrto Tilianaki, a senior advocate for the environment and human rights at Human Rights Watch, said at a press conference Tuesday. ""And that is a major problem, because if their lived experiences and solutions aren't heard, the policies that come out of these talks might not fully reflect their needs or protect their rights.""

A spokesperson for Azerbaijan's Embassy in Washington wasn't immediately available for comment.

Responding to the earlier allegations from U.S. lawmakers, the embassy said Azerbaijan is a victim of an ""orchestrated disinformation campaign.""

The selection of Azerbaijan to host this year's climate talks shows the country is ""a responsible and credible member of the international community,"" the embassy said in a statement. It added that ""human rights have nothing to do with permissiveness to engage in illegal activities.""

The report from Human Rights Watch and Freedom Now says recent arrests of activists and media figures in Azerbaijan were primarily linked to laws restricting nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The arrests were politically motivated, the report says, and ""follow well-established, abusive methods the government has used for many years to curtail freedom of speech and freedom of association in the country.""

In most of the cases documented in the report, people who worked for or were involved with unregistered NGOs and independent media outlets were charged with smuggling money into Azerbaijan. Some of those people were also charged with crimes such as illegal entrepreneurship, forgery and tax evasion, according to the report. In other cases, people were charged with extremism, drug possession, counterfeiting and treason.

The circumstances and timing of most of those arrests ""strongly suggest that the criminal charges were merely a pretext intended to punish and put an end to activists' legitimate work,"" according to Human Rights Watch and Freedom Now.

Azerbaijan was picked to host this year's United Nations climate talks after Russia blocked bids from countries in the European Union, which has supported Ukraine in its war with Moscow.

At last year's climate conference in the United Arab Emirates, countries agreed to move away from fossil fuels, the main driver of human-caused global warming. However, Azerbaijan has suggested the world can meet its climate targets while continuing to produce fossil fuels.

Oil and gas pays for a large share of Azerbaijan's budget, and the country is poised to increase gas production by a third over the next decade, according to an analysis by Global Witness, an environmental and human rights group.

""I have always said that having oil and gas deposits is not our fault. It's a gift from God,"" Ilham Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, said at a conference earlier this year. ""We must not be judged by that. We must be judged based on how we use these reserves for the development of the country, to reduce poverty and unemployment, and on what our targets are with respect to the green agenda.""

One of the cases highlighted by Human Rights Watch and Freedom Now involves an economist named Gubad Ibadoghlu who was arrested on charges related to the production of counterfeit currency and extremism. Ibadoghlu has argued that average citizens in Azerbaijan don't benefit from the country's oil and gas reserves because revenues are mismanaged. And he recently examined plans for greater energy cooperation between Azerbaijan and the European Union, questioning how much gas Azerbaijan could send to Europe. If he's convicted, the report says Ibadoghlu faces 17 years in prison."
3 Top Stocks To Buy Now After The Fed Rate Cut,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-stocks-to-buy-now-after-fed-rate-cut/,2024-10-08T21:13:42Z,"The Federal Reserve committee inaugurated the much-anticipated interest rate cut cycle in mid-September, slashing half-a-percentage point off its benchmark rates without waiting to hit its actual 2% inflation target. The objective of the bigger-than-expected rate cut was to avert a recession, when a weaker-than-expected July jobs report officially triggered the Sahm Rule-a historical recession indicator that has a consistent 100% (well, almost) accuracy rate for every recession since the early 1970s. This gives rise to a few questions like:

The Federal Reserve launched its interest rate cut cycle on September 18, by aggressively slashing 50 basis points off benchmark rates, lowering the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The federal funds rate represents the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans to fulfill their reserve requirements. Banks are mandated by law to hold a reserve equal to a specific percentage of their deposits, referred to as the reserve requirement to ensure that bank is capable of meeting sudden withdrawals.

This is the first rate cut in four years since the Fed's emergency response to pandemic shutdowns in March 2020. Another half-percentage point reduction before this year-end is likely in the cards with an additional percentage-point cut anticipated in 2025.

The Fed raised interest rates from March 2022 to July 2023, to ease inflation that surged to the highest levels in more than four decades. In June 2022, inflation in the U.S. reached a whopping 9.1%, as prices and demand soared amid pandemic-disrupted supply constraints and unprecedented government stimulus programs that pumped about $5 trillion into the economy. When inflation shoots up, the Fed Reserve typically steps in to cool the inflation by raising interest rates and making borrowing more expensive. This brings down spending and demand thereby inflation.

The corollary to rising interest rates is an increase in borrowing costs for businesses as well, which in turn triggers cost-cutting, slowdown in expansion initiatives, layoffs and lesser new hires. This leads to an increase in the unemployment rate, which was 4.1% in September, up from 3.8% in the same month last year. A rise in unemployment rate alongside a slowdown in hiring has renewed recession concerns.

With the half-a-percentage cut, the Fed is hoping for a soft landing, a scenario in which the economy slows sufficiently to reduce inflation without entering a recession. The Fed's mandate is to restore price stability, while trying not to increase unemployment, even as its 2% inflation target appears within reach. Experts opine that a soft landing is plausible but far from guaranteed.

The current inflation rate is 2.5%, the lowest since February 2021, and lower than the long-term average of 3.28%. The fact that the Fed did not wait until the 2% inflation target was hit clearly shows where its priorities lie now-to avoid a recession.

Historically accurate and reliable recession indicators like the Sahm Rule are now facing skepticism because the pandemic has disrupted normal business activity and complicated forecasting efforts. The Sahm Rule, named after former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, states that a recession may happen when the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate rises by 0.50 percentage points or more when compared to its low during the previous 12 months. The Sahm Rule has maintained an impressive accuracy rate of nearly 100% for every recession since the early 1970s. The only exception occurred in November 1976, when the rule was triggered without a corresponding or subsequent recession.

The Sahm Rule reading was 0.53% for July when the unemployment rate hit 4.3%. However, the rule's inventor Sahm herself rebutted the surge of catastrophic narratives, stating that ""I am not concerned that, at this moment, we are in a recession."" in an interview with Fortune. However, she also added later ""I think the recession odds, given what we're seeing in the labor market, are increasing."" While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was slightly dismissive of the Sahm Rule as more of a ""statistical regularity"" than an ""economic rule."" Sahm believes the rule shouldn't be dismissed as it's been very accurate over time and noted that ""recessions can build slowly, and then come quickly.""

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped from 4.3% in July to 4.2% in August and 4.1% in September showing improvements ahead of the upcoming elections in November. In September, the U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs exceeding estimates for 150,000 new jobs. The upbeat September jobs report should silence concerns about an impending disaster at least for now.

Nevertheless, unemployment rates will be a key data point to watch going forward. Any material rise in unemployment and fall in hiring may likely hit consumer spending, which has thus far been resilient because of strong wage gains. It is natural for people to cut back on spending when facing unemployment or the threat of losing a job.

High interest rates incentivize the consumer to save money, while lower interest rates tend to influence the consumer to borrow, spend and invest. Consumer spending is the main driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

Fed rate cuts are expected to be most impactful for credit cards that have variable interest rates. The previous Fed rate hike cycle has pushed the variable interest rates on credit cards close to all-time highs of above 21% currently, from around 14.6% in March 2022 when the rate hikes began. As the rate cut cycle unfolds, credit card rates will likely ease below 20%, offering some degree of relief for borrowers.

Mortgage rates for both 15-year and 30-year fixed loans are typically linked to Treasury yields and the overall economy, are likely to decrease slightly but are unlikely to return to the lows seen in the last decade. Currently, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage hovers around 6.2%. Experts predict these rates will remain between 6% and 6.5%, with the possibility of dipping below 6%. However, elevated home prices may still deter potential home buyers.

Auto loans are fixed with the average rate on a five-year new car loan being 6.8% in the second quarter, sharply higher than the 4% levels at the beginning of rate hikes. While the easing of rates may encourage car buyers who have pushed-out on purchases, the limiting factor could still be higher vehicle prices and lack of incentives for buyers.

The fixed nature of Federal student loan rates also means that a rate cut may have no impact on these borrowers, because these interest rates don't change over the loan term.

Savings rates have benefitted from the rate hike cycle. A high-yield savings account (HYSA) offers nearly 5% interest, while top interest rates from certificate of deposit (CD) instruments range from 4.00% to 5%. While these interest rates could decline, the opportunity still exists to secure a HYSA or CD before rates drop further.

A research study by Hartford Funds shows that 7 of the 11 Fed rate cutting periods from 1980 to 2024 were accompanied by recessions. While recession is not a desirable condition, how does it impact the stock market? Here are some interesting observations.

An analysis by Hartford Funds of 22 Fed rate-cutting cycles since 1928 revealed that the S&P 500 benchmark index on average outperformed government bonds and corporate bonds in the 12 months after the Fed started cutting interest rates. The average 12-month real return (after adjusting for inflation) from the date of first rate cut for U.S. stocks (represented by the S&P 500 index) has been 11% vs. 5% returns for government bonds and 6% returns for corporate bonds and 2% returns for cash.

The average returns of the stock market in the 22 rate cut cycles is even more impressive considering that in 16 out of 22 cycles the U.S. economy was already in a recession when the rate cuts were initiated or entered a recession within a 12 month period.

During the non-recessionary, rate-cut cycles the stock market returned a solid 17% on average (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut) vs. 2% for government bonds, 4% for corporate bonds and 3% for cash. In the event of a recessionary, rate-cut period, the stock market still returned a positive 8% on average vs. 7% for government and corporate bonds and 2 % for cash (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut.)

While these stock market returns seem solid, investors should remember that this is an average value for 22 rate cut cycles. The stock market suffered heavy losses too during recessionary periods. In 6 out of 22 rate cut cycles, stock market returns fluctuated widely between a negative 10% to negative 45%.

After the much touted ""great rotation"" into small-cap stocks, the focus is shifting to mid-cap stocks, because investors may be looking at a situation where small-caps may still be risky and large caps still too expensive. Until the Fed achieves the targeted soft landing, recession worries will continue to linger at the backdrop. Besides, the longer-for-higher interest rates have also triggered concerns about a slower-than-anticipated Fed rate easing cycle.

With stronger fundamentals (higher profitability and solid balance sheet) vs. small-caps and attractive valuations vs. large-caps, mid-caps seem better positioned to benefit from the present Fed rate cuts. Yet another solid reason for the pivot to mid-caps is the historical outperformance of mid-caps vs. large caps and small caps in the first 3 and 12 months subsequent to the first Fed rate cut. According to Goldman Sachs, the S&P 400 mid-cap index has been an outperformer since 1984 vs. the S&P 500 (large-caps) and Russell 2000 (small-caps) in the 3 and 12 months following the first Fed first rate cut. Presently, Goldman Sachs projects a 13% return for the S&P 400 index over the next 12 months.

Elf Beauty qualifies as a high growth beauty company, having grown sales and market share for 22 straight quarters, and averaging at least 20% sales growth per quarter. Over the past five years, Elf has expanded its top one/two positions from across eight segments in the color cosmetics category to 18 segments, which now account for over 80% of its Elf cosmetics sales. The company's ""Holy Grail"" approach centers on creating value versions of prestige products to align with consumer preferences. For reference, the average price point for Elf is about $6.50 vs. around $9.50 for legacy mass cosmetics brands and more than $20 for prestige brands. Elf's recent Bronzing Drops is comparable to a prestige product in the market at a third of the price. This strategy has helped solidify Elf's outperformance in the cosmetics category.

Solid market share gains: Elf Beauty's color cosmetics business continues to be a category outperformer. A 26% growth across track channels in the first quarter vs. a 1% decline for the category, has helped ELF grow its cosmetics market share to 12.3% presently. This represents a more than 2x increase from 5.7% market share in the same quarter three years ago. ELF expects to double its cosmetics market share again in a few years.

Shelf-space gains with Walmart, top share with Target, Opportunities at groceries, drug stores: With Target, a long-standing customer, Elf Cosmetics is the number one brand for six quarters in a row with its share rising from 13% to 21%. A 50% shelf space gain from 8 feet to 12 feet at Walmart is commendable, but still underpenetrated vs. legacy brands that have a 16 feet to 20 feet shelf space. The opportunities for expansion are attractive at Target, Walmart and Alta, alongside growth at grocery and drug stores, where ELF currently has a much smaller footprint.

Maximizing Brand Performance with Retail Partners: Elf proactively refreshes up to 20% of its retail assortment annually, leveraging insights from its digital business and beauty squad loyalty programs. This strategy has doubled its average sales per SKU over the past five years, making it a highly productive brand in terms of dollar sales per foot basis with retailers.

Growing Skincare business: Elf Beauty hopes to replicate the success in its cosmetics business across its skincare segment. For the latest first quarter, Elf SKIN grew 45% in track channels, vs. category growth of 1.4%. Elf SKIN has roughly 2% market share as of the first quarter vs. 14% share for the leading skin care brand. ELF's Naturium acquisition from last year should also help unlock growth in the skin category.

International expansion opportunities: International sales accounted for 16% of ELF's total first-quarter sales, up from 13% a year ago, but is still underpenetrated vs. global peers that have a 70% exposure to international sales. International expansion represents a key growth runway for ELF.

Upbeat Guidance: ELF recently raised guidance for fiscal 2025 (ending on March 31, 2025), now expecting adjusted EPS of $3.36 to $3.41, on sales of $1.28 billion to $1.30 billion, from prior expectations of $3.20 to $3.25 EPS on sales of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion. The revised guidance compares more favorably with year-ago EPS of $3.18 on revenues of $1.02 billion.

ELF Stock Sell-off presents opportunity: Despite these positive developments, ELF stock trades way off its 52-week intra-day high of $221.83 reached in early March. After a couple of attempts in late June and mid July to recapture the highs of the year, the stock has fallen sharply amid concerns regarding the sustainability of its growth rates above 20%. However, it still has a Strong Buy rating from 16 Wall Street analysts.

Medpace is a full-service clinical contract research organization providing Phase I-IV clinical development services for the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Medpace calls itself as a CRO trusted by biotechs with a focus on small to mid-sized biopharma customers that represented more than 95% of its 2023 revenues. With an estimated 5% market share in the small and mid-sized biopharma space, Medpace sees an estimated core addressable biopharma CRO market of $28 billion.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profit: Top line has grown at a nearly 22% CAGR from $704.6 million in 2018 to $1.89 billion in 2023, while net income has grown four-fold from $73.2 million or $1.97/share in 2018 to $282.8 million or $8.88 per share in 2023.

Attractive Free Cash Flow characteristics: Medpace has attractive free cash flow (FCF) characteristics with FCF growing from $138.7 million in 2018 to $396.7 million in 2023. Ebitda-FCF conversion has remained above 100% since 2019.

Upbeat outlook: For 2024, revenue is expected to be between $2.125 billion and $2.175 billion, representing year-on-year growth of 12.7% to 15.3%. Net income is expected to be $361 million to $383 million or $11.24 per share to $11.93 per share and Ebitda to be $430.0 million to $460.0 million.

Concerns over cancellation appear baked into stock price now: While announcing second-quarter earnings results, the company cited some order cancellations that brought its book-to-bill ratio to 1.04 for the quarter vs. prior expectations for 1.2. Medpace also cautioned that the book-to-bill numbers could be flat to slightly higher sequentially in the third quarter. Some analysts downgraded the stock to a Hold/Neutral rating in late September citing weaker bookings growth coupled with cancellations as one of the reasons.

Are the concerns overrated? In the earnings call, Medpace said it does not see a prolonged pullback, or does not view the cancellations as a pattern that's going to continue. Besides, a book-to-bill of 1.04 for one quarter is not earth shattering, because it is still above 1, implying strong demand. Medpace sees the third quarter book-to-bill to be at 1.04 or slightly higher and in the first quarter the number was at 1.2. Also, Backlog as of June 30, 2024 was a solid $2.9 billion, up 13.7% year-on-year, and Medpace expects to convert about $1.585 billion of this backlog to revenue over the next twelve months. Medpace even raised its profit guidance for 2024 to show that it continues to anticipate industry-leading organic revenue growth and profitability despite the challenges in backlog growth. The backlog concerns appear to be priced into the MEDP stock that is already trading well below its mid-July highs of $459.77.

Upcoming catalyst: A key catalyst for the Medpace stock is the upcoming third-quarter earnings report, slated for release on October 21, after market close. Overall the MEDP stock has a moderate buy rating from analysts.

Skechers, dubbed as the comfort footwear giant, is a Fortune 500 company that makes lifestyle and performance footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. International sales represented more than 60% of its 2023 top line. The comfort footwear maker operates via wholesale and direct-to-consumer (DTC) business segments, with wholesale representing 56% of sales in 2023, and the rest coming from DTC.

Record second-quarter sales: Despite currency and supply chain headwinds, regulatory obstacles in India, and a lackluster 6/18 holiday in China, Skechers delivered record second-quarter sales of $2.16 billion, up 7.2% year over year driven by continued strength in its international DTC business and significant improvement in its domestic wholesale business.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profits: Skechers has grown sales from $5.2 billion in 2019 to $8 billion in 2023, and earnings per share from $2.25 to $3.49. Fiscal 2024 outlook is even better with sales expected between $8.88 billion and $8.98 billion and EPS expected to be $4.08 to $4.18.

Expanding margins: Skechers sells at affordable price points, yet gross margins have remained above 47% since 2019 exceeding 50% in 2023, while operating margins have been mostly in the mid-to-high single digits, with the exception of a drop to 2.9% in 2020. The margin story gets even better in the first half of 2024, with gross margins at 53.7% and operating margin at 11.5%.

One shoe does not fit all but Skechers fits all into one shoe: Considerable thought goes into the design of Skechers footwear to meet the needs of every walk of life. Under a partnership with John Deere, Skechers recently launched a footwear line for agricultural professionals, construction workers, and outdoor enthusiasts. Made of waterproof materials, the footwear line has interesting features like composite toe protection, nano carbon safety and Poron XRD metatarsal protection-Poron XRD being a flexible, lightweight, breathing foam, which hardens when impacted and forms a protective shell around the foot, absorbing up to 90% of the impact energy. Skechers has also integrated its slip-resistant and electrical hazard-rated technologies into the new offering.

Reasonably attractive valuation: Skechers stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 16.2x based on $4.08 eps guidance for 2024 (at the low end of the range). This is lower than its own five-year historical average of 21.2x. If the multiple re-rates to a conservative 19x (at the midpoint of the multiple range), it would still represent about 17% upside from current price levels. The footwear maker's expectations to achieve $10 billion in sales by 2026, also implies 13% upside potential from current stock levels, upon applying the current forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 1.13x. The stock may have 13%-17% upside potential from current levels.

The U.S. economy is currently not in a recession. The Fed rate easing cycle may likely achieve a soft landing of the economy, although there are no guarantees and historical evidence points otherwise, at least most of the time. Monthly Jobs data will continue to be a critical watch point. Even as recession fears linger, mid-cap stocks could be a preferred investment over large-cap or small-cap stocks, as mid-caps are at the confluence of reasonable valuations and stronger fundamentals. The mid-cap stocks highlighted in the article enjoy profitable growth with upbeat future prospects."
Walgreens Is The Latest Employer To Embrace Student Loan Benefits,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2024/10/08/walgreens-is-the-latest-employer-to-embrace-student-loan-benefits/,2024-10-08T18:18:19Z,"Plus, another 'September surge' in the job market, managers are willing to pay higher starting salaries for in-office personnel and how Marianne Markowitz climbed the financial corporate ladder.

Did you know that employers can match your student loan payments with contributions into your 401(k)? Thanks to Secure Act 2.0, which took effect January 1, employers can now offer extra retirement savings to young workers making student loan payments, even if the employee is not contributing to their retirement account on their own.

On Thursday, Walgreens became the latest large employer to embrace this benefit, offering it to the company's more than 300,000 employees. This means that Walgreens will match up to 4% of eligible pay for workers who are paying down student loans, even if they have not contributed directly to their 401(k) themselves.

Employees who've worked at Walgreens for one year and have completed 1,000 hours of work are eligible.

The program has been lauded as a win for young workers who have to choose between saving for retirement or paying off debt. At Walgreens, roughly 30% of the company's employees are facing financial debt from higher education, according to the company, including more than half of its pharmacists. On average, pharmacists have $170,000 of student debt, according to the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, making it one of the professions with the highest debt.

While other major employers--including Verizon, Kevin Hart-owned Hart House, Chipotle and Abbott Laboratories (a medical devices and healthcare company)--are offering the same benefit, its adoption has been slow, according to Bloomberg. The hesitance is largely due to employer's compliance and logistics concerns in its implementation, even after the IRS issued additional guidance in August.

As the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness plan moves through the courts, student loan 401(k) matching could be a major help to the 42.8 million Americans paying off student loan debt. But the key question remains: Just how many employers will implement it?

In other news, another hurricane is scheduled to make landfall in the south this week. To all of those in the path of Hurricane Milton, please listen to local officials and I hope you stay safe.

Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week!

Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter

A career financial expert, Marianne Markowitz is the founding CEO of First Women's Bank, a Chicago-based bank focused on serving women. Fresh off the heels of announcing the launch of the FWB Collective, a resource hub for women to launch their own businesses, I spoke with the First Women's Bank CEO to speak about her career in finance and focus on banking for women, working with small businesses, and what she learned working in both the private and public sectors. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Before starting First Women's Bank, you had some impressive stints as a risk and treasury manager in the private sector before heading up the Small Business Association. What did you find was the biggest pain point in the transition from private to public employers?

You know, it's interesting because I expected there to be more pain points than I actually experienced. Up until that point, the Small Business Administration (SBA) was the smallest organization I'd ever worked for--even Barack Obama's presidential campaign was larger. So as a federal agency, you were able to actually shape that agency, which was really interesting as an entrepreneurial-focused group. So I didn't experience that many pain points. Now, if I'd joined a much larger agency that would have been different! But the SBA is a unique agency in how it mirrors the private sector more because most of its partners are in the private sector, and works with over 4,000 banks.

Oh interesting! What's your advice to someone who may be considering a similar move, jumping into working with federal or government agencies?

There's a lot of doors into the public sector, so it's likely there is one that fits most people's backgrounds. I would say if you're inclined to serve at all, then it's a fit for you. It's all about service, and it's an amazing way to build a career. It's hard to explain, and you can't understand the scale of your impact when you're in the public sector (almost like you can't explain what it's like having a baby until you do!). You get to touch and impact so many lives with the work you do, it's an amazing place to build a future.

Between starting First Women's Bank and working in banking, you've had the experience of both being a founder but also climbing the corporate ladder. What is one thing you learned during that time that really helped you reach the C-Suite both as a CFO at the Obama presidential campaign and now as the founding CEO?

The next step is not only the one that is right above you. Sometimes I think we only see our careers linearly. But often moving side to side and gaining other experience will prepare you to move up, and it may not be the immediate channel that you see right ahead of you.

The other thing is sometimes, our work doesn't give us the opportunity or positions that we're ready for. Sometimes, it doesn't give us the opportunity to lead, or that's not part of your particular job at the time. So look outside your day job and find opportunities. We don't make the time to do that early enough in our career. Go find a nonprofit, get on a board, because when I look at a résumé I look at all of that. Where is the leadership in this résumé? It may not be in your position, but it happened because you did something that was really important to your job that aligned with your values outside of work.

Also, show up to the employee resource groups!

That's a good point -- leadership doesn't have to be in your job description to become a leader. What is one unique thing you look for in not only new hires, but women who come to the bank looking for funding or loans?

As women, we can often have disruptions in our career. We've got live events that we're balancing with that, and those disruptions can make for zig-zags in our résumés. That's something we really understand at First Women's Bank, and we give a lot of credit to the portability of experience and how we underwrite someone's ability to lead a business. It's something we really acknowledge, even if their career doesn't play out in a linear fashion. That's one way we really acknowledge and show up for women.

Markets Project Smaller 2024 Interest Rate Cuts On Better Jobs News,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/08/markets-project-smaller-2024-interest-rate-cuts-on-better-jobs-news/,2024-10-08T17:17:05Z,"With recent, stronger jobs data, markets expect the remaining anticipated interest rate cuts of 2024 to be 0.25% moves. That's down from expectations that both November and December Federal Open Market Committee meetings could see 0.5% cuts. Fixed income market expectations are tracked by the CME FedWatch Tool.

There was concern that the U.S. unemployment situation could weaken further. However, the Employment Situation Report for September showed clear improvement. Unemployment fell slightly for the second consecutive month to 4.1% and nonfarm payrolls rose 254,000. That's over 200,000 jobs added for the first time since May.

Now, the FOMC will see another jobs report on November 1 before its next meeting on November 6-7 and that data could change things. Inflation numbers will matter too. Nonetheless, for now, U.S. unemployment data is more positive than generally anticipated and inflation continues to trend lower.

This matters because if unemployment were to rise significantly, then the FOMC may be prompted to cut rates quite rapidly. That would be to try and reduce the risk of a recession. On the most recent data, a steep rise in unemployment is not happening.

Of course, inflation appears to be returning to the FOMC's 2% annual target, so that creates some momentum for less restrictive monetary policy. However, if the jobs market continues to appear robust, then there's perhaps a little less urgency for interest rate cuts.

The remaining scheduled FOMC interest rate decisions of 2024 are on November 7 and December 18. Currently, fixed income markets expect both to result in 0.25% interest rate cuts. That would leave short term interest rates at 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of 2024 or 0.5% lower than current levels. The risk of a slightly larger or smaller interest rate move is balanced, but currently further 0.5% cuts in 2024 are viewed as unlikely just as is the scenario of the FOMC choosing to hold rates steady at either meeting.

In two recent speeches, policymakers have signaled confidence in monetary policy and advocated for a more gradual approach to interest rate cuts.

New York Fed President John Williams said that: ""The current stance of monetary policy is really well positioned to both hopefully keep maintaining the strength that we have in the economy and the labour market, but also continuing to see that inflation comes back to 2 per cent,"" in an interview with the Financial Times on October 7.

St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, said: ""My baseline outlook is for continued economic expansion over the next several quarters, supported by a gradual easing of monetary policy and accommodative financial conditions."" At a speech in New York on October 7.

There is still more key economic data to come before the FOMC's next scheduled meeting on November 6-7. Primarily, that's the jobs report for October and inflation reports for September.

So far, the jobs markets appears to be performing better than expected since the FOMC last met, and inflation continues to trend lower. If that economic outlook continues, then it appears likely the FOMC will cut interest rates at its two remaining meetings of 2024, but only by 0.25% at each, rather than the previously estimated 0.5%."
How CFOs Are Preparing For The Future Amid Election Uncertainty,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2024/10/08/how-cfos-are-preparing-for-the-future-amid-election-uncertainty/,2024-10-08T16:05:40Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

CFOs are taking on bigger leadership roles and more responsibility throughout the business world. A new IDC InfoBrief study commissioned by Billtrust that focuses on the order-to-cash area of business shows one area in which CFOs are leading: AI adoption.

The study surveyed several top leaders in businesses, which included some CFOs. Nearly nine in 10 respondents said CFOs are becoming more critical to their organizations because of the economic downturn and financial uncertainty, and almost as many said that digital transformation across the OTC process is critical to the survival of their businesses. More CFOs agreed that digital transformation is needed, and more are optimistic about generative AI's potential to bring some of that transformation. Two-thirds of CFOs said generative AI will have a large impact on their organization, as opposed to 59% of all people surveyed. And 44% of CFOs said generative AI will help them do their jobs faster, 9% more than the 35% of all surveyed positions.

These results show that it's time to let CFOs lead on generative AI. They've researched the possibilities and know what it can do. And as a virtue of their position and expertise, they know the financial and strategic options their companies should take to weather the current uncertainty. Companies that want to see the financial part of their business become more effective and efficient should give the CFO the respect the position is now commanding. A bonus: Other studies have shown that CFOs who are able to lead on company strategy tend to significantly outperform their peers.

Deloitte conducts a quarterly CFO survey and found in its latest results that 58% think next month's election will be at least very consequential to their organizations. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global and U.S. leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what this means for CFO planning in Q4 and beyond. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are still open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

The upbeat job data also turned the stock market upwards on Friday, but markets came crashing down Monday afternoon as crude oil prices and government bond yields rose to multiweek highs. Monday was the anniversary of the current Israel and Hamas war in the Middle East, which has recently escalated to include Lebanon and Iran, and has sent defense stocks and oil prices up. The rise in bond yields has been somewhat unexpected, though some analysts have predicted it's in response to increasing oil prices, while others have predicted it's responding to the dwindling likelihood of another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month.

According to CME FedWatch, 88.2% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.8% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Last week, organized labor seemingly notched another victory as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike. On Thursday, the U.S. Maritime Alliance offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port workers wanted a 77% wage increase and a ban on many kinds of automation. There are no proposals made public from USMX on automation, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for the time being.

Meanwhile, Boeing is back at the bargaining table with members of the International Association of Machinists union, though local news station KOMO reported negotiations appear to be at a standstill. More than 30,000 members of the union that work in the aerospace giant's factories have been off the job going on four weeks. In a note reported on by Quartz, analysts at Oxford Economics wrote the Boeing strike could impact GDP growth in Q4, similar to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene -- which caused a wide swath of devastation in the Carolinas and Florida.

The roller coaster ride for Nvidia stock continues, with the company surging to become the world's second most valuable, surpassing Microsoft, on Monday. At the close of markets on Monday, Nvidia was worth $3.132 trillion. Nvidia's stock and market capitalization has seen dramatic rises and falls in the last month and a half. After its most recent earnings report at the end of August -- in which the AI processor company delivered record earnings and smashed expectations -- its stock price tumbled because it didn't project as much growth in the next quarter as some might have wanted to see. But since then, relatively small events have caused Nvidia's stock to spike. At a Goldman Sachs conference in mid-September, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia's soon-to-come Blackwell processors was ""so great,"" leading the stock value to pop 8%. And another leap in value came last week when Huang said on a CNBC interview that demand for the new chip was ""insane."" Monday's rally came courtesy of Super Micro Computer's announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products alongside Nvidia's GPUs were strong. This seems to be proof that the AI effect is still strong on markets. The sell off in August looked like investors were stepping back until they saw that Nvidia was worth the share price. But their behavior since then -- buying up the stock whenever there is any potentially positive news -- shows they are still overly eager about the technology's possibilities.

Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey showed that most people in the position view November's election as consequential to their organizations. Even if there weren't an election featuring two candidates with wildly differing policy ideas, there are a host of significant geopolitical and economic issues CFOs need to deal with. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what that might mean. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

Considering the state of U.S. politics, geopolitics and the economy, was there anything surprising about how CFOs responded to the survey?

Gallucci: There were some things that we pulled from the data that were interesting. For example, while CFOs are still very risk averse -- less than 15% said that this was a good time to take risk -- a lot of them were actually upbeat quarter-on-quarter around the capital markets. This data was collected before the rate cut, but there was a strong expectation [of one], and all signals indicated that rates will continue to trend downward in the next four quarters. That was a pivot over the last seven or eight quarters, as rates were rising, the capital markets were very inactive. When capital markets are inactive, there's less capital spending, there's less M&A.

More than half -- 58% -- said the election will be at least very consequential for their businesses. How does that impact how CFOs run their businesses and planning?

On the day-to-day running of the business, that particular stat has not shifted. In the longer term, a lot of scenario planning is happening. When you step back and think about where we might be from a policy perspective in six months to a year, it could look different from a tariff perspective. It could look different from a labor perspective.

CFOs more broadly have built into their psyche, [and] they approach their roles with an expectation that there will be shocks to the system that come from all angles: geopolitical shocks, certainly elections. [About] 45% of the world's GDP is electing a new leader this year. CFOs have built in an attribute of being agile and able to pivot. If you trace that back, you're going to go to the pandemic. That shock threw everybody for a loop. We haven't had a world pandemic in a hundred years, per se. [Consider] how that impacted business and supply chains, particularly things like semiconductors and computer chips, and being able to get that type of product. When you lob on top of that some of the geopolitical conflicts that we've been dealing with the last couple of years, all have contributed to a much more dynamic type of environment that chief financial officers across all industries and sectors have had to manage.

Do you think most CFOs have been expecting this wildly changing stock market, and are considering that when they're looking ahead?

Without question. They're looking at a whole host of factors in terms of making decisions around capital spending, M&A, new projects. [There is] a lot of variability in all those areas -- the economy, geopolitics, consumer spending -- which gets back to some of the data that we're taking in around being less risk averse, less bullish, et cetera. You put all these factors in a basket and then you have to make business decisions.

Let's take interest rates, for example. As the Fed was on a plan to raise interest rates to fight inflation, there was a lot of unpredictability: When is it going to peak? When is it going to top out? What we have right now is a little more clarity in terms of it's on the way down. They've stated that they want to get to somewhere around two point half percent and the FOMC rate. That gives a little more certainty towards CFOs in that particular area of the private markets. They can start to plan around that. Once you have clarity in a particular area and a sense that things have less unpredictability, you'll start to see some more actions on the part of corporates and CFOs, specifically, around things like M&A and capital spending.

Some of these big question marks will be figured out six months from now. We will have another president. That person will be in office and their economic policies could be stabilizing. How do you see CFOs responding to a similar survey then?

If you look historically post-election, there's a little more certainty in terms of where things will go in the near to medium term. It's hard to handicap what all that will look like. We'll continue to be in a descending rate capital market. With that, you'll see all indications are a much more robust capital market in the way of M&A and bond issues and whatnot.

History would tell you that there could be some type of bounce and there could be more optimism. There could be another geopolitical conflict that could send the markets into a tizzy. We're dealing with things like natural disasters throughout the globe, and that has an impact. I have to hedge with what we know and we don't know.

How Immigration Can Become A Strategic Solution For U.S. Housing Needs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2024/10/08/how-immigration-can-become-a-strategic-solution-for-us-housing-needs/,2024-10-08T13:11:57Z,"As the United States grapples with housing shortages, the influx of migrants and homelessness, the need for innovative, scalable, and humane solutions has never been more urgent. Traditional housing approaches prioritizing permanent solutions, often miss the mark. Whether it is young people seeking to buy their first home, individuals moving to new cities, immigrants who have just landed, migrants shuttled to a new state, or unsheltered homeless people in California, a flexible and forward-thinking housing model is essential. And Immigration may be able to contribute to such a solution.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have made housing a key issue in the current presidential race. Vice President Harris promises to ""cut the red tape that stops housing construction, take on corporate landlords hiking rental prices, work with builders and developers to construct 3 million new homes and rentals, and help first-time homebuyers with $25,000 down payment assistance."" On the other hand, President Trump focuses on deregulation, proposing the opening of federal land for housing development and reducing regulatory hurdles to speed up construction. He opposes rent controls and aims to preserve single-family zoning, framing it as protecting suburban communities.

While these proposals target housing shortages through construction and regulatory reform, neither candidate has sufficiently focused on a critical opportunity: using immigration policy to address U.S. housing needs.

When Congress passed the Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 (RIA) to reform the EB-5 investor immigration program, it created three priority areas for EB-5 funding: high unemployment areas, infrastructure, and rural development. The EB-5 program enables foreign investors to obtain U.S. residency by investing in job-creating projects. Historically, the program has been used for commercial developments, luxury housing, and large-scale projects. However, expanding the EB-5 program to include affordable housing projects could significantly benefit U.S. cities facing severe housing shortages. By directing foreign capital into affordable housing developments, investor immigration could become a key component in solving the U.S. housing crisis. What is proposed here is to add housing to the EB-5 program as a fourth priority. This expansion would encourage foreign investors to channel their investments into developments in cities with the most pressing housing needs, such as affordable apartments in urban centers or temporary housing for new migrants in need of immediate shelter.

To further enhance the program, the U.S. could introduce an Expression of Interest (EOI) system for selecting such EB-5 investors. Such a system is currently in use in Canada, for example, to avoid long backlogs in processing of applications. The system would allow the government to pre-select investors based on factors such as their language proficiency, integration potential, ties to the U.S., and the urgency of housing needs in specific areas. By prioritizing high-quality investors who align with U.S. housing goals, the government can ensure that projects are completed efficiently and in a timely manner. This approach adds flexibility, allowing the U.S. to target investors who are not only financially capable but also committed to contributing to the communities they are entering while preventing frustrating backlogs.

Apart from helping young people looking to buy their first homes and people moving across the country to locate a house they can afford, expanding the EB-5 program for housing, together with some innovative programs we will mention shortly, would also help ensure that migrants and refugees arriving in the U.S. have access to adequate living conditions as they settle into new communities. This approach could reduce the pressure on cities and states already struggling with limited housing availability and strained public resources.

As migrants and refugees continue to arrive in the U.S., the availability of immediate, safe housing is critical to their successful integration. Cities that experience sudden surges in migrant populations often face a severe shortage of affordable housing, leaving many new arrivals without a place to live. Traditional housing models, focused on permanent homes, can take years to develop, and temporary shelters are often overcrowded and unsafe.

A more flexible housing model is needed to address these immediate needs. The U.S. could adopt innovative solutions like those used by Dignity Moves, a California-based nonprofit that provides interim housing for homeless individuals. Dignity Moves constructs affordable, dignified prefabricated units on vacant or underutilized land, providing private, lockable spaces for individuals in need of temporary shelter. This approach could be adapted to house migrants and refugees, offering them a safe place to live while they go through the immigration process and work towards more permanent housing.

To make these solutions work, public-private partnerships will be essential. Local governments, private investors, and nonprofits must work together to ensure that new housing is built quickly and affordably. As already mentioned, the EB-5 program can serve as a key funding mechanism by incentivizing foreign investors to contribute to affordable housing projects in exchange for U.S. residency. Local governments can further support these efforts by offering tax incentives, zoning benefits, and streamlined permitting processes to developers focused on affordable housing. Additionally, philanthropic organizations and corporate social responsibility initiatives can play a role by providing grants and operational support to nonprofits working on innovative housing solutions.

The U.S. housing crisis demands bold and innovative solutions that go beyond traditional construction and regulation reforms. By integrating immigration programs like EB-5 with innovative housing development programs like those mentioned and incorporating an Expression of Interest system to select the most suitable investors, the U.S. can address both the immediate housing needs of migrants and refugees and the broader national shortage of affordable housing while avoiding long immigration backlogs. This could be a game-changing approach to solving the problem involving creative partnerships between governments, private investors, and nonprofits -- all working together to ensure that everyone, from young couples buying their first home, to newly arrived migrants, to homeless people, has a place to call home."
Americans are using AI at fairly high rates. What does this mean for the economy?,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2024/10/07/g-s1-26429/americans-using-ai-fairly-high-rates-what-does-this-mean-for-economy,2024-10-08T10:33:21Z,"Before conducting a recent survey of Americans to figure out how much they're using generative AI, Harvard University economist David Deming says he was solidly in the ""AI skeptic"" camp. That is, he was skeptical that the explosion of generative AI would offer sizable benefits for the U.S. economy anytime soon. Now, however, he says he's more optimistic.

""I was very surprised at the numbers in our survey,"" Deming says. ""And it sort of made me think that AI is gonna be a bigger deal than I would've thought.""

The study, Deming says, was motivated by questions over whether and how much Americans are using generative artificial intelligence. Doing what economists tend to do, he and his colleagues, Alexander Bick and Adam Blandin, wanted to get some good data.

They modeled their survey after the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Conducted monthly, the CPS is sort of the gold standard for surveys. It's how we know things like the unemployment rate and the state of the labor market.

In short, the survey that Deming, Bick and Blandin conducted is high-quality. It has a large sample size. It's nationally representative. And they even included some of the same questions that the CPS asks, so they could cross-reference their survey with the CPS and make sure their numbers were good. They conducted their survey twice, in June and August 2024.

Deming says he was shocked by the results. He and his colleagues found that almost 40% of Americans, ages 18 to 64, have used generative AI. And a sizable percentage seems to use it regularly. In their August survey, the economists found that more than 24% of American workers had used it ""at least once in the week prior to being surveyed, and nearly one in nine used it every workday.""

Even more surprising, Deming says, usage of AI seems to be pretty much across the board. He expected that younger and more-educated Americans would be the biggest users. They confirmed that's the case. ""But we even found that 22% of blue-collar workers say they use AI, and usage rates were above 20% in every major occupation category except personal services, where it was like 15%,"" he says.

This rapid rate of adoption, the authors point out, is much faster than the speed at which Americans adopted personal computers and the internet. That may not be very surprising though, considering that personal computers cost thousands of dollars in the 1980s and 1990s and you had to get physical hardware, hook it up, figure out how to use it, etc. Even with the internet, people had to buy modems, get subscriptions, figure out how to ""surf the web"" and so on. Generative AI is more plug and play, often free or has a low-monthly subscription cost, and has a user interface that is familiar to anyone who has ever used Google.

In a recent two-part series on The Indicator, Darian Woods and I debated whether AI is overrated. Given the tremendous uncertainty about the impact that AI will have on the economy -- as well as our reluctance to make predictions that might get us laughed at in a few years -- we decided to obscure our personal feelings on the matter. We flipped an AI-generated coin. I got ""AI is overrated"" and wrote an episode and a newsletter making that argumentative case.

In the course of my research, I discovered a study conducted by the Census Bureau this year that found that only about 5% of American businesses said they had used AI in the previous couple of weeks. I used this as evidence that use of generative AI was pretty pathetic, especially considering all the hype around it.

How does Deming square his results with that finding?

For one, Deming says, he and his colleagues found that actually Americans report they're using AI more during their personal time at home than at work.

Hmmm. OK. Putting my ""AI is overrated"" hat back on, this makes me think that much of AI use is for pleasure rather than for productive work purposes -- which would suggest that AI's impact on the economy will be limited.

The sort of economic dream for AI would be that it would rescue the U.S. economy from its long period of slow productivity growth. Productivity growth -- meaning workers being able to produce more in less time -- is the magic sauce of rising living standards. And recent technologies have been pretty disappointing on that front.

I mean, look at the smartphone. If I told you back in 2006, the year before the iPhone was released, that we'd soon all have supercomputers in our pockets, able to search the internet, give us precise directions to anywhere, send emails to and do video calls with co-workers and clients, order basically any product or service, translate languages and on and on -- you might think we'd see an explosion in productivity. But smartphones seem to be more a tool for pleasure and distraction than an incredibly impactful work tool. We haven't seen a huge boost in productivity growth since its mass adoption well over a decade ago.

Deming, however, stresses that people are using generative AI for work. He says their survey shows ""about 1 in 4 people used it at least once in the last week at work"" (versus ""about 1 in 3"" who used it in their off time). When it comes to how people use AI to help their work, respondents indicated that writing, interpreting and administrative support were the most helpful (although a significant share also said they were using it for other tasks, including coding and support when dealing with customers and co-workers).

Squaring his study with the one from the Census Bureau, Deming says he thinks there's a ""big gap between a company's formal policy on AI use and workers. I think quite a lot of the use is under the radar, like you've gotta write an email to your boss and you just use it to write the email more quickly and you just use ChatGPT to do it. But you don't tell anyone."" Deming says many of his students use generative AI this way.

We reached out to Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Daron Acemoglu -- whom, these days, you might call the AI skeptic in chief -- about Deming and his colleagues' study. Does the fact that they find that a large percentage of Americans are using generative AI change his perspective at all?

""My concern with their numbers is that it does not distinguish fundamentally productive uses of generative AI from occasional/frivolous uses,"" Acemoglu said in an email. ""If you are curious about what ChatGPT would say to introduce one of your guests and use it to get a sense of that, you are a user, but this is not fundamentally integrated into the NPR production process. Worse, if you asked me whether I'm using generative AI, and if I'm being honest, I will have to say yes, because when I do searches, now I see generative AI-generated output. But this has zero impact on me. The productivity improvements would require fundamental integration and reorganization of production processes, together with complementary investments in organizational capacity and worker skills -- not gimmicky, frivolous uses. We know ChatGPT has about 200 million unique monthly users, but the question is how many of them are using it in a way that will lead to significant productivity improvements/cost reductions. I don't really know the answer to that question, and I don't think we find the answer to that question from this paper.""

To try to predict how much AI will boost productivity growth, Deming and his colleagues did some rough calculations. They looked at five randomized studies that analyzed how much use of generative AI increases productivity in various work settings. They picked the productivity-boost number in the middle of those studies, which is about 25%. They then multiplied that, Deming says, by ""our estimate of the number of work hours that are currently being assisted by generative AI"" (which, they calculate, is somewhere between 0.5% and 3.5% of all work hours in the U.S.).

They ended up estimating that generative AI will result in an ""increase in labor productivity of between 0.125 and 0.875 percentage points at current levels of usage."" That may not sound like very much. But, Deming says, consider that productivity growth over the last couple of decades has ""been about one and a half percent per year. So if you take that 1.5% and you add this, that's actually a pretty big increase.""

Interestingly, Acemoglu has also done some rough calculations of the potential impact of generative AI on the economy in the near future. And despite using a different method to calculate the potential productivity boost from AI, his estimates are actually pretty similar to this recent work from Deming and colleagues.

Yet, Acemoglu and Deming put different spins on the results. Acemoglu seems to be reacting more to all the media and industry hype around generative AI -- and, he's like, we're not witnessing an economic revolution by any means. Deming looks at the potential productivity increase and emphasizes more that it looks like generative AI could make a meaningful impact on the U.S. economy.

""Is it gonna lead to 7% productivity growth? No, probably not,"" Deming says. ""Not the way it's currently being used, but it could add a little bit, and every little bit counts. Like that's millions and millions of dollars of extra GDP growth and rising living standards. That really counts.""

Deming and his colleagues have plans to continue conducting their survey in the future. It's worth noting that they conducted their last survey before Apple released an iPhone that has ChatGPT integrated into it.

Pretty soon, he says, ""because AI is gonna be embedded in so many things, like the iPhone, it's gonna be hard to even ask people, ""Do you use AI?"""
"Markets Are ""On Fire"" Since September Jobs Report. Will They Continue?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2024/10/07/markets-are-on-fire-since-september-jobs-report-will-they-continue/,2024-10-07T20:24:49Z,"On September 6 the jobs report came in weak at 142,000 new jobs. This report was well below expectations, unemployment rose from 4.1% to 4.2% and markets plummeted on the news. Economists proclaimed the beginning of the end with major stock indices falling 2% to 3%. The Vix index, indicating volatility and market nervousness, rose sharply. The outlook among many was bleak and, irrespective of Fed interest cuts on the horizon, many economic ""experts"" began voicing concerns of a recession. Those comments were overblown. The US economy is nowhere near a recession. At least now.

By contrast, on October 4 a new jobs report came out that was red ""hot"". Jobs increased by 254,000, soundly beating expectations, and major market indices soared by 1% to 2%. Since the September 6 dip, major indices have been soaring. The S&P 500 has increased 6.45%, while others such as the QQQ (+8.76%) and the Russell 1000 Growth (+8.43%) have done much better. Leading the pack has been the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR) which came in at 12.99%. (Note: Past performance is no guarantee or guide to future performance).

This performance has continued the strong year-to-date (YTD) results. The table below shows that, thus far, this has been a banner year. YTD the S&P 500 is +21.86%, with the Russell 1000 Growth (IWF) +24.10% and the Nasdaq QQQ +19.51%. The Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR) is continuing its strong year from 2023 (57.41%) with a current YTD performance in 2024 of 38% (Note: past performance is no guide to future performance).

What should investors take from these results? In retrospect, the strong negative response from the September, 6, 2024 negative jobs report was an overreaction on the downside. The economic situation for the US was not nearly as bleak as market pundits expressed. To be fair, neither is the strong jobs report on September 6, 2024 as good as many deem it to be. Many of the 245,000 jobs created in the month of September are from government, social services and healthcare. More importantly, the US workforce is old. Very, very old. 75m baby boomers will be at or past retirement age by the year 2030. As many as 25 to 30m working baby boomers, 1/3 of whom now work past retirement age, (well up from 20 years ago) will be retiring within the next 5-10 years. Further, online estimates suggest 300,000 jobs are being outsourced overseas each year. My data from a Capital IQ search of top public IT firms, suggests it is much, much higher. The US is losing high wage IT jobs to places based primarily in India and Eastern Europe. We are losing low wage bookkeeping and call center jobs to places based primarily in Philippines and Vietnam. Many low wage jobs in the US are also being picked up by illegal immigrants working for cash dollars.

Are these labor issues major concerns for the US economy in the next 5-10 years? Absolutely. The US labor force currently only produces approximately 1m new jobs per year. Losing 5 million jobs over the next year, under normal circumstances would be devastating, let alone, 20m to 30m jobs. The US labor force is currently creating non productive jobs in government and social services. As a country, we may soon find ourselves with less than 1/2 of our adults in the labor market. This means fewer Americans will need to perform the heavy lifting to support the rest of us.

Fortunately, purely by coincidence, AI may save the day. The productive capabilities of AI means that we as a population will need fewer workers to provide the same level of productivity as before. Smart robots will enter the workplace and provide more efficient delivery mechanisms than humans. In an environment with a growing population this displacement of humans would be a problem. The US has the opposite issue. The productive capabilities of AI and robotics will be a game changer for many industries, particularly in IT, Healthcare, Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary. We will also see innovative nuclear energy solutions to power our data centers. These innovative, disruptive, entrepreneurial solutions have the ability to arrive just as our aging population needs it most.

Will AI and robotics benefit all companies? Absolutely not. Just as companies such as Nvidia, Applovin and Arista Networks (among others) have begun reaping benefits associated with AI, their competitors have suffered. A declining labor force does not necessarily imply a dip in the stock market.

We believe that the next few years will continue to widen the gap between winners and losers. The stakes have never been higher. Brick and mortar, bureaucratic stores such as Walmart, Target and Home Depot and Telecommunication companies such as AT&T continue to lose hundreds of thousands of jobs, other entrepreneurial companies will grow their ventures and reap strong rewards. Major change to our labor force is guaranteed within the next 5-10 years. But all is not lost. Far from it. We simply need visionaries at the top to help us lead the way.

ctober is here, and the sprint to the end of the year is fraught with distractions, disasters and disengagement that will be challenging for anyone managing workplaces and teams. A tight, polarizing election has workers unsettled and anxious -- and could drive more conflict in the office. An escalating crisis in the Middle East brings increasing tensions over geopolitical issues, uncertainty about planning ahead and more concerns for employees with family in the region.

Add the devastation of a massive hurricane across the Southeast, and it's been an unparalleled season of disruption for many leaders and workplaces. Hurricane Helene has disrupted operations at a quartz mine in western North Carolina, washing out roads and cutting power to an area critical to semiconductor manufacturing. Some employers across the region are working hard to help workers struggling without power, water or even homes -- while others in Tennessee face inquiries from the state Bureau of Investigation over allegations that they ignored warnings about Helene and required employees to report to work, leading to deaths and missing workers. Asheville, which had prospered with an influx of remote workers, entrepreneurs and new business owners, now faces an unprecedented challenge to rebuild.

Amid all the chaos is the human cost -- and a humanitarian crisis. Disaster relief is inherently hard to execute well, and the people leading it will need support. If you want to help, my colleague Kelly Phillips Erb has a rundown over what you need to know about tax deductible donations and where to donate. Read on for more in today's newsletter about how Amazon's RTO push remains in the headlines, Friday's blockbuster jobs report and an interview with Handshake's chief talent engagement officer about AI and jobs.

September job growth shattered economists' predictions, as U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs last month, according to nonfarm payrolls data released Friday by the Labor Department. It was the biggest month for jobs growth since March, sprinting past average economist estimates of 150,000 and prompting the unemployment rate to dip to 4.1%, compared to projections of 4.2%, where it stood in August. Investors cheered the news with big stock gains Friday.

Striking dockworkers and port employers reached a tentative agreement Thursday, ending a strike that began earlier in the week and lifting concerns over the potential impact to the U.S. economy. The tentative agreement includes a 62% wage increase over six years, according to the Wall Street Journal, and will temporarily relieve Democrats fearful of the strike's impact on the November election. The big issue still up for negotiation? Automation, as workers remain concerned about the potential for layoffs and fewer jobs for humans in the future.

The fallout over Amazon's decision to require full-time office work has remained in the headlines even several weeks after the tech giant made the announcement. Dell has since mandated that salespeople come back to the office five days a week, while McKinsey is also reportedly asking staff to be onsite more often. Will the trend continue? Contributor Ann Kowal Smith sees Amazon's move as the ""canary in the coal mine for a dangerous problem,"" noting ""the relationship between employers and employees has become one based on power, not mutual respect and collaboration."" Meanwhile, contributor Ryan Anderson suggests the continued disappointment leaders feel in one-size-fits-all hybrid policies could mean a different approach would be better for workplace flexibility.

The most sweeping attempt so far to regulate artificial intelligence, a California bill that could have set a precedent for other laws, was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom last week. ""I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public,"" Newsom said, according to the New York Times. If the California bill had been signed into law, writes Forbes contributor Owen Tedford, it would have predominantly focused on improving AI safety, with businesses that create large AI models required to perform safety tests and publicly disclose how they'd prevent the models from being manipulated. Tedford examines what could come next, suggesting the bill could be changed and reintroduced in future sessions.

Forbes caught up with Valerie Capers Workman, chief talent engagement officer at student careers platform Handshake, about how AI is shifting jobs as we know them, a recent book she published and addressing the gender divide in AI. Excerpts from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity.

How is AI changing jobs?

I'm going to use my son as an example. He entered school in 2018-2019, he was going to be a data scientist. Data science was the career: You're going to get a job the second you hit junior year, you're going to be flooded with internships and you're going to be employed. Enter A.I. The ability of A.I. to take on so much of the preliminary data science work [means] you need to be a masters or PhD in data science to skip over what A.I. can do. [He realized] 'I need to go back to school.' He is now applying to universities for artificial intelligence master's degrees. He loves having the skill set, but A.I. enables more companies to do what he was doing.

What message did you want to share in your book?

The most important concept that I was raising is that the requirement to be superhuman; the requirements of EQ are more important in the age of AI than all the pundits are saying. My point is, yes, you can get an entry level job, but you're not moving up without the EQ, without the combination of AI plus liberal arts skills, the critical thinking skills, you're going to stay right there. The ability to move and progress in your career? You're going to have to do both.

[""AI skills""] are the ability to ask great questions and understand whether or not you've got a great answer and then utilize that answer to do the work you're doing. The ability to ask great questions? That requires critical thinking skills, language skills, reading comprehension skills, historical context, ethical understanding and understanding of biases. Generative AI is what is going to differentiate the general workforce from the executive workforce track, if you will. I think it was a COO from BlackRock who said [they want] to hire finance or tech employees who have liberal arts or history majors? That's what I'm talking about.

If you're hiring, how do you assess that AI skill?

If I'm interviewing someone on my team, I'd ask them: 'I have this issue. Give me an AI prompt that will help me. Give me a prompt that you would use to help me finish this project for me in five days.'

Are you pulling on the right threads to understand what types of questions you need to ask? If I find someone who knows how to frame a question, I can train you how to do that better. I can't train you how to think.

Do companies have a responsibility to retrain their people who work in fields where jobs will be replaced, such as customer service?

That's a great societal question.

What is the responsibility of the employer to reskill its current workforce if a set of roles can now be done by AI? I like to put it this way: The companies that understand how to repurpose their workforce for the higher order skills that need to be done by humans -- that can't be done by A.I. -- are the companies that are going to win.

We're hearing more about how women are not developing the AI skills at the same pace and could get left behind. What can be done to help with this?

In higher education, they need to have required courses, period. Just required. It cannot be optional because women are not taking the AI courses at the same rate as their male counterparts. It can't be optional. ... The societal issues that caused them to run away from a phrase like prompt engineering go all the way back to when they were in third grade. So, required courses.

Same thing with employers. Training should not be optional. ... You're going to leave people behind who don't think that certain courses apply to them. AI courses apply to everyone. They should be mandatory. You can solve a lot of societal anomalies and inequities just by making the playing field even for everyone without having people required to opt in.

Last week's jobs report was a big one, prompting a stock market rally and causing the odds of another interest rate cut in the coming months to fall.

176,000: How many more jobs than expected the U.S. nonfarm labor force grew by from July to September, according to the Labor Department. September's 254,000 nonfarm payroll additions, the highest total in six months, were 104,000 more than economist forecasts, while the government upwardly revised July and August's payroll growth by 55,000 and 17,000, respectively.

83.8%: Prime-age labor force participation, or people working or looking for work, is near multi-decade highs

""The labor market isn't on the brink of collapse and still has the potential to deliver surprises, however its ability to sustain momentum without further support from the Federal Reserve is not guaranteed."" -- Cory Stahle, economist for Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement

It's a very good time for unions right now. Last week, organized labor likely notched another victory, as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike.

Union members started striking at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, after their contract with ocean carriers and port operators represented by the U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX) expired. The strike essentially shut down all cargo ports on the eastern side of the U.S., potentially roiling the economy and supply chains for everything from groceries to automobiles. Union members wanted a 77% wage increase over six years, as well as an agreement to ban automation in places where it could be used to replace workers. To end the strike for now, USMX offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port automation hasn't been resolved, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for now.

But cargo ships are getting bigger, global trade is increasing, and there is more demand for imports and exports. Proponents of automation say that it could make ports more efficient, which could help them handle higher volumes. Some ports in Europe and China, as well as a couple on the West Coast, are already automated. The California ports that use automation increased their employment numbers and wage hours after the machinery went in.

These numbers -- and what truly makes a port efficient -- will likely to be discussed at length as the union and USMX return to the bargaining table. It's unknown if the port workers will be willing to compromise on this point. Jim Kruse from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute told Marketplace he has seen forecasts of seaport trade volume doubling by 2050, meaning ports really should be striving toward more efficiency. But if there are no port workers, all of the automation in the world won't be helpful.

Thousands of companies worldwide use Atlassian's collaboration tools -- including Jira, Confluence, Trello and Loom -- to work together and manage projects. I talked to Atlassian President Anu Bharadwaj about how the company uses its culture and experience to best serve enterprise technology needs. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

With the upbeat job data, the stock market turned upwards, too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both rose close to a percentage point on Friday, while the Nasdaq was up 1.2%. ""The economy continues to show incredible resilience,"" Bolvin Wealth Management Group President Gina Bolvin said in comments emailed to Forbes.

While the jobs data and stock bounces are all good for the economy, economists say they're negatively impacting the chances for another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month. According to CME FedWatch, 88.5% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.5% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Spirit Airlines stock dropped more than 30% on Friday after reports that the budget carrier may be exploring bankruptcy following a failed merger with JetBlue Airways. It was the deepest plunge of the airline's stock since January, when the Justice Department blocked the proposed $3.8 billion acquisition on antitrust grounds, sending prices down more than 50%. Spirit has been working toward improving its financial position this year, executing a restructuring plan that involves changing routes, deferring new aircraft deliveries, cutting 32 routes, and adding new premium tiers for passenger service and experience. Spirit Airlines CEO Ted Christie has said in the last two earnings reports that the company was discussing options with its bondholders for bills due soon. In the last earnings report, CFO Fred Cromer said updates would be provided ""when appropriate."" According to the Wall Street Journal, people familiar with the matter said any bankruptcy filing is not imminent, and recent talks have focused on reaching an agreement to support a Chapter 11 filing.

In today's business world, studies found most women are not at the levels where decisions are being made. Just 9% of CEOs at the largest U.S. companies are women, but there are few women in the other C-suite roles that can be seen as stepping stones to the top spot, according to a new analysis by executive search firm Russell Reynolds. Looking at the top 100 companies on the S&P, there are 74% fewer female executives on leadership teams than there are in the current U.S. population. Looking at the position-by-position breakdown, 46% of CMOs are women, the closest to the half of the population women represent. There are the most female CHROs -- 72% -- and the fewest CEOs and COOs -- 8%. Forbes senior contributor Kim Elsesser writes other recent studies show that the professional bias against women starts early. A recent study by McKinsey and LeanIn found that women represent 59% of all bachelor's degree recipients, but only represent 48% of entry-level corporate roles. For every 100 men promoted to manager, only 81 women get the same career advancement. Another study that interviewed 57 women CEOs found that two-thirds of them weren't aware the CEO role was in their grasp until someone else suggested it.

Thousands of companies across the globe use Atlassian's collaboration tools -- which include Jira, Confluence, Trello and Loom -- to work together and manage projects. I talked to President Anu Bharadwaj about how Atlassian serves companies' tech and AI needs, the culture at the 22-year-old company -- which is still founder-led, and its growth prospects.

This interview has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here.

How do you figure out which problems Atlassian should be solving next with AI, and how do you go forward doing it?

Bharadwaj: We are a company of product builders. Our philosophy is: Create the things that you want to use yourself. A lot of our product heritage has been we build products for ourselves and then figure out [if] this is interesting for other people, and how can we make it more generalized and applicable in different industries and contexts?

Or we go off and acquire a product. Loom is a great example of a company we acquired last year that we used heavily inside Atlassian. We are a 12,000-person company distributed across 13 countries. [At] the beginning of the pandemic, we made the decision to go fully distributed. We said to employees, we will not ask you to come into an office for any number of days a week, but we will set some guidelines around how many working hours overlap you have with your team. When we compose a team of people on the West Coast and East Coast, that's okay. But if you take people on the East Coast, West Coast, Australia and Singapore, it becomes a problem because there are not enough working hours overlap. A lot of the tools that we use are really our own tools for collaboration and for teamwork. And one of the tools we heavily relied on was Loom, which really helped, creating video snippets that would help disseminate information so that people can then consume it at their own pace. We decided to buy the tool ourselves and integrate it with our product suite because it really helped with asynchronous communication and distributed teamwork.

Scott Farquhar, one of the founders of Atlassian, recently stepped down from the co-CEO spot. While this may not signify a huge transition for the company, since cofounder Mike Cannon-Brookes is assuming the sole CEO role, what does it mean symbolically for Atlassian?

I have been at Atlassian for 10 years, and the big reason for me staying this long has been Scott. Scott's a personal friend and has been a great supporter and champion. Personally, I feel bittersweet about it. I feel very happy for him that he is now going on to the next phase of life. He has the energy and the bandwidth to focus on some of the things that he has started, like Pledge1%. He has a number of well-defined philosophical philanthropy projects that he's rallied the company around.

Operationally day-to-day, it's not that much of a change for us because he's been very thoughtful about this transition. He has set up the requisite systems and leaders. I personally have been doing a lot more on the go-to-market, which Scott used to run.

Mike, our CEO, [and Farquhar] have been co-founders and co-CEOs for 20-plus years, which is very unusual in software. Mike staying on as the founder CEO means that even symbolically for Atlassian, it's really not that much of a step change, because we continue to be founder-led. We continue to have the 20-year context continue.

One of the staggering things about Atlassian is we have a lot of tenured people in the company. We have a Slack channel called Old Timers, which seems to keep growing each day. It's mostly people who have 10-plus years, and I recently joined. Because we have a lot of tenured people, the culture, the ethos of the company, beliefs, values, they all tend to be strong. We are lucky that we have that cohort of people where this continues to be a defining way of how we run the company.

In Atlassian's most recent earnings report, some investors reacted negatively to slower growth prospects than they were hoping. Where do you see Atlassian's growth going? What is your vision for the next six months?

It's interesting because I've been here since we were $100 million in revenue. We are about $4.5 billion dollars in revenue, and we've been a growth company throughout. We are committed to a 20% CAGR over multiple years. [A] 20% CAGR on a $4.5 billion base is substantial, and it's quite rare for a company of our scale. I continue to be excited and grateful that we have a business where the opportunities are so big that we can confidently talk about 20% CAGR over multiple years.

Why do we think that that is the case? Because we operate in three fundamental markets where I think the opportunity is going to grow, because more and more people are poised to be creators. Thanks to gen AI and redefining of the software development lifecycle, more people can do what only technical people used to be able to do before. That's a good thing for Atlassian because we serve the full cycle, not just the coding part of a developer's life. That means more software gets created and more opportunity to grow in that business.

Our second business is the IT service market, which is fundamentally service request handling. This is a market that stands to greatly benefit from the AI wave. Even outside of the AI wave, this is a market that continues to grow at a very healthy clip. We just put out the numbers for each of our business lines for the first time back in April. Service management has been our fastest growing business, close to $500 million. We are priced super competitively, and we are just getting started. That's really at the early phases of the market capture, and that's several billion dollars that is open opportunity for us to go after.

The last market is for knowledge workers. We can democratize that with an open philosophy of saying companies can use any number of tools for knowledge management applications they require, but we want to be the backbone that connects all of those things in one single place through a connected data platform, and offers customers the choice to use multiple tools, but have a single knowledge backbone across their organization such that they can make the maximum use of their own data and deliver the most insights based on what their own employees are doing. That is definitely the largest market we are addressing, and has the most promise, and we are also the earliest in that market.

Booming artificial intelligence company OpenAI announced a massive funding round last week.

What To Expect From September's CPI Inflation Report,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/07/what-to-expect-from-septembers-cpi-inflation-report/,2024-10-07T16:20:48Z,"Consumer Price Index inflation data to be released on October 10 is expected to provide some support for the Federal Open Market Committee cutting rates in November. However, unemployment data may ultimately matter more for the FOMC's decision making.

All inflation metrics are down over the past 12 months according to the Atlanta Fed's Dashboard that measures a range of inflation metrics. Specifically, headline annual CPI inflation is 2.5% to August 2024 and core CPI, which removes swings in food and energy prices is 3.2%.

Although these figures do not hit the FOMC's 2% inflation goal, inflation is running at a much lower rate than for much of the 2021-2023 period. As a result the FOMC made the first interest rate cut of this cycle in September, recognizing that monetary policy no longer needed to be as restrictive with significant progress on inflation.

Inflation nowcasts from the Cleveland Fed call for reassuring inflation data. They expect 0.1% monthly inflation for headline CPI for September and 0.3% monthly core inflation. Should these forecasts hold, they would provide further reassurance for the FOMC that inflation is now under control. However, some minor concerns remain.

Firstly, shelter costs, which make up a large portion of CPI inflation continue to rise at a relatively fast 5.2% annual rate as of August 2024. Reaching the FOMC's 2% target may require shelter costs to cool from these levels. Secondly, the FOMC continues to monitor for unexpected shocks that could cause inflation to resume. For example, the dockworkers' strike ending with a substantial pay increase recently is the sort of thing the FOMC will be monitoring, to make sure wage-lead inflation doesn't resume.

Inflation was among the more closely watch economic indicators in recent years, given the surge in prices. Now, the FOMC is paying closer attention to the other component of its dual mandate - maintaining full employment. Typically, when the FOMC raises rates abruptly, increases in unemployment result. We've seen that to some degree this cycle with unemployment now at 4.1% for September compared to 3.8% in September 2023. However, so far the increase in unemployment has been sufficiently gradual, so far, to ease fears of a potential recession. Still, jobs data is likely to get more attention than inflation data should inflation continue to ease back towards 2%.

The FOMC next sets interest rates on November 7. Therefore, the October 10 figures will be the last CPI release before that meeting. However, there will be a Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index release on October 31, which may offer further insight on U.S. inflation trends.

It is expected that the FOMC elects to cut interest rates by 0.25% according to the CME FedWatch Tool, with some chance that rates are held steady. Previously, markets anticipated a material chance of a larger 0.5% cut. However, that probability has faded with unexpectedly robust jobs data for September, with the economy adding a higher than expected 254,000 jobs. Should inflation continue to cool, so it is likely that the FOMC continues to cut rates. However, the pace of loosening monetary policy may be more informed by jobs data than inflation figures."

Today marks one year since Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, leading Israel to retaliate and catalyzing the war in Gaza. Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians.

Despite calls for a ceasefire from the U.S. and allies, the Middle East is on the precipice of a broader war as tensions escalate between Israel and Iran. About 31% of Americans believe Israel's military operations in Gaza are going too far, a slight increase from last December, according to a new Pew Research Center poll.

Meanwhile, the share of Americans who believe Israel is doing enough or should be doing more has fallen in the last 10 months.

The U.S. added far more jobs than expected in September, and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%. The Labor Department data delivered good news for investors on edge after July and August saw far weaker labor market expansion than expected.

MORE: Leading stock indexes saw gains Friday on the heels of the jobs report: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 0.8%, the S&P 500 climbed as much as 0.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq bounced as much as 1.2%. But labor market resilience dampened hopes for a second aggressive interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month.

Tencent Holdings is considering acquiring Ubisoft Entertainment with the Guillemot family, which founded the French video game publisher, sending Ubisoft's stock soaring Friday after it falling to a decade-low in late September. Rumors about a takeover of Ubisoft, behind video games like Assassin's Creed and Just Dance, have swirled for years, and private equity firms like Blackstone and KKR & Co. have previously considered buying out the company.

Compare price/earnings to a growth rate and you get PEG, the classic formula for measuring the price tag of a growth stock. But PEG has deep flaws. The superior Super PEG measures how much you pay now to get a certain level of earning power down the road, and then compares that to what you pay to get future earning power from the S&P 500 index.

The ultra-swank Yellowstone Club, located on a remote patch of Montana wilderness, is one of the world's most exclusive clubs: Those who want to be admitted must buy land, a home or a condo, which will set you back $10 million, even for the least expensive undeveloped plot. The club has fewer than 900 homeowners, worth more than a combined $290 billion, including Melinda French Gates and hedge fund tycoon Bill Ackman.

The Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people has been published every year since 1982, and out of the total 1,739 featured, just 11 have made the list every year. They include Warren Buffett, worth $145.5 billion; Charles Koch, worth $67.5 billion; and Nike's Phil Knight, with a net worth of $36.5 billion.

Alphabet's self-driving car venture Waymo, the only commercial robotaxi service in the U.S., signed a ""multiyear"" agreement with Hyundai Motor to add electric Ioniq 5 hatchbacks to its Waymo One fleet starting next year. Currently, its U.S. fleet includes at least 1,000 electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs, and reducing costs is critical for Waymo to reach profitability, as it is quickly expanding its service area.

At a recruitment event for his fledgling AI company xAI, billionaire Elon Musk pitched the firm as the anti-OpenAI, calling the ChatGPT maker ""closed"" and profit-obsessed. Musk cofounded OpenAI with Sam Altman, but he has since left and sued the company twice, accusing OpenAI of abandoning its mission to build artificial intelligence to benefit humanity.

Out of office and back on the campaign trail, former President Donald Trump earned an estimated $218 million in operating income last year, roughly double what he made during his final year in the White House. Trump's golf portfolio now generates huge profits, with his golf-connected properties generating $74 million more in operating income last year than they did in 2020.

Perpetua Resources is set to resurrect a shuttered Idaho mine that will once again supply the Pentagon with vital weapons-grade antimony, bust a Chinese monopoly, and underwrite the rehabilitation of 20 miles of backcountry salmon streams. The surge in the price of gold since the pandemic is also propelling Perpetua, which expects to produce an average 300,000 ounces of gold per year at an average all-in cost of $650/oz and eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual profits.

Shares of Spirit Airlines fell 26% Friday after reports indicated the low-cost airline was exploring bankruptcy. In January, a federal judge blocked a $3.8 billion merger between Spirit and JetBlue, ruling it would eliminate the airline industry's popular discounted flight options and drive up prices.

If you need to renew your passport, now is the time: The average wait time is the shortest it's been in decades. The State Department said Thursday that the average processing time for passports has dropped to four to six weeks, which is a third as long as it took in 2021 during the pandemic backlog.

TOPLINE Over the last several months, joint state and federal task forces have raided more than 100 vape and smoke shops, hemp product manufacturers and distributors in North Carolina, alleging that they are selling marijuana disguised as hemp.

The 2018 Farm Bill allows the production of hemp and all its derivatives so long as it contains 0.3% of THC or less. In 2022, hemp-derived cannabinoid product sales hit $28 billion overall, while legal marijuana products generated $26 billion in sales during that same period, according to cannabis data firm Whitney Economics.

But hemp farmers, Whitney Economics estimates, have lost about $3.1 billion in annual sales due to the state bans and legal confusion that has followed.

Despite what the Farm Bill states, there is plenty of debate about whether hemp-derived THC products are legal under federal law. That's because hemp-derived cannabinoids -- including delta-9 THC and delta-8 THC (a less potent compound that is affectionately called ""weed lite"" or ""decaf kush"") -- are legal under the Farm Bill if those compounds are found naturally in the plant.

Yet most intoxicating hemp products on the market are made by converting hemp-derived CBD isolate into delta-9 THC or delta-8 THC using a chemical process.

North Carolina's crusade against hemp is not the only front in this war on drugs. Late last month, California Governor Gavin Newsom banned hemp-derived THC through an emergency order. Newsom said that the move was to prevent the sale of intoxicating hemp products to children.

But California also views hemp products as a threat to its struggling $5 billion legal marijuana market.

WHY IT MATTERS ""What's going on in the hemp industry right now shows how complicated and nuanced the legalization of cannabis can be,"" says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. ""Even though marijuana and hemp are variations of the same plant -- Cannabis sativa L -- marijuana is still illegal at the federal level while hemp is legal.""

It's important not only to save for retirement but also to plan for the non-financial aspects. For instance, if you enjoy what you are doing or the social aspect of your job, consider working part-time to transition to full retirement. Take the time to build social connections outside of work, join community groups and develop hobbies. And don't wait until you retire to start traveling: Go when you can, because no one's health is guaranteed.

SAP BrandVoice: How To Create A Strategy To Reduce Youth Unemployment,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2024/10/07/how-to-create-a-strategy-to-reduce-youth-unemployment/,2024-10-07T11:28:18Z,"The global education goal, part of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), remains significantly off track. Various reports, including from UNESCO and UN news, highlight the concerning trend that unless drastic changes occur the world will not meet its commitments to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education by 2030.

The world today is grappling with a polycrisis - a complex set of interconnected global challenges that impact economies, industries, and job markets simultaneously. From climate change and geopolitical tensions to technological disruptions and economic instability, these crises are reshaping the landscape of work, especially for young people. While youth unemployment remains high, employers worldwide are also struggling to fill critical roles, highlighting a significant skills gap.

According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), global youth unemployment was 13% in 2023, with many young people facing limited prospects for stable and decent work. On the flip side, the World Economic Forum (WEF) found that 44% of businesses report difficulties in finding talent with the right skills to fill jobs. This contrast reflects a deepening mismatch between the supply of young job seekers and the demand for skilled talent, which, if left unaddressed, will exacerbate both unemployment and the talent shortage.

To tackle this challenge, we must take a comprehensive, systems-based approach, focusing on five interconnected elements: economy, education, employability, equality, and the ecosystem. Together, these factors can help close the skills gap, reduce youth unemployment, and create pathways to decent work for all.

Economic growth remains a critical driver of job creation, but the quality and inclusivity of that growth matter. In many parts of the world, jobless growth has become a pressing concern, as economies expand without generating enough formal employment opportunities for young people. Youth unemployment continues to rise even in nations with positive GDP growth, indicating that inclusive economic policies and investment in key sectors are lacking (ILO, 2024).

Moreover, the alignment between economic growth and investment in education is critical. The Global Education Monitoring Report 2023 highlights that national budgets for education often fall short of the recommended 4%-6% of GDP that UNESCO advocates. Without adequate financial support, education systems cannot provide the skills and competencies needed to prepare young people for modern job markets, leaving many young workers without the necessary tools to succeed.

Education systems need to evolve to meet the changing demands of the workforce. The OECD - OCDE emphasizes the importance of embedding skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values into education systems to ensure that young people are prepared for lifelong learning. In particular, stackable credentials - modular qualifications that allow learners to build expertise over time - are becoming an essential component of successful education-to-employment transitions.

For more information on how SAP is helping the world run better and improving people's lives all year round, visit sap.com/csr

Despite the need for adaptable learning pathways, many education systems remain rigid and slow to adopt these models. However, countries that have embraced flexible learning, such as Germany with its robust vocational education and training (VET) programs, have been able to reduce youth unemployment significantly. The integration of industry-specialized learning and competency-based education is critical for preparing young people to thrive in an evolving workforce, particularly in sectors like technology and sustainability.

One of the most significant barriers to reducing youth unemployment is the skills mismatch - the gap between what young people learn and what employers need. The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2023 projects that 50% of employees will need reskilling by 2025 due to rapid technological advancements. Yet, traditional education systems are often not aligned with industry needs, leaving many young workers without the skills required for high-growth sectors.

Governments and businesses must collaborate to ensure that training programs are directly linked to market demand. Public-private partnerships, such as apprenticeship programs and industry-led training initiatives, can play a pivotal role in closing the skills gap. For example, in Switzerland, where education and training are tightly integrated with the labor market, youth unemployment is among the lowest in the world. Building a system that continually adapts to changing workforce needs is essential for improving youth employability.

Recent trends show that many young people increasingly prefer entrepreneurship over traditional employment, driven by the desire for independence and the ability to create change. A 2019 study by Deloitte found that 76% of millennials view entrepreneurship as a key vehicle for driving social impact. However, research highlights the need for robust support systems to help these young entrepreneurs succeed.

The 2021 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor emphasizes that access to entrepreneurial education, mentorship, and skill development is critical for youth to thrive in their ventures.

Any strategy to reduce youth unemployment must prioritize equality, ensuring that opportunities are equally accessible to all young people, regardless of their background, gender, or location. Despite advances in education, women and marginalized communities continue to face barriers to entry in high-growth industries, particularly in STEM fields. According to UNESCO, only 35% of STEM graduates are women, highlighting the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

Programs that specifically target underrepresented groups - such as mentorships and women-in-tech initiatives - can help diversify the talent pipeline. Furthermore, companies that emphasize inclusive hiring practices, gender parity, and equity in leadership are not only contributing to social justice but also benefiting from a more innovative and dynamic workforce. The data is clear: promoting diversity is a strategic advantage in the modern economy.

A thriving job market requires more than just a functioning economy and well-prepared workers - it needs a cohesive ecosystem where governments, businesses, educational institutions, and civil society work together efficiently. The OECD underscores the importance of synergy across the value chain, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned toward the goal of reducing unemployment and fostering decent work.

Successful models of ecosystem collaboration, like those seen in Singapore, offer valuable lessons for other nations. In these countries, the government plays a central role in orchestrating cooperation between educational institutions and industries to ensure that young people are being trained in fields that are projected to grow. Such synergies foster an environment where young people can transition smoothly from education to employment and where employers can easily find the talent they need.

As respective leaders, SAP and UNICEF join forces to create innovative solutions to global skilling and workforce challenges with an aim to help young people transition to earning. Together, we're generating inclusive opportunities for underserved young people worldwide, preparing them for decent work with the skills that employers need.

We expanded our partnership in 2022, with a three-year investment focused on impacting youth in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa through a new program that supports learning to earning pathways in growing digital and green economies. The program helps equip youth with the essential skills they need to flourish - wherever they may see their future. Further, it builds on UNICEF's Generation Unlimited (GenU) signature program, Youth Agency Marketplace (YOMA), a platform developed by young Africans to tackle labor market challenges and increase youth agency across the globe.

By the end of the first year, SAP and UNICEF's GenU reached more than 600,000 youth, granting them access to foundational and digital skills opportunities that help young people unlock opportunities in the changing global economy.

One of the learn to earn pathways on YOMA is the SAP Educate to Employ initiative designed by SAP to help equip beneficiaries with essential competencies for the digital economy. The free initiative, implemented by the local non-profit UMUZI, focuses on developing skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values to help prepare candidates for employment.

It also aims to assist employers in accessing diverse and certified talent, thereby accelerating digital transformation in each country through a skilled talent pipeline. More than 1,000 learners completed one or more foundational skills courses, while 165 learners completed over 400 hours of critical skills development training and achieved an SAP certification for technology consultant beginners. Additionally, 100 learners have completed their intermediate training on the SAP Learning site and are preparing for SAP-certified associate exams.

This multistakeholder approach underscores the power of partnership in addressing complex social challenges. By pooling expertise and resources, SAP, UNICEF's GenU, and UMUZI are collectively ensuring that youth not only gain relevant skills but also access meaningful pathways to employment. These partnerships exemplify the collaborative frameworks needed to drive sustainable impact on a global scale. As digital and green economies continue to reshape the future of work, partnerships that unite private, public, and civil society actors will remain crucial in ensuring that marginalized youth are not left behind.

The polycrisis we face today demands multidimensional solutions that address both the supply and demand sides of the labor market. By focusing on the interconnected elements of economy, education, employability, equality, and ecosystem, we can create a comprehensive strategy to reduce youth unemployment and foster decent work for all.

Policymakers, business leaders, and educators must come together to close the skills gap, promote inclusive growth, and build resilient labor markets. The challenges are great, but so are the opportunities. With coordinated effort and sustained investment, we can build a future where young people have the skills, opportunities, and support they need to thrive in the global economy."
Beyond Sustainability: Guayakí's Regenerative Approach To Business,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christophermarquis/2024/10/07/beyond-sustainability-guayaks-regenerative-approach-to-business/,2024-10-07T11:18:00Z,"In an era where sustainability has become a buzzword, beverage company Guayakí Yerba Mate stands out with its innovative ""Market-Driven Regeneration™"" model, demonstrating that with the right approach, market forces can indeed be harnessed to drive meaningful change for the environment and societies. Unlike traditional approaches to sustainability, which focus on avoiding harm and maintaining socio-ecological systems, regeneration actively works to improve health and biodiversity, often starting by aligning agricultural and business practices with nature's inherent cycles.

Founded in 1996, this yerba mate company has been at the forefront of regenerative business practices for nearly three decades. Yerba mate, a traditional South American plant known for its stimulating properties, is harvested from the leaves of the holly family. Guayakí produces a variety of yerba mate-based drinks, including canned energy beverages, loose leaf yerba mate, and sparkling blends, all of which offer customers a new alternative to traditional caffeinated drinks.

I recently spoke with Ben Mand, CEO of Guayakí, about the company's work and how companies can integrate regenerative practices into their core business strategy, the challenges of scaling such a model, and the evolving consumer landscape for sustainable products.

At the heart of Guayakí's model is a commitment to shade-grown, regenerative organic farming practices that preserve biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest region of South America. These farming techniques foster biodiversity by using native plant cover and engaging in organic farming methods that nourish the soil rather than deplete it.

But as we discuss, their approach extends far beyond agriculture, encompassing fair trade practices, community development, and a holistic view of their entire supply chain. Their ""Fair for Life"" certification ensures that every worker along the supply chain -- from the indigenous communities harvesting the mate to the factory workers -- receives a living wage, with additional premiums paid above market prices to promote fair compensation. Guayakí has long-term, trusted relationships with these communities, ensuring that they are empowered and that their traditional knowledge is respected and integrated into the company's operations. Their Market-Driven Regeneration model, as Mand puts it, ""makes a connection between demand for our products and the positive outcomes we can create.""

Read more below for details from Ben on how Guayakí's regenerative model is not just about producing a sustainable product, but about fostering a system where business success directly translates to environmental restoration and community empowerment.

Marquis: Would you mind saying a little bit both about the company, its core products, its mission, and then also about yourself?

Mand: Guayakí is a very purpose-driven business. In today's world, which is so digital and often divided, Guayakí stands out because it's rooted in connection and community. Yerba mate, especially when shared in a gourd, has been enjoyed for generations in South America. There's a ceremony and ritual in packing a gourd and passing it around, which fosters a sense of connection.

From a business perspective, Guayakí is about regeneration -- about rebuilding and making sure we leave every connection stronger. What has become popular in the U.S. is the ready-to-drink yerba mate products -- whether it's a can or a glass bottle. We brew yerba mate and then add mint, fruit juice, or other flavors. Consumers love the benefits, especially the natural caffeine boost, which is great in the morning or early afternoon.

Yerba mate comes from the holly family, not the tea plant, but it's often mistaken for tea because it contains caffeine and is brewed in a similar way. We harvest, dry, and mill the yerba mate, then brew beverages with it or sell it as loose leaf. It has the polyphenols and minerals you'd find in tea, the caffeine of coffee, and the theobromine you'd typically find in chocolate, which gives you a bit of euphoria.

As for me, I'm originally from Wisconsin, and I'm a first-generation college student. I didn't grow up with much, which taught me to be resourceful. I'm an optimist with a can-do attitude, and I think that has served me well. Over the course of my life, I've had to do a little bit of everything, and I enjoy that. Business wise, I grew up in Consumer Packaged Goods (CPGs) at General Mills, where I learned the fundamentals of running a business. I worked on mature businesses, but my approach was always to find ways to make products better while still delivering sales and profit growth.

After General Mills, I moved into smaller, purpose-driven businesses. Instead of figuring out how to improve products that reached 30-50% of consumers, my focus became scaling products that reach just 2% of households and trying to get that number to 10%, 20%, or 30%, all while strengthening the impact these businesses have.

At Plum Organics, a company focused on early childhood nutrition the mission was clear: to improve the quality of ingredients in baby and toddler food. We worked with experts to craft a supply chain that delivered better, less processed inputs into those products.

Harmless Harvest was similar in that it was a beverage company, very purpose-driven, and Fair for Life certified, just like Guayakí. Three months after joining Harmless Harvest, I transitioned the company from plain organic to regenerative organic. It was a big endeavor, considering the company wasn't very profitable at the time, but I knew it was the right decision. We found ways to improve efficiency and the P&L while still moving toward regenerative organic practices.

There are a lot of parallels between that experience and what I'm doing now at Guayakí. I've been drinking yerba mate for years, and I've always had my eye on the brand. So, when Guayakí came calling, looking for a new CEO, I was thrilled. It's a brand that resonates with me, and I believe it has a ton of potential. The question now is, how do we do even more?

Marquis: I'd love to talk now about the Market-Driven Regeneration model. What do you mean by regeneration? And how does Guayakí think about it, particularly in relation to yerba mate?

Mand: Market-Driven Regeneration really starts at the source. It's the ethos of our business and begins where we grow yerba mate, which comes from Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. That's where we have our long-standing relationships with local communities. We work with them not just on growing, but also on harvesting and purchasing the yerba mate.

Our focus is on shade-grown, regenerative organic farming. From a farming standpoint, it's all about biodiversity. We're not talking about fields like what you might see in California with almond trees or olives. Yerba mate typically grows in a forest environment, so there's shade cover provided by native plants. That's a key part of what we do -- growing yerba mate in its natural environment under native plants to maintain biodiversity. We're certified regenerative and fair trade, which ensures that everyone involved is paid a livable wage. We also pay a premium above market prices.

The idea is that it's an entire ecosystem -- whether you're thinking about indigenous communities, the environment, the factory we run, or the partners we work with. It's about creating mutual success. Our goal isn't to succeed at the expense of our partners; it's to make sure everyone involved is better off through the work we do together.

Marquis: Can you say a little bit about how you think about your regeneration model beyond just the agricultural aspect, for example how you sell in the United States, engage with the communities that your farmers are in?

Mand: One of the things I find really special about Guayakí, and working with yerba mate, is the long-standing relationships we've built with the communities we partner with, including many Indigenous communities. For example, we've been working with the Aché Kue Tuvy people since 2002. We have other relationships that range from 10 to 20 years, and there are some communities I've visited that we just started working with six months ago. What's amazing about these partnerships is that they're not just based on long-term contracts or transactions. They're about real relationships.

For instance, with the Aché Kue Tuvy community, we've not only been harvesting yerba mate with them, but also helping them plant seedlings, expand their tree cover, and increase their acreage over the years. That's just one piece of the puzzle, though. We're also working with them on processing. We've built a small factory where they can dry and package the yerba mate before sending it to our larger factory for further processing. This brings value-added activities into their community, creating more jobs and opportunities for local people.

The really exciting part is that the World Bank is now involved in funding a project to expand this factory. When it's completed, they'll be able to do even more of the processing themselves. This long-term partnership, with us investing over time and partnering closely with them, is instrumental in helping the community develop trade skills and build value-added capabilities. Now, they'll have a factory manager, teams of workers, engineers, payroll staff -- all the activities needed to run something they fully own and control.

Marquis: How does yerba mate move downstream in your supply chain? Could you describe the production process that results in the products consumers can buy, especially from a regenerative standpoint.

Mand: In Brazil, we have our own factory. From a Fair for Life standpoint, we can only have a small percentage of our workforce as temporary employees. This was the same approach at Harmless Harvest, where I worked before. The idea is that you want to employ people year-round, not just seasonally. So, employment practices as a Fair for Life organization dictate how we run the factory.

Right now, we have times of the year where our workforce is underutilized, which creates inefficiency. When I stepped into the role, I took a fresh look at our supply chain to figure out how we could improve efficiency, both financially and environmentally. One big question was how to reduce miles and maximize the density of products in containers to cut down on costs and environmental impact.

At the moment, we process our loose leaf yerba mate and the bags in the U.S. We ship dense bales of aged yerba mate from Brazil to the U.S., where we pack it and send it out. But now, we're looking at centralizing that process in one location, rather than shipping the product all over the U.S. This would streamline everything and make our operations more efficient.

The liquid is a bit different. We don't produce the liquid in Brazil -- we make a yerba mate brew here in the U.S. Right now, we're also exploring how to make that more efficient. For example, we do a light concentrate of the brew, but we could take out even more water so we're shipping mostly the solids. It's similar to how juice concentrates are shipped and rehydrated later.

Efficiency is a big focus for us, not just in terms of labor and how we partner with communities, but also in streamlining the entire supply chain. It's about reducing miles, increasing container efficiency, and thinking about how we can make smarter logistical choices. That's really where we're putting a lot of effort right now.

Marquis: Why define Market-Driven Regeneration as your own model? Why not just say you're Fair for Life and Regenerative Organic certified?

Mand: The term ""Market-Driven"" highlights that we're a for-profit business, not a nonprofit. We believe we can build a successful brand in financial terms while also living into our purpose and mission. The terminology helps people understand that consumers play a key role in this. They have the power to make choices that are better for them, better for people, and better for the planet.

For us, it's about making amazing products that meet people's needs while doing the right thing. When you create demand for a product that does good, you can have a positive impact. It's something I've noticed in board conversations, especially with our Regeneration Committee. The founders are always talking about how we can buy more yerba mate. It's not just about growing the business -- it's about paying a premium, reinvesting in the community, and driving more positive impact. That's what Market-Driven Regeneration means: making a connection between demand for our products and the positive outcomes we can create.

Marquis: What have you done to help other companies understand or adopt this model?

Mand: I can't speak to every conversation the team has had, but having this defined model has given us a way to talk about it consistently. It's a powerful concept, and we wanted to position ourselves as leaders in the regenerative movement.

At Harmless Harvest, we didn't use the term ""Market-Driven Regeneration,"" but we had a similar approach. We focused on making great products that consumers wanted to buy, which naturally pulled them toward products sourced in a fair, humane way. We worked with farmers using regenerative organic practices that were better for the environment, helped sequester carbon, and supported communities. The concept is the same; we just didn't have the exact language at the time. But it's important for people to start understanding this idea more clearly now.

Marquis: Are there other companies you're looking to in this space from which you can learn about regenerative practices?

Mand: I was recently at an offsite retreat with One Step Closer, which brings together thought leaders from both technology and small, burgeoning companies -- some larger, some smaller. Dr. Bronner's and Numi were part of it, and there were lots of great brands in the cohort. It's a great opportunity to learn from one another, whether you're doing $500,000 in sales or $500 million. Everyone is working toward similar goals, but we're all doing things a bit differently.

When it comes to regenerative farming, for example, the approach varies depending on where you are. Farming in South America is very different from farming in Thailand or California, where almonds or cashews are grown. Each region presents its own set of challenges and best practices, and sharing those is invaluable. Sometimes, it's about understanding how to apply these practices elsewhere or sharing data on things like soil health and yields. At Harmless Harvest and now at Guayakí, we collect data on things like shade-grown versus sun-grown yields, so we can compare and understand the differences, whether it's coconuts, yerba mate, or cashews.

Marquis: Could you explain why having the Regenerative Organic certification is important for you? What have you learned from the certification process, considering you were already implementing regenerative practices?

Mand: A big part of my role at Guayakí is to future-proof the organization. I want to ensure that even if the leadership team changes, the company still lives up to its original mission and purpose. One way to do that is through certifications. They keep us honest and ensure we're adhering to our principles.

Certifications also offer learning opportunities. We go through annual audits, which allow us to see where we're excelling and where we need to improve. You want to perform well and lead the industry, but you also don't want any blind spots. If audits uncover any gaps, we figure out what we've learned and what changes we need to make.

It all ties back to Market Driven Regeneration. Consumers are realizing they can't wait for governments or other organizations to solve these problems -- they can make responsible choices themselves.

Certifications like Fair for Life and Regenerative Organic help give them that quick reassurance.

Marquis: Could you share some examples, either from your time at Guayakí or at Harmless Harvest, where the certification process revealed something you needed to change?

Mand: We've definitely had a range of learnings across organizations. It's important to remember that certifications don't just involve one person -- they span the entire organization. At Guayakí, for instance, it touches everything from our facilities in South America to our finance, accounting, and commercial teams. Everyone is part of the process, and it becomes a learning experience for the entire company.

One example is when we started thinking about the partners we use for in-store displays. Do they have the right codes of conduct? Are they using the right materials? What's the end-of-life impact of those materials? It wasn't just about our factory but about every aspect of our supply chain. Once you start going through these audits, it helps everyone see where they can make different choices. Even something as small as a cleaning service becomes an area where you can apply more sustainable practices. That's one way these certifications push us to think more holistically.

Marquis: Could you talk a little about Guayakí's consumer profile and how you're planning to expand it? It seems like a passionate but possibly niche group -- how do you plan to grow?

Mand: Our core consumer tends to be younger, ranging from college to young adulthood. Yerba mate often becomes their preferred energy boost as they start to move away from coffee or other forms of caffeine. The discovery of yerba mate typically happens in college, when they're cramming for exams and need something to help them power through.

But it doesn't stop there. Our consumers are young, full of life, and love outdoor activities, music, and being with friends. They also care deeply about the environment and social responsibility. They want to align with brands that reflect those values. So, our sweet spot is really that Gen Z and millennial crowd who value responsible products.

Marquis: How are you working to communicate sustainability and regeneration to consumers and have that be an important part of the story of yerba mate as consumers are adopting it?

Mand: We started on the West Coast, but we've been expanding nationwide over the past few years. There's a natural desire to make a positive impact, and our challenge is to help people recognize that they can make a difference with their purchasing decisions.

That said, it's a tricky balance. Consumers aren't always looking for a purpose-driven message in their social media or marketing -- they want to be entertained or educated in other ways. So, it's important to stay true to the fundamentals of building a brand. You need to understand who your consumer is, what they need, and how your product meets that need.

There are moments where it makes sense to bring the purpose-driven message to the forefront, like during Earth Week or the holidays when people are focused on giving back. I believe that doing good should be baked into everything we do, and then we can sprinkle in those moments where we celebrate it. You don't want it to come across as self-promotional, even if it's authentic. It needs to be shared in a way that feels natural and not forced.

Marquis: How do you approach different distribution channels, like Natural Foods Markets or big chains like Target?

Mand: The distribution piece is really important. Big companies like Coke and Pepsi dominate the shelf space because they have the resources to secure that real estate. This means consumers often don't have the opportunity to choose different products because retailers aren't allocating space for them or helping with education.

Retailers do have opportunities, like end caps and merchandising events, to feature smaller brands, but these brands usually don't have the big budgets that multinationals do. Still, if we want to change consumer behavior and encourage the purchase of environmentally and socially responsible products, retailers need to step up. To even be on their shelves, you must meet certain criteria, so consumers trust that products in these stores are aligned with their values. Plus, natural retailers often have programs that highlight and educate consumers on responsible products.

Interestingly, Target does a great job with in-store experiences. People often talk about ""Tar-Jay"" because it offers more than just shopping -- it creates a theater-like environment. They used to have a program called Made to Matter, which was Target's way of showcasing brands with a purpose. Unfortunately, when times get tough and budgets get cut, programs like this are often the first to go.

On the other hand, traditional grocery stores face different challenges. Their businesses rely heavily on labor, and with low unemployment, it's hard for them to even stock shelves, let alone focus on the next level of consumer education. These environments are also harder for responsible brands because they have to hit certain sales velocities quickly to stay on the shelves. They need time to build momentum, but the system doesn't always allow for that.

Marquis: Finally, understanding how all of this is connected in the company, can you explain how the governance and ownership of the company are structured to align with this mission? And as someone coming in after 28 years of founder-led leadership, how have you adjusted to your role?

Mand: From a governance perspective, we have all the structures you'd expect from a social purpose corporation, such as bylaws and annual reporting requirements. But what I think is important, and maybe what you're getting at, is how our governance supports our mission beyond just the financials.

One thing I really love is that we have a separate Regeneration Committee, much like a Compensation Committee, that meets regularly. One change I made is to ensure the entire leadership team attends these meetings. We can only be successful if everyone understands our goals and is accountable for driving results. This has been a shift for the organization, but it's important to get the cadence right.

In the Regeneration Committee, we don't talk about business results -- we spend three hours focusing solely on strategy, initiatives, and setting priorities for the next 12 months. Afterward, we report back to the board, but the Regeneration Committee allows us to go deep into our regenerative efforts.

In my first six months, I've spent a lot of time with the founders to understand the company's history, their goals, and their vision. My role is to future-proof the business, to make sure it's on a trajectory where it can live out the principles the founders established. I see myself as the bridge between their vision and the realities of running a successful, profitable business. Financial success is what allows us to keep fueling our purpose."
It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich. Sylvia Jarrus for NPR hide caption

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."
September CPI Will Impact Fed Policy And Market Expectations,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/10/06/september-cpi-will-impact-fed-policy-and-market-expectations/,2024-10-06T21:38:58Z,"The September U.S. Consumer Price Index tops this week's economic reports. With year-on-year total and core CPI inflation rates still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, traders and investors will be watching for signs that give the Fed license to cut rates on November 7. The potential that inflation rates are too high presents downside risks to equity markets and commodity prices because elevated inflation rates could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates next month.

This week's September CPI report will be critical for Fed interest rate policy expectations because labor market and inflation data are the Fed's main policy concerns. With the potential to shape Fed policies, which are front and center for financial markets, the CPI report has the potential to impact financial markets from equities and bonds to industrial commodities and the dollar.

Year-on-year total CPI inflation slowed in August to the lowest year-on-year pace since February 2021. Total CPI decelerated to 2.5% from 2.9%, although year-on-year core CPI was unchanged at a relatively high 3.2%. Both total and core year-on-year CPI rates are still elevated and above the Fed's 2% target.

Inflation has been easing slowly, but base effects threaten to keep year-on-year total CPI and core CPI above the Fed's 2% target until the first half of 2025. Nevertheless, year-on-year CPI inflation rates appear likely to have made more progress toward 2% in September, and Prestige Economics is forecasting year-on-year CPI to be 2.4%, with core CPI at 3.1%.

As the Fed carefully weighs the importance of labor market and inflation data, this week's CPI report will be more critical for Fed policy expectations in the wake of last week's Employment Situation Report -- informally called the jobs report by economists and analysts. September payrolls and unemployment data were much stronger than expected with strong payroll gains of 254,000, upward revisions to payrolls of 72,000, and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%.

Following the release of the strong September jobs report, the potential for a 0.5% Fed rate cut on November 7 fell to zero in the CME FedWatch Tool on October 6, while the potential for a 0.25% interest rate cut rose to 97.4% and the chance that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged rose to 2.6%.

Just one week prior, on September 27, the CME FedWatch Tool reflected the chance of a 0.5% Fed interest rate cut on November 7 at 53.3%. Meanwhile, the chance of a 0.25% interest rate cut was 46.7%, and the chance of no changes in interest rate policies was zero. The change in the CME FedWatch Tool expectations reflects just how important the strong September jobs report was for shifting Fed policy expectations.

The CME FedWatch Tool reflects that there is no urgency to cut interest rates due to the strength of the labor market. However, if inflation eases in September, the Fed will have more wiggle room to cut interest rates next month.

If the September CPI report does not show a further easing of year-on-year consumer inflation, expectations that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged on November 7 will likely rise. These dynamics would likely support the dollar but potentially hold mixed to negative implications for equities, bond prices, and industrial commodity prices.

However, if the September CPI report shows an easing of year-on-year inflationary pressures from August, the potential for a 0.5% rate cut would likely increase, weighing on the greenback but supporting equities, bond prices, and industrial commodity prices.

What do you expect for the September CPI inflation report?"
Robust Job Gains Remove Recession Fears,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/06/robust-job-gains-remove-recession-fears/,2024-10-06T11:06:04Z,"The September jobs report on Friday put to rest any fears that the labor market might be on a path to cool enough to endanger U.S. economic growth. On the contrary, the report was so broadly strong as to give rise to worries that the Federal Reserve might pause further cuts and reignited wage growth might be a looming danger.

Employment grew by 254,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations, and the upwardly revised 159,000 in August. The household survey data was also robust at a gain of 430,000 jobs, with the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, soaring by a whopping 666,000.

The unemployment rate was reported at 4.1% but was close to 4.0% at 4.05%, down from 4.2%.

Wages crept up to 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.8%, which reinforces the strength of the labor demand but might raise questions about renewed inflation pressures. The only blemish on the jobs report was the average workweek hours falling to 34.2, a four-year low also seen in July and January.

The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm that the cooling trend in the labor market has stabilized, with both measures off their respective peaks.

Before the recent decline, the unemployment rate had risen enough off the lows to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. However, there are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle.

Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is further evidence that the labor market does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy.

Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 near all-time highs by Friday's market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved higher as well.

Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. The lower probability of recession after the healthy jobs report is reflected in the better performance of economically sensitive companies.

The crucial economic reports before the next Federal Reserve meeting on November 7 include Thursday's consumer inflation (CPI) and another monthly jobs report. Consensus estimates expect September CPI to slow to 2.3% year-over-year from 2.5%. The Cleveland Fed's CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the November meeting.

Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expected pace of 2024 rate cuts. A short-term interest rate cut of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November and December Fed meetings is implied. In response to the slower expected pace of rate cuts, the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields rose to 3.92% and 3.97%, respectively.

Friday's job report increases the probability that the Federal Reserve can engineer a soft landing with the U.S. economy remaining remarkably resilient. The Atlanta Fed's estimate of third-quarter GDP is at 2.5%, according to their last update on October 1. As the fears of recession recede and have been reflected in all-time high stock prices, earnings will likely need to be the next catalyst for higher prices. Third-quarter earnings season kicks off at the end of the week as if on cue."
Stunning photos of a vast e-waste dumping ground  --  and those who make a living off it,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/10/05/g-s1-6411/electronics-public-health-waste-ghana-phones-computers,2024-10-05T17:35:53Z,"The now-demolished Agbogbloshie Scrapyard in Accra, Ghana, once received 250,000 tons of electronic waste each year, making it the world's largest electronic waste dump. Muntaka Chasant hide caption

When he was just 18 years old, Emmanuel Akatire traveled about 500 miles from his home in Zorko, Ghana, to Accra, the nation's capital, to find the only work he could -- sifting through vast piles of discarded electronics to find valuable scrap metal. A week's worth of painstaking, often dangerous work, earns him the equivalent of about 60 U.S. dollars.

""I started doing scrap work around 2021 -- after I lost both my parents -- to provide for the rest of my family,"" he told Muntaka Chasant, a photojournalist in Ghana. ""There's no electricity in my community, no development there,"" he said. So he came to Accra, which has become a major dumping ground for the globe's used electronics.

For years, a site called Agbogbloshie in Accra was the world's largest e-waste dump, getting 250,000 tons of discarded phones, computers and other used electronics each year. Many Western media outlets depicted the site as a public health and environmental tragedy, rife with toxic chemicals that leach into the water and poison the air. While that's undoubtedly true, it's not the full story, according to a new collaborative photojournalism project.

The project, called E-Waste in Ghana: Tracing Transboundary Flows, which won this year's Fondation Carmingac photojournalism award, aims to capture both the positive and negative aspects of e-waste.

""The world cannot throw all its garbage here, it has truly negative consequences on the people,"" says Anas Aremeyaw Anas, an investigative journalist in Ghana who co-led the project. ""But there are positive aspects of sending us e-waste,"" he says, as it's sparked a dynamic, informal recycling economy in the country that, while often dangerous, can also help lift people like Emmanuel Akatire out of poverty.

Globally, e-waste is an enormous problem. In 2022, humans discarded about 62 million tons of used electronics, enough to fill a line of trucks that spans the equator. But there's opportunity too, as those trucks contain over $91 billion of valuable metals, the U.N. estimates, though people like Akatire who do the dangerous recycling work reap the smallest share of those potential profits.

E-waste falls into two broad buckets: functional and non-functional. The line between them can be fuzzy, as what's still usable or repairable to one person may not be to another, but the distinction is important. International laws prohibit trafficking of non-functional e-waste containing toxic substances, but the United Nations sees trading functional e-waste as beneficial, as it can lengthen the lifespan of a product.

The project found that exporters often fail to separate functional from non-functional e-waste. ""If you have a container full of TV screens, how on earth are you going to verify each and every one of them to make sure that they are functioning,"" says photojournalist Bénédicte Kurzen, a co-author of the project. As a result, both kinds of e-waste get stuffed into container ships that make their way to low- and middle-income countries like Ghana.

Formally, Ghana prohibits the import of many forms of hazardous e-waste material. But the team found that a well-placed bribe can get port officials to look the other way. As a result, informal e-waste sites are growing across Ghana's coast. There, both functional and non-functional e-waste get dumped into vast piles that are encroaching on residential areas. Thousands of ""pickers"" come to these sites, picking through the rubbish to separate items that might be repaired from waste that could contain valuable minerals.

Many of the pickers are climate migrants from an area of Ghana known as the ""Upper East,"" says project co-author Chasant, where warming temperatures are upending traditional farming practices. ""This area has the highest unemployment rate among young people,"" he says. They come to e-waste sites to earn money during the dry season, Chasant says, which they bring back to the Upper East. ""There's a whole generation of young people that are building their society from e-waste work.""

It's fraught, precarious work. To separate valuable minerals, like copper wire or iron, from useless plastic, pickers often burn the trash, producing noxious fumes. Burns, cuts and other injuries are common. E-waste workers -- many of whom are children, the team found -- are at risk of exposure to over 1,000 harmful chemicals, according to the World Health Organization, including lead, mercury and brominated flame retardants, which are linked to higher rates of diseases like cancer and diabetes.

Bernard Akanwee Atubawuna, a 21-year-old picker from Upper East, died while doing scrap work, says Chasant. His cause of death is unknown, but ""Akanwee was a sickle-cell carrier and should never have been anywhere near fires/picking. But his parents said it was the only way he supported them. He sent his sister to learn a trade. He was also helping the parents to build a house back in the Upper East -- all from picking.""

The harms extend beyond the dumps themselves. ""There are many communities that have run to a halt as a result of the devastating effects of the poisonous gases that are inhaled,"" says Anas. Heavy metals seep into the soil and water too, which can have profound health effects on local communities. ""When people start burning, the poisonous fumes lead to people relocating.""

A burgeoning recycling and repair industry has risen up alongside those harms. The team documented informal marketplaces, where vendors sell scores of busted cell phones to buyers looking to repair circuit boards or extract their precious metals. On Zongo Lane in Accra, the reporters say, hundreds of small, independent shops sell used or repaired equipment, ranging from televisions to computers.

""In Africa, people still have this thing of repairing is important. Don't throw it away. You can still do things about it,"" says Kurzen. In Western countries, people view these objects as much more disposable, she says, which is helping fuel the growth of e-waste worldwide.

The most valuable minerals extracted from Ghana's e-waste often don't stay in Ghana. Many of the most valuable items get cherry picked and sent to more advanced smelters in Europe or Asia, the team found. ""People are dismantling these items in toxic environments, and then the few piles that contain incredibly valuable minerals are going to be re-exported,"" says Kurzen.

She and her colleagues hope that the project prompts people to re-examine their relationship to the electronics in their lives. The few years we spend with a new phone represents just a blip in the story of the materials that power it, Kurzen says. ""Those materials are traveling worldwide,"" she says, ""These [devices] we hold in our hands come at the expense of somebody, somewhere in the world. Nothing comes for free."""
5 Questions For The Fed's Austan Goolsbee -- Including: Did They Move Fast Enough On Inflation?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/05/5-questions-for-the-feds-austan-goolsbee-including-did-they-move-fast-enough-on-inflation/,2024-10-05T12:09:41Z,"It's an unusually tense time at the Federal Reserve as Democrats and Republicans -- including former President Donald Trump -- target the central bank as it starts cutting rates in its most significant monetary policy in decades. Forbes spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, an alternate member on the highly watched Federal Open Market Committee and a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Obama, about how ""super serious"" central bankers feel about becoming a political football ahead of the election, how the Fed is adjusting to easing inflation and growing recession angst, and what he'd change about the ""behind the curve"" policy leading to the worst inflation crisis in the U.S. since the early 1980s.

Forbes: Have there been any discussions at Federal Open Market Committee meetings about pressure from both sides of the political aisle to act in a certain way heading into the election? Context: The FOMC is the U.S. central bank panel that votes on the target federal funds rate, which heavily influences interest rates on loans across the country, impacting inflation, economic growth and unemployment. The Fed is under heightened scrutiny after rolling out the first interest rate cuts since early 2020 last month. The reaction function refers to how a central bank responds to one event, like lowering rates when inflation rises.

When you become a sworn member of the Federal Reserve, you're out of the election business. Everybody takes that super seriously. The things that determine our decisions are: What are the economic conditions and what are the forecasts. What would we need to see to stop raising? What would we need to see to hold? What do we need to see for stuff to come down? We've been laying out the criteria, and now we're just seeing come to pass the stuff that we've been forecasting, and so the reaction function is pretty well established.

Forbes: What are the data points in the labor market that you are paying the closest attention to meeting to meeting? Context: We interviewed Goolsbee two days before the September jobs report surprisingly revealed the strongest job growth since March, decelerating bets on continued aggression from the Fed on lowering rates and throwing another wrench into the central bank shift as borrowing costs look less likely to tumble.

Goolsbee: The unemployment rate, but everybody knows that. A little bit less, the payroll, job employment numbers. There was a time when, if you had asked me ""what's the single most important number?"" I probably would have said that, but not now, with the uncertainty about immigration and the uncertainty about these [revisions to jobs data].

This has been such a strange, unprecedented moment of new firm creation and self employment and different work arrangements. I think that's why we're having such major revisions on these [data points]. All of those things make me put a little bit less weight [on monthly nonfarm payrolls] since there's more of a question mark around [them]. All the measures that we tend to look at as economists to track the labor market - the ratio of vacancies to the number of unemployed, the employment-to-population ratio of prime age workforce, the quit rate, hiring rate, all of those things, plus the the new unemployment claims - I feel like they're all kind of saying the same thing.

The rate of change is all in the direction of cooling. And if you look in the past, it's quite rare that you see cooling labor markets that just settle into full employment. Usually, when things start to go bad, they keep getting worse. And so that's our challenge now: After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?

Forbes: Let's imagine we have that crystal ball and we're able to look forward to the end of next year. We officially stick the landing, core PCE runs right in that sweet spot of about 2%, and the federal funds rate falls to right around the median forecast around 3%. What risks for the second half of the decade are you most worried about? Context: Core PCE is the Fed's favored inflation metric as it tracks how much Americans spend monthly on goods and services outside of more volatile food and energy categories. Projections shared at the FOMC's latest meeting indicate officials have a median forecast of 3.4% at the end of 2025.

Goolsbee: It's productivity growth.

For productivity growth, the [data] matters the most over the long run, and in the short run, it's one of the most noisy [data points] there is. So that's why it's kind of hard to take that into account in the meeting-to-meeting monetary policy decisions. We saw wild swings in that over Covid...but in the last year-and-a-half, that growth rate of productivity has been averaging well higher than the trend before Covid.

Is that a sign that technology has changed, or is it AI? Is it something else? Is it hybrid work? Is it the business dynamism that we've had all these startups? Because if the productivity growth rate is going to be higher, even if not permanent [but] for the medium term, then the second half of the decade we're going to have a bunch of discussions like the second half of the 1990s, where there was an extended increase in the productivity growth rate. The implications for the economy are that you can grow faster and have more job growth without inflation in a world like that.

And income, wages are going to go up. Nobody needs to be nervous about wages going up at fast rates, because productivity growth will justify it. To me, that's an overwhelmingly important factor that we're going to have to think about in this second half.

Forbes: You're allowed to time travel back to mid-to-late 2021, right before inflation skyrocketed, and you can change one policy within relative reason. What do you choose? Context: After a decade of sub-3% inflation, prices began rising rapidly in 2021, and consumer price index inflation peaked in June 2022 at a 41-year high of 9.1%. The Fed didn't raise rates, the most common response to inflation, until March 2022, and raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to a two-decade high of over 5% in a 16-month span.

Goolsbee: I think looking back, if you had one thing to change, if you could know that the supply shocks were not going to be transitory in the three or four months sense, you would have started moving earlier.

You would not have been raising with this kind of rapidity that the Fed engaged in, 500 basis points in one year. That's about as fast as it's ever gone up. You would have started earlier but also realistically, I think it's worth considering how much lower you think inflation would be if they had done that. If you could have a crystal ball and have perfect timing and recognize it's not going to be a temporary supply shock lasting three months, it's going to be a temporary supply shock lasting two years, how much less would inflation be?

There were a lot of countries that tried both monetary and fiscal policy a lot of different ways, and, for the most part, they basically had the same inflation experience. It is instructive that there are limits to what the Fed could have done. But if I had one thing to do over - I wasn't on the FOMC at that time - but looking back, they were behind the curve, slow to move.

Forbes: I know you're a big fan of ""The Simpsons"" - what do you think Mr. Burns would want the FOMC to do now? What's the conversation like at Moe's tavern when CNBC comes on after the last FOMC meeting? Context: Goolsbee often references ""The Simpsons,"" the animated comedy which features curmudgeonly nuclear power tycoon Mr. Charles Burns and the pub ""Moe's Tavern,"" where Homer Simpson and his more working class drinking buddies congregate.

Goolsbee: Mr. Burns has, in various episodes, lots of cash, lots of equity and/or lots of bonds. So does he want high rates or low rates? I would like to think Mr. Burns, just out of his own pure self-interest, wants whatever is good for the economy. Financial stability seems like it is the order of the day for him. At Moe's Tavern, there's one of the episodes where they're showing old presidential debates, and Kennedy's like, 'I'd like to express my fondness for Duff beer,' and Richard Nixon's like, 'I would also like to express my fondness for that particular beer,' and it cuts Moe's Tavern. And they're like, 'That guy never drank a Duff in his life!' And I fear that Moe's Tavern, they would not be super enamored of the FOMC, but they should be. We're not the bad guys. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

[Goolsbee revised his Burns response in an email: ""Burns is a notorious gold bug that's still complaining that the Coinage Act got rid of the ha'penny in 1857. He's had it out for the Fed since we tipped off authorities in season 9 that he was the one who stole the 1 Trillion dollar bill after WWII.""]"
Opinion | Striking dock workers just set an example for all working folks,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dock-workers-strike-sent-powerful-message-bosses-workers-rcna173849,2024-10-05T11:58:58Z,"Dockworkers strike on a picket line outside of the Port of Houston Authority in Texas on Oct. 1.Brandon Bell / Getty Images

On Tuesday, dockworkers went on strike, shutting down ports across the East Coast and Gulf Coast to demand higher wages and a guarantee that automation won't be used to throw many of them out of work. It was a massive demonstration of the power of working people to grind the gears of the economy to a halt by simply refusing to show up.

The bosses caved in record time. Both sides agreed to a tentative deal Thursday. The dockworkers will return to work in exchange for a 62% pay increase over the next six years. That's a very good thing.

What's alarming is that even as the workers were being demonized by right-wing media outlets like The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, many liberals were fretting that the economic chaos resulting from foreign goods not coming into American ports would cost Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris the election. Even some otherwise left-of-center journalists were criticizing the workers for having the audacity to strike or even calling on President Joe Biden to force them back to work.

Naysayers had argued that the workers were greedy. As they saw it, dockworkers already made more than enough money. Others argued that by blocking automation, the workers were standing in the way of progress. Many observers said that collective bargaining is all well and good within reasonable limits, but shutting down this much of the flow of goods coming into the country was too much of an economic disruption to be allowed.

All of those arguments missed the mark by a mile. The only structural power the working class has in a capitalist system is the power to disrupt the economy by withdrawing its labor. That's the entire point of union organizing.

In this case, the union members stuck to their guns and won. Their victory is a victory for everyone who has to sell their working hours to a boss to make a living.

There were breathless headlines about dockworkers who make ""six-figure salaries,"" but those were about the top earners. As Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pointed out in his statement of solidarity with the striking workers, the average income for these workers is $60,000 a year, with ""many East Coast port workers mak[ing] as little as $20 an hour -- the same wage that a fast food worker in California currently makes."" And loading and unloading cargo ships is demanding work, often involving very long hours. The idea that these workers are overentitled clashes jarringly with these basic realities.

There's a much bigger problem, though, with the idea that striking dockworkers didn't deserve support because they already made good wages. That argument assumes that labor activity is just a way of procuring charity for workers who are poor and desperate enough to need it. That's exactly the wrong way to think about it. The labor movement exists to give the working-class majority of a society a say in what goes on at the workplaces where they spend half their waking hours and some input into how the profits created by their hard work are divided up. It imposes some small measure of democracy on the economy. The more that happens, the more everyone who works for a living benefits.

Every dollar that doesn't reach the pockets of workers pads the profits of already wildly profitable companies. The ocean carriers have made record profits in the last few years: $400 billion since 2020. Meanwhile, the dockworkers whose labor does so much to produce those profits are actually making 12% less than they were two decades ago, when adjusted for inflation. Why should the bosses hoard the benefits of the industry's success? If some dockworkers make more money than you do at your job, then why should your conclusion be that the dockworkers are greedy and not that you should organize with your co-workers for a better deal?

It's all too easy to think of corporate CEOs and shareholders raking in money as the inevitable order of things and working people trying to get a bigger piece of the pie as an imposition. Similarly, we just take it for granted that advances in automation will be used to throw some workers into unemployment while the ones lucky enough to keep their jobs have to work as hard as ever as they see their employers' profits skyrocket.

But that's not the only way things could work. Imagine that these companies were collectively owned by the workers themselves. In that scenario, labor-saving technology could actually be used to save labor for everyone. Workers could all work shorter hours for the same income, spread the work that still needs to be done by humans more thinly among themselves and give themselves more time to spend with their loved ones.

In the world we live in, though, ownership and labor are separated, so bosses decide how automation will be implemented. This is a problem that's going to impact every corner of the economy as technology advances, and any workers who want to avoid being left in the cold at the end of the process need to be ready to follow the dockworkers' lead and draw a line in the sand.

And people who profess to be workers' allies need to take their heads out of the sand.

Lee Fang, a heterodox left-wing journalist I'd expect to be sympathetic to organized workers, assailed the dockworkers on the grounds that Biden has been a pro-labor president and the strike had the potential to ""cause crippling inflation only 1 month out from the election."" He said this ""might take the cake"" as an extreme example of ""self defeats of organized labor.""

Dylan Matthews of Vox went so far as to call for Biden to invoke Taft-Hartley, a notorious piece of union-busting legislation passed in the 1940s, lest the dockworkers' strike ""cause inflation to come roaring back weeks before an election."" Matthews said ""you can support bargaining"" without tolerating the ""sabotage"" of the economy that would come from shutting down traffic at East Coast ports.

But what incentive are employers supposed to have to give concessions if workers can't back up their bargaining demands with a credible threat to walk off the job? That's the only way workers have ever been able to build real power.

As it happened, the bosses caved before the supply chain disruptions could cause inflation. Even if things hadn't worked out this way, though, it's disturbing that Matthews was willing to throw striking workers under the bus for the ""greater good."" If Biden had taken Matthews' advice, the ""pro-labor"" president using a union-busting law to shut down a major strike would have had demoralizing ripple effects throughout the rest of the organized working class.

Even if all you care about is Democrats winning elections, screwing over dockworkers would still have been a bad idea. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is already being supported by a higher percentage of union households than any other Republican candidate in the last 40 years. A Democratic president invoking Taft-Hartley to shut down a high-profile strike would likely only make things worse.

As Chris Isidore and Vanessa Yurkevich point out at CNN, if the union had continued to work under a contract extension, thus delaying any strike until after the presidential election, then they ""would have lost bargaining leverage"" by losing the chance to shut down the ports before the ""pre-holiday shipping season"" really got going. In telling the workers to throw away their best chance to win this massive pay raise to make sure Harris won, Fang and Matthews were essentially telling them not to take action themselves but to trust politicians to look out for their interests. But workers can't exert much influence on the political process if they don't start by building power for themselves where they work.

It's true that in many ways, Biden has been more pro-labor than recent presidents. But his record is more mixed than Fang suggests. He came into office promising to pass the PRO Act, which would make it easier for workers to organize unions, but it hasn't passed and never seemed to have been a high priority for his administration. And two years ago, in a situation much like this one, Biden invoked the Railway Labor Act to prevent a major rail strike. It's good that this time around he did the right thing -- he told reporters that he didn't ""believe in Taft-Hartley"" -- but these blotches on his record show the limits of trusting politicians to be benevolent toward workers.

While Republicans are certainly worse on labor issues, the sad fact is that the working class has relatively limited influence in both parties. There's no way to change that more basic reality without building a bigger and more militant labor movement, one that's not afraid to flex its muscles at times that might be inconvenient for others.

And if you work for a living, then that's exactly what you should want to happen."
Does unemployment whiplash mean recession? : The Indicator from Planet Money,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/1203595442/jobs-friday-recession-economy-unemployment,2024-10-04T21:49:55Z,"It's Jobs Friday! It's that time of the month where we check in on the American worker.

In September, 254,000 jobs were added to the US economy and the unemployment rate ticked down very slightly to 4.1%. It's unexpectedly strong, and relieving news for workers after a pretty lackluster summer.

But ... given how the labor market cooled over summer, is the labor market still on thin ice? And if there were to be a plummet in jobs, could anything be done to speed up the recovery?

Stephanie Ruhle: By all measures we have a strong economy. So why don't Americans feel that way?,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/job-report-inflation-economy-biden-rcna174092,2024-10-04T20:53:06Z,"The Biden administration woke up to some good news on Friday. The U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, blowing past the 150,000 expected. Not only did September's numbers beat economists' expectations, but data from previous months were also revised upward and the unemployment rate fell from 4.2% in August to 4.1%.

This is good news. By almost all measures, we've got a strong economy, except for one thing that matters an awful lot: how Americans feel about it. It's a reason why Donald Trump continues to poll better among likely voters on handling the economy.

That feeling is largely frustration that prices are still too high. I'm not talking about the pace of inflation -- just the fact that everything seems to cost more.

Now, the administration and the Harris campaign point to all the recent positive economic news, but they don't always connect the dots to one reason behind those prices: the rise in wages.

Yes, price increases can be due to ""greedflation."" Corporations have held wages low for years while raising prices and pocketing big profits. Many businesses could increase wages and benefits without higher prices. That's why many politicians, including Vice President Kamala Harris, want to investigate and go after those engaging in price gouging.

However, a lot of workers -- especially lower-wage earners -- have gotten a raise in recent years. And when wages go up, prices likely do as well. We want lower-wage earners to be able to support their families, but if you're paying people who work at fast-food joints or pizzerias $20 an hour, then you're not likely going to get $1 menu items anymore, and you're not going to get a pizza that costs less than $20.

Here's an example: My son works at a deli and takes home $20 an hour for making sandwiches. When my mother rolls in to pick him up from work, she can't understand why the sandwiches are $22.

But it's not just about ""greedflation"" and price gouging. Employers are paying people more and it's going to impact all kinds of companies. And if employers pay their workers more, especially small business owners, it has to come from somewhere, and often that means raising prices for consumers.

Let's not forget, this increase in wages is also good news. Wage growth has been rising fastest for the lowest-wage workers. That's a good thing, even if it means we might have to pay a little more for fast food, pizza and sandwiches."
Broke And Unemployed? Here Are 5 Steps To Financial Recovery,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/truetamplin/2024/10/04/what-if-youre-broke-and-unemployed-5-steps-to-financial-recovery/,2024-10-04T18:13:03Z,"Being broke and unemployed is undoubtedly one of the most stressful financial situations one can face, with the pressure to make ends meet -- buying food, paying rent, or keeping the lights on -- seemingly impossible. Nonetheless, there are steps you can take to regain control. This article offers practical strategies to help reduce expenses, access assistance, and quickly generate income. By taking swift action, you can ease financial pressure and work toward long-term stability. Even in difficult times, small, focused efforts can make a significant difference in securing your financial future.

Before making decisions about managing your finances, you must first fully understand where you stand. Knowing the extent of your resources and liabilities will provide a clearer picture of what needs to be done.

Gather a complete list of all available resources, such as any cash you have on hand, money in checking and savings accounts, or funds held in PayPal or other payment services. You should also consider any assets that you could potentially liquidate, such as unused electronics, jewelry, or other valuables.

This step serves as your financial baseline, a way to determine how much you have to work with. While the number may seem small, it's crucial to have clarity on the exact amount of money you can draw from in the short term.

The next step is to examine where your money is going. Categorize your expenses into essential and non-essential groups. Essentials are things like rent, utilities, food, and transportation. Non-essentials may include streaming services, dining out, entertainment, or other discretionary purchases.

A detailed breakdown of your spending will enable you to construct a minimal budget centered around survival. This is the initial stage of identifying areas where you can cut back.

Based on your expenses, you'll need to estimate how much money is required to cover your essential costs over the next one to three months. This timeframe provides a short-term view, allowing you to focus on immediate survival while planning for longer-term recovery.

Write down exactly how much you need for basic living expenses and subtract this from your current assets to understand any pressing shortfall.

This is one of the most critical steps in managing a financial crisis. In some cases, it might mean making difficult decisions about what to cut, but reducing expenses as quickly as possible is necessary to stretch your available resources.

Cancel or pause your streaming services, gym memberships, or other subscriptions. Even though these services may provide comfort or routine, they are not important for survival.

You should also refrain from dining out, going to the movies, or shopping. By cutting out all non-essential expenditures, you can redirect the money saved toward critical living costs.

Many service providers, from utilities to ISPs, are willing to offer flexible payment plans or temporary reductions for individuals facing financial hardship. Contact these companies directly and explain your situation.

Landlords may also be willing to negotiate, particularly if you're at risk of eviction. Depending on your location, there may be legal protections against eviction for those who are unemployed. Negotiating can buy you time, reduce your financial burden, and prevent essential services from being cut off.

If you are carrying debt, reach out to creditors to explore options for deferring payments, reducing interest rates, or restructuring your debt. Some creditors offer hardship programs designed for individuals going through periods of unemployment or financial crisis.

If deferring payments isn't an option, focus on making minimum payments to avoid additional late fees or damage to your credit score. Although debt can be stressful, your basic needs, such as housing and food, should take precedence over aggressive debt repayment during this time.

There are a variety of emergency assistance programs available, designed to help you cover essential costs like food, housing, and utilities when you cannot do so on your own.

Several government programs offer financial assistance to those who are unemployed and struggling. Unemployment insurance provides temporary income to eligible individuals who lost their jobs through no fault of their own, and can be applied for through your state's Department of Labor.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program helps low-income individuals and families purchase groceries, while Temporary Assistance for Needy Families provides cash assistance for basic living expenses. For healthcare, Medicaid offers free or low-cost coverage to qualifying individuals based on income. Research what programs you qualify for and apply as soon as possible. These programs can provide the financial lifeline you need to get through the toughest months of unemployment.

In addition to government assistance, many charitable organizations provide food, housing assistance, and other resources to those in need. Local food banks can provide groceries, allowing you to cut food costs from your budget while still ensuring you and your family are fed.

Non-profit organizations often offer rental assistance, emergency housing, and utility support. Religious organizations may also provide financial aid or community support. These resources are usually available at little to no cost and can offer significant relief.

Even with reduced expenses and assistance programs, there may still be a gap between your needs and available resources. You can earn money quickly through these temporary measures:

Look around your home for items you no longer need or use that can be sold, such as electronics, furniture, appliances, or even clothing. Use platforms like eBay, Craigslist, or Facebook Marketplace to post these items for sale.

While this isn't a long-term solution, it can provide the funds needed to cover a bill or buy groceries. Even small sales can add up and provide some breathing room in your budget.

If selling items isn't enough, you might consider short-term borrowing. You can ask friends or family to lend you cash, but be sure to communicate clearly about repayment terms to avoid straining personal relationships.

You may also consider taking out a personal loan from a credit union. However, be cautious with payday loans or other high-interest borrowing options, as these can trap you in a cycle of debt that's difficult to escape.

The gig economy offers numerous opportunities to earn an income without the need for long-term commitment. Apps like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, TaskRabbit, and Upwork allow you to take on freelance work, driving, or small tasks that can bring in money quickly.

Many of these jobs offer flexibility, allowing you to work as much or as little as you need. While gig work may not provide the stability of a full-time job, it can be a useful short-term strategy to cover your essential expenses during this period.

After stabilizing your immediate financial situation, the next step is to focus on building a strong foundation for long-term financial health. This involves not only finding a sustainable income but also creating a financial safety net and developing better financial habits. By addressing these three critical areas, you'll be better prepared to weather future financial challenges and steadily build wealth.

Securing stable employment is a crucial part of moving forward financially. Be strategic and persistent in your job hunt. Reach out to former colleagues, connect with industry groups, and engage on professional platforms like LinkedIn. Remember to tailor your resume for specific roles and focus on sectors that align with your goals.

You may also use this period of unemployment as an opportunity to reassess your career path and identify ways to enhance your job prospects. Instead of rushing to accept any available job, think about how you can increase your skills and qualifications to align with industries that offer better job security and growth potential.

After you've landed a stable job, your next priority is building a financial safety net. This will protect you from future emergencies and give you peace of mind knowing you have a buffer to fall back on in times of crisis.

Establish an emergency fund and aim to save three to six months' worth of living expenses to cover unforeseen situations like job loss, medical emergencies, or major car repairs. Building this fund may take a while, but even small, regular contributions can grow significantly over time. Automate your savings to ensure consistency, with a portion of each paycheck regularly transferred into a separate savings account.

If you incurred debt during unemployment, managing and reducing it is key to improving your financial standing. Prioritize paying off high-interest debt first, such as credit cards, as these can quickly spiral if left unchecked. Once your debts are under control, your available income can be directed toward savings and investments, allowing you to focus on long-term financial growth.

This will ensure you don't fall into financial crisis again. For example, budgeting is the foundation of good financial management. There are several tools and apps that simplify the budgeting process and allow you to track your spending more efficiently.

Aside from short-term budgeting, think about the bigger financial picture. Set concrete goals such as saving for retirement, buying a home, building a business, or investing for future growth. For instance, if your employer offers a retirement plan, contribute as much as possible, particularly if they provide matching contributions. You may also consider investing in low-risk, diversified options like index funds or ETFs.

Even modest, consistent investments can benefit from compound interest, significantly increasing your wealth in the long run. Or if you have an entrepreneurial spirit, there are ways to start a business with zero capital. Whatever you decide, remember that your investment strategy should align with your goals and risk tolerance to ensure that you're building a secure financial future.

The struggle of unemployment and financial hardship can be overwhelming. However, by making timely interventions to cut expenses, access emergency resources, and generate quick cash, you can alleviate some of the pressure and maintain control over your financial situation. Remember to remain proactive and seek help when needed. Financial recovery is possible, and by taking it one step at a time, you can move toward a brighter future."
September Jobs Report Obliterates Experts' Projections,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliamdur/2024/10/04/september-jobs-report-obliterates-experts-projections/,2024-10-04T18:01:30Z,"The American job market continues to forge ahead under a head of steam, forcing even the most cautious prognosticators to ask if it's really that good. Well, truth is, it's better than that.

Once again, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly Jobs Report astonished economists and market observers by revealing that 254,000 jobs were created last month, blowing away predictions of 140,000, while the unemployment rate ticked down from 4.2% to 4.1%. For the 45 consecutive month, the job market outperformed expectations, continued the most robust expansion in history, and even defied possible disruptions usually associated with election year jitters and shenanigans. In short, the American job market is a beautiful thing.

And as usual, it's not limited to the veneer of jobs created and unemployment rate. A look under the hood shows us the following:

While all this is going on, wages continued rising and are now 4.0% above the level 12 month ago. This is not the only good news for the wage earner. At the same time, inflation has cooled to a very manageable 2.5%. The typical worker, then, is up 1.5% over inflation, although that's little consolation after a trip to the supermarket. In other words, had it not been for the rock-solid job market we've come to rely upon, this would be a different conversation.

In sum, the current job market is a sturdy structure, not susceptible to erosion or collapse. In large part, that's due to to smart initiatives like the American Relief Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, smart fiscal policy on the Fed's part, continued enrollment growth in the Affordable Care Act, and - intangible but undeniable - overall confidence on everyone's part."
The U.S. saw stunningly strong growth in jobs last month. Here's what to know,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140039/labor-market-jobs-economy-interest-rates,2024-10-04T17:19:53Z,"U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs in September -- more than forecasters had expected. Gains for July and August were also revised upward. Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images/Getty Images hide caption

As far as economic data goes, it was a bit of a stunner.

Economists had expected U.S. employers to have added about 150,000 jobs in September. Instead, they created more than a quarter-million jobs last month, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, according to a report Friday from the Labor Department.

Here are five things to know about Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report.

In total, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs in September. Restaurants, retailers and construction companies all added jobs at a healthy pace.

In addition, employment gains for July and August were revised upwards by a total of 72,000 jobs. That means that, on average, employers have added 186,000 jobs in each of the last three months.

While that's a slowdown from the first three months of the year, when employers added an average of 267,000 jobs a month, it's still a solid pace.

A separate report earlier this week also showed the number of job openings increased slightly in August to 8 million.

But not all industries are enjoying a boom. Manufacturing has been in a slump for most of the last two years. Factories cut 7,000 jobs in September, although factory employment is still higher than it was just before the pandemic, by 137,000 jobs. Most of September's job cuts were in the auto industry.

A survey of factory managers released this week by the Institute for Supply Management shows manufacturers are still struggling with high interest rates and uncertainty about the upcoming presidential election.

By contrast, another ISM survey shows continued growth in the much-larger services side of the economy -- things like restaurants and car repair.

In order to keep adding jobs, employers need workers. Fortunately, the U.S. labor force continues to grow.

Friday's report shows 150,000 people joined or re-joined the workforce last month. Much of this growth is driven by immigration. The foreign-born workforce has grown rapidly over the last year, adding 1.4 million workers, while the native-born workforce shrank by nearly 600,000 workers.

Were it not for immigrant workers, job growth might well have stalled. The decline of the native-born workforce is primarily the result of baby boomers retiring. By contrast, the share of people in their prime working years (25 to 54) is near an all-time high.

Average wages in September were up 4% from a year ago. That's likely more than enough to outpace rising prices, giving workers a real boost in their purchasing power.

Inflation data for September won't be released until next week, but in recent months, prices have been climbing at a modest pace -- 2.5% for the 12 months ending in August. In fact, wage gains have exceeded price hikes for fifteen months and September's increase probably extended that trend.

The Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates last month with an aggressive half-a-percentage-point move, signaling a turning point in its years-long battle against inflation.

But Fed chairman Jerome Powell says he and his colleagues may move more cautiously in the future, cutting rates by a quarter point at a time.

""This is not a committee that feels like it's in a hurry,"" Powell said Monday.

Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report is likely to reinforce that patient approach. According to CME's FedWatch tool, odds of a quarter-point rate cut at the next Fed meeting rose to nearly 95% after the jobs report was released, from 68% the day before.

Fed policymakers will get one more monthly jobs report before their next scheduled meeting in early November."
"With Robust Hiring In September, Here's What Lies Ahead For Job Seekers In October And November",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/10/04/with-robust-hiring-in-september-heres-what-lies-ahead-for-job-seekers-in-october-and-november/,2024-10-04T16:28:16Z,"The job market in September showed remarkable strength as the United States economy added 254,000 new jobs last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday.

Hiring lived up to the hype of the ""September surge,"" as the government data outpaced the Dow Jones consensus forecast of 150,000. Employment continued to rise in sectors such as food services and drinking establishments, healthcare, government, social assistance and construction, while unemployment fell to 4.1%.

August's total was adjusted upward by 17,000, while July experienced a significant increase of 55,000, bringing the overall monthly growth to 144,000.

Adding to the positive momentum, the Federal Reserve is anticipated to implement another interest rate reduction on November 7, following an initial cut on September 18.

Market projections suggest a 0.25% decrease in interest rates, bringing them to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. However, there's a possibility of a more substantial 0.5% cut, contingent on the economic data released in the upcoming weeks.

Looking ahead, this buoyant hiring mood could continue into the coming months, potentially leading to further job growth. Although, challenges remain for job seekers, as competition for positions may intensify.

As October and early November roll in, job hunters find themselves in a prime window of opportunity, with many companies generally eager to fill positions before the holiday season commences.

Historically, this period often sees an uptick in hiring activity as businesses look to maximize their remaining budgets before year-end. The fall hiring season typically parallels the busy recruitment cycle of January and February, which are peak months for interviews as staff return from vacations, according to Indeed.

However, candidates must act swiftly, as this productive phase is fleeting, with a slowdown expected to take hold around Thanksgiving.

Moreover, the current economic climate has introduced some uncertainty to this hiring pattern. Job growth has been slowing overall, with the economy adding fewer monthly jobs compared to the previous years.

The average monthly gain over the past 12 months is 203,000, down from 251,000 in 2023, 377,000 in 2022 and 604,000 in 2021, according to BLS.

Job seekers should approach this period with realistic and flexible expectations, as well as a well-prepared strategy -- such as networking -- to maximize their chances of success. With fewer job openings, competition may be fiercer.

Certain sectors may still see increased hiring activity. Industries directly affected by the holiday season, such as retail and hospitality, often ramp up seasonal hiring during this period.

Amazon announced on Wednesday its plans to hire 250,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal roles across its customer fulfillment and transportation operations in the U.S."
China's 30% Stock Rally Has An Economic Problem,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2024/10/04/chinas-30-stock-rally-has-an-economic-problem/,2024-10-04T15:42:59Z,"The bulls charging through Shanghai are beginning to look over their shoulders.

Gaining on them is economic reality that has many wondering if the more than 30% surge in equities from a September low is overdone. The problem is an underlying economy facing intensifying headwinds. And one failing to keep pace with the sudden surge in investor optimism toward China.

This stock rally follows an extraordinary barrage of moves to cut interest rates, slash mortgage rates, relax rules for homebuyers in major cities and lower the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping is hinting at bigger steps to come to boost national growth.

These maneuvers changed the subject from China's deflation-generating property crisis, high youth unemployment and weak consumer demand.

Not for long, though, as Chinese data suggest more trouble ahead. In August, industrial industry profits plunged 17.8% from a year earlier, the sharpest contraction so far in 2024. Other data on retail sales and fixed asset investment add to worries Asia's biggest economy is slowing anew.

So much so that some economists think Xi's Communist Party should issue about 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) in special debt to lift confidence via infrastructure projects. Count Jia Kang, head of private think tank China Academy of New Supply-Side Economics, among them.

""As these projects get underway, they will create jobs, increase income for citizens, and unlock consumption potential,"" says Jia, the former head of a research institute linked to the Ministry of Finance, told Chinese publication The Paper.

In other words, what Team Xi has done to date isn't gaining the traction economists hoped. One problem is that China is doing more to throw money at the forces generating deflation than implementing policies to reverse them.

Hence concerns that the stock surge is racing ahead of concrete efforts to raise China's economic game. Or even to meet this year's 5% growth target in credible ways.

It's a reminder that China needs to treat the underlying causes of its economic slump, not just the symptoms. It was those causes that had Chinese shares plunging two weeks ago. That selloff reflected concerns the economy is stumbling.

Yet even as the bulls charge again, those concerns remain real.

In an op-ed for news organization Project Syndicate, Chinese economist Yu Yongding argues ""it's fair to say that China's 'economic miracle' of maintaining an average annual growth rate of 10% is over. Still, I believe that with wise macroeconomic policy, market-oriented reforms, and a genuine commitment to opening up its economy, the economy should be able to maintain a solid growth rate of 5-6% for the foreseeable future.""

Yu was on the Chinese central bank's monetary committee. Now, he's on the frontlines of another epochal debate.

""Chinese economists have debated for years whether policymakers should adopt more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate GDP growth, or focus instead on structural reforms aimed at eliminating overcapacity,"" Yu argues. ""But given this year's lackluster economic performance, their views are increasingly aligned. In fact, one could even say that all Chinese economists now advocate expansionary measures.""

Even more important, though, are steps to end the property crisis once and for all. Lessons from Japan abound. In the 1990s, Tokyo acted glacially to get bad loans off banks' balance sheets, paving the way for 25 years of deflation.

Japan comparisons only go so far with China. But the slow pace of stabilizing a property sector pivotal to gross domestic product has helped no one in China. It's the biggest cause of Chinese deflation.

Xi's inner circle has been slow to get bad assets off property developers' balance sheets. It's lacked urgency to address China's fast-aging population and catalyze a bigger, more disruptive startup boom. It's been too slow for comfort to build social safety nets to encourage households to save less and spend more.

Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's Analytics, can't help but think back to a market mini-crash that happened nine years ago. Recent data suggest Chinese officials aren't recalling the lessons from Tokyo's lost decade.

""Outside of the pandemic, this is the lowest it has been since the 2015 stock market crash,"" Cruise says. ""With the domestic economy struggling, deflation fears are elevated.""

The 2015 crash still traumatizes Xi's party. In a three-week period, from July to August 2015, Chinese shares plunged 30%. At the time, China Inc. circled the wagons. Xi's party pumped tidal waves of state funds into markets, scrapped all initial public offerings, suspended trading in thousands of companies and let mainlanders pledge homes as collateral to buy shares.

Yet then, as now, Beijing did more to address symptoms than the underlying causes. The more the bulls catch on, the more Chinese stocks may be vulnerable to a big correction."
Job Market Strong in September - Will It Slow Fed Rate Cuts?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/harryholzer/2024/10/04/job-market-strong-in-septemberwill-it-slow-fed-rate-cuts/,2024-10-04T14:34:24Z,"The jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for September was considerably stronger than expected.

Economists had been predicting payroll growth of 140-150,000 jobs; instead, payrolls rose by 254,000. The estimates for July and August were revised up substantially; the average for the last 3 months is now 185,000, which is considerably higher than earlier estimates. The strongest growth was in eating and drinking places, where employment rose by a very robust 69,000 jobs.

Wage growth has also been more robust than in previous months. Combining August and September, monthly wages have risen by about 5% (on an annualized basis). And, from the household survey, the employment rate out of the population grew by .2 percentage points (60.0 to 60.2%), while the unemployment rate fell - especially among high school dropouts and Hispanic workers.

It would probably be a mistake to read too much into this, or any other report, that covers just a single month. The monthly employment statistics tend to bounce around, and 3-6 month averages present a more informative picture. Also, other measures like the job vacancy rate (which held steady at 4.8 percent in August), suggest a steadier labor market. And another reading in the coming weeks on productivity will also be important - since the relative strong productivity growth (above 2 percent) over the past year and a half suggest we can live with wage growth of 4 percent or higher.

Still, the large bump in payrolls in September, combined with upward revisions for July and August as well as more robust wage growth, suggest that the job market weakness we had detected in the late spring and summer months might have been a bit overstated, or perhaps a more temporary lull than we thought. The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point earlier this month, indicating its concern about a slowing economy. The current data might cause it to slow down further rate reductions a bit, until we get a clearer picture of where the job market is really heading."
Strong September Jobs Report Reduces Recession Fears,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/10/04/strong-september-jobs-report-reduces-recession-fears/,2024-10-04T14:03:49Z,"The September jobs report was stronger than expected and is likely to assuage recession risks and fears, driving up hopes for ""soft landing"" or ""no landing"" economic scenarios. This report is likely to reduce the chances that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 0.5% on November 7, but the recent trend of slowing payrolls is still supportive of a 0.25% rate cut. An uncertain presidential election outcome could still push the Fed to cut rates by 0.5%.

The Employment Situation report, known to economists and analysts as the jobs report, was strong for September. It showed a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, strong net payroll gains of 254,000, and strong upward revisions to payrolls by 72,000 for the previous two months. This was a much stronger report than economists and analysts had been forecasting, and it reduces the perceived downside risks to the U.S. labor market and economy.

While the jobs report supports the claim that the U.S. labor market is relatively solid, other recent data also reinforce this notion. After all, initial and continuing jobless claims are very low. Continuing claims are at 1.826 million, which is only around 1.1 percent of the labor force. Initial Jobless Claims are also very low, at just 225,000.

Strong Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data showed that there were over 8 million open jobs in August 2024. While this is around 4.2 million fewer open jobs than the U.S. historic high in March 2022 of 12.2 million, 8 million is still around 1 million more open jobs than before the COVID pandemic. With over 6 million more open jobs than people collecting unemployment, it is difficult to expect very large net payroll losses across multiple months anytime soon.

The Fed has a dual mandate to support full employment and keep inflation rates low and stable. The September jobs report, August JOLTS data, and recent weekly jobless claims reflect full employment in the U.S. labor market, but consumer prices are not yet low and stable - or at least not yet at the Fed's 2% inflation target. The combination of above-target inflation and a solid labor market could incentivize the Fed to cut interest rates by only 0.25% rather than 0.5% in its next policy decision on November 7.

Of course, we don't yet have September inflation data, and there is also a U.S. election to contend with before the next Fed meeting.

The September CPI and PCE reports will be critical for the November 7 Fed decision. Year-on-year inflation rates are likely to have made more progress toward 2% in September, and Prestige Economics is forecasting year-on-year September total CPI to be 2.4%, with core CPI at 3.1%. However, it may be the November election outcome - or uncertainty about that outcome by November 7 - that could push the Fed to cut rates by 0.5%

A strong September employment report with payrolls well above August levels and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1% is a signal that the Fed can take its time with rate cuts, which is likely to support the greenback and bond yields. Additionally, this solid report could still have positive impacts on equities, oil prices, and industrial metals prices because it assuages concerns about recession."
Is It A Goldilocks Economy?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/04/is-it-a-goldilocks-economy/,2024-10-04T13:06:32Z,"Temporary Strike Resolution Offers Short-Term Relief For Impacted Industries

Stocks were relatively quiet on Thursday as markets awaited this morning's employment situation report. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was flat. Small cap stocks were the biggest movers for the day, falling over 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%.

This morning, the Labor Department released the latest employment report. Forecasts were calling for 147 thousand new jobs and an unchanged unemployment rate of 4.2%. The actual numbers were 254 thousand new jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. We also saw upward revisions for both July and August, suggesting the economy continues to show strength. We'll get the latest Consumer Price Index late next week and a chance to see if prices are continuing on their trajectory of moderating. Thus far though, the net effect of recent data implies an economy continuing on target for a soft landing. However, there is one potential caveat to that, oil.

On Thursday, oil was up over 5% as the world awaits Israel's response to Iran's missile attack earlier in the week. For the week, crude oil prices are up nearly 10% and that is something with the potential to upset the progress made vis-a-vis inflation. If there is one commodity that has the potential to jumpstart inflation, it is oil. Therefore, in addition to both the humanitarian and geopolitical repercussions, there is the potential for economic upheaval as well. The 200-day moving average for crude oil is right around $75 and that is a level I'll be watching. A close above that could be bullish for those who are long but bearish for inflation.

The other big story on Thursday was the temporary end to the strike at ports along the East Coast. Employers offered workers a pay increase of 62% spread out over six years. The International Longshoremen's Association and port operators said this agreement will last until late January as the two sides work on a long-term deal. One of the main sticking points in the negotiations is automation and how that will impact jobs. Seeing as how the strike lasted just three days, any economic impact was likely muted. However, this is an issue we may hear about again come early next year. In the meantime, we're seeing some of the companies that could have been negatively impacted by a prolonged strike trading higher in premarket activity. Shares of Walmart are up 0.5% along with Target, which is trading higher by nearly 1%.

For today, I'm keeping an eye on how the jobs data report is spun and oil. The market's initial reaction to the jobs number has been bullish. Index futures jumped when the report was released. Heading into this morning's report, sentiment was largely in the camp that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by a quarter point when they meet in November. Expectations for that quarter point cut were relatively unchanged after the employment number was released. One other thing I'll be watching today is the VIX. Last Friday, volatility increased right near the end of the day. I believe that was largely due to the situation in the Middle East and investor concern about the potential for increased hostilities over the weekend. Given the state of affairs as of Friday morning, I would not be surprised if we saw a similar situation today. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
The Latest Employment Numbers And The Presidential Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2024/10/04/the-latest-employment-numbers-and-the-presidential-election/,2024-10-04T12:44:31Z,"The Employment Situation Report for the month of September was released this morning. It showed what everyone expected: very little change in the unemployment rate. At 4.1%, it was actually slightly lower than that for August (4.2%). One open question was the impact of Hurricane Francine on jobs, but ""Our analysis suggests that Hurricane Francine had no discernible effect on national payroll employment, hours, and earnings from the establishment survey, or the national unemployment rate from the household survey.""

As important as these releases are in normal times, they take on extra significance in the lead up to an election. In fact, experts claim that the economy is particularly important to voters this year. It has consequently been a running theme for both parties, with Democrats focusing on low unemployment and robust growth and Republicans on the recent spike in inflation.

What's curious about this campaign is the fact that the Democrats are having to scramble to defend themselves. You'd think that theirs was the high ground given that:

Meanwhile, though it is true that inflation accelerated temporarily, there is little question that this was related to factors outside of the US and has calmed down considerably.

Despite this, however, voters have a very dim -- and flawed -- view of the state of the economy:

""Nearly everything Americans believe about the economy is wrong, according to a recent Harris-Guardian poll...The poll, conducted earlier this month, found that perceptions of the U.S. economy are often at odds with reality. For instance, most Americans (55 percent) think the economy is shrinking, with about the same share saying we're in a recession.""

Unfortunately for the Democrats, perceptions are more important than reality in situations like this.

There are three more key indicator announcements before the November 5th election:

If any of these is out of line with what we have been experiencing of late, it could have an impact on voters.

That said, economists do not expect any significant deviation from our current low unemployment, solid GDP growth, and moderating inflation. Even if the dockworkers' strike (now resolved) and recent flooding were to raise prices, the October 10 CPI announcement only covers September. It simply wouldn't show up yet.

What this suggests is that the releases will include very little new information and both parties will simply recycle their earlier talking points. If the outcome is going to be affected by the state of the economy, it is going to be because one party did a better job of spinning than the other. And while there is evidence that Kamala Harris' economic message may be gaining ground on Donald Trump's, a lot can happen in a month.

Everyone will be watching these numbers closely."
MEDIOCRE JOB GROWTH REPORTS BELIE MAJOR PROBLEMS AHEAD FOR US ECONOMY,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2024/10/03/mediocre-job-growth-reports-belie-major-problems-ahead-for-us-economy/,2024-10-04T01:40:11Z,"The September job report (10/4 @8:30am) is expected to show 150,000 new (non farm) jobs and an unchanged 4.2% unemployment rate. These numbers are not overwhelming, but neither are they disastrous. Importantly, anything close (or even weaker) will be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to proceed with continued interest rate cuts. This is key to further market advancement.

But the jobs reports, thus far, in 2024 are not signaling the massive problems on the horizon. As a population, we are an old country and getting older. Moreover, we are not creating jobs like we used to and have resorted to outsourcing many jobs that we could keep ""in house"". Further, we have lately resorted to a propensity to create ""non productive"" jobs to maintain employment. For example, over the past 5 years, the United States created 350,000 MORE jobs in government, social services and healthcare than overall total jobs created.

It should come as no surprise that the US has long since lost its competitive edge in manufacturing. However, our job growth is now dependent on aging baby boomers with many refusing to retire. This may be due to economic necessity or desire to keep active, but eventually, the issue becomes moot. Sooner or later they leave the workforce. Many individuals will no longer contribute wealth to our society and will become an added burden to limited support and services.

Surprisingly, in a close election year, marked by animus from one political party to the next, the economic news has taken a back seat to other issues deemed more worrisome. It shouldn't. Current economic issues, the direction of job growth and the inevitable, irreversible decline in the US workforce, should take center stage. The next four years will be critical to the economic direction of the US economy. In the absence of a visionary change in direction, economic retooling, incentives and policy changes, our overall economy is headed for a vicious downward cycle.

There are some key fundamental demographics which are not going away. Ever. The US has an aging workforce with 75m baby boomers. Notably, by the year 2030 the number of Americans who are 65+ will exceed 20%, almost doubling the level in the year 2000. Each year, more than 4m Americans are eligible to retire. This will continue for the foreseeable future and have a profound impact on the size of the civilian labor force, the employed population ratio, and the unemployment rate. To place these numbers in perspective, one needs to understand that in the past 5 years, only 3m new jobs were created. There are currently 40m+ Americans who are 65-75 and in the next 6 years another 25m will join them. Approximately 1/3 of them work (up for 1/4 10 years ago). This implies that within the next 5 to 10 years, the US can expect 20m+ retirements. Given the current level of 161m employed Americans, on a civilian non institutional population base rate of 268m, the employed population ratio could plummet from 60% to 50%. In other words, in only 5 to 10 years, the US could be in a situation in which 1/2 the civilian non institutional population (above 16, non military, not in jail or nursing home) would not be working.

Compounding the problem is that the US has added to taken a leadership role in outsourcing talent -- notably to Eastern Europe and India for technical IT support and Philippines and Viet Nam for bookkeeping and accounting support. Millions of jobs, both high and low wage jobs are being sent overseas.

Meanwhile, the job growth in the US has come from 3 key areas: HealthCare, Government, Social Assistance. In fact, over the past 20 years, 2/3 of the new jobs from these areas and in the past 5 years, more than 3.5m jobs were created in government, health care and social services than overall jobs!

Given the aging population, the trend in healthcare will clearly continue. Moreover, the demand for social services will likely also continue to rise as additional illegal immigrants enter the country.

Is there a solution to avoid this impending doom? Possibly, but we would need immediate corrective actions. Unfortunately, job growth, and in particular, long-term job creation has not received the attention that it requires. Minor tweaks are being made to extend retirement age among some workers from 65 to 67, but this does not address the larger issue that will happen within 5 to 10 years.

Policies need to be implemented to create economic incentives for companies to keep jobs in America and bring other jobs back home. Along these lines, tough policies regarding minimum wages need to be considered in the context of not forcing employers to shut down, move or outsource talent. America also needs to grow it's educated work force, especially among young people. Simple solutions, such as keeping foreign college students in our country longer, might go a long way to helping resolve this developing crisis.

Finally, the US cannot continue to create jobs primarily in government, social services and health care. Jobs that help reduce global balance of payment deficits are required for long term economic growth. This cannot happen with governmental or social service jobs. As part of this action, governmental policy regarding the increased cost of millions of illegal aliens entering our cities needs to be addressed.

The forthcoming jobs reports for the next few months will likely continue without major surprise. But it is just a matter of time before baby boomer retirements kick in. At that point, it will become clearer that the US has major problems ahead. Hopefully, our future policy makers will make these issues a top priority. The growth of our economy and the future for our children depend on it."
From Layoffs To Love Lost: Why Job Loss Can Lead To Divorce And How To Avoid It,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethpearson/2024/10/03/from-layoffs-to-love-lost-why-job-loss-can-lead-to-divorce-and-how-to-avoid-it/,2024-10-03T22:09:06Z,"You've likely seen the headlines about looming job cuts, which are leading to 70% of US workers to proactively prepare for the potential layoffs, according to a recent survey. And while it's obvious that losing your job can be stressful, what you may not realize is that job loss is ranked as one of life's most challenging experiences, so much so that some studies report losing a job can be more stressful than getting a divorce or even receiving a long-term illness diagnosis.

Beyond the financial impact of getting laid off, it can take a serious toll on emotional health, self-worth, and even personal relationships. For those who've experienced a recent layoff, it'll come as no surprise that it can affect your relationship -- what is less talked about is that job loss is linked to increased rates of divorce. This correlation is complex to say the least and involves a mix of financial, emotional, and identity-related factors that create strain on a relationship, often in ways that may act as a knock-out blow to your marriage, partnership, or romantic relationship.

For women, who juggle multiple responsibilities and face societal expectations around being a source of nurturing-stability, the impact of job loss can be feel even more intense. The last thing you want to after you've lost your job is to lose your support system too, so let's break down why it feels so apocalyptic when you get axed and what you can do to safeguard your marriage, or partnership, in the wake of its wrath.

While experiencing the end of a marriage is incredibly difficult, studies have shown that individuals tend to eventually return to their previous level of well-being after such event. If you really think about it, divorce often provides some level of closure, allowing those involved to eventually heal and move on. However, the emotional and psychological impact of losing your job may linger inevitability, and can feel even more overwhelming if you're in a specialized field or had a high-level role, which on average have fewer opportunities and take significantly longer to replace.

The uncertainty around job loss is what makes it so hard for couples to deal with. It can create a prolonged period of feeling ""stuckness,"" with no clear end in sight. So, unlike a breakup or divorce, where you may regain a sense of autonomy and direction, the helplessness that can come from searching for a new job creates an ongoing sense of instability. It's that uncertainty which causes tension and could lead to the employed partner resenting the unemployed partner for not contributing financially -- which could trigger feelings of worthlessness or failure, adding further strain on the relationship.

Set Realistic Expectations Together: Sit down with your partner to discuss a plan. Setting realistic expectations around the job search timeline, budget adjustments, and how to support each other can alleviate the anxiety of uncertainty. Aligning your expectations will help you both navigate this period without placing undue pressure on your relationship.

One of the most obvious effects of losing a job is the financial strain that comes with it, and the loss of one income can lead to an immediate sense of imbalance. When bills pile up and expenses outweigh income, a scarcity mindset can lead to arguments, resentment, and fear. Then, once that financial foundation begins to crack, it's easy for both partners to start blaming one another and when that happens, you're no longer trying to solve the problem as a team, but rather turning on one another and intensifying the tension and panic.

It may be no surprise then that debt and financial stress are of the most cited reasons for divorce, with research finding that 54% of people believe them to be valid to consider divorce -- and job loss can amplify it tenfold. The pressure to ""make ends meet"" can quickly turn into tension and conflict, with both partners feeling unsupported or misunderstood.

Create a New Financial Plan Together: Review your finances and create a new budget that reflects your current reality. Openly discussing finances can help prevent misunderstandings and resentment. This also allows you both to find ways to cut costs and avoid debt, reducing financial stress and strengthening your bond. If you have a financial advisor/planner, it's a great idea to get with them and get a true understanding on if there's any immediate need to panic, or if you have some time before you need avoid Amazon and Target like the plague.

A job is much more than a paycheck -- it often provides a sense of identity, self-worth, and purpose. For many, career success is closely tied to feelings of confidence, respect, and stability. When you lose your job, you may feel like you've lost an essential part of yourself. This is especially true in our society which places such a high value on productivity and professional achievement.

For women, whose identities are often interwoven with various roles -- professional, caregiver, partner -- job loss can feel like a personal failure, even if the circumstances were beyond their control. The loss of a job can trigger deep emotional responses, including shame, anxiety, and depression, all of which can negatively affect relationships. Some signs you might be struggling include becoming withdrawn, irritable, or overly dependent on your partner for validation. The resulting emotional strain can create distance, making it harder for your partner to connect with you. Over time, the disconnect can widen, leading to feelings of isolation and dissatisfaction for both partners.

Reconnect with Your Identity Outside of Work: To preserve your sense of self-worth, invest time in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of your career. Whether it's taking up a hobby, volunteering, or spending time with friends, these pursuits can help you maintain a sense of identity and purpose, reducing the emotional toll of job loss.

Communicate Openly with Your Partner: Share your feelings about the job loss with your partner, including any fears or insecurities you have. Being vulnerable can foster empathy and understanding, helping to maintain emotional intimacy and ensuring your partner knows how to support you.

While losing your job can feel like a crisis, certain factors can help alleviate the stress and mitigate the risk of damaging your relationship. Understanding what might help can be the key to surviving this challenging period together.

Support from Family and Friends: Having a strong support network can make a significant difference and leaning on them can help reduce the pressure on your relationship by not relying solely on your partner for comfort.

Living in an Area with High Unemployment: This may sound counterintuitive, but if unemployment is high in your area, it can normalize your experience and reduce feelings of shame or inadequacy. The shared experience can help you feel less isolated and reassure both you and your partner that the situation is not a reflection of your abilities or worth.

Having an Extroverted Personality: Extroverted individuals tend to reach out for help and support more readily, which can be a crucial asset when dealing with job loss. If you're naturally inclined to seek out social connections, it can help you stay positive and motivated. For those who are more introverted, making an intentional effort to connect with others can provide similar benefits.

The loss of a job is undoubtedly a significant stressor, but it doesn't have to lead to the end of your relationship. By being proactive, communicating openly, and making decisions together, you and your partner can navigate this difficult time as a team. Remember, your worth is not determined by your employment status, and your relationship can thrive even in the face of financial or emotional challenges."
Highest-Paying Jobs Without A Degree In 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/student-resources/highest-paying-jobs-without-a-degree/,2024-10-03T17:38:28Z,"Wages for jobs that don't require a degree vary by location and demographics.

You don't have to graduate from college to get a job that pays well. While wages often rise based on educational attainment, workers can find many high-paying jobs that don't require a degree -- and some of those careers report six-figure median salaries.

It might seem like every high school grad heads to college these days, but the data shows that this isn't true. Nearly half of college-aged young adults aren't in school, and they find job opportunities in diverse industries such as the skilled trades, healthcare, tourism and more.

How much can you earn without a degree? And does completing some college change your job prospects, even if you don't graduate? Forbes Advisor digs into the numbers to find the highest-paying jobs without a degree--and the outlook for workers who opt out of college.

Did you know that more than half of Americans don't hold a college degree? That's according to 2022 educational attainment data from the U.S. Census Bureau. In fact, a high school diploma is the most common level of educational attainment, with 28% of adults falling into this category.

Similarly, most jobs don't require a college degree. But who are these workers without college degrees?

A majority of jobs in the U.S. don't require a college degree--and that should hold true in the future. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projections, 60% of new jobs created in the 2020s will be in fields that don't require a degree.

A majority of high school graduates head to college. In October 2023, 61.4% of recent high school grads attended an in-person or online college. However, a substantial number of young adults are not currently enrolled in school.

Recent high school graduates not enrolled in college in October 2023 were more than twice as likely to be in the labor force as graduates enrolled in college (71.7% versus 32.4%).

Not surprisingly, high school grads who decide not to attend college report a higher rate of employment than college students. However, the percentage of part-time college students who work is nearly as high as those not enrolled in college, with 68.9% in the workforce. High school dropouts report a significantly lower employment rate, with just 43.7% in the workforce.

The employment rate of 25- to 34-year-olds with a high school diploma but no college experience was 74% as of 2023, as reported by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).

When it comes to careers that don't require a degree, many workers benefit from some post-high school education. And employment data reflect that: adults who attend some college but don't earn a four-year degree have a higher employment rate.

In 2023, the median annual wage for workers with a high school diploma or the equivalent was $45,040 as of 2023.

Adults with a high school diploma who didn't attend college and those with some college but no degree earn a similar median pay. However, adults with a postsecondary credential such as a certificate or diploma earn slightly more, with a median pay of $47,740.

How many students drop out of college? A significant number of first-year college students leave without finishing their programs. College dropout statistics reveal the many reasons people choose to leave college.

Nearly one in four college students drops out, and that number has remained fairly consistent since 2017. Retention rates have risen since 2006-07, when 29% of first-time undergrads did not return for their second year.

College graduation rates typically measure the number of graduates over a six year period. Looking back at 2017, nearly three in ten students left school without a degree. Many of those students entered the workforce looking for jobs that don't require a degree.

How many adults fall into the category of ""some college, no credential""? The number might be higher than you think. Nearly 42 million Americans have taken college classes but left without finishing a degree, diploma or certificate.

As the college enrollment rate grows, so does the population of adults who leave college without a degree. According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center (NSCRC), the number of SCNC adults has grown in nearly every state, ballooning from 36 million in 2019 to nearly 42 million in 2024.

What stops college students from finishing their programs? The cost of college poses a major barrier for many students. Close to half of those who left college before graduation day point to finances as a driving reason.

Another significant share questioned whether college was the best path for their future. Careers that do not require a degree offer another way for these adults to enter the workforce.

You don't need a master's degree to earn a six-figure salary. In fact, several careers with six-figure median salaries don't require a degree at all.

What are the highest-paying jobs without a degree? The list includes some that you might guess, like a commercial airline pilot, and others that might surprise you, like a ship engineer.

Careers that don't require a degree may still entail specialized training. Some require postsecondary training, while many come with on-the-job training.

These are the 20 best-paying jobs without a degree according to the BLS.

You can work in some of the fastest-growing careers without a degree. The BLS projects a 2.8% average growth rate for all jobs in the U.S. over the 2022-32 decade; these 10 occupations will benefit from much faster employment growth according to BLS projections.

Some of these high-demand jobs without a degree may demand a certificate or diploma, and while you don't need a bachelor's degree, some require an associate degree.

How much does educational attainment matter in different parts of the country? When comparing rural vs. urban education statistics, the data indicates a lower educational attainment rate for rural areas, and yet these workers without a degree benefit from better rural jobs than their urban counterparts.

In rural areas, 34% of adults hold a high school diploma as their highest level of education, compared with 23% for urban areas. Similarly, while 37% of urban adults hold a bachelor's or higher, that number falls to 25% in rural areas.

Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce defines a ""good job"" as one that pays enough to achieve economic self-sufficiency, which is at least $43,000 a year for workers ages 25 to 44 and $55,000 for workers ages 45 to 64 (in 2022 dollars), with a median annual wage of around $82,000.

Jobs in urban areas often pay higher salaries than those in rural areas. However, that pattern does not hold for high school dropouts and those with a high school diploma who hold good-paying jobs. For those jobs, rural workers earn more than their urban counterparts, according to data from the Center of Education and the Workforce.

As of 2022, 45% of rural adults with less than a high school diploma were not in the labor force, as compared to 36% of urban adults with the same education level.

While rural adults who hold good jobs fare well in the workforce, nearly half of high school dropouts in rural areas do not work. That's 9% higher than their counterparts in cities.

When looking at well-paying jobs, researchers discovered that rural workers without a degree are more likely to hold these good jobs than urban workers with the same education level. In rural areas, 26% of adults with a high school diploma hold a good job, compared to 15% in urban areas.

Are there differences in job posting requirements by state? Some states report more jobs that don't require a degree, while others have fewer opportunities. However, a growing number of states are eliminating degree requirements for public sector jobs, reflecting a wider shift in the labor market.

While many public sector jobs require a college degree, states across the country have eliminated degree requirements in an effort to promote skills-based hiring. When comparing job posting requirements by state, the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) reported that at least 18 states have recently eliminated the degree requirement for most government jobs.

Those states include Maryland, California, Pennsylvania, Virginia and New Jersey. Many other states are considering changing job requirements through executive or legislative action.

More jobs require a college degree in Washington, D.C., home to the federal government, than other areas. In these locations, a lower share of jobs do not require a degree.

Which states have the most jobs that don't require a college degree or postsecondary training? Southern states like Louisiana and Arkansas make the list, along with Nevada, home to a multi-billion dollar tourism industry that provides many careers without a degree.

In 2023, the median high school diploma weekly earnings reached $899. But breaking down those workers by age, race and gender offers a more nuanced picture. For example, the average salary by age for high school graduates almost doubles for the lowest-paid and highest-paid age groups.

As high school graduates gain experience, their earning potential grows, with a peak in the top-earning years of 45 to 64. When looking at earnings by age, high school graduates also see a major jump when shifting from the 18 to 24 age range to 25 to 34 years old.

When comparing educational attainment by race, Asian Americans report the highest high school graduation rate, with 99% of Asian Americans graduating from high school. Hispanic Americans reported the lowest high school graduation rate, with 88% finishing high school.

Gender affects earning potential, and that's true for adults without a college degree. In fact, women who drop out of high school or graduate without going to college make around 20% less than men with the same education.

Men report a higher rate of labor force participation than women at all education levels, but the gap is larger for those at the lower education levels. While there's a 7.3% gap between men and women with a bachelor's or higher, that gap grows to 19.1% for high school graduates and 23.8% for high school dropouts.

For both high school dropouts and high school graduates, white women earn higher median salaries compared to other racial groups. Black and Hispanic women earn the lowest median salaries. The gap isn't large--white women with a high school diploma earn $57 more per week than Hispanic women with the same education--but it adds up.

Degree-seeking Americans benefit from many paths to reach their goals. The growing number of online programs can lower barriers to college attendance, as can the many colleges with high acceptance rates. Scholarships, grants and other forms of financial aid can make college more affordable, as can comparing schools based on total cost.

But college is not the only path to a successful career. Three in five new jobs created in the 2020s will not require a degree, and many of these careers offer strong job growth and high earning potential.

Our research on the highest-paying jobs without a degree indicates that the top 20 jobs by salary all report median annual wages of $75,000 or higher. That's significantly higher than the median annual wage for all occupations, which reached $48,060 in May 2023, according to BLS data. By seeking out careers in these higher-paying fields, adults without a degree can thrive."
How Financial Advisors Can Help Women In Business,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/financial-advisor/how-financial-advisors-can-help-women-in-business/,2024-10-03T17:38:23Z,"Content from Forbes Advisor Brand Group is presented as part of a paid partnership with our advertisers.

Women in business often face unique financial challenges that complicate their professional and personal finances. Persistent gender pay gaps, disparities in access to business funding, longer life expectancies and higher healthcare costs are just a few factors that can make financial planning more complex.

Navigating all these challenges can require a comprehensive approach to financial management, including tailored investing, early retirement planning, expert tax advice and robust contingency strategies for whatever life may throw at you. With women's labor force participation reaching new highs and a projected $30 trillion wealth transfer to women by the decade's end, it has never been more important to have a strong financial plan in place.

Financial advisors can offer valuable support and guidance in this process, providing personalized strategies to help you maximize your financial potential. Here are some key areas where working with a financial advisor can be particularly beneficial for women in business.

Success in the business world can often come with increased wealth and the opportunity to invest your hard-earned money. Sixty-seven percent of women are actively investing outside of their retirement accounts, a notable increase from previous years, according to survey data from Fidelity.

However, a few common barriers still keep some women from participating in the investment market. Only 33% of women report feeling confident about investing, and 69% wish they had started earlier.

Financial advisors can help demystify the investment process and provide tailored advice based on your specific financial objectives. This might include:

Beyond just guidance, studies show advisors can significantly improve investment outcomes. An analysis from Vanguard found that investors who worked with advisors saw an average net return 3% higher than those who didn't. Working with an experienced professional can give you a sense of confidence and peace of mind, knowing that your investment strategy is being guided by expert insights.

Planning for retirement and managing an estate can be particularly complex for women due to longer life expectancies, lifetime healthcare expenses that are a third higher than those of men and any potential lost earning opportunities due to career breaks.

Financial advisors can work with you to create a personalized retirement plan that includes diverse income streams such as 401(k)s, IRAs, Social Security benefits, pensions and personal savings. They can also assist with:

Estate planning can be equally important as it determines what happens to your assets after you die. Some advisors can help you:

Career transitions are becoming increasingly common due to several factors, including longer working lives, job market uncertainty and rapid technological advancements. A study by McKinsey predicts up to 12 million occupational shifts by 2030, with women being 1.5 times more likely than men to require job transitions.

Whether you're switching industries, getting a promotion or re-entering the workforce, career transitions usually involve significant financial changes that call for careful planning. Financial advisors can help navigate these changes by providing guidance on:

As you progress in your career, your income and tax situation may become more complex. Working with a financial advisor can help you navigate the ever-changing tax laws and find ways to minimize your overall tax burden. Some areas where advisors can provide helpful insights include:

Consider seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor specializing in tax planning, such as a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) or Certified Financial Planner (CFP®). Companies like Datalign provide access to an extensive network of vetted advisors and can recommend a suitable advisor who can help you navigate complex tax laws and make informed decisions about your financial future.

Starting a business can involve many crucial financial decisions, from choosing the right structure and managing cash flow to securing funding -- where financial missteps can be costly.

Financial advisors can work with you to:

Searching for the right financial advisor can detract from essential day-to-day operations. Datalign's online platform can simplify this process with its personal questionnaire and AI-matching algorithm to quickly connect you with a vetted financial advisor suited to your specific needs.

Deciding whether to work with a financial advisor depends on your individual needs and goals. If you have any concerns or questions, it may be worth considering bringing on a financial advisor to help guide you through the process. But keep in mind that working with a financial advisor is an investment and should be carefully considered.

Here are some key things to look for when choosing an advisor:

Datalign's AI-enhanced platform can help take a lot of the work in finding the right advisor for you by quickly connecting you with a pre-screened financial advisor tailored to your unique needs and goals. You can then schedule a complimentary introductory meeting with your matched advisor to see if they're a good fit."
Student Loan Help For Those Impacted By Hurricane Helene,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertfarrington/2024/10/03/student-loan-help-for-those-impacted-by-hurricane-helene/,2024-10-03T10:35:08Z,"With the federal student loan on-ramp over as of September 30, 2024, now is an awful time to be struggling with bills. The 12-month on-ramp period protected borrowers from the worst consequences of missed payments and defaulted loans, including potential damage to borrower's credit scores.

With this short-term fix for borrowers in the rearview mirror, this means those with late payments may soon see their credit scores drop and face other ramifications like wage garnishment and seizures of tax refunds.

Borrowers impacted by Hurricane Helene may find some relief when it comes to their student loan payments. If you are facing hardships caused by the hurricane, including displacement, a temporary loss of income, or an injury that left you unable to work, here's what your options may be.

According to Paul Dieken, who serves as Director of Financial Aid at Pomona College, current students pursuing a degree that have been impacted by the hurricane should contact their college financial aid office to see if they can appeal their offer of financial aid. Doing so may help them qualify for additional aid based on changes to their financial situation, and the school's financial aid office will likely offer assistance when it comes to the specifics of filing an appeal.

For those people who are in repayment on federal student loans, Dieken says they should contact their loan servicer and ask if they qualify for a disaster relief administrative forbearance.

According to the U.S. Department of Education, borrowers who live in a FEMA-designated disaster area may be able to qualify for a disaster relief administrative forbearance that postpones their loan payments for up to 90 days. Interest doesn't capitalize during this type of forbearance either, which means loan balances won't grow during the 90 days required payments are paused.

There are other types of forbearance for federal student loans to consider as well, including general forbearance. Borrowers can apply for a general forbearance with their loan servicer if they are facing financial complications, a job loss or loss in income, unexpected medical expenses, or other consequences of Hurricane Helene.

This type of forbearance works for Direct Loans, Federal Family Education (FFEL) Program loans, and Perkins Loans and generally lasts for up to 12 months at a time. Students can also request an extension of their general forbearance if their situation hasn't improved. However, a cumulative limit of three years applies for all months spent in general forbearance.

According to Studentaid.gov, deferment of federal student loans is another option to consider. Deferment can be a better choice since some loans (specifically subsidized student loans) do not accrue interest during deferment, whereas interest accrues during general forbearance periods.

The U.S. Department of Education lists a range of situations when deferment could apply, and one of them is ""experiencing economic hardship."" Deferment can also be achieved during periods of unemployment.

Note that you'll have to submit documentation and proof to qualify for deferment or forbearance with federal student loans. In either scenario, you'll start the process by reaching out to your loan servicer to find out how to apply and which documents you need to subit.

People who are in repayment on a private student loan should contact their lender to find out what options are available.

""Private lenders may offer their own forbearance plans, but each lender will be different, so borrowers will need to contact them to find out what is available,"" says Dieken.

For example, private student loan lender Laurel Road offers general forbearance options for economic hardship, which could apply after a major hurricane. Laurel Road doesn't share much information on what it takes to qualify, but it does say its forbearance program can give borrowers anywhere from two to 12 months to get back on track with their student loan payments.

In any case, you have nothing to lose by calling your private student loan servicer to inquire about your options. You may be able to secure several months of paused payments to give you some time to catch up, but you won't know unless you check.

If you're losing income, you've lost your home, you're currently displaced or all of the above, having to pick back up with federal student loan payments this month could be a major hardship.

You can also look into applying for one of the other income-driven repayment plans available for federal student loans (like PAYE or ICR). These plans aren't as good as SAVE, which is currently blocked by the courts, but they can help some borrowers get a lower monthly payment each month.

For the most part, options for borrowers with federal student loans start with reaching out to their loan servicer to inquire about options. This could be federal deferment or forbearance for federal student loans or a disaster relief administrative forbearance for borrowers who live in a FEMA-designated disaster area.

Individuals with private student loans can and should reach out to their private student loan company to see what options they have, if any. While private student loans don't have as many consumer protections as federal student loans, a surprising number of providers let borrowers skip monthly payments when disaster strikes."
The October Effect: What It Is And How It Is Believed To Impact The Stock Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/october-effect-what-it-is-impact-stock-market/,2024-10-02T20:32:04Z,"Investors are not worried about ghosts and goblins this Halloween season. They're worried about the ""October Effect"" and the spooky effect it can have on stock prices. Intrigued? Read on to find out what the October Effect is and whether you should be preparing for a portfolio scare.

What Is The October Effect?

The October Effect is a theory that stock prices decline in October. One basis for this belief is that nine of history's 20 largest single-day percentage declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) happened in the Halloween month.

Beyond that data point, however, research suggests the October Effect on stocks is superstition. Analysis by Yardeni Research indicates that since 1928, the S&P 500 has gained value in October more times than it has declined. And, averaging out October performance over the past 96 years shows a slight gain.

Although the numbers do not show stock price declines in October, there is evidence of high volatility. In an interview with Money, CFRA Research's Chief Investment Strategist Sam Stovall said October is 35% more volatile than the average over the rest of the year.

History Of Stock Market Crashes In October

Four events are largely responsible for the belief that stocks dip in October. They are the Panic of 1907, the Stock Market Crash of 1929, Black Monday in 1987 and the declines related to the 2008 Financial Crisis.

Much more than breaking news, our diverse reporting digs deeper with unparalleled insights that empower you to make better informed decisions. Become a Forbes member and unlock unlimited access to cutting-edge strategies, actionable insights, and updated analysis from our network of leading finance experts.

The Panic of 1907

In October 1907, while the U.S. was in recession, two speculators attempted to gain an influential level of control over the stock of a copper mining company. When the attempt failed, U.S. depositors began withdrawing funds from banks and trust companies associated with those speculators.

At the time, trust companies operated alongside banks in the financial system. These institutions held deposits and provided liquidity for stock trading but were not part of the central banking system. When Knickerbocker Trust faced a liquidity shortfall due to excessive withdrawals, the New York Clearing House initially denied support to conserve resources for member institutions. Consumer panic intensified and withdrawals increased, prompting a liquidity shortage in the stock market. J.P. Morgan and a group of bankers stepped in with $23 million to keep the NYSE open and operating.

The Stock Market Crash Of 1929

The historic crash of 1929 followed a period of economic expansion earlier in the 1920s. That expansion fostered optimism, which in turn encouraged speculation and trading on margin. Unfortunately, the good times would end. Production declines, rising unemployment, high debt and low wages set the stage for an overvalued financial market that needed a steep correction.

Stock prices began falling in early October. Investor fear rose and the market went into a tailspin near month's end. Billions of shares were traded so quickly that tickers could not keep pace. The market lost 12.8% on October 28 and another 12% on October 29. The crash was followed by the Great Depression, which lasted for a decade.

Black Monday 1987

On October 19, 1987, the DJIA fell 22.6%. It was the second-largest single-day crash in stock market history. Contributing factors included:

The week before Black Monday, the U.S. financial markets softened, which stoked international panic over the weekend. Stock markets in Asia and New Zealand crashed before trading opened in the U.S. on Monday. The DJIA then fell immediately at the opening bell. Declines snowballed, fueled in part by automated liquidations.

Most of the losses incurred on Black Monday were recouped within days, and the markets fully recovered to set new highs within two years.

2008 Financial Crisis

On October 9, 2008, the DJIA fell nearly 679 points, shedding more than 7% of its value. Six days later, the index lost 733 points, declining nearly 8%.

Earlier that year, Bear Stearns and IndyMac collapsed, the U.S. Treasury took over Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and the U.S. government bailed out insurance company AIG. The failures were linked to the collapse of the housing market, which had bubbled due to lax lending standards and low interest rates. The Great Recession followed. The DJIA did not set new highs again until 2013.

Key Psychological Triggers

Human psychology contributes to every stock market crash, usually to extend the severity of the losses. Two common behaviors at work are loss aversion and herd instinct.

Loss Aversion

Loss aversion is a tendency to feel losses more deeply than gains. The sting of losing 10% in your portfolio's value, for example, is usually more memorable than the buzz of gaining 10%.

Loss aversion can prompt investors to take extreme, sometimes illogical measures to protect their wealth. As stocks lose value, for example, many investors liquidate. The liquidation, however, does not prevent a loss -- it creates one. Given that every stock market crash in history has reversed, waiting for that reversal is usually the better approach. But time and time again, investors cannot resist the urge to sell their holdings because they fear greater losses.

Herd Instinct

Herd instinct is the compulsion to mimic the behaviors of the majority. It drives investors to buy growth stocks when markets are strong and sell when markets are weak. This behavior can cause individual stocks, industries or the entire market to become overvalued or undervalued. On a more granular level, following the masses often leads to buying high and selling low, which works directly against the pursuit of investment gains.

Is The October Effect Still Real In Modern Times?

Yardeni Research has addressed the October Effect with an analysis of monthly S&P 500 performance between 1928 and 2024. Key conclusions from that analysis are:

In short, the theory that stocks lose value in October is an oversimplification of financial market behavior. While major crashes have occurred in October, the more common experience is that stock prices rise throughout the month -- albeit with a tendency towards volatility.

Common Misconceptions About The October Effect

One common misconception about the October Effect is that stocks always decline in October. They do not.

It is important to recognize that any lasting market correction or volatility is usually linked to a chain of events that began months or years earlier. The Panic of 1907 had a shorter runway but also led to protective financial reforms, including the creation of the U.S. Federal Reserve System.

In the modern era, major market declines should deliver warning signs well in advance. This does not mean crashes are preventable, of course. The human tendencies of loss aversion and herd instinct alongside an increasingly interconnected and complex global financial ecosystem will always produce cycles of optimism and pessimism. Optimism OP fuels overvaluation, which inevitably creates the possibility for corrections.

October Versus Other Volatile Months

According to the Yardeni Research data, three months of the year have averaged stock market declines since 1928. They are February, May and September.

Compared to the months that averaged gains, October's performance is the lowest. March follows with an average gain of 0.60% and August shows an average gain of 0.64%.

The months with the highest historical averages are July, April and December. They show gains of 1.70%, 1.32% and 1.31%, respectively. Note that July's historic strength defies another calendar-based investing theory referred to as ""Sell in May and go away."" The phrase refers to the unfounded belief that stocks routinely underperform in the summer months.

How To Handle Stock Market Fear

Fear can push even the savviest of investors to make regrettable decisions. For that reason, it is wise to have a plan for managing emotions when the market turns sour. You can take proactive and reactive measures here. Proactively, you might rethink and reaffirm your investment strategy. And reactively, you can adopt practical habits to keep your head level.

First, decide how much risk you can handle and adjust your portfolio accordingly. For stock ideas, see our list of best stocks of 2024. If you have never experienced a big market correction, be conservative in your self-reflection. The practical reality of a 30% wealth decline is more distressing than you might expect.

Next, think through your plan for bear markets. Unless you are trading heavily, the simplest and most reliable approach is to do nothing. Stay in the market, wait for the correction to run its course and be ready for recovery gains on the other side.

Finally, plan on managing your stress level when the inevitable correction appears. You might avoid reading financial headlines and temporarily ban yourself from logging into your portfolio account, for example.

Bottom Line

Some investors believe stocks lose value in October, but the theory is not supported by data. What the data does show is the potential for higher volatility in fall's first full month. Now is a good time to verify your holdings align with your risk tolerance. After that, there's nothing more to do but stay calm and stick to your strategy.

The Great Detachment: Why Workers Are Disengaging From Their Jobs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lucianapaulise/2024/10/02/the-great-detachment-why-workers-are-disengaging-from-their-jobs/,2024-10-02T15:09:27Z,"There is a new workplace phenomenon known as ""The Great Detachment"" that is affecting today's workforce. Younger employees are experiencing increased job dissatisfaction, disengagement, and burnout, and many feel stuck in roles that do not inspire them. Despite their desire to leave, they often feel trapped due to intense competition in the job market. This rising trend is reshaping how we understand workplace engagement and the mental health of employees, particularly among Gen Z and Millennials.

The Great Detachment refers to the increasing number of younger workers who are mentally and emotionally disengaging from their jobs. Unlike the Great Resignation, where employees actively quit in search of better opportunities, those experiencing detachment feel disconnected yet constrained from leaving due to financial pressures, a competitive job market, or a lack of desirable alternatives.

Detachment is a coping mechanism that helps individuals manage stress or discomfort when they cannot change or escape a difficult situation. It involves mentally distancing oneself from emotional triggers or stressors. It can offer temporary relief.

1) Burnout and Overwork. Many employees are experiencing increased workloads and unrealistic expectations due to layoffs and company restructuring, so they feel exhausted and emotionally drained, and fearful to say NO.

2) Lack of Meaningful Work: Some workers may feel the urge to do something more meaningful and connected with their values, but they are often met with repetitive tasks or find that their contributions don't matter.

3) Economic Constraints: While many would prefer to switch roles or pursue further education, they are limited by student debt, high cost of living, or fear of unemployment.

This growing disengagement has serious consequences, both for companies and employees.

In an interview with Dr. John Scott, Head of Learning and Design of MasterClass at Work, he shared that ""For the average full-time worker, roughly a third of their weekly waking hours are spent at work. When employees feel disengaged from work, a significant part of their lives is unfulfilling and lacking meaning. Work plays a critical role in the overall well-being of people, from the relationships people form with others to their overall sense of purpose. Feeling disengaged from work, therefore has ripple effects across society overall, where people generally feel more unhappy and more isolated in their lives. When people are unhappy, when they feel unfulfilled and unmotivated, ultimately their performance at work is going to suffer, which will also inevitably impact the bottom line of the business.""

Detachment affects productivity, innovation, and overall job satisfaction. Companies with high levels of disengaged employees often suffer from low morale, higher turnover rates, and decreased output. For younger workers, the longer they stay detached, the more likely they are to experience burnout, anxiety and imposter syndrome.

Scott emphasizes the importance of remote workers engaging in authentic and meaningful conversations with someone they trust and respect. ""An employee may find such a connection through an ERG, cross-functional collaboration, or other informal socializing opportunities"".

As a coach I have seen how just talking about how they feel with someone like a coach or a peer, help them cope better. It's important for people to think about what they truly want and take small steps to get there in order to increase their motivation. It's not about resigning or looking for new jobs, but rather about considering the type of role they would like to have, the skills they want to develop, or the hobbies to which they want to dedicate more time. It is important for them to get help to focus on what can be controlled instead of being consumed by negative emotions.

Scott highlights that for leaders, ""it's crucial to establish clear expectations and goals with an employee, provide the necessary support structures, and then grant them the autonomy to execute"". Instead of reacting to disengagement with micromanagement, it's better to put people in a position where they can maximize their unique talents, which is a more effective way to engage them at work.

For organizations, learning and development opportunities are a great way to increase employee engagement. When employees feel like they are learning and developing critical skills, they will feel more confident and feel like they connect more with the company's values. Companies can also offer more support in mental health issues, like coaching opportunities at all levels, not only for executives. Another important ask is flexible work models.

The Great Detachment poses significant challenges for both employees and employers. For companies to thrive, they must address the root causes of disengagement, fostering environments that support mental health, meaningful work, and flexibility. Younger workers need to feel empowered, supported, and aligned with their roles to remain engaged. As the workforce continues to evolve, the companies that successfully navigate this trend will not only retain top talent but also create a thriving, purpose-driven workforce."
"Opinion | Who will win? Election forecasters think it's Harris, but they've been wrong before",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-election-forecasts-predictions-rcna173277,2024-10-02T10:48:06Z,"Models looking at everything from polls to economic conditions show a narrow Harris win.

Can science predict the future? The great science fiction author Isaac Asimov wrote a series of books in which a scientist figures out a way to do just that.

""It was the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations,"" Asimov wrote in one of the books in his Foundation series. ""The individual human being is unpredictable, but the reactions of human mobs ... could be treated statistically.""

It's a great concept for a book series -- and a well-reviewed streaming TV show -- but in the real world, it falls flat.

The subject has come up again as we are now just a month out from a hotly contested election that could determine everything from the future of abortion rights to the strength of American democratic institutions. It would be comforting to hear from an expert who can read the tea leaves and tell us who will win.

Demand is so high that multiple models are competing for dominance, and two of the biggest forecasters -- historian Allan Lichtman and close poll reader Nate Silver -- got into an online feud over the weekend over how to read the ""13 keys"" that Lichtman uses to make his predictions. (Lichtman says they predict a Kamala Harris win, but Silver argues they actually favor Donald Trump.)

""Allan let's just say the little tricks you've played with the Keys in the past will come back to haunt you! The Keys shall be respected,"" posted Silver, in what sounded like something the villain in a children's movie shouts shortly before an army of elves overtakes the castle.

If you're not sure about the 13 keys, you could look instead at the Misery Index, a crude measure developed by an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson that combines the unemployment rate and the inflation rate, which will tell you the numbers are looking good for Harris. Or you can check out the more sophisticated Time for Change model, which zeroes in on the popularity of the current president, the state of the economy and the number of terms the incumbent party has been in the White House. That also predicts a narrow Harris win.

Or maybe, like Silver, you favor polls. In that case, you can look at 538's proprietary mix of polls, economic and demographic data to see that Harris is projected to win 57 out of 100 times (Silver is no longer with 538). If you're willing to pay, you can see Silver's own forecast, which is based on his new model. Or you can just look at the state-by-state polls yourself and obsessively play with the maps on 270 to Win while muttering about crucial Waukesha County.

Or perhaps you like the newfangled prediction markets, which ask bettors to put their money where their mouth is. PredictIt has a bet on a Harris win at 56 cents, with Trump as the underdog at 47 cents, while VirtualTout blends PredictIt data with some fancy math to come up with a forecast for a ""strong Democratic victory.""

The good news for these forecasters is that if Harris wins, they'll all get to claim that their models were accurate. And if Trump wins, they can say that, after all, their models showed only a high probability of a Harris win, or they'll switch to talking about the popular vote.

The problem with all of these models, however, is that they attempt to make iron laws out of the scrap metal of past elections. We've had only 59 presidential elections since the Constitution went into effect -- even fewer if you consider only those since the expansion of voting rights, the advent of TV news and the development of sophisticated voter targeting in the 20th century. Statistically speaking, that's just not a lot of data.

More recently, you can throw in the complications the Electoral College has caused since 2000 by diverging twice from the national popular vote, the increasingly intense partisanship and the closely divided elections, and it's basically impossible to make definitive predictions. Would your favored political model have predicted an Al Gore or George W. Bush win in 2000? Did it predict Trump or Joe Biden winning by tens of thousands of votes in a handful of swing states?

If your model assumes how voters will respond to a president running for re-election, how does it factor in the president's dropping out and endorsing his vice president just months before the election? Or a former president's running for a nonconsecutive second term? What about a candidate who was impeached for trying to overturn the results of the last election?

Most models can be useful to a point. They can give us the general sense of the political landscape or enough information to start make contingency plans for after the election. If Harris wins, maybe the models will make at least some voters less open to bogus arguments that the election was stolen. (I'm not holding my breath on that one.) And some can tell us how well a generic Democratic or Republican candidate might have done in a particular environment, which can help the parties review their strategies.

But ultimately, we aren't voting for a generic candidate. We have to choose between two specific people, with their own strengths and weaknesses. And sometimes the polls, the economic models and the betting markets can't measure that.

In Asimov's series, the scientist's predictions of the future are accurate for centuries until, through random chance, a man is born with a mutation that allows him to psychically manipulate other people's emotions, creating fear and devotion in order to rise to power. That proposition -- that predictions of the future ultimately cannot account for the unknown or the unexpected -- is worth keeping in mind as we head into the November election, especially given that we have a candidate on the ballot who's adept at creating fear and devotion.

In the end, election forecasts are not bad at telling us how the future will look, as long as it continues to look like the past."
The Future Of Work: New Skills For Thriving In The AI-Driven Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyrubin/2024/10/02/the-future-of-work-new-skills-for-thriving-in-the-ai-driven-economy/,2024-10-02T04:16:38Z,"With insights from Shea Gopaul, John Frankel, Matt Greenfield, Kamal Mistry, Reza Safai, and Nick Bostrom

The IMF predicts that AI will affect 40% of global jobs, either through replacement or complementing human roles. Despite the potential disruption, AI is opening doors to new opportunities in STEM, healthcare, finance, entertainment, manufacturing and energy. The key challenge now is how governments, businesses, and educational institutions can collaborate to ensure that workers are prepared for this fast-evolving landscape.

Addressing the Global Skills Crisis

AI's global impact presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly in developing regions. Shea Gopaul, IOE Permanent Representative to the UN, highlights the global ""skills crisis,"" compounded by 2.6 billion people lacking internet connectivity, which exacerbates the digital divide.

Gopaul stresses that ""more action is needed."" The private sector must play a pivotal role in advancing internet connectivity, governance, and digital literacy. ""We need to foster trust and adopt a human-centric approach,"" she asserts.

Public-Private Partnerships as a Solution

Gopaul highlights the power of partnerships in addressing the skills gap. ""Apprenticeships, one of the oldest forms of collaboration, align education with current labor market needs,"" she says. Through initiatives like the Global Apprenticeship Network (GAN), businesses, governments, and institutions can reskill and upskill workers to meet evolving industry demands. ""Collaboration between the public and private sectors has never been more crucial.""

Future-Ready Skills for AI-Driven Industries

Gopaul underscores the role of multinational corporations in preparing workers for AI-driven industries through training in Generative AI and enhancing human skills like adaptability and collaboration. ""It won't be AI taking jobs; it will be people with AI skills,"" she explains. Job creation and AI skills development are paramount if we are to eliminate poverty.

Ensuring Compliance and Governance in AI-Powered Industries

AI is helping streamline tasks in industries like finance, such as risk monitoring and compliance reporting. While automation increases efficiency, human oversight remains crucial to ensure regulatory standards are upheld. Businesses must balance automation and human judgment to innovate responsibly and navigate legal and ethical challenges.

Opportunities in AI-Driven Sectors

John Frankel, founder of ff Venture Capital, highlights a shift in focus: ""The conversation has moved from being an AI startup to how any startup integrates AI processes to reduce costs and scale efficiently. The challenge for existing businesses is that new ones automatically start with AI processes -- such as ad generation, sales automation, code development, and quality assurance.""

On job loss, Frankel notes: ""The Luddite perspective that technology destroys jobs is very seductive, as the jobs lost are easier to grasp than those gained. But look where we are: tight unemployment in a deeply technological society."" He adds, ""Robotics and advanced AI applications will create jobs in areas that are harder to see, but the technology should be embraced, not rejected.""

Looking ahead, Frankel foresees major developments: ""There will be a huge increase in the deployment of technology into US manufacturing and energy sectors, creating massive efficiencies and many new jobs. The economy will be better for this.""

Innovating with AI in Immersive Storytelling

AI's impact on the entertainment industry is a clear example of how it is reshaping jobs and required skills. Volumetric video, which captures performances in 3D, is being transformed by AI to expand its applications and lower production costs. According to Kamal Mistry, ""AI enables us to capture volumetric video in more varied environments, opening up entire genres such as concerts, sports, and even training scenarios."" This shift is creating new career opportunities in content creation and interactive media.

AI-Driven Innovation: Merging Creativity with Technology

Reza Safai, filmmaker, actor, and founder of MASSIVE, highlights that creativity will remain indispensable in an AI-driven future. While AI can assist in the creative process, Safai emphasizes that pushing boundaries will still depend on human insight and innovation. ""The skills that will keep you relevant in the future aren't purely technical,"" he explains. ""It's about learning to think differently, to see possibilities where others see limitations.""

Educating Tomorrow's Workforce for AI-Driven Industries

As industries like entertainment continue to evolve with AI, preparing the workforce must start with education. Matt Greenfield, managing partner of an education-focused venture capital firm, stresses the need for educational systems to adapt. ""Schools need to figure out how to help students productively use AI in group projects. In our jobs, we will all be refining our work in iterative processes incorporating insights from multiple AI models and multiple humans.""

Greenfield emphasizes that the most critical skills for tomorrow's workforce won't just be technical but human-centered. ""The most important skills for most workers will be non-technical: the ability to ask catalytic questions, empathize, lead, solve multidisciplinary problems, and unlearn when they have been wrong.""

Next Steps: Preparing for the AI-Driven Workforce

To ensure a smooth transition into the AI-driven future of work, all stakeholders must take active roles in shaping how industries adapt and evolve. Here are actionable steps to consider:

The path to the future of work lies not just in mastering the technologies that will shape industries but in fostering the human-centered skills that will enable workers to thrive alongside AI. Creativity, empathy, critical thinking, and ethical decision-making are the qualities that will set professionals apart in the AI-augmented workforce.

As Nick Bostrom puts it, ""The future is big enough for both humans and digital minds to flourish, but we must work hard to ensure that relations between them remain friendly."" By embracing AI's advances while maintaining ethical oversight and fostering human-centered skills, we ensure that AI serves as a tool for empowerment, not disruption."
Loan-Outs Live!,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/schuylermoore/2024/10/01/loan-outs-live/,2024-10-01T23:55:57Z,"On September 30, 2024, California passed legislation enshrining the sanctity of certain loan-out companies (""loan-outs"") in the motion picture industry, which now avoids the risk for California tax and unemployment purposes of (a) qualifying loan-outs being disregarded and (b) the individuals rendering services through the loan-outs being treated as the employees of the ultimate payors. The legislation states that it is merely clarifying current law, so it is effectively retroactive. This article provides a summary of the legislation, with some critical extrapolation.

1. Definition of Loan-Out. To be respected under the legislation, loan-outs must meet all of the following tests:

a. The loan-outs must be corporations for tax purposes, including S corporations and LLCs that have elected to be taxed as corporations. There is no requirement that the loan-outs be formed or registered in California.

b. The principal activity of the loan-outs must be the rendition of services to companies that are engaged in the development or production of audio-visual works of any type (including commercials, music videos, and TV shows), referred to in this article as ""production companies."" However, companies that only distribute audio-visual works do not qualify as production companies.

c. Critically, there appears to be an unstated implied requirement that the loan-outs provide services relating to the development or production of audio-visual works, which is the standard practice in the film industry. However, the literal wording of the legislation leads to absurd results. For example, the legislation applies the ""production company"" test based on each ""employing unit,"" which includes a company and all its subsidiaries and affiliates that are operationally integrated, and the test is not based on the primary activity of the employing unit. Thus, as long as the employing unit engages in some development or production activities, that employing unit should qualify as a ""production company,"" even with respect to unrelated divisions, like a food court. To make matters worse, there is no express requirement that the loan-outs provide development or production services, so the legislation would literally permit a full-time employee in the food court of a studio to use a loan-out. This result is obviously absurd, which is why there must be an implied requirement that the loan-outs provide development or production services.

d. The services the loan-out provides to production companies must be performed by employees of the loan-out that own at least 10% of the stock of the loan-out, referred to herein as ""shareholder/employees."" What is somewhat odd about this test is that if the employees own less than 10% of the stock of the company rendering services, that company would almost certainly be respected as an independent contractor under general principles.

2. Consequences. The consequences of loan-outs being respected are as follows:

a. The companies paying the loan-outs (whether production companies or payroll companies) do not need to withhold any California income or payroll taxes.

b. The loan-outs are required to withhold California income and payroll taxes on compensation paid to their shareholder/employees, including unemployment insurance taxes. This requirement does not apply to dividends, and many S corporations pay dividends (after the payment of ""reasonable"" compensation) to minimize payroll taxes.

c. The shareholder/employees qualify for unemployment benefits.

3. Payroll Companies. In order to enforce the obligation of loan-outs to withhold California taxes on compensation paid to their employees, the legislation leans heavily on payroll companies, and requires them to file quarterly reports with the state setting out the details of payments to loan-outs commencing in 2026. Importantly, the reports must include the name, address, and social security number of the employees rendering the related services.

4. Federal Treatment. Another reason to interpret the reach of the California legislation as limited to loan-outs that provide development or production services is that the IRS has quietly acquiesced to the use of loan-outs for development and production of audio-visual works, perhaps due to the perceived unfairness of the inability of employees to deduct fees paid to managers, agents, and lawyers, while loan-outs can. However, the IRS has never permitted executives and rank and file employees to use loan-outs. One fuzzy area has been the use of loan-outs by below-the-line crew, and the new legislation may expand the use of such loan-outs, although it is not clear if the IRS will accept it."
"Opinion | What Trump's vision of ""one rough hour"" for police really means",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-purge-police-rough-violent-day-rcna173295,2024-10-01T10:34:42Z,"In the 2013 dystopian thriller ""The Purge,"" America observes a tradition wherein, once a year for a designated 12-hour period, all crime is permissible -- up to and including murder. During the purge, society is rocked by spectacular violence, which is said to have a cathartic effect: It dramatically reduces crime and unemployment. ""The Purge"" provides audiences with a warning about the horrifying consequences of selective observation of morals and a world ruled by a ""might makes right"" ethos. But at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday, former President Donald Trump effectively floated the idea as a good thing. Except in his spinoff version, the twist is that it's only the cops who get to do what they want.

As he often has in the past, Trump complained at the rally that police are ""not allowed to do their job"" because of political pressure and that crime is rampant in President Joe Biden's America as a result. (It is not.) And that's when he proposed his ""Purge""-esque solution: If police were allowed ""one real rough, nasty"" and ""violent day,"" he said, crime would be eliminated ""immediately."" He was taken enough by the proposition that he returned to it later, saying, ""One rough hour -- and I mean real rough -- the word will get out and it will end immediately, you know? It will end immediately.""

A Trump campaign official told Politico afterward that he was ""clearly just floating it in jest."" And Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign's communications director, told Politico that Trump has ""always been the law and order president and he continues to reiterate the importance of enforcing existing laws.""

Let's unpack a few things here. The Trump campaign's ""in jest"" excuse should be dismissed. As I've written before, for the better part of a decade Trump has used a comic tone and ""I'm just kidding"" caveats to float trial balloons for his most extreme ideas.

Even though Trump obviously wouldn't have the authority as president to permit the police to indulge in a day of extreme violence, that he's articulating the idea in public at all is still significant -- and corrosive. It signals an attitude toward police misconduct that helps to set the Republican agenda -- at federal and state levels -- on legislation related to police reform.

It could also affect the day-to-day culture of policing by emboldening police officers to act more aggressively when interacting with citizens. And it could more generally encourage Trump's supporters to consider vigilantism and political violence as a way to address social problems. The latter is not a far-fetched, abstract concern, either, but a real, already-existing social phenomenon that could definitely get worse. In no context is it appropriate for a presidential candidate -- much less a former or sitting president -- to ""joke"" about law enforcement brutalizing the public, especially in a country plagued by police violence.

Cheung's attempt to frame Trump's authoritarian remarks as a reflection of his commitment to ""law and order"" is preposterous. Trump is suggesting that police should be able to operate outside the constraints of the law to achieve the social goal of reducing crime; in other words, suspending regular law to achieve order. And the worldview underpinning Trump's preferred social order is, of course, reactionary -- it's about protecting the powerful and dominating those who challenge them.

Trump's vision of ""one rough hour"" echoes his rhetoric about being ""dictator for one day"" to crack down on illegal immigration and drill for oil wherever he wants. In both scenarios Trump invokes the threat of a crisis (surging crime or migration across the border) to legitimize the idea of extraordinary power (unconstrained executive power or police brutality) to achieve an end.

Trump tries to frame this as compatible with democracy and the rule of law by framing the exercise of that extraordinary power as temporary. This is, of course, a familiar playbook for autocratic leaders, who argue that crises require exceptions (ostensibly temporarily) to the rules to tackle them. But somehow the crises -- and the special rules to solve them -- seem to extend indefinitely. The reality is that rules are rules only because everyone follows them. Once you argue that you alone need an exception to the rule to govern, then you're in effect arguing that you don't believe in rules.

If Trump wins the White House again, would he be able to pursue a special police ""purge""? Not through any conventional laws or institutions. But everything he's said, especially since 2020, has made it clear that he's interested in trying, and the courts and half of Congress seem willing to let him."
What To Expect For Interest Rates From The November Fed Meeting,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/01/what-to-expect-for-interest-rates-from-the-november-fed-meeting/,2024-10-01T06:52:00Z,"On November 7, the Federal Open Market Committee is expected to again lower interest rates after an initial cut on September 18. Markets currently expect a 0.25% reduction in interest rates to 4.5% to 4.75%. However, a larger 0.5% reduction is possible depending on reported economic data over the coming weeks.

The FOMC will meet November 6-7 announcing its interest rate decision at 2pm E.T. on November 7. It is slightly unusual that the decision will be announced on a Thursday rather than the typical Wednesday. This will be followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30pm. Economic projections are released at every other meeting, and were last updated on September 18, so they will not be updated at the November FOMC meeting. Minutes of the meeting, offering greater color on the decision making process, are then typically scheduled to be released 3 weeks later.

The FOMC is currently appears to be dialing back restrictive monetary policy as inflation is now clearly within sight of their 2% target, and the labor market has seen broadly rising unemployment over the past 12 months, albeit from low levels.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index showed 2.2% annual inflation to August 2024, or 2.7% with food and energy price trends excluded. That's down significantly from the peak levels of 7% in summer 2022, which prompted the FOMC to raise rates aggressively. In addition, even at the best of times, the FOMC has been unable to hold inflation precisely at 2%. As such, deviations of around one percent from target are historically quite typical.

The unemployment rate is 4.2% for August 2024. That's up from around 3.5% for much of last year. Unemployment still remains at low levels by historical standards and the FOMC has expressed confidence in the job market, seeing a return to greater balance, rather than the start of ongoing weakening. Nonetheless, even relatively small rises in unemployment have often bought recessions historically.

As Powell said on September 18. ""We know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment moving to a more sustainable level. So the balance of risks are now even.""

As always the FOMC will watch incoming data closely before their next meeting. Perhaps the most significant of many reports will be two jobs reports on October 4 and November 1. Here the FOMC is generally comfortable with some cooling in the jobs market, but is looking to avoid a more abrupt rise in unemployment that could signal a recession.

For inflation, key data points will come with the Consumer Price Index for September on October 10, and the PCE inflation release also for September on October 31. The broad expectation here is that inflation should continue to trend toward 2% and won't bring cause for alarm. However, jobs data may prove more significant in shaping the FOMC's thinking. If there is a further rise in unemployment, then the FOMC may be prompted to make larger interest rate cuts to counter recession risk.

It is highly likely that short-term interest rates are cut again on November 7, according to fixed income markets. Yet, it is unclear how large the cut will be, with a 0.25% cut viewed as more likely than 0.5%. However, there's ample time for that to change. More fundamentally, markets are assessing how low interest rates will ultimately go. Currently, short-term interest rates could be around 3% by late 2025, but markets project a broad range of outcomes, implying that anything from 2% to 4% is possible."
Waiting For The September Jobs Report,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/09/30/waiting-for-the-september-jobs-report/,2024-09-30T23:00:40Z,"The September jobs report will be pivotal for markets. Payroll gains have slowed over the past two years, while the unemployment rate has been rising on-trend. With the Federal Reserve on the verge of more interest rate cuts, the jobs report will be a key data point informing markets of future Fed policy actions.

Investors, analysts, and policymakers are watching economic data releases closely for Fed implications. One of the most important economic data reports of the month will be the U.S. employment situation report released on October 4 at 8:30 a.m. ET. This report, which is informally called the jobs report by economists, has the potential to move foreign exchange, equity, bond, and commodity markets.

The unemployment rate has risen from 3.5% in September 2022 to 4.2% in August 2024. While the unemployment rate has risen, net monthly payroll gains have slowed. In August 2024, only 142,000 net new jobs were added for the month. Directional changes in September labor data will have the power to move markets, especially if the jobs report tips the balance of risks for the Fed's dual mandate.

The Fed has a dual mandate to support full employment and keep inflation rates low and stable. While the labor market is close to full employment, prices are not yet low and stable. Additionally, recent Fed statements and remarks have acknowledged the growing balance of risks in the economic outlook, including the downside financial market risks to both parts of its dual mandate.

While year-on-year inflation rates have slowed, they remain above the Fed's 2% target. August 2024 year-on-year inflation rates were 2.5% for CPI and 3.2% for core CPI, with year-on-year total PCE inflation up 2.2% and core PCE up 2.7%. These rates are unlikely to fall to the Fed's 2% target this year. However, they have been falling on-trend, and they are likely to fall to the Fed's 2% target next year. Given the currently elevated levels of year-on-year inflation, the Fed is likely to tread carefully in its rate cut policies.

A Fed interest rate cut of 0.25% is likely on November 7. However, a rate cut of 0.5% would be more likely if the labor market weakens significantly -- or if the U.S. presidential election outcome is unknown by the time of the November 7 Fed decision.

Potential Market Implications Of The Jobs Report

A solid September employment report with payrolls above August levels with an unemployment rate at or below 4.2% is likely to signal that the Fed can take its time with rate cuts, which would likely support the greenback and bond yields. Additionally, a solid report could still have positive impacts on equities, oil prices, and industrial metals prices because it would assuage concerns about recession.

A weak September employment report with payrolls below August levels with an unemployment rate at or above 4.3% would signal that larger interest rate cuts are more likely. This would, in turn, likely weigh on the greenback and bond yields. However, a weak report could still have mixed to bearish implications for equities, oil prices, and industrial metals prices, because downside risks could exacerbate concerns about recession.

In anticipation of the September jobs report, a number of other labor market data releases will be watched closely this week, including September ADP payrolls, August Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data, and weekly jobless claims."
Why China's Struggling Economy Is A Huge Price Boost For Bitcoin,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/09/30/why-chinas-struggling-economy-is-a-huge-price-boost-for-bitcoin/,2024-09-30T21:57:17Z,"China's economic growth is slowing significantly. This year, it may fail to achieve what was already a low 5% annual growth rate goal. Beyond representing a significant economic change, this will have many implications for Bitcoin. It may well represent a hidden bullish factor as Bitcoin prices continue to test upward momentum after a couple of months of stagnation -- a theme I often explore in my book on Bitcoin + China.

Asset bubbles are being created in China, which has been responsible for the stark increase in gold prices. Since Chinese equities and real estate are down, there's a premium for exiting money from the Chinese system and getting a return elsewhere. Chinese investors have piled onto gold ETFs and government bonds. In 2022, Chinese savers were estimated to sock away over $2.6 trillion in the domestic Chinese banking sector. However, that behavior may change with interest rates now ticking down and more stimulus being put on the table. A persistently high Chinese savings rate unique among other nations may need a new place to go: with historic interest in Bitcoin, stablecoins, and other cryptocurrencies, Chinese investors looking for an exit ramp may just choose Bitcoin's allure - a path towards getting money out of the Chinese system and being able to transact with financial freedom.

With an exchange ban in the Mainland, over-the-trading counters are one way for Chinese people to buy Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. While some Chinese crypto buyers use exchanges with different addresses, many large buyers would prefer to work with OTC desks. Those OTC desks have recently seen record inflows since 2021, showing a rebound from when China imposed restrictions on Bitcoin mining and trading. This recent surge in price-boosting demand seems motivated mainly by the declining return on Chinese assets.

China's economic downturn has created pressure on both monetary and fiscal authorities to turn the economy around. The most alarming statistic is the high unemployment rate for youth. The central bank is decreasing interest rate targeting and loosening the money supply in China, which will help in the short term with Bitcoin's correlation with risk assets as central banks race with one another to fight growing downturns in the economy around the world. Already, Chinese investors are racing back from bonds to Chinese equities - risk assets more correlated with Bitcoin's price. In the United States, the Federal Reserve is also lowering rates and expanding US monetary supply, which will allow the Chinese central bank to also lower rates to keep the Yuan at the same preferred trading range as now and not to worry about a weakening Yuan against the US dollar (in fact, both may just weaken against Bitcoin.)

In the case of Bitcoin mining, it's estimated that about 20% of the global hash rate still resides in China despite increasing amounts of restrictions and province-level bans as of 2022. As local governments in China struggle to raise tax revenue because of declining land value, the prospect of working with companies that can leverage stranded power into tax revenue and economic growth becomes much more attractive - and may account for the surprising amount of global hash rate securing the Bitcoin network remaining in China despite the level of restrictions and bans.

Bitmain and Bitcoin mining companies were originally from China. Though tariffs have hit them on the American side and restrictions on the Chinese side, and now they manufacture mostly outside of China, they still maintain many offices in China. Many mining pools offering software that coordinates Bitcoin mining originated from China, and exchanges such as Binance, Huobi, and OKX did, too. As an economic downturn with few state-guided technological windfalls unwinds, the entrepreneurial energy dedicated to starting Bitcoin's momentum in China may now be directed towards Bitcoin again, along with increases in buying activity. Chinese entrepreneurs, businesses, and buyers will once again have the opportunity to contribute their efforts to Bitcoin - as I've written at length about in my book on Bitcoin + China. China's loss, in this case, may well be Bitcoin's gain."
Economists And Regular Americans Dangerously Disagree About Presidential Candidates' Proposals,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hershshefrin/2024/09/30/economists-and-regular-americans-dangerously-disagree-about-presidential-candidates-proposals/,2024-09-30T20:05:53Z,"Regular Americans and professional economists sharply disagree about the merits of key economic policies being put forward by the country's two Presidential candidates. This is extremely important because while professional economists seek to identify rational policies, regular people are psychologically limited in their abilities to engage in rational economic analysis.

Economic analysis is complicated, detailed, and uses sophisticated techniques. Most people lack the requisite skills to understand the analysis; and therefore, they resort to intuitive ""sniff tests."" These sniff tests are sometimes effective; but, not always, and it is the ""not always"" situations that can be dangerous.

The votes of regular Americans will decide the winner of the presidential election, not the recommendations of professional economists. Some might believe in the principle known as ""the wisdom of crowds,"" but that principle breaks down when the issues involve judgmental tasks that are emotionally laden.

An example where regular Americans and professional economists disagree is former President Trump's proposal that the U.S. levy a tariff of up to 20% on all imported goods. According to a survey administered by the Wall Street Journal, 47% of regular Americans surveyed support this proposal, despite no professional economist surveyed doing so.

Standard economic analysis indicates that tariffs harm the general public, even though they may benefit a few special interests. Tariffs work by imposing taxes on imported goods. These taxes are paid by the consumers of those goods, not the foreign companies or countries selling the goods. The point of these taxes is to reduce the cost advantage enjoyed by foreign competitors, thereby forcing Americans to buy ""made in America"" that is more expensive to manufacture, or of lower quality than what comes from abroad, or both. Remember, Trump is talking about imposing a 20% tariff on all imported goods!

The 47% of Americans who favor Trump's tariff proposal appear not to understand the economics of tariffs. Their intuitions are more likely influenced more by the language they hear from Trump, which is laden with emotion. For example, Trump describes tariffs as ""beautiful."" He avoids describing tariffs as taxes on American consumers, but instead says that tariffs ""will take in hundreds of billions of dollars into our Treasury and use that money to benefit the American citizens.""

The psychological elements in Trump's pitch for tariffs are highly germane, and apparently effective. The word ""beautiful"" has a positive spin, what psychologists call ""positive affect."" Avoiding the description of tariffs as a tax is an example of psychological salience, or the lack thereof: out of sight out of mind. The statement about billions of dollars flowing into ""our Treasury"" that will ""benefit the American citizens"" is intended to create a false image in which the 47% view themselves as being the beneficiaries of the alleged flows into the Treasury, rather than special interests.

Trust is the overarching psychological principal at work in Trump's communications about tariffs, and of course other campaign issues. The academic framework for the psychology of trust suggests that Trump's followers trust him because of four reasons.

1. They regard him as a friend, not a foe. He does tell them he loves them.

2. They regard him as having integrity, and believe his statements that the accusations against him in the courts are a witch hunt.

3. They judge him to be competent, and believe him when he says that, as president, ""I took in from China hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes and tariffs, and I had no inflation.""

4. They view him as predictable; and indeed, he routinely delivers the same basic messages.

Behavioral economics use the term ""nudge"" for interventions designed to alter people's behavior. The nudge framework has several components, such as ""incentives/feelings"" and ""mapping of actions to consequences."" Dark nudges are interventions that harm people, even though on the surface they appear to be beneficial. In respect to tariffs, dark nudging helps people feel as if our country is socking it to China. It helps think that doing so adds billions of dollars to the Treasury. However, the nudge is dark because the tariffs will do much more harm than good for the country.

Vice President Harris has proposed penalizing companies that engage in price gouging for food products. The Wall Street Journal reports that although 72% of regular Americans support this proposal, only 13% of economists do so.

Standard economic analysis focuses on the role that prices play in aligning demand and supply. Prices naturally tend to rise in the wake of a shock that either reduces supply or increases demand. Suppressing price changes typically creates market inefficiencies by reducing the motivation for producers to increase supply and for customers to reduce demand.

The 72% of regular Americans who support Harris' price gouging proposal appear not to understand the subtleties associated with the dynamics of equilibrium pricing. Research in behavioral economics finds that people instead focus on a perceived lack of fairness when the price of key products rise after the occurrence of an unfavorable event. The term ""gouging"" is emotionally loaded, and implies the violation of a right people assume they have.

Harris' economic plan, for lowering costs and creating what she calls an ""opportunity economy,"" states the following:

""Vice President Harris and Governor Walz's proposal -- like many of the laws already on the books in 37 states -- will go after nefarious price gouging on essential goods during emergencies or times of crisis. When an emergency strikes, the American people deserve to know the government can take on bad actors that take advantage of a crisis to excessively jack up prices.""

The details of Harris' proposal are vague, but her plan references the existing state laws that are on the books. Her plan suggests that she plans to introduce national legislation along the same lines.

Psychologically, Harris' proposal might redirect attention away from voters' perception that the economy is weak, and that inflation remains a threat. To be sure, the inflation experienced during the Biden presidency badly stung most regular Americans. They are still feeling the pain, still experiencing the fear of a resurgence in inflation, and by associating Harris to Biden, in her role as Vice President, connecting her to that pain and fear.

Nevertheless, the economy is currently performing well. The rate of economic growth is normal, the odds of an imminent recession are low, the unemployment rate is low, and inflation is coming down. The Federal Reserve is reducing interest rates, which sets the stage for future growth. Still, for many regular Americans, psychologically, it is the past inflation that is salient, not the state of the current economy: They find themselves experiencing the ""peak-end rule.""

Economists are right about the negatives of both Trump's tariff proposal and Harris' price gouging proposal. The gut instincts of regular Americans' psychology on these two issues are simply off.

The net costs to Trump's tariff proposal are much larger than to Harris' price gouging proposal. Imports are continuous, and therefore high inefficient tariffs are continuous. Moreover, Trump's proposal applies to all imports! In contrast, price gouging in response to emergencies is intermittent, and confined to a few products.

Economists have more disagreement with Trump than with Harris. In the Wall Street Journal survey, economists and regular Americans disagree more about proposals put forward by Trump than about proposals put forward by Harris.

In going to the polls this year, regular Americans should carefully reflect on where their gut instincts might lead them, lest they get what they wish for."
"Designing A More Neurodivergent, Inclusive World",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenniferpalumbo/2024/09/30/designing-a-more-neurodivergent-inclusive-world/,2024-09-30T19:55:40Z,"The world is becoming more aware of the need to accommodate neurodiversity, but true inclusivity goes far beyond merely acknowledging differences. Whether it's in schools or workplaces, designing environments that actively embrace neurodivergent individuals is critical to ensuring they feel supported, understood, and empowered.

Neurodiversity refers to the variation in human brain functions, including differences in learning, thinking, and processing information. Autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and other neurodevelopmental conditions are examples of neurodivergence.

While these individuals often face challenges in environments not designed with their needs in mind, they also bring unique strengths like creative problem-solving and innovation. Research from JP Morgan Chase underscores the value of neurodiverse talent, estimating that employees hired through its neurodiversity program are 90% to 140% more productive than their neurotypical peers.

Creating more inclusive spaces isn't just a moral imperative -- it's a smart investment in the future. By designing environments that cater to the needs of neurodivergent individuals, we unlock untapped potential that can drive progress across various industries.

Schools are often the first place where neurodivergent children encounter the challenges of navigating a world designed for neurotypical individuals. While Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) are essential for many students, they only scratch the surface of what's needed for true inclusion.

According to Antoinette Banks, CEO of Expert IEP and a mother of a child with autism and ADHD (AuDHD), ""True inclusion isn't just about what's written in an IEP -- it's about embracing the whole child."" Banks, whose company helps families develop personalized education strategies for neurodivergent learners, emphasizes the importance of understanding each child's strengths, interests, and broader goals.

She advocates for schools to engage families early and consistently beyond academic needs. ""Schools could make it a practice to understand the long-term aspirations parents have for their children. This ensures the support aligns not just with the school setting but with the child's future.""

In fostering a neurodiversity-affirming environment, it's also crucial to acknowledge the intersectionality of students' identities. Neurodiversity often intersects with factors like race, socioeconomic status, and cultural background. By recognizing this complexity, schools can create more nuanced support systems that truly meet the diverse needs of neurodivergent students.

One of the most effective ways to support both neurodivergent and neurotypical students is through student-led initiatives. ""When we empower students to lead the way, we see remarkable results,"" says Banks. ""Neurodivergent students become more motivated and engaged, while neurotypical students develop greater empathy and understanding.""

In schools where students of all neurotypes work together, everyone benefits. Neurodivergent students feel a sense of belonging, and neurotypical children learn essential social skills, fostering a richer and more inclusive learning environment.

True inclusion requires more than just academic support; it involves addressing the emotional and social development of neurodivergent learners as well. Banks emphasizes the need for a collaborative approach between parents and educators. ""As parents, we often don't hear from schools unless something has gone wrong. This creates a reactive environment absent of true collaboration.""

To shift this paradigm, regular check-ins between parents and educators are essential. These meetings should go beyond academics and focus on the whole child, discussing strategies that foster emotional and social development. Banks notes that involving parents in setting both academic and personal development goals ensures that neurodivergent children receive consistent support in all areas of their lives.

With the rise of technology, schools have more tools at their disposal than ever before to support neurodivergent learners. However, Banks stresses that while technology can be incredibly useful, it should never replace human interaction. ""At Expert IEP, we use AI to flag areas where additional support might be needed, but we rely on experienced educators to interpret those insights.""

By automating certain tasks, educators can focus on the irreplaceable elements of education -- empathy, mentorship, and personalized guidance. The combination of AI-driven data and human insight creates a powerful support system for neurodivergent learners.

The workplace presents another significant challenge for neurodivergent individuals. Neurodiverse unemployment rates are about 40%, not because these individuals can't do the job but because they're often not in the right environment to succeed. Travis Hollman, CEO of MeSpace, believes that personalized workspaces can make all the difference.

""As a father of a neurodivergent son, I've seen firsthand how difficult it can be to navigate environments that go against the grain of how the neurodiverse brain works,"" says Hollman. ""Too often, neurodivergent individuals are told they won't succeed when the problem lies in the environment, not the individual.""

Hollman's company, MeSpace, focuses on creating customizable work environments tailored to neurodivergent employees. ""The ability to control one's environment is critically important,"" he says. Neurodivergent individuals often have unique sensory preferences, such as sensitivity to noise, lighting, or textures. By providing employees with adjustable lighting, customizable noise levels, and flexible seating options, employers can help create a workspace where neurodivergent individuals feel comfortable and empowered.

In addition to physical adjustments, Hollman stresses the importance of considering the type of work neurodivergent employees are tasked with. ""Neurodivergent individuals excel at complex problem-solving -- exactly the skills needed as AI replaces many repetitive office tasks.""

Creating an inclusive workplace culture goes beyond physical accommodations. Hollman notes that companies should also focus on training their teams to understand and support neurodiverse colleagues. ""I go out of my way to train my team on how my brain works differently, and I encourage companies to do the same.""

Hollman believes that this type of proactive approach will allow companies to capture a competitive advantage. Neurodivergent employees bring a unique perspective to the table, and when their needs are met, they often outperform their neurotypical peers. A study from the Harvard Business Review supports this claim, highlighting that neurodiverse employees excel in fields like software testing, data analytics, and cybersecurity.

Designing a more neurodivergent-inclusive world isn't just a matter of physical accommodations or adjustments in an IEP. It's about embracing the strengths and talents of neurodivergent individuals and creating environments where they can thrive.

Whether it's through personalized education strategies, student-led initiatives, or customizable workspaces, the key to inclusion lies in collaboration and understanding. As Hollman puts it, ""If given the right environment, I firmly believe neurodivergent individuals, like my son, will change the world.""

As more schools and workplaces take steps to embrace neurodiversity, we move closer to a world where everyone, regardless of how their brain works, can achieve their full potential."
How To Set Realistic AI Expectations And Goals For Your Business,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/09/30/how-to-set-realistic-ai-expectations-and-goals-for-your-business/,2024-09-30T16:38:51Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CEO newsletter, which offers the latest news for today's and tomorrow's business leaders and decision makers. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every week.

Executives are vital to provide leadership to businesses, but they aren't the only ones. Boards hold an equally important role. Though most boards sit more on the advisory side, members' knowledge and opinions on company strategy, policy and who a company's management should be can dramatically shape its outlook and finances.

Executive search firm Spencer Stuart published its annual Board Index earlier this month and found that many boards are slowly making evolutionary changes to better reflect today's business realities. The operative word is ""slowly."" The study found there's more that needs to be done -- and fast -- to bring boards more in line with companies' needs. Fewer than a third of CEOs told the firm they feel their company has the board it needs to address the issues they're facing. And among boards, about a quarter say they have one or more members who should no longer be there because their skills and expertise are outdated. Yet many board members stick around for a long time. Only 58% of S&P 500 boards got a new member in 2024, and the turnover rate for board members is about 7% to 8%.

Spencer Stuart offered some advice for shaking up a stagnant board, other than the directive that board members need self-awareness to know when their service is no longer useful to the company. The entire culture behind board membership should be built around the board's mission as a dynamic group committed to the company and its shareholders. Third-party evaluations into boards -- and individual members -- could assess their effectiveness. And adopting formal policies to promote turnover -- including term limits, maximums or post-full-time-job-retirement requirements -- could also help push the awareness that the board should be constantly refreshed.

In terms of incoming board members, Spencer Stuart found modest gains in many expertise and diversity-related factors. Nearly three in 10 new board members have financial expertise -- up three points from last year -- and the largest proportion of new board members come from tech or telecommunications backgrounds. Just over a third of board members appointed last year were first-time members, and 14% of those were younger than 50 -- all of these statistics are up 3% from 2023. The one place that saw a sizable gain was the number of new female board members with financial backgrounds: 34% appointed this year came from finance, while just 25% in 2023 did. However, that large step forward came with a small step back: The number of new women board members was down -- representing 42% of new members this year, as opposed to 46% last year.

Even though generative AI has been talked about by the business community for almost two years, there are still many unrealistic expectations about what it can do for a company -- often among board members who don't have much technical knowledge. I talked to Krishna Sudheendra, CEO of digital transformation company UST, about what CEOs need to know about setting realistic expectations and goals for AI. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are now open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

The interest rate cut that everyone was waiting for happened earlier this month. And yet there's already lots of talk about how big the next one will be at the Federal Reserve policy-making committee's next meeting in November. (According to CME FedWatch, as of Monday morning, 38.6% of economists project another half-percentage point cut.) This isn't just a case of impatient analysts and investors, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. After the rate cut was announced, yields on the 10-year Treasury note increased. These notes are the basis for interest rates on things including mortgages, auto loans and corporate borrowing -- meaning financing might not be getting cheaper after all.

There are many reasons for Treasury yields to be increasing, some benign and some ominous. Some analysts say investors had already priced in the rate cut, especially since its yields are down compared with earlier this summer. But CNBC spoke with analysts who see uncertainty through the federal deficit and the Fed's willingness to cut interest rates, even with inflation a bit higher than the 2% it sees as tolerable. On Friday, reports showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index -- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- to be at 2.2% in August.

One of the reasons for this month's rate cuts was the weakening job market, as the unemployment rate rose to 4.2% in August. That sent consumer confidence numbers down this month -- from 105.6 in August to 98.7 in September, far below consensus economist forecasts of 104. Dana Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board, said in a statement that consumers are concerned with fewer work hours, slower raises and fewer job openings, even though the labor market on the whole is healthy.

The Justice Department sued Visa last week, arguing that the financial services giant violates antitrust laws with its debit card business. Visa accounts for nearly 60% of U.S. debit card transactions, and Attorney General Merrick Garland said it has ""unlawfully amassed the power to extract fees that far exceed what it could charge in a competitive market."" While most consumers don't see these fees broken out when paying for items, businesses must pay them. Garland said Visa's conduct affects ""the price of nearly everything."" The National Retail Federation, which has long pushed for more controls on transaction fees charged by credit and debit card companies, supported the lawsuit but said in a statement this is ""just the tip of the iceberg.""

In a statement shared with several media outlets, Visa general counsel Julie Rottenberg said the lawsuit ignores that Visa is one of many competitors in the debit market. ""When businesses and consumers choose Visa, it is because of our secure and reliable network, world-class fraud protection, and the value we provide.""

WeightWatchers' bad year just got worse. On Friday, CEO Sima Sistani abruptly left the company, effective immediately. Forbes senior contributor Edward Segal writes this is yet another big hit for a company that has been trying to rebrand itself as people's relationship with weight, health and weight loss drugs are in significant flux. As more people have turned toward weight loss medications -- including Ozempic and Wegovy -- membership and confidence in the company has fallen. Longtime WeightWatchers advocate, client and board member Oprah Winfrey even left the company, selling her stock and exiting its board in February. In March 2023, under Sistani's leadership, WeightWatchers bought Sequence, a digital health platform that could prescribe weight loss medications, for $132 million. But the company has accelerated in the wrong direction, with its stock down more than 90% in 2024 alone, currently trading at less than $1 per share. The interim CEO is board member Tara Comonte, former CEO of TMRW Life Sciences.

Nearly two years after ChatGPT ignited massive interest in generative AI, many companies have been working to bring AI-powered solutions to their companies. But the hype around AI is still huge, and CEOs need to understand realistic expectations for the technology. I talked to Krishna Sudheendra, CEO of digital transformation company UST, about how companies can be realistic about the benefits and return on investment they can get from AI. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

Are expectations for what AI can do right now in the short term out of hand? Or do you feel like everybody kind of has the right expectations and ideas?

Sudheendra: Right now, especially if you look at the boards and the investors, they feel AI is this magic wand. AI has been around. Generative AI and content generation [is] new, and the power, because of the new semiconductor chips and all the technologies coming together, has been enhanced. But right now, many people think that it is this magic wand that is going to bring my cost down dramatically. Companies are announcing, 'We are going to take out $3 billion in cost because of AI,' or 'We are going to enhance our market value by $XXX+ because of AI.'

Where you can really see it in action is in your productivity tools. How can you re-look at your ways of work, whether it's your software development cycle, core generation, internal productivity or call center operations. You can bring in generative AI technologies to really make things productive. We have seen in order of magnitude 20% to 40% reduction in cost and improvement in efficiency. Those are the real use cases that are getting into production.

But there are a lot of pie-in-the sky use cases which are not really getting out there. Yes, there are POCs [proofs of concept], but nobody is really ready to get things into production.

There are regulations that need to come into play. There has to be a complete governance layer in terms of ethics. All of those are yet to be formed and, without that, we cannot really have a mass adoption of AI, especially helping businesses to grow or significantly enhance their customer experiences.

How can the people inside of the business who grasp the concept of AI temper expectations for the boards, the investors and people who just see ""the magic wand?""

It's all about starting small, setting realistic expectations and showing the results. I have seen CIOs, CTOs and some of the smart technologists saying, 'Let's look at how we can really improve our software engineering using AI.' Or our call center performance, our supply chain operations or their operational performance, using document, vision, analytics and so on -- bringing all of these technologies together. They have been able to show some early results.

They have to set realistic expectations with their board, saying there is still a lot of work that needs to be done bringing all the data together, putting things onto the cloud. A lot of the digital transformation is incomplete today. Otherwise, AI is bound to hallucinate and give you wrong results.

A realistic expectation needs to be set: As we start, where can it be applied, and when would we get results? And then clearly show a larger, longer roadmap to the board and investors saying, 'Here's my AI roadmap. This is what I'm achieving today, realistically. This is the art of possible. We need to get our digital transformation in place. We need to get our resources in place. We need to get the investments in place, and here is a way to get there.'

How do you build your roadmap from what can be done today to what can be done in the future?

Every company needs to have an AI strategy. The thought leaders, the technologists, the architects, the business leaders within the company need to come together. Today, the awareness of what AI can do is very limited. I think there needs to be an AI education for the board [and] the senior leadership team. They have seen their children in high school, trying cool things on ChatGPT. That can solve smaller problems, but to apply AI in an enterprise and really look at business strategy.

Such an education should lead the businesses to have AI strategy. When UST did a survey, it was very evident that there is [a] lack of talent in the market. External experts need to come in to define what an AI strategy will look like. Then every company can build its own, which will also include a significant portion of digitizing their current environment. Companies have not even completed their digitization roadmap, and [it] will become an integral part of the AI roadmap.

Most importantly, the regulation needs to catch up. Whether it's healthcare, retail, [or something else,] industry leaders need to help formulate some of the regulations. Regulation and governance need to go hand-in-hand while defining the AI strategy for the future.

After several years of tight availability and sky-high prices, economists from Cox Automotive said on a webcast that the automobile industry is becoming more affordable.

$47,870: Average transaction price for a new vehicle, down 1.7% from 2023, and 4% less than 2022

22%: Year-over-year increase in sales of subcompact SUVs, the best-selling type of vehicle

'The story is steady demand': What Cox Automotive Director of Industry Insights Stephanie Valdez Streaty said about EV sales, which represent about 9% of the total market

With all of the work and dedication required to be a CEO, burnout is always a possibility. CEO and entrepreneur Jessica Zweig recently published a book, The Light Work, about how to come back after burning out.

Social media makes it easy to build your personal brand, and as an executive -- especially if you've got a smaller or brand new company -- there are many reasons to do it. Here are 10 things branding can do for you and your business.

C. It has a mandatory bag and jacket check at the door

D. It only accepts online orders and delivers shoppers' purchases to the parking lot"
"China's Youth Should Not Be Seduced By ""Garbage Time"" Meme",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/drewbernstein/2024/09/30/chinas-youth-should-not-be-seduced-by-garbage-time-meme/,2024-09-30T13:04:59Z,"There are few sentiments as seductive to youth as pessimism and none so poisonous. In the West, we hear about young people giving up on the prospect of having children due to their ""rational"" concerns about climate change or housing costs.

In China, social media has been overrun by the meme of the ""garbage time of history,"" which suggests that China has entered a period of stagnation analogous to the final decades in which the Soviet Union slowly suffocated under a sclerotic leadership. Initially coined by the essayist Hu Wenhui, this term adopts the metaphor of a basketball game when one side has amassed so many points that the outcome is a foregone conclusion.

""When the overall situation is set, and defeat is inevitable no matter how hard you try, it's just a futile struggle,"" Hu said. ""How should those unfortunate enough to encounter the garbage time of history conduct themselves?""

The concept of ""garbage time"" provides a world-historical framing for the fashionable ethos of ""lying flat,"" in which young people choose to withdraw from China's hyper-competitive educational and professional race to focus on their personal interests. This Chinese counter-cultural movement recalls the young Americans who embraced the ""slacker"" identity tag during the recession of the early 1990s when the economy stalled under the weight of the savings and loan crisis, and unemployment spiked to nearly 8%.

What accounts for the attraction of the ""garbage time"" memes?

First, we should acknowledge that China is undergoing a profound reset in its economic model. Since 2009, its economy has been turbocharged by government infrastructure spending, breakneck real estate investment, and explosive credit formation by corporations and local governments. This model was ultimately unsustainable. The resulting correction parallels the deflation of Japan's real estate bubble in the 1990s and the American housing and credit derivative debacle in 2008.

As a result, China's Gen Z is coming of age in an environment of reduced expectations. GDP growth will likely downshift to a more modest pace over the next decade. Investing in housing is no longer a one-way bet. The ""easy money"" in financial services, e-commerce, and real estate development has already been made. Youth unemployment remains troublingly high at nearly 19%, even after the government adjusted the formula to calculate it.

For all these headwinds, succumbing to the defeatist ""garbage time"" vibe is a spectacularly wrong bet. The best times to start something new are when capital is scarce, established business models are faltering, and talent is plentiful.

Remember America's slacker generation? Fortunately, not every Gen Xer decided to focus their time on bong hits and coffee shop guitar solos. Instead, we saw a string of companies founded, including Nvidia (1993), Amazon (1994), eBay (1995), and Netflix (1997) that would fundamentally transform the American economy. Many of these were not straight-line successes and even went through near-death experiences, but they scrapped through the famine years until they found their groove.

Two decades ago, China was embarking on explosive growth that would shake the world. That transformation was rooted in cheap and abundant labor, massive land privatization and development, and accommodative credit policies.

Today, those drivers have reached their structural limits. But China brings a whole new set of strengths to the table. China's young people would be well advised to bet on the forces that will create the next few decades of opportunities rather than pining for the past.

First, China is unquestionably an economic, scientific, and technological peer to the United States. It is an irreplaceable manufacturing powerhouse with a density of supply chains, logistics, and practical industrial expertise that outstrips rivals. In several sectors, including new energy vehicles, renewable energy, drones, and battery technology, China has leap-frogged American technology to the point where American producers rely on steep tariff barriers to survive.

By 2025, China is expected to generate nearly twice the number of STEM PhDs as the U.S. In 2022, the US Patent and Trade Office granted four times as many patents in AI to Chinese inventors as to Americans. While American universities still lead in fundamental research in many fields, China may, in many cases, be better positioned to commercialize basic science given its robust industrial base and scale manufacturing.

China's past success was often based on being a low-cost, fast follower. Today, there are a growing number of fields in which Chinese companies and technologies have the opportunity to set the global standard, including robotics, mobility, AI applications, and renewables. Competing to define new markets carries a high risk of failure, but the rewards for the winners can be immense.

The second reason for optimism is that China is better positioned to compete in specific regions that will make an outsized contribution to global growth in the decades to come. According to the United Nations, there has been a lot of attention to China's aging workforce and the resulting socio-economic pressures, with nearly half of the population projected to be over 60 by 2020. However, this demographic crisis is not exclusively a Chinese problem; it is afflicting most of the developed world.

When you look at the regions projected to continue to experience stable or growing populations, including Africa, Southeast Asia, and parts of South America and the Middle East, you will see that Chinese companies and technology are well suited to these markets. Much of the manufacturing boom in Southeast Asia has been fueled by Chinese management expertise and capital. If Africa is to experience a green power industrial future, it will likely be by deploying Chinese technology. China is such a significant player in South America that even Argentina's anti-socialist firebrand president, Javier Milei, has had to dial back his rhetoric.

Therefore, if a bright and ambitious Chinese young person doesn't like the prospects in their home country, there is a world of opportunity to prepare for and take a risk in the decades ahead. The most convincing reason not to succumb to ""garbage time"" futility is that even failure and frustration provide enormous opportunities for growth. Pessimism is an indulgence that no young person of talent can afford."
More China Stimulus And A Looming Port Strike,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/09/30/more-china-stimulus-and-a-looming-port-strike/,2024-09-30T12:32:09Z,"U.S. Chipmakers Fall On China's Potential Chip Sector Investments

As we head into the final day of both the month and quarter, stock index futures are trading down slightly in premarket. On Friday, both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite fell 0.3% and 0.4%, respectively. However, the Russell 2000 gained 0.7% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average moved higher by 0.5%. For the quarter, the S&P is up over 5% through Friday and over 1.5% for the month. The Nasdaq Composite is up over 2% for the quarter and 2.2% for the month.

One of the more interesting stories that I'm watching is what is taking place in China. With the Chinese economy struggling, the People's Bank of China (PBOC) has unleashed a plethora of tools aimed at stimulating the economy. Some of these I've already discussed, but they include a lowering of mortgage rates, funding for buying stocks by institutions and also assisting with share buyback programs. As a result, Chinese stocks have rallied sharply and are up another 8% Monday. It's the best performing day for China's market since 2008. While the stimulus measures are showing initial strength, as I mentioned on Friday, this is a major attempt at boosting markets and should it fail, I'm not sure what more China has to offer in terms of stimulus tools. Therefore, I'm very focused on whether or not stocks can hold their gains or if this is simply a short-term rally in a bear market.

On a side note, U.S. chipmakers are indicated lower in premarket trading. One of the potential concerns with respect to China's stimulus efforts is they may choose to begin heavily investing in their own chip sector. That could in turn lead to greater competition and cheaper alternatives as companies forge ahead with Artificial Intelligence (AI) related investments.

Back here at home, there are a number of significant newsworthy items. I'll start with the looming strike on the East Coast. The International Longshoremen's Association is set to go on strike tonight at midnight if a new contract isn't accepted. There are some 45,000 workers who could potentially strike, shutting down ports from Maine to Texas. According to The Wall Street Journal, the strike would impact imports of food, vehicles, heavy machinery, construction materials, chemicals, furniture, clothes and toys. The economic impact could cost the U.S. economy an estimated $3.8 - $4.5 billion per day. Companies that could be impacted by a strike include Walmart, Caterpillar, General Motors and others. This is definitely a situation worth monitoring, especially as we head into the holiday shopping season. Also, should the strike go on for an extended period of time, it could reintroduce inflationary pressures.

There are a couple of companies in the news this morning, starting with Stellantis. The automaker is warning on their forecast for gross profit margins. As a result, that stock is down 13% in premarket. I'll be curious how other automakers react to the Stellantis news, as well as the looming ports strike. AT&T is selling their 70% stake in DirectTV business to private equity firm TPG for $7.6 billion. At the same time, DirectTV announced this morning that they reached an agreement to purchase Dish, which is owned by EchoStar. The details are a bit complicated, but essentially result in DirectTV assuming $9.75 billion of Dish's debt. And lastly, shares of CVS are higher in premarket trading by 3%. The company is being pressured by activist shareholder Glenview Capital to make changes aimed at creating greater value.

In the broader economy, we are heading into what could be an interesting period. This is a heavy week for economic data with the theme being jobs. Tomorrow, we'll get the latest report on job openings and then Wednesday, a look at private, non-farm payroll hires. However, Friday will be the big day with the latest unemployment figures scheduled for release. I'll have more on that in my Wednesday piece.

For today, I'm watching the VIX which had a late day run on Friday. The VIX is up 2% in premarket and given the geopolitical issues as well as economic news coming, I can't say I'm too surprised. In addition, we're just under two weeks away from the beginning of earnings season and a month away from the election. Not to mention, October markets have a history of throwing child-like temper tantrums. Therefore, there are a lot of potential catalysts floating around and I think it's fair to suggest we could be in for some choppy trading. Like I suggested last Friday, it may be a good time to review your holdings and how your portfolio is positioned as we head into the final quarter for the year. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."
6 Financial Literacy Lessons For Small Business Owners,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/truetamplin/2024/09/30/6-financial-literacy-lessons-for-small-business-owners/,2024-09-30T06:21:59Z,"Small business ownership comes with numerous responsibilities, and understanding finances is essential for managing these tasks effectively. Whether you're just starting or have been in business for years, enhancing your financial literacy is crucial to navigating cash flow challenges, tax obligations, profitability, and risk management. This article will delve into essential financial concepts, tools, and strategies that will equip you to make informed decisions, manage your finances effectively, and position your business for long-term success.

Financial statements are indispensable tools for assessing your business's overall performance and making informed decisions. They provide a comprehensive view of your company's financial health, helping you monitor growth, address challenges, and guide future strategies. The three core financial statements are the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash flow statement.

The income statement, or profit and loss statement, details revenues, costs, and expenses to show whether your business was profitable during a specific period. Regularly reviewing this statement helps you assess performance and identify areas where you can reduce costs or improve profitability.

The balance sheet offers a snapshot of your company's financial position at a specific time, summarizing what your business owns (assets), owes (liabilities), and your equity. It reveals the business's long-term financial stability, which is essential for assessing how well your business can meet its financial obligations.

Lastly, the cash flow statement tracks the movement of cash in and out of your business, reflecting its liquidity and ability to meet short-term obligations, such as payroll, rent, and supplier payments. While the income statement focuses on profitability, the cash flow statement ensures you can keep operations running smoothly.

Maintaining a healthy cash flow is critical for your day-to-day operations. Many small businesses face cash flow challenges due to late customer payments, unexpected expenses, or seasonal fluctuations in sales.

One effective strategy for managing cash flow is prompt invoicing. Sending invoices immediately after delivering a product or service can reduce payment cycles and improve liquidity. You can also negotiate longer payment terms with suppliers or offer early payment discounts to customers, which can help extend cash availability.

Another strategy is to build a cash reserve to protect your business from shortages during slow periods or when unforeseen expenses arise.

Along with managing cash flow, creating and adhering to a budget is vital. A budget serves as a financial roadmap, guiding your resource allocation, controlling spending, and helping you achieve short- and long-term goals.

Start by accurately estimating revenue and separating fixed costs like rent and utilities from variable expenses, such as marketing or production costs. Regularly reviewing your budget against actual performance allows you to adjust projections, spot discrepancies, and refine your financial plans, ensuring that your business remains on a path to profitability.

Effective tax management is essential for small businesses to remain financially stable and avoid costly penalties. Understanding the different types of taxes your business is responsible for and filing them within deadlines is key to maintaining smooth operations.

Common taxes for small businesses include income tax, paid either through the business owner's tax return for sole proprietors and partnerships or as corporate tax for C-corporations. Sales tax is collected on taxable goods or services and remitted to the state, while payroll taxes are required for businesses with employees, covering contributions for Social Security, Medicare, and federal unemployment taxes. If you're a sole proprietor or freelancer, you'll also need to manage self-employment taxes.

You must follow tax deadlines to avoid penalties. Many businesses find that using accounting software helps automate tax tracking and filing, reducing the likelihood of errors. Stay on top of quarterly estimated tax payments to ensure compliance with income and self-employment taxes.

Use available deductions and credits to reduce your tax liabilities significantly. Deductions for office supplies, travel expenses, utilities, and even home office use can lower taxable income. Tax credits such as the Work Opportunity Tax Credit for hiring employees from specific target groups or energy efficiency credits provide additional tax relief. Strategic timing of income and expenses -- by either accelerating expenses or delaying income at year-end -- can further optimize your tax situation, depending on your financial outlook for the year.

External funding is often necessary, especially during expansion or when facing cash flow challenges. Traditional bank loans are a common source of financing, offering lump-sum funds at favorable interest rates, though they typically require strong credit and collateral.

Alternatively, lines of credit provide flexible financing, allowing you to borrow only what is needed and pay interest solely on the borrowed amount. Equity financing is another option, where you raise capital by selling ownership stakes, although this comes with the trade-off of relinquishing some control over your company. Government grants and loans, often available to specific industries or underrepresented groups, offer additional low-interest financing options.

While debt can be a powerful tool for growth, it must be managed carefully. Regularly monitor your debt levels to ensure your business is not over-leveraged. Prioritize repaying high-interest debt first, as this improves cash flow and reduces long-term interest expenses. Maintaining a healthy balance between debt and revenue ensures that your business can manage its financial obligations without taking on excessive risk.

Reinvesting profits into your business is one of the most effective ways to grow without taking on debt. Strategically using retained earnings can enhance your competitive position, improve productivity, and increase revenue.

One area where profits can be reinvested effectively is marketing. ""It used to be, if you were a small business, you did not have the aspects available to you that a big company with a marketing department, a budget, and access to other big companies had,"" comments Frank Vella, CEO of Constant Contact, in an interview. ""Now, with technology, even if you're a small business with a small marketing budget, you have access to almost all of the same technologies they have at a different scale,"" Vella adds.

You can reinvest in digital marketing campaigns, such as Facebook and Instagram ads, or enhance your search engine optimization (SEO) efforts with tools like Ahrefs or SEMrush. Email marketing is another valuable tool, and platforms like Mailchimp, Zoho Campaigns, or GetResponse enable you to create targeted campaigns that engage customers and nurture leads. Advancements in AI technology, such as Contant Contact's BrandKit, can even build automated marketing plans. These technologies make marketing a worthwhile reinvestment.

Another area of reinvestment are in technology and equipment to improve operational efficiency, helping you scale your business and reduce long-term costs. Upgrading outdated equipment or investing in new software to automate tasks will improve productivity and customer service. Expanding product offerings or services is another effective strategy, enabling you to capture a larger market share and drive additional revenue. Prioritizing these reinvestments ensures that your business continues to grow sustainably.

Every business faces various risks that can threaten its financial stability and long-term success. Understanding these risks and developing strategies to mitigate them is essential for safeguarding your operations.

Financial risks can stem from cash flow shortages, delayed payments, or poor debt management, as mentioned above. Market risks arise from external factors such as economic downturns, changing customer preferences, or increased competition. Operational risks include disruptions in supply chains, equipment failures, or internal inefficiencies that can slow down production or increase costs. Regulatory risks arise from changes in laws or compliance requirements, where failure to abide can result in fines or other legal liabilities. Additionally, cybersecurity risks have become a significant concern for businesses in the digital age. Cyberattacks, data breaches, AI-generated deep-fakes, and other security threats can cause considerable financial and reputational damage.

You should adopt a data-driven and proactive approach to manage these risks effectively. Regularly monitor metrics like cash flow, profit margins, and ROI for early identification of financial issues. Scenario planning -- evaluating potential outcomes like rising costs or fluctuating sales -- helps you anticipate and prepare for disruptions. You should also conduct operational audits to uncover inefficiencies and ensure systems are secure against internal and external threats to reduce vulnerabilities. Staying informed on regulatory changes helps ensure compliance, and using tools like predictive analytics can forecast market trends, enabling you to adjust strategies.

Incorporating these financial literacy lessons into your small business operations will help you manage your day-to-day responsibilities more effectively and position your business for success. Continuously refining your financial practices ensures that your business remains resilient, competitive, and primed for long-term growth."
How To Upskill Your Workforce With Artificial Intelligence (AI),Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/juliekratz/2024/09/29/how-to-upskill-your-workforce-with-artificial-intelligence-ai/,2024-09-29T12:06:17Z,"With employee tenures at organizations at record lows and an unemployment rate that's forecasted to remain lower than previous generations, it's critical that businesses rethink how to upskill their workforces. It isn't a surprise that artificial intelligence (AI) is entering the workplace, and it presents a clear opportunity to automate production and simple tasks, yet organizations need to remember that their people also need to be evolving and learning new skills, which AI can help power.

In my interview with Amy Clark, chief people officer at D2L, she said, ""For people leaders, the message is clear: prioritizing workforce upskilling is no longer optional; it's a strategic imperative. D2L's recent research reflects this urgency, revealing 75% of learning-and-development leaders feel a strong sense of urgency in equipping their organizations for the transformative effects of AI and automation.""

While many organizations have gravitated towards training their employees on AI, AI can help develop traditional soft skills or human skills as well. Clark comments, ""It's not just about technical skills. Our research also found that both employees and L&D leaders rank human skills, leadership and management skills as just as important to develop as AI and machine-learning expertise. Skills like critical thinking, creativity and emotional intelligence are essential for roles that require nuanced decision-making and people leadership.""

Clark's team is proactively addressing these needs by offering comprehensive upskilling programs that put employees in the driver's seat of their own professional development. Each employee receives an annual professional-development stipend that can be used to pursue credentialed courses that align with the company's evolving needs, including emergent technologies like AI -- but also other areas where human skills like business, communication, wellness and sustainability are in demand.

""In today's rapidly evolving job market, continuous skill development is crucial for organizational resilience and success. D2L's research highlights a significant gap: 83% of employees recognize the importance of ongoing skills development, yet only 51% have completed any formal education or training outside of work in the past five years. With the rise of generative AI further emphasizing the need for both technical and human skills, employers have a real opportunity to create learning opportunities that are relevant, practical and aligned to business goals. By clearly defining the specific skills and competencies employees will gain, organizations can increase buy-in and commitment, making the programs a valuable investment in their development rather than just another mandatory task,"" Malika Asthana, senior strategy and public affairs manager at D2L added.

Employees look to their current employer as the first place to develop additional skills. ""Forty-one percent of employees see their current employer as the first place they would turn to build job- or industry-specific skills. This far outpaces the 17% who would go directly to a community college and the 14% who would look to a university for the same needs. For employers, this is a clear call to action: investing in comprehensive career-development programs and transparent advancement pathways is essential. Employees are looking for guidance and curation of learning opportunities so they know that when they do invest their time, their employer will recognize the value,"" Clark found.

By upskilling in-house where employees already are, organizations create more long-term loyalty. People remember organizations that invested in their growth and development, believed in them and helped them to become better.

""To ensure that professional-development budgets are effectively spent, the learning opportunities offered to employees need to be relevant, outcomes-driven and directly applicable to employees' day-to-day work. When employees see the real-world value of the skills they're acquiring, they're more likely to view upskilling as a worthwhile investment in their future, rather than just another checkbox to tick,"" Clark commented.

Organizations can map skills to outcomes by illustrating how improved communication or leadership skills contributed to business outcomes. Perhaps, with leadership training of middle managers, they're able to improve productivity and engagement on the teams, or they find that using AI to deploy training programs helps reduce administrative costs. For the business impact it's critical that outcomes are shared with the organization to encourage more upskilling in the future.

AI is rapidly entering the workforce and automating tasks, but organizations must also focus on upskilling their employees. AI can help develop both technical skills and human skills, such as critical thinking, creativity and emotional intelligence. Upskilling in-house creates long-term loyalty as employees appreciate organizations that invest in their growth and development."
Poland's Economic Growth Is Threatened By Severe Labor Shortages,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lidiakurasinska/2024/09/26/polands-economic-growth-is-threatened-by-severe-labor-shortages/,2024-09-26T19:09:10Z,"Despite boasting the fastest GDP growth in the European Union and a record-low unemployment rate, Poland is facing significant threats to its economic prosperity due to severe labor shortages.

More than 80% of small and medium-sized enterprises report struggling to find enough workers. In some industries -- such as construction, manufacturing, transportation, and logistics -- staffing shortages affect half or more of the companies.

In an effort to attract more foreign workers and fill labor market gaps, the government is developing its first comprehensive migration strategy, expected to be unveiled by the end of the year.

Until now, Poland's migration policies have been largely reactive and lacked clearly defined long-term objectives, reducing the country's attractiveness to foreign workers and hampering investment.

According to a June study by the Polish Economic Institute, half of the companies surveyed said that labor shortages were a significant barrier to their operations. The problem is particularly severe in the construction industry, where nearly seven out of ten businesses are affected.

According to data from the Central Statistical Office (GUS), in the first quarter of this year, Polish employers reported 112,000 job vacancies that could not be filled despite active recruitment efforts. Estimates suggest that Poland's labor shortage could reach up to 1.5 million workers by 2026.

Some of the reasons behind Poland's labor shortages include low fertility rates and an aging population. Over the past 30 years, the birth rate decreased by 40% and currently stands at 1.33. The country's statistical agency forecasts that the population will continue to shrink in the coming decades and that between 2023 and 2060, the number of people of working age will decrease by at least 7 million.

Yet businesses seeking to employ migrants face many bureaucratic hurdles. Andrii Arkaniuk, employment legalization specialist at Contrain Group, a recruitment agency, says it can take eight to 10 months for a worker from outside the EU to receive a permit.

In August, 11 business associations urged the government to adopt a ""favorable approach to legal, sustainable labor immigration."" Many entrepreneurs are concerned that strict immigration policies will make it harder to hire workers.

Katarzyna Dębkowska, head of the Economic Foresight Team at the Polish Economic Institute, says developing a comprehensive, responsible, and selective migration policy should be one of the government's most urgent priorities.

""This is particularly important given that, over the past decade, Poland has shifted from a country with a negative net migration balance to one with a positive balance,"" Dębkowska says.

Approximately one million foreigners are employed in Poland, making up 6.6% of the total workforce. Of these, 68.7% come from Ukraine, followed by 11.4% from Belarus and 2.5% from Georgia.

Up to a third of Ukrainians in Poland are considering leaving the country, as they are employed in roles beneath their qualifications and see limited opportunities for advancement. This poses a serious risk for industries such as construction, transport, and logistics, which heavily rely on Ukrainian labor.

Arkaniuk believes Ukrainian refugees could significantly benefit the Polish economy if they were employed in positions that match their skills. However, the main challenge they face is the language barrier, as many do not speak Polish.

He suggests the government consider offering support for Polish language education, possibly through tax breaks or subsidies, to help Ukrainian workers integrate more effectively and fully contribute to the workforce."
How Universal's 'Wicked' Can Improve Retail Sales This Holiday Season,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pamdanziger/2024/09/26/how-universals-wicked-can-improve-retail-sales-this-holiday-season/,2024-09-26T12:35:00Z,"Universal Pictures' Wicked musical release, starring Ariana Grande as Glinda and Cynthia Erivo as Elphaba, is set to hit theaters on Wednesday, November 27, the day before Thanksgiving.

In advance, Universal has amassed an all-star lineup of retailers and brands, counting on the two witches from Oz to wave their magic wands and generate excitement in a consumer market that has been spooked by ""bad juju.""

Collaborations will cover apparel, accessories, footwear, home decor, beauty toys, role play, publishing, collectibles and more. Aldo, Ariana Grande's r.e.m. Beauty, Beekman 1802, Build-A-Bear, Bombas, Bloomingdale's, Crocs, Fisher-Price, Forever 21, H&M, Hallmark, Hasbro, Hot Topic, Kohl's, Rebecca Minkoff, Target, Vera Bradley, Walmart and many more are on the Wicked train.

Ulta Beauty just announced its Wicked multibrand lineup will hit stores October 6, explaining in a statement, ""The Wicked-themed collection defines beauty norms, empowering beauty enthusiasts to embrace their truest selves."" Ulta needs some good magic this holiday season as comparable sales declined 1.2% in its most recent quarter.

And it's not just Ulta that needs a lift. Consumers are spooked by the economy, and retailers hope good witch Glinda will cast a spell to get them to come out and spend in the critical holiday season ahead.

The Conference Board just announced that in September the Consumer Confidence Index fell by seven points, the largest drop in the last three years. And its Present Situation Index was off over ten points based on consumers' assessment of current business and labor market conditions.

""The deterioration across the Index's main components likely reflected consumer's concerns about the labor market and reactions to fewer hours, slower payroll increases, fewer job openings -- even if the labor market remains quite healthy, with low unemployment, few layoffs and elevated wages,"" The Conference Board's chief economist Dana M. Peterson said in a statement.

The fact that the Bureau of Labor Statistics just revised its previous 12-month job number down by 818,000 didn't help people's confidence in the job market.

The National Retail Federation (NRF) just released its Halloween spending forecast and predicts it will come in about 5% less than last year's, down from $12.2 billion to $11.6 billion this year.

""Halloween marks the official transition to the fall season for many Americans,"" NRF Vice President of Industry and Consumer Insights Katherine Cullen said in a statement.

As such, Halloween, along with back-to-school (BTS) shopping, are guides to how the coming holiday retail season will turn out. And BTS doesn't look promising either.

Back-to-school forecasts were off 5%, dropping from $41 billion in 2023 to $39 billion this year. Back-to-college spending was off even more, down 7% from $94 billion last year to $87 billion this year, according to the NRF.

In the NRF's September economic outlook, released before The Conference Board's report, it tried to put a positive spin on where the economy stands. ""The U.S. economy is clearly not in a recession nor is it likely to head into a recession in the home stretch of 2024. Instead, it appears that the economy is on the cusp of nailing a long-awaited soft landing with a simultaneous cooling of growth and inflation.""

Yet, The Conference Board's Expectations Index stands at 81.7 points, within striking distance of hitting 80 points, which typically signals a recession ahead.

""The proportion of consumers anticipating a recession over the next 12 months remained low but there was a slight uptick in the percentage of consumers believing the economy was already in recession,"" Peterson said.

While the Census Department's Monthly Retail Trade Survey shows retail, excluding motor vehicles and gasoline stations, has increased 3.7% through August, if you take food services out, retail sales have only advanced 1.5%, from $3.28 trillion to $3.33 trillion. These three categories are excluded from NRF's core retail tracking.

Nonstore retailers, the core retail sector's largest category, has grown 8.3% this year, and it certainly will continue to advance this holiday season.

However, other categories in retail are languishing. Furniture and home stores are off 5%, building materials and supplies down 2%, sporting goods and hobby declined 3.5% and department stores continue to struggle with revenues down 1% this year.

While inflation is well off highs reached in mid-2022, retail prices are still about 20% higher in most spending categories since runaway inflation took hold. For example, Bankrate found that only about 6 percent of the nearly 400 items tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) are cheaper now than they were back in 2020.

In response, shoppers are widely trading down to less premium goods, according to McKinsey and Company's third quarter ConsumerWise survey among 4,000 U.S. consumers. Some 76% of consumers surveyed, including 86% of GenZ and Millennials, are trading down to save money.

And particularly among the younger cohort, a social media-driven trend called ""underconsumption core"" is taking hold. CNN reported that these young people are pushing back against influencers who urge followers to buy the next new fashion trend, beauty product or hot gadget.

They are opting instead to show off how well they are making do without, and helping to save the planet in the process.

""It's really pushing back against this idea that you need to constantly be buying things to have a happy and fulfilling life,"" Megan Doherty Bea, assistant professor of consumer science at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, shared with CNN.

The NRF has yet to announce its Winter Holiday forecast, but at the start of the year, it predicted core retail growth would be in the 2.5% to-3.5% range and reach between $5.23 trillion and $5.28 trillion by year end. However, as of August, retail growth is only about half that.

While NRF nailed its Winter Holiday 2023 forecast last year, with retail sales up 3.8% over November-December to reach $964.4 billion, retail will need to make up for the shortfall its experienced through the first eight months of this year to hit NRF's full-year forecast.

That looks increasingly unlikely, given current consumer sentiment and all the other unknowns we face, as McKinsey warns, ""The next few months may be turbulent. Market uncertainty, the upcoming U.S. general election and ongoing geopolitical conflicts may test U.S. consumers' faith in the economy.""

One hit movie can't be expected to singlehandedly lift holiday retail sales. Yet excitement generated by Wicked could bring consumers out of their funk and get them engaged for the holiday season.

Regardless, it's going to take a lot of powerful witchcraft to overcome retail's headwinds going into the last months of the year."
Gen Z Demands Flexible Workplace Benefits,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jefffromm/2024/09/25/gen-z-demands-flexible-workplace-benefits/,2024-09-25T15:51:41Z,"Gen Z is asking for more from their employer: mental health days, work from home two days a week, legal insurance, pet insurance, travel perks, tuition assistance, college debt relief, access to live event tickets and even ""emergency fund"" access. The office gym is, now, the price of admission and yesterday's news.

The inherent tension is that older employees didn't have access to this range of benefits when they were at the same point in their career journey. Some will begrudge younger workers from access to a broader benefit suite because it doesn't fit into their old framework. Flexible benefits is today's new CHRO mantra.

Did you realize that 27% of the workforce will be comprised of Gen Z in 2025?

A 2023 report from Workhuman iQ, found that flexibility is a key indicator for whether an employee is happy with their work arrangement. Additionally, Gallup has found that exclusively remote and hybrid employees tend to have significantly higher employee engagement than on-site workers.

We've heard the myths before with Millennials -- this generation of young people is lazy, entitled and unrealistic. Will Gen Z be even more difficult to work with? Or is this really just new expectations fueled by a combination of new ""Covid-19 rules,"" technology that allows for increased collaboration from anywhere and other trends?

Daniel Pink, author of seven NY Times best-selling books commented, ""I don't buy the idea that younger employees don't work as hard as their elders. Every incumbent generation in history has said that about the generation rising behind them. Geez, people used to say that about Gen-Xers like me -- and now they're saying we're deranged workaholics and relentless taskmasters! Instead, as people live and work longer, the deeper need to to rethink the structure of career paths and the nature of jobs. For instance, with lots of people in their 60s still working, and with a small and fixed number of top executive positions, companies would do well to create new roles -- like senior scientist or team coaches or master mentors. Likewise, I'm a fan of reverse mentorship programs, where these supposedly slacker young employees share their insights and guidance on technology and social trends with their older colleagues. The new normal is going to be more idiosyncratic, nonlinear career paths and job categories people never imagined.""

Let's face it I contribute to Forbes, but I don't live in NYC. That wouldn't have been likely when I graduated college in the late 1980s. As a Gen Xer I certainly got tired of hearing the term ""slackers"" too.

The U.S. unemployment rate is hovering at 4.2% which is well below the long term average of 5.69%. Employers want to retain quality employees and the labor pool remains thin at this point. One of the old ages is people quit their boss.

However, companies have an obligation to create a strong employment brand and build emotional connections with employees. Emotional connections help tip the scales slightly to the companies' advantage when employees get poached.

Cris Grossmann, CEO of Beekeeper. Cris added, ""35-55% of front line workers changed job in the last twelve months. Employee retention becomes a big issue. Access to communications and benefits needs to be available to all employees.""

A GWI Report highlighted that Gen Z is the most likely of any generation to say they have a mental health condition - and they are also the least comfortable talking about the condition.

Megan Gerhardt, Ph.D. and author ""Gentelligence: The Revolutionary Approach To Leading An Intergenerational Workforce"" confirmed there is a shift in norms with respect to expectations on both sides -- employer and employee.

Gerhardt and I spoke by Zoom and she said, ""Generational differences need to be embraced. Generational shaming isn't helpful. Gen Z is coming to work with a different psychological contract. The generational norm of today is that we ask for the things we want.""

Gerhardt elaborated, ""The older Gen Z's had only been at work for a few year's at most when the pandemic occurred and this was a formative phase in their work journey. Work and health were conflicting priorities during Covid. If you are sick don't go into work. And for the first time many company leaders were checking in on the mental health of their employees at scale. Further, many employees were questioning is my work site safe. Gen Z had a front row seat to the issue of mental health at work.""

Now fast forward to today. Employers are expected to check on employees mental health. Gen Z does not see a stigma around mental health as a topic they discuss not only with peers but at work. It is no longer unusual to share my current state of mind.

Payroll Integrations 2024 State of Employee Wellness Report highlighted that only 24% of Gen Zers completely understand their company's benefits. Given the importance Gen Z employees place on employee benefits this ""lack of understanding"" gap is an employer brand opportunity. You have a workforce that wants more unique benefits and a communications gap around what the company has made available and their future roadmap to flexible benefits.

Doug Sabella, CEO of Payroll Integrations remarked, ""Many Gen Zers are leaving money on the table at a time that is crucial for them to start to support their financial future. Further, Gen Z turnover may be impacted by this lack of understanding around benefits because they don't fully understand what's offered.""

Missy Plohr-Memming, a MetLife executive focused on group benefits, noted the impacts of Covid on tribal knowledge, ""Entering the workforce during and post-pandemic, many Gen Z employees have primarily experienced remote or hybrid work, limiting their opportunities for casual, 'water-cooler' conversations and sharing about benefits with colleagues.""

While attending the HR & Tech Conference it's clear we're witnessing an explosion in employee benefits. Companies are rapidly competing to offer more innovative and personalized packages. What was once a landscape dominated by basic health insurance and retirement plans has transformed into a vibrant ecosystem of offerings tailored to the diverse needs of today's workforce. Wellness programs, mental health support, flexible work, financial planning tools, and experiences like live events are becoming essential for attracting and retaining talent. As workforce expectations shift, employees seek meaningful support that enhances their overall well-being.

Adam Rossbach, a live event expert and TFL President commented, ""Companies embracing this change will stay competitive and boost employee engagement and productivity. The benefits landscape is transforming the way businesses create emotional connections with their employees who are often the first line of contact to the brand experience.""

Cristina Goldt, a GM at Workday noted the power of technology in creating flexibility, ""By harnessing AI and employee sentiment data, companies can gain a real-time understanding of how their Gen Z workforce uses and feels about their benefit options. Increasing this transparency enables companies to tailor their benefits offerings - whether it's enhancing mental health support, offering coverage for pets, or improving paid leave options - and invest in the benefits that their employees truly want.""

Gen Z wants more transparency and a sense of company values. The truth is I'd label this a Gen Z mindset as older generations appreciate the same but Gen Z started this trend.

David Klein, VP of Talent at Spirit Airlines & Recognition Professionals International board member, is currently spearheading transformational change. He added, ""Gen Z is a purpose-driven generation, which emphasizes the need for HR executives to be transparent and aligned with a broader mission when leading change. It's essential to personalize communication, focusing on the 'why' behind the change, allowing Gen Z team members to see their role in the organization's purpose. This connection fosters greater commitment and motivation.""

Generational shaming is a losing strategy. Gen Z isn't going to be more difficult to work with, but they will be different. And different means making adjustments in the employer-employee compact.

We all know how to work with Gen Xers since we've been doing that for decades.

Understanding both the need to adjust and the root causes will enable senior executives to build a powerful HR brand that's both flexible and enduring."
Beijing Begins To Face Demographic Reality And Raises Retirement Ages,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/miltonezrati/2024/09/25/beijing-begins-to-face-demographic-reality-and-raises-retirement-ages/,2024-09-25T15:51:27Z,"Authorities in China have finally responded to the nation's demographic strains -- on the state pension system and on the economy generally. They have raised statutory retirement ages. For years, such matters were far from the minds of leadership in Beijing. Because China could count on a huge flow of young people into the workforce, it could support one of the youngest retirement ages in the world. The flow of young workers provided productive strength and a torrent of funds for the nation's pension system. Chinese society could easily afford to move workers along into retirement. But things have changed. Decades of the one-child policy have now left China with a paucity of young workers. No longer does the economy have access to so many young hands and minds or the funds they once poured into the state pension scheme. Beijing has had to respond.

Accordingly, the authorities have announced a jump in statutory retirement ages. Men, who previously could go onto the pension scheme at 60 years of age will now have to work until 63. For women in blue collar jobs, the retirement age will rise from 50 at present to 55. Women in other lines of work will see their statutory retirement age rise from 55 presently to 58. So as not to shock those just approaching the old statutory ages, the increase, the authorities have announced, will take place gradually over the next 15 years.

Demographic trends will no doubt require another such adjustment. Decades of the one-child policy have already left China with twice the number of retirees for each person of working age than was the case 25 years ago. The implicit pressure of this situation has already impelled the authorities in Beijing to loosen the old one-child rules, but as it has turned out, Chinese householders are no more interested in having more children than they were under the old law's strictures. Matters will then likely become still more intense in coming years, demanding additional adjustments in the retirement age among other accommodations. Even had fertility rates risen with the loosening of the old law, it would be 15-20 years before rising birth rates could affect the labor situation and pension flows. As it is, no such relief is coming.

China's planners have inadvertently compounded this situation. Some years ago, they decided that the unfolding Chinese economy would require vast numbers of engineering and science graduates. They pushed youth to go this route and financed it. For years, China graduated more engineers than just about the rest of the world combined. But as it has turned out, the economy has less need for all these graduates than the planners anticipated. Many young graduates cannot find work appropriate to their level of education and remain unemployed rather than take a menial job. At last measure, China's youth unemployment rate stood at almost 19 percent. So, in addition to having fewer young workers than are needed, quite a large portion of the young population seems to have opted out of the active workforce even as China already faces a shortage of factory workers.

Beijing thus had little choice. Keeping working men and those women in white collar jobs at work for three additional years and women in blue collar jobs at work for an additional five years gives time to assemble enough young workers to take their place in the tax-paying, production part of China's economy. It also means that existing workers will pay into the pension system and not draw on it for 3-5 more years than they would have under the old retirement laws. And since the new rules are not likely to change life expectancy, the new retirement rules will have those drawing on the system for 3-5 years less than they would have under the old system.

Given the still low fertility rates in China, this hike in the retirement age will not be the last. Likely even before the 15-year transition ends, Beijing will have to raise the statutory retirement ages again. To be sure, similar pressures exist in Japan, Europe, and the United States, but nowhere as acutely as in China."
Immigration expert warns Black Americans are being impacted by migrants 'flooding their communities',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/immigration-expert-warns-black-americans-impacted-migrants-flooding-their-communities,2024-09-25T14:13:11Z,"Founder of NumbersUSA Roy Beck has written extensively on the impact that large amounts of immigration has had on employment for Black Americans. He is the author of ""Back of the Hiring Line.""

A top conservative immigration expert is arguing that a recent surge in immigration into the U.S. is likely to have a heavy impact on the job prospects of Black Americans -- just as the Census Bureau found that foreign workers had made gains in the job market.

Data released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, an arm of the Department of Labor, shows native-born Americans lost more than 1.3 million jobs over the last 12 months, while foreign-born workers gained more than 1.2 million jobs.

As of August of this year, there are 129,712,000 native-born workers compared to 131,031,000 in August 2023, meaning a plummeting reduction of 1,319,000 jobs.

JOBS REPORT IS A BOOM FOR MIGRANTS, SLUM FOR AMERICANS

In comparison, there were 31,636,000 foreign-born workers in the U.S. as of last month, compared to 30,396,000 in August 2023, a surge of 1,240,000 jobs.

Roy Beck, who founded the group NumbersUSA which argues for lower levels of immigration, recently published ""Back of the Hiring Line: A 200-Year History of Immigration Surges, Employer Bias, and Depression of Black Wealth.""

In that book, he outlines the history of government-induced migration impacting heavily on the prospects of Black Americans the most.

""Economic historians say that every time that immigration has gone to a high percentage, the incomes of black males have gone down and that income and that income disparity, racial disparity increases,"" he said. ""Every time you reduce immigration, the livelihoods of black families and black men increase.""

SURGE OF FOREIGN-BORN WORKERS REMAKE AMERICAN JOBS MARKET

August statistics show that the unemployment rate for adult men is 4% and adult women is 3.7%. For White Americans, it is 3.8%, and for Black Americans, it is 6.1%. The White House noted in May that the unemployment rate for Black workers - then at 5.6% in April - was still lower than the average unemployment rate for Black Americans for 2016 to 2020 (about 8%) and 2000 to 2015 (11%).

However, Beck argues that, while foreigners will often create jobs as well, some jobs that are taken by foreign workers would otherwise go to Americans of all races -- and he argues that racial discrimination often means that Black Americans are hired last.

""There is still racial discrimination that happens among many employers and there's a tendency that the last people recruited are the descendants of American slavery,"" he said. ""And so African-Americans, the descendants of American slavery, have always done best -- all Americans have done best -- but they've really done best in tight labor markets. And immigration is not the only thing that dictates loose and tight labor market, but it's something you can control.""

""The government can control how many foreign workers it brings in, he said. ""But over the last three and a half years, there's been virtually no control at all. I mean, we've never seen numbers, anything like the new foreign workers that have come over the last three and a half years,"" he said.

As to why this is not a bigger issue for Black civil rights leaders, he said that major national leaders have not been speaking out, but some at the local level are getting louder.

""What you have is more and more black leaders in the communities, places like Chicago and Philadelphia and Houston, more and more, you're seeing local black leaders who have their ear on the ground, their eyes on the ground, who are speaking out more and more.""

However, he blames national leaders for turning a blind eye due to ""political alliances.""

""The tragic thing is that part of it seems to be that the Black leaders feel like they have to make an alliance with Hispanic political leaders. But the fact is that polls show that a majority of Hispanic Americans don't want this high immigration either,"" he said.

""At some point, these leaders are going to get left behind because the people in the local communities are going to just stop putting up with national leaders who just insist on flooding their communities with workers that aren't needed and with people for whom there isn't housing for them."""
Financial Heavyweights Offer Mixed Forecasts On Fed's Next Move,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danirvine/2024/09/25/financial-heavyweights-offer-mixed-forecasts-on-feds-next-move/,2024-09-25T13:00:10Z,"The decision by the Federal Reserve to slash interest rates by an aggressive 50 basis points has ignited lively discourse among financial titans, each offering their unique perspectives on the potential ramifications. As the economy teeters on the precipice of uncertainty, the question that looms large is whether this monetary maneuver will catalyze a soft landing or precipitate a tumultuous descent.

Leading the optimistic camp is Goldman Sachs, with its chief financial officer, Denis Coleman, expressing confidence that the Fed's decisive action has paved the way for averting a recession. Coleman's remarks during an interview with CNBC this week resonate with the sentiment that the 50 basis-point cut signals a new trajectory for monetary policy.

In Coleman's estimation, the rate reduction should ""unlock incremental amounts of confidence"" and ""reduce the cost of capital,"" thereby fostering an environment conducive to strategic business initiatives as the year draws to a close. His projections envision a ripple effect, wherein the lower interest rates will invigorate investment backlogs and catalyze increased market activity in the forthcoming year.

Echoing the consensus among Goldman Sachs economists, Coleman insists that a recession remains an unlikely scenario. Instead, he anticipates a gradual economic recovery, particularly in Europe, fueled by an uptick in investment once the presidential election concludes and manufacturing gains momentum, buoyed by the favorable interest rate environment.

The Fed's decision to embark on this rate-cutting cycle was framed by Chair Jerome Powell as a ""recalibration"" of policy, a response to the evolving dynamics of falling inflation and rising employment risks. This recalibration, according to Coleman, aims to strike a delicate balance, enabling the central bank to lower inflation without tipping the economy into a recessionary vortex - a feat he acknowledges as a ""tricky job to manage economies through transition.""

Austan Goolsbee, the President of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, has emerged as a vocal proponent of a dovish monetary policy stance. In remarks delivered at the National Association of State Treasurers Annual Conference this week, he advocated for ""many more rate cuts over the next year"" to facilitate a soft landing for the economy.

Goolsbee's rationale is anchored in the observation that inflation has ""way down"" from its peak and has recently converged around the Fed's 2% target. Concurrently, the 4.2% unemployment rate is widely regarded as indicative of full employment, aligning with the central bank's dual mandate.

Despite the favorable economic conditions, Goolsbee emphasizes the incongruity of maintaining elevated interest rates, which he deems unsuitable for an environment where the primary objective is to sustain, rather than cool, the economy. This dissonance, he argues, necessitates a significant downward adjustment of rates to preserve the prevailing economic equilibrium.

Goolsbee's advocacy for preemptive rate cuts stems from a desire to remain proactive in steering the economy toward a soft landing. His stance is encapsulated in the notion that ""if we want a soft landing, we can't be behind the curve,"" a sentiment that resonates with the Fed's mandate to maintain a delicate balance between inflation and employment.

While Goldman Sachs exudes optimism, JPMorgan Chase's Chief Executive Officer, Jamie Dimon, strikes a more skeptical tone. Dimon's reservations stem from a belief that inflation may not dissipate as readily as anticipated, casting doubt on the notion of a seamless soft landing for the economy.

Dimon's skepticism is rooted in his conviction that ""inflation is going to go away so easily,"" as he stated on stage at The Atlantic Festival last week. This sentiment stands in stark contrast to the prevailing narrative of cooling inflationary pressures, as evidenced by the recent 2.5% year-over-year increase in overall inflation - a figure that suggests a moderating trend.

Dimon's assessment of the likelihood of a soft landing for the U.S. economy remains cautiously optimistic, hovering around a 35% to 40% chance, highlighting his reluctance to ""count [his] eggs"" prematurely.

Ultimately, the resolution of this debate will unfold over time as the economy responds to the Fed's monetary maneuvers and the interplay of various macroeconomic forces. Divergent discourse is a testament to the enduring complexity of economic forecasting, where nuanced insights and prudent risk management strategies will remain invaluable assets for navigating the next chapter of this saga."
American Consumer Confidence Plunges As The Job Market Weakens,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/09/24/american-consumer-confidence-plunges-as-the-job-market-weakens/,2024-09-24T21:09:59Z,"The latest Consumer Confidence Index reveals a significant downturn in Americans' economic outlook, raising concerns about the health of the economy and job market in the United States.

The Conference Board, a nonpartisan think tank that provides analysis on future trends, reported on Tuesday that consumer confidence plummeted to 98.7 in September from 105.6 in August, marking the steepest decline in three years.

""Consumer confidence dropped in September to near the bottom of the narrow range that has prevailed over the past two years,"" Dana M. Peterson, chief economist at the Conference Board, said in a statement. ""September's decline was the largest since August 2021 and all five components of the Index deteriorated.""

The index, a key indicator of consumer attitudes and purchasing intentions, reveals that Americans are increasingly skeptical about the job market, with a rising number of respondents describing jobs as ""hard to get."" This perception has intensified, jumping from 16.8% in August to 18.3% in September.

""The deterioration across the Index's main components likely reflected consumers' concerns about the labor market and reactions to fewer hours, slower payroll increases, fewer job openings -- even if the labor market remains quite healthy, with low unemployment, few layoffs and elevated wages,"" Peterson added.

The Consumer Confidence Index paints a bleak picture of American sentiment, highlighting widespread negativity about current business conditions and a growing pessimism regarding future labor market prospects.

The data shows a noticeable decrease in the percentage of consumers who view jobs as ""plentiful,"" dropping from 32.7% in August to 30.9% in September.

Pessimism about future employment prospects also increased, with more people anticipating fewer jobs available in the coming months, rising from 17.0% to 18.3%.

The decline in consumer confidence was particularly significant among individuals aged 35 to 54 and those with annual incomes below $50,000, suggesting that anxiety about the job market is especially prevalent among middle-aged workers and lower-income groups.

The Federal Reserve's move last week to reduce interest rates reflects that the central bank also has a growing unease about the labor market, as it seeks to counteract signs of a ""cooling"" job landscape.

In July, the unemployment rate in the U.S. increased to 4.3%, marking its highest level since October 2021, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rate remained relatively stable at 4.2% last month.

By focusing on the labor market, the Fed aims to correct course and bolster confidence among consumers and businesses alike.

If consumer confidence continues to plummet, it could have a significant long-term impact on American workers. A prolonged drop in consumer confidence often leads to decreased consumer spending, as individuals become more cautious about their financial futures, opting to save rather than spend on non-essential goods and services.

This reduction in spending can create a ripple effect throughout the economy, causing businesses to experience lower revenues and profits. Companies may then implement hiring freezes, layoffs or reduce working hours to mitigate costs.

As businesses adopt a more conservative approach to expansion and investment, the rate of job creation is likely to slow down, resulting in fewer new job openings and increased competition for available positions, which could lead to stagnating wages.

Moreover, a persistent decline in consumer confidence would shift job market dynamics, with more individuals turning to freelance or contract work as full-time positions become scarcer, unemployment rates increase and people experience longer periods of joblessness."

Today's average mortgage rate on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage is 6.65%, up 0.04 percentage point from the previous week, according to Curinos.

Borrowers may be able to save on interest costs by going with a 15-year fixed mortgage, which will typically have a lower rate than a 30-year, fixed-rate home loan. The average APR on a 15-year fixed mortgage is 5.74%. However, a 15-year mortgage means you are paying off the house in half the amount of time compared to a 30-year term, so your monthly payments will be higher.

30-Year Mortgage Rates

Today, the average rate on a 30-year mortgage is 6.65%, compared to last week when it was 6.61%.

The annual percentage rate (APR) on a 30-year, fixed-rate mortgage is 6.67%. The APR was 6.62% last week. APR is the all-in cost of your loan.

With today's interest rate of 6.65%, a 30-year fixed mortgage of $100,000 costs approximately $642 per month in principal and interest (taxes and fees not included), the Forbes Advisor mortgage calculator shows. Borrowers will pay about $131,179 in total interest over the life of the loan.

15-Year Mortgage Rates

Today, the 15-year mortgage rate sits at 5.71%, higher than it was one day ago. Last week, it was 5.69%.

On a 15-year fixed, the APR is 5.74%. Last week it was 5.69%.

At today's interest rate of 5.71%, a 15-year fixed-rate mortgage would cost approximately $828 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. You would pay around $49,117 in total interest over the life of the loan.

Jumbo Mortgage Rates

Today's average interest rate on a 30-year fixed-rate jumbo mortgage climbed 0.08 point from last week to 6.76%.

Borrowers with a 30-year, fixed-rate jumbo mortgage with today's interest rate of 6.76% will pay approximately $649 per month in principal and interest per $100,000. On a $750,000 jumbo mortgage, the monthly principal and interest payment would be approximately $4,867.

What's an APR, and Why Is It Important?

APR, or annual percentage rate, is a calculation that includes both a loan's interest rate and a loan's finance charges, expressed as an annual cost over the life of the loan. In other words, it's the total cost of credit. APR accounts for interest, fees and time.

Since APRs include both the interest rate and certain fees associated with a home loan, the APR can help you understand the total cost of a mortgage if you keep it for the entire term. The APR will usually be higher than the interest rate, but there are exceptions.

How Are Mortgage Rates Determined?

Mortgage interest rates are determined by several factors, including some that borrowers can't control:

Federal Reserve. The Fed rate hikes and decreases adjust the federal funds rate, which helps determine the benchmark interest rate that banks lend money at. As a result, mortgage rates tend to move in the same direction with the Fed's rate decision. Bond market. Mortgages are also loosely connected to long-term bond yields as investors look for income-producing assets -- specifically, the 10-year U.S. Treasury Bond. Home loan rates tend to increase as bond prices decrease, and vice versa. Economic health. Rates can increase during a strong economy when consumer demand is higher and unemployment levels are lower. Anticipate lower rates as the economy weakens and there is less demand for mortgages. Inflation. Banks and lenders may increase rates during inflationary periods to slow the rate of inflation. Additionally, inflation makes goods and services more expensive, reducing the dollar's purchasing power.

While the above factors set the base interest rate for new mortgages, there are several areas that borrowers can focus on to get a lower rate:

Credit score. Applicants with a credit score of 670 or above tend to have an easier time qualifying for a better interest rate. Typically, most lenders require a minimum score of 620 to qualify for a conventional mortgage. Debt-to-income (DTI) ratio. Lenders may issue mortgages to borrowers with a DTI of 50% or less. However, applying with a DTI below 43% is recommended. Loan-to-value (LTV) ratio. Conventional home loans charge private mortgage insurance when your LTV exceeds 80% of the appraisal value, meaning you need to put at least 20% down to avoid higher rates. Additionally, FHA mortgage insurance premiums expire after the first 11 years when you put at least 10% down. Loan term. Longer-term loans such as a 30-year or 20-year mortgage tend to charge higher rates than a 15-year loan term. However, your monthly payment can be more affordable over a longer term. Residence type. Interest rates for a primary residence can be lower than a second home or an investment property. This is because the lender of your primary mortgage receives compensation first in the event of foreclosure.

What Is the Best Type of Mortgage Loan?

Conventional home loans are issued by private lenders and typically require good or excellent credit and a minimum 20% down payment to get the best rates. Some lenders offer first-time home buyer loans and grants with relaxed down payment requirements as low as 3%.

For buyers with limited credit or finances, a government-backed loan is usually the better option as the minimum loan requirements are easier to satisfy.

For example, FHA loans can require 3.5% down with a minimum credit score of 580 or at least 10% down with a credit score between 500 and 579. However, upfront and annual mortgage insurance premiums can apply for the life of the loan.

Buyers in eligible rural areas with a moderate income or lower may also consider USDA loans. This program doesn't require a down payment, but you pay an upfront and annual guarantee fee for the life of the loan.

If you come from a qualifying military background, VA loans can be your best option. First, you don't need to make a down payment in most situations. Second, borrowers pay a one-time funding fee but don't pay an annual fee as the FHA and USDA loan programs require.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

What is a good mortgage rate?

A competitive mortgage rate currently ranges from 6% to 8% for a 30-year fixed loan. Several factors impact mortgage rates, including the repayment term, loan type and borrower's credit score.

How to get a lower mortgage interest rate?

Comparing lenders and loan programs is an excellent start. Borrowers should also strive for a good or excellent credit score between 670 and 850 and a debt-to-income ratio of 43% or less.

Further, making a minimum down payment of 20% on conventional mortgages can help you automatically waive private mortgage insurance premiums, which increases your borrowing costs. Buying discount points or lender credits can also reduce your interest rate.

How long can you lock in a mortgage rate?

Most rate locks last 30 to 60 days and your lender may not charge a fee for this initial period. However, extending the rate lock period up to 90 or 120 days is possible, depending on your lender, but additional costs may apply.

Opinion | Harris is finally catching up to Trump on the all-important economy question,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/harris-finally-catching-trump-important-economy-question-rcna171994,2024-09-23T18:03:24Z,"If this result holds up, it could be fatal to the former president's chances of winning back the White House.

It's one of the enduring mysteries of American politics: Despite the irrefutable evidence that the economy performs better under Democratic presidents by almost any measure, much of the voting public remains convinced that Republicans are better economic stewards. But if recent polling is accurate, glimmers of sense are breaking through. In several recent polls, Vice President Kamala Harris has nearly erased former President Donald Trump's advantage on the question of which candidate would be better for the economy. If this result holds up, it could be fatal to his chances of winning back the White House. It would be nice if this change were a testament to the voters' rationality and keen economic understanding. But it isn't.

In the latest NBC News poll -- with a margin of error of 3.1 percentage points -- voters give Trump a 50-41 advantage on ""dealing with the economy."" That 9-point deficit may not sound like good news for Harris, until you learn that at the beginning of the year, Trump's advantage over President Joe Biden on that question was more than 20 points.

Other polls have shown even better results for Harris. A CBS News/YouGov poll found that Trump leads by only 53-47 among those who say the economy is a major factor in their vote. A Fox News poll showed Trump ahead of Harris by 5 points on this measure. An AP-NORC poll showed Trump leading Harris by only 2 points on who voters trust on the economy. A Quinnipiac poll of swing states found a similar gap. A Morning Consult poll show the two tied on the same question. And a Financial Times/University of Michigan poll found Harris leading by 2 points. (The CBS result lies outside the margin of error, while all the other poll findings are within those surveys' margin of error.)

While the numbers vary somewhat, the overall trend is clear: Voters are much more favorably inclined toward the Democratic nominee on the economy than they used to be -- which is a huge win for Harris. Before Biden exited the race, Trump was obliterating him on these economic questions, even though Biden's economic stewardship was worlds ahead of Trump's.

The lead Trump enjoyed earlier in the year can be attributed to a combination of amnesia, delusion, and the widely shared sense that the 81-year-old Biden just wouldn't be up to the job in a second term. Voters somehow forgot how Trump's mismanagement of the pandemic made the inevitable downturn deeper and more difficult to recover from.

The former president may be fond of asking, ""Are you better off now than you were four years ago?"" But the appropriate answer is, ""Are you kidding?"" Four years ago the economy was 10 million jobs in the hole from pre-pandemic levels. The unemployment rate was still 7.8% (today it's 4.2%). Even before the pandemic, Trump also ballooned the deficit, which Republicans pretend to care about, with tax cuts aimed at the wealthy.

Even if you want to excuse Trump from blame for the pandemic recession (which you shouldn't), Biden's economic performance was almost miraculous: millions of jobs created, growth steady, a dramatic surge in manufacturing investment directly spurred by his industrial policy, and an economy that has significantly outperformed our global peers in recovering from the pandemic. That outperformance includes inflation, which spiked globally due to snarled supply chains and corporate price gouging, and which the U.S. recovered from more quickly than peer nations.

Yet millions still believe that not just prices but everything was better under Trump. NPR recently interviewed one Georgia voter who said she's supporting Trump ""because her investments were doing better when he was in office."" Unless she invested in Trump NFTs, it's hard to imagine what she could be talking about. The day before the 2020 election, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed at 26,925; last Friday it closed at 42,063, for an increase of 56%. The S&P 500 told the same story: It closed at 3,310 the day before the 2020 election, and finished at 5,702 on Friday, for an increase of 72%.

Nevertheless, for a couple of years now, many have been convinced that the economy is a disaster. One poll taken in May showed that 56% of Americans thought we were in a recession, 49% believed the stock market was down for the year, and perhaps most incredibly of all, 49% said unemployment was near a 50-year high, when in fact it's near a 50-year low.

Millions also continue to believe that because he's a rich businessman, Donald Trump must really understand the economy. After all, how could the man behind Trump University, Trump Steaks, and Trump Vodka not be an economic genius?

But that idea seems, finally, to be breaking down. Perhaps some voters have taken a close look at the two candidates' proposals and are starting to conclude that Harris' ideas have more merit. Perhaps they've seen that both conservative and liberal economists agree that Trump's plan for across-the-board tariffs would be an economic disaster. Or maybe they have been impressed with Harris' plan to reduce the price of housing.

More likely, though, is that voters' feelings are translating into economic conclusions. Just as people felt that Biden looked old and feeble and therefore he couldn't have been doing a good job on the economy, now many feel that Harris seems serious and competent, and therefore they can trust her to do a better job. Her ratings overall have improved since her successful convention and strong debate performance, so that halo has extended to economics. And as Trump spends every day spreading insane lies about immigrants, perhaps some voters are questioning his ability to handle a whole range of issues.

There is reason to believe things could get even better for Harris on this score. The Fed's decision to lower interest rates will likely give people confidence that mortgage and car loans will get cheaper. She'll also probably continue to get a boost from something no lawmaker has much control over: the retail price of gas. The national average is now $3.21 and falling, a full 66 cents lower than it was a year ago, and in many states the price is below $3.00.

By the time we get to the election, Harris may have even opened a real lead on the economy. The basis of voters' judgment may not be much more rational than when they thought Trump was an economic wizard. But at least the conclusion won't be so crazy."
What Chinese And Indian Investors Need To Know About U.S. EB5 Visas,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2024/09/23/what-chinese-and-indian-investors-need-to-know-about-us-eb5-visas/,2024-09-23T15:13:34Z,"According to recent studies, some 13,500 Chinese high net worth individuals were expected to leave their country between 2023 and 2024. In the case of India, that number is 9,400. Such individuals may find a recent 2024 U.S. World and News Report that indicates the United States is the third best county in the world, just behind Switzerland and Japan to be of interest. No doubt the fact that the U.S. is regarded so highly compared to other countries is one of the main reasons why so many Chinese and Indian high net worth individuals want to immigrate there. The question for such individuals is, what American immigration option is best for them in the case of those who seek investor immigration as an option?

For most foreign investor immigrants the American EB5 regional center program is best. Four concerns predominate. The first is will they get a green card if they invest? Second is how long is it going to take? The third is how safe is investment? And the final question is how soon will they get their money back?

The question of wait times to get EB5 green cards for investor immigrants is exceedingly complicated. As the the American Investor Investor Alliance (AIIA) has pointed out, such calculations must include, ""how many investors have already joined the queue for visas, how many visas will be available, and how visas get allocated by country and category."" Then estimates have to consider family sizes, future denial rates, and future I-526/I-526E processing speed, volumes, and priority.

That said, AIIA added, ""Individual wait time estimates are complex and open to difference of opinion, but the big picture is simple: demand > supply = wait times. By that metric, the high unemployment category was clearly already headed toward a significant backlog and visa wait times as of November 2023, while the rural category appeared to have some cushion but was approaching the backlog rapidly. Individual analysis should drill down more deeply and include the country factor. The backlog risk is especially a concern for applicants from China and India, considering that these countries have shown strong demand but are limited to 7% of available visas plus what is leftover from the rest of the world.""

In seminars offered by WR Immigration, Charles Oppenheim, former Chief of the Immigrant Visa Control and Reporting Division of the U.S. Department of State, assured podcast viewers that the set aside category of EB5 immigrant visas should remain current for about half of the 2024- 2025 fiscal year and perhaps may remain current until September 31st, 2025, the end of the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) fiscal year. With processing times of around 12 months for I-526E petitions, that would appear to indicate that Chinese and Indian EB5 investors who file their petitions now will be treated on a priority basis and may not need to wait longer than, say, less than two years for their conditional green cards to be approved for residence in the U.S.

Until recently, high unemployment area (HUA) regional center projects attracted more Chinese and Indian investor immigrants in the EB5 program than the other set aside options. These projects have been the cornerstone of the EB5 program, with many Regional Centers boasting extensive success stories. Such projects were better understood, often because they were in real estate, and because they offered more stable growth and had good reputations. Projects such as those carried out by CMB Regional Centers, Behring Capital LLC and EB5AN Regional Centers had good track records, and their investors succeeded in getting green cards. Invested funds were returned safely to their EB5 investors historically in these cases within roughly five-year time frames.

However, ILW, an investor immigration organization working in the EB5 world, not long ago published calculations revealed by Freedom of Information Act requests that the line up for investor applications from Chinese and Indians in high unemployment area (HUA) projects is 5 years long and may soon face 10-15 year delays in getting green cards. The culprits are mainly country limits, priority dates and the number of immigrant visas allocated to this HUA category. Fortunately, processing in the rural and infrastructure EB5 immigrant investor categories for Chinese and Indian immigrants appear to be still current. So those Chinese and Indian investors who are filing now in those categories still apparently will be processed reasonably quickly. However, infrastructure projects are not well understood because of confusion as to whether they must entail government involvement. It therefore seems that rural projects are increasingly the focus of such investors, at least for now.

Until recently, while rural projects promised faster processing, urban and high unemployment area targeted employment area (HUA-TEA) projects offered a more stable, though slower, path to U.S. residency. For Indian and Chinese investors who are already in the U.S., concurrent filing of the I-526E petition and the I-485 adjustment of status application inside the USA offers a way of living in the USA while waiting for approvals enabling them to live and work in the U.S. for as long as it took for their EB5 approval. Access to employment and travel made the waiting time less significant to them. This was particularly important for conservative investors who were ready to accept longer processing times in HUA-TEA projects because of their historical success records.

However, a recent ILW commnique warned investors that the number of HUA EB5 applications already received by the USCIS is so high that the wait time for the urban pipeline is already 8-10 years and is in the process of growing to 15+ years. The communique then went on to point out that due to such delays, investors' children may age out during the long wait. Investors from China and India could also face inordinate delays in getting their money back. If project promoters are knowingly misleading investors on green card wait times that could be securities fraud. Finally, attorneys could face malpractice claims if they do not understand the difference between the visa bulletin and the USCIS pipeline regarding wait times for investors receiving green cards. For some Chinese and Indian investors who prioritize lower financial risk and a higher probability of return on investment, urban and HUA-TEA projects may still be the safer choice, but for others even with employment and travel availability, the wait time of 10 - 15 years may be just too long.

For Chinese and Indian investors, HUA projects involve growing processing delays. Although perhaps riskier, rural projects may involve processing times as quick as two years to the conditional green card stage, return of capital possibly within 2 to 3 years and permanent status within say four years. Due to litigation over the required investment sustainment periods and redeployment of capital, however, investment capital return requirements may be extended. Hopefully, such determinations will be made soon.

Ultimately, the decision for Chinese or Indian investors should be guided by a comprehensive assessment of their goals, risk tolerance, and the specific challenges of each investment type. By carefully navigating the EB5 process and staying informed about the latest developments, Chinese and Indian investors will make the best choices to secure U.S. residency as efficiently and safely as possible."
"Kamala Harris hit for being vague, dodging questions in recent interviews: 'She owes us these answers'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-hit-being-vague-lacking-specifics-interviews-she-owes-us-answers,2024-09-23T09:13:18Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris has been criticized for avoiding specifics and dodging questions in the wake of multiple interviews she's done this week, as media pundits demand she actually answer questions from the press.

""This week she couldn't or wouldn't answer a single question straight, and people could see it. She is an artless dodger,"" The Wall Street Journal's Peggy Noonan wrote, suggesting voters now have a choice between ""awful and empty.""

Harris spoke to journalists this week during an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists (NAJB) and sat down with Oprah Winfrey, who endorsed her for president at the DNC. Harris has yet to hold a formal press conference since emerging as the nominee.

""She owes us these answers. It is wrong that she can't or won't address them. It is disrespectful to the electorate,"" Noonan wrote, arguing that avoiding questions on illegal immigration was ""political malpractice.""

HARRIS ADVISER BRUSHES OFF LACK OF INTERVIEWS: 'SHE'S A VERY BUSY PERSON'

The New York Times' Todd Purdum, a former White House correspondent for the outlet, wrote on Thursday that Harris could not afford to be vague.

""In a campaign in which Donald Trump fills our days with arrant nonsense and dominates the national discussion (and polls show a tight race where Ms. Harris is running behind Joe Biden's level of support in 2020 with some groups), the vice president can't afford to stick only to rehearsed answers and stump speeches that might not persuade voters or shape what America is talking about,"" Purdum said.

Purdum suggested that direct answers from the vice president would go a long way with voters.

""Writing about politicians for decades has convinced me that direct, succinct answers and explanations from Ms. Harris would go a long way -- perhaps longer than she realizes -- toward persuading voters that they know enough about her and her plans,"" the journalist wrote.

CNN COMMENTATOR SLAMS HARRIS AFTER OPRAH WINFREY SIT-DOWN: 'WHEN HAS SHE SAT DOWN WITH ANY HOSTILE MEDIA?'

MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton have suggested the opposite, arguing that Harris didn't need to be specific about her policies.

Clinton argued that she had more policy than anyone when she ran against Trump in 2016.

""I gave speeches about it. It was on our website. I wrote a book with Tim Kaine about it. We had lots of policy. At the end of the day, that's not what caused people to vote for me or against me, and I think the Harris campaign knows that. They know that you've got to, you know, cross a threshold which they have more than done in terms of what kind of governance you're promising,"" Clinton said during an interview on MSNBC's ""Morning Joe.""

Ruhle suggested Harris didn't need to be specific because she was running against Trump.

""Kamala Harris is not running for perfect. She's running against Trump. We have two choices. And so there are some things you might not know her answer to. And in 2024, unlike 2016 for a lot of the American people, we know exactly what Trump will do, who he is and the kind of threat he is to democracy,"" Ruhle insisted during an appearance on Bill Maher's show.

Bret Stephens, an anti-Trump New York Times columnist, who has also called on Harris to answer questions more directly, told Ruhle, ""I don't think it's a lot to ask for her to sit down for a real interview as opposed to a puff piece in which she describes her feelings of growing up in Oakland with nice lawns.""

Stephens called on Harris to answer more difficult questions in a recent NYT column.

""It should not be hard for Harris to demonstrate that she can give detailed answers to urgent policy questions. Or to express a sense, beyond a few canned phrases, of how she sees the American interest in a darkening world. Or to articulate a politics of genuine inclusion that reaches out to tens of millions of distrustful voters. Or to prove that she's more than another factory-settings liberal Democrat whose greatest virtue, like her greatest fault, is that she won't step too far from the conventional wisdom,"" he wrote.

Some reports and pundits suggested Harris ""lacked specifics"" and stuck to her script during the NABJ interview.

ABC's Selina Wang said Harris ""did not directly answer the question or offer any policy specifics,"" referring to a question about the Israel-Hamas war.

""There were multiple times, though, during this interview where Vice President Harris did not offer a specific answer. Instead, she pivoted and returned to her talking points that she wanted to hit,"" Wang continued.

CNN's Abby Phillip played a clip of Harris responding to a question about whether voters were better off than they were four years ago.

AXELROD ENCOURAGES HARRIS TO DO MORE INTERVIEWS: 'FLOOD THE ZONE'

""We came in during the worst public health epidemic in centuries. We came in after the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War and a lot of it due in large part to the mismanagement by the former president, as it relates to COVID and, obviously, January 6. And we had then a lot of work to do to clean up a mess. As of today, we have created over 16 million new jobs, over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. We have the lowest Black unemployment rate in generations,"" Harris said during the interview.

Phillip argued that Harris should have something ""quick"" and ""understandable"" ready in response to a question about whether voters were better off four years ago, adding, ""and that wasn't really it.""

CNN political commentator Scott Jennings argued Harris should just ""answer the question,"" and pointed to some of Harris' answers during the debate.

""Every single policy question she got at the debate, she totally ignored and never answered. Why is it that she believes she does not have to answer to journalists who are asking pretty basic questions of a presidential candidate?"" he said.

Following the interview, Politico reported on Wednesday that Harris refused to ""veer off script."" The report said Harris evaded questions about important issues, adding, ""she did not break much ground or stray far from her talking points.""

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment."
"Trump has a plan for economic prosperity, Harris does not",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-has-plan-economic-prosperity-harris-does-not,2024-09-23T09:12:59Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As the November election approaches, the economy remains the most important issue for voters. On the question of which candidate voters believe would make the best economic policy decisions, President Trump holds a 10 percentage point advantage over Vice President Kamala Harris, according to the latest Pew Research survey. No one should be surprised.

Trump offers straightforward pro-growth economic policies consistent with the plan he successfully implemented during his first term in office, as most voters fondly recall.

He would keep tax rates low, encouraging investment and consumer spending, reduce growth-hobbling business regulation, and expand America's domestic energy production, reducing the cost of literally everything.

During his first term in office, this plan reduced unemployment to historic lows for every race and both sexes, increased wages and family incomes to historic highs, drove poverty to historic lows, reduced income inequality, and all without inflation. It's a plan that works, and Americans know it.

NEW TRUMP WEBSITE REVEALS HOW MUCH MONEY A HARRIS PRESIDENCY COULD COST TAXPAYERS

In fact, CNBC surveys going back to 2008 tellingly show that, over the past 16 years, Americans have been more pessimistic than optimistic about the economy in all but two years - 2018 and 2019 - when Trump was president.

In other words, Americans were more pessimistic than optimistic about the economy in all 12 years that Presidents Obama and Biden occupied the White House, but were more optimistic in two of the four years Trump was president. No one seriously doubts that Trump's economic winning streak would have continued but for the pandemic.

Today, economic pessimism is essentially back to where it was in 2016, Obama's last year in office, and where it was near the end of 2021, the year Biden and Harris took office.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTIONS ABOUT HER PLAN TO HANDLE A RECESSION, ATTACKS TRUMP'S ECONOMIC RECORD INSTEAD

The roots of the current pessimism lie in two massive Biden/Harris spending bills - each of passed only because Harris casting the tie-breaking votes (the misnamed American Rescue Plan and the comically named Inflation Reduction Act).

These bills led to an economy plagued by surging inflation that raised the price of everything over 20% - and Harris owns them. Real wages failed to keep up, lowering the standard of living for millions of Americans. Add in housing that is far less affordable due in great part to interest rate hikes the Fed implemented to reduce inflation, and you have serious economic pessimism.

It's not a record Harris wants to run on so she is attempting to distance herself from it, promising an ""opportunity economy."" But how would Americans find economic opportunity without economic growth, something her plans would only stifle?

WERE YOU BETTER OFF UNDER TRUMP'S ECONOMY OR BIDEN'S?

Of course, Harris would increase taxes on the most successful individuals and businesses. It's a policy that's very popular, if not a mainstay, on the Left. But raising taxes unequivocally discourages private sector investment and growth, demeaning economic opportunity.

A San Francisco liberal at heart, Harris has indicated no inclination to meaningfully reduce the massive, growth-killing federal regulatory state and is unlikely to abandon her career-long opposition to domestic fossil fuel production (despite supposedly reversing her position on fracking, at least in politically significant Pennsylvania).

So, from where will the growth from her ""opportunity economy"" come?

In a desperate effort to come up with something, Harris offers a confused mixture of unserious proposals even the left-leaning never-Trump Washington Post has criticized as ""populist gimmicks.""

AMERICANS FRUSTRATED WITH 'OUTRAGEOUS' HIGH PRICES AHEAD OF THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION

For example, to combat inflation, Harris has proposed that government fix the price of goods purportedly to stop businesses from ""price gouging."" But there has been no price gouging as the Biden-Harris administration's own Department of Labor data makes clear. In reality, American businesses have merely passed on to consumers the increased costs that surging inflation has forced on them.

In any event, price fixing is just bad economic policy. As stated in a Washington Post opinion piece, ""[i]t's hard to exaggerate how bad this policy is,"" as government price fixing ""would lead to shortages, black markets and hoarding, among other distortions seen previous times countries tried to limit price growth by fiat."" That sounds pretty bad!

But of course it's a bad economic policy. It was never intended to be good economic policy. It is a purely political proposal designed to cast blame on American businesses for the surging inflation the Biden-Harris economic policies caused.

So, given her pivotal role in passing those two inflation-driving behemoth spending bills, you would think Harris might have learned her lesson on government spending and inflation. But apparently she has not.

The Washington Post's editorial board also panned another Harris ""populist gimmick"" - to give first-time home buyers $25,000 in down payment assistance. Why? Well, because it would stimulate housing demand ""which risks putting upward pressure on prices."" Of course it does.

But again, Harris' goal was not to actually make home purchases less expensive. It was to assuage voters frustrated that housing inflation and increased interest rates have made owning a home to expensive thanks to Biden-Harris economic policies.

Bottom line, Trump offers a proven pro-growth plan that will reinvigorate our economy benefiting all Americans. Harris offers growth-diminishing policies and political gimmicks. Rather than economic opportunity for American families, her policies are about political opportunity for herself.

If Americans have had enough economic misery over the last three-and-a-half years and are ready for a return to prosperity, Trump has a plan for that. Harris does not."
We're talking to Nevada voters. Here's what role the state could play in the election,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5114992/nevada-vote-election-voters-swing-state-trump-harris,2024-09-23T09:06:03Z,"The Arts District in Las Vegas, Nevada on Sept.18, 2024. Krystal Ramirez for NPR hide caption

How Nevada swings on Election Day could tip the 2024 presidential election.

The southwest state -- with two Democratic senators, a Republican governor and a quickly growing population that looks to be politically purplish -- has just six Electoral College votes.

But in the race to reach 270 -- and given how close the race is in other battleground states -- Nevada's handful of votes could deliver The White House to either Vice President Harris or former President Donald Trump.

In the last two presidential elections, 15 of Nevada's 17 counties voted Republican. But the two counties that didn't -- Clark and Washoe -- make up almost 90% of Nevada's population, according to Census data.

The state voted Democrat in recent presidential elections, but not by much. Voter registration for the two main parties are pretty equally split and even more are technically registered as ""Non-Partisan.""

NPR's Morning Edition is reporting from Nevada all week telling stories about the state and its voters.

Of the six states that NPR is visiting that could determine who wins the White House in November -- Georgia, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Arizona and Pennsylvania -- Nevada has the fewest Electoral College votes.

But that doesn't mean it's the least important state to the candidates.

Jon Ralston, founder and editor-in-chief of the nonprofit news site The Nevada Independent, said there's a surrogate from Harris' team in Nevada ""almost every day.""

For Republicans to win the state, they'll need to focus efforts on the two largest counties, as the 15 smaller counties voted overwhelmingly Republican in recent elections and are expected to do so again.

""While we may not be the deciding state, it's also not impossible,"" Ralston said. ""There are plenty of scenarios where Nevada could decide everything.""

Depending on how other key states vote on Election Day, Nevada could put either Harris or Trump over the 270 mark to win the election.

The state has a hefty chunk of people who haven't chosen a side. Around 40% of registered voters don't identify as either Democrat or Republican -- since many were automatically registered as ""Non-partisan"" when going to the DMV for things such as driver's licenses under a state law that took effect in 2020.

Some of these voters may not know -- or care -- that they're registered to vote, Ralston said. Candidates up and down the ticket will have to find out whether these voters lean left or lean right in order to reach them.

Among Republicans, Ralston said immigration is a big concern, though Nevada isn't a border state.

Democrats hope that an amendment protecting abortion rights that will be on the state ballot will drive their voters to the polls.

There's bipartisan support for protecting abortion rights in the state constitution, according to Joe Schoenmann, host of KNPR's State of Nevada in Las Vegas. Polls show that nearly 70% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats in Nevada oppose criminalizing abortion.

Schoenmann said the economy is top of mind. Most here have experienced cost of living increases since the pandemic.

Nevada also has the highest unemployment out of any state in the country at 5.4% with 6.7% in the Las Vegas area, compared to the national average of 4.2%.

With much of Southern Nevada -- which includes Las Vegas -- living on tips, higher prices ""can really hit home,"" Schoenmann said.

In addition, Nevada is growing fast -- with an estimated 30% of new residents moving from California.

""They're selling their homes in California for large sums of money. So they come here, they are buying homes over the asking price. And they're driving up housing costs,"" Schoenmann reported.

While efforts to build affordable housing for seniors are underway, he said virtually no affordable housing for the rest of the population is being built.

Farther north in Reno, KUNR political reporter Lucia Starbuck said voters are also concerned about the cost of living -- everywhere from the gas pump, grocery store and paying utility bills and child care.

Healthcare access is also a big concern for rural voters. In some parts of the state, residents have to drive over an hour to give birth, to get emergency care or get specialty care, Starbuck said.

Starbuck has spoken with Democrats who are ""afraid to be super public"" about their politics.

""People are wanting to have civil conversations with their neighbors about politics, but really feel that they can't,"" she said.

Across the political spectrum, Schoenmann and Starbuck say Nevada voters are concerned about safeguarding democracy. Democrats have said Trump is a threat to democracy -- especially in his rhetoric after the attack on January 6, 2021 -- and Republicans say the same thing about democrats."
European nation's pivot toward conservatism brings staggering drop in illegal immigration,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/european-nations-pivot-toward-conservatism-staggering-drop-illegal-immigration,2024-09-22T16:41:52Z,"Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani on an increase in Italy's defense spending, Italy's success under a conservative administration, and curbing illegal immigration.

Italy's conservative-led government has been hard at work to bring down illegal immigration over the past year, and they have a 64% drop in numbers to show for it.

""It's not easy. We've worked hard to achieve this goal,"" Italian Foreign Minister Antonio Tajani told ""Sunday Morning Futures"" host Maria Bartiromo.

""We are very happy for this. We are not against legal immigration, rather against illegal immigration,"" he clarified.

""Human traffickers are the most important part of crime. They are human traffickers, weapon traffickers, drug traffickers. They [belong to] the same organization, but we need to be very strong and to fight against these organizations, and we are doing it.""

ITALIAN COURT DROPS CHARGES AGAINST MIGRANT RESCUE SHIP CREWS AND ENDS LONG-RUNNING LEGAL BATTLE

Tajani said the drop followed financial deals struck with Tunisia, Libya and other North African countries, a measure criticized by some and commended by others, including a member of the opposite side of the aisle, U.K. Prime Minister Kier Starmer.

Last year, Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni sat down with Bartiromo for a talk about the political climate in Europe, including the conservative movement's apparent growing influence that remains a part of political discourse.

There, she spoke urgently about the trafficking situation fueled by illegal immigration from Northern African nations.

""We have to fight the traffickers,"" she said at the time. ""What the traffickers are doing is incredible. These organizations are always becoming more powerful, and they use their power and the money they [have] against the state. We cannot allow a mafia to decide who's coming into our countries.""

ITALY'S MELONI OPENS AFRICA SUMMIT WITH PLANS TO CURB DANGEROUS MIGRATION

Meloni credited instability - the COVID-19 pandemic and the Russia-Ukraine War - for opening the eyes of many citizens and enabling them to see differences between right and left-wing policies.

Tajani commented on the apparent rightward shift and its effects, telling Bartiromo the Italian economy is better off now than it was under previous leadership.

""The economy now is going up in Italy. We are not very happy, but we are happy because less unemployment and the stock exchange is going up. We need to do more... in the next year, we need to do less taxes [lower taxes]. This is important. This is our strategy."""
After The Fed Rate Cut: Soft Landing Checklist,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/09/22/after-the-fed-rate-cut-soft-landing-checklist/,2024-09-22T10:42:23Z,"Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve delivered a larger-than-expected half percentage point (0.50%) decrease in short-term interest rates last week. While the rate cut was a virtual certainty, the path forward and whether it will prevent the economy from descending into recession remain unknown. This piece will identify some data to gauge the effectiveness of the Fed's actions in supporting the economy.

Because of the aggressive first move from the Fed, the odds of an economic soft landing should be considered higher than before the move. Though the real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate remains above 2023, there are likely more rate cuts in the pipeline.

Futures pricing assumes another cut to short-term interest rates of at least 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November Fed meeting and a 50% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut. The December meeting has expectations identical to those for November.

In seven of the last nine easing cycles, the economy was either in recession when the rate cuts began or ended in recession. Still, stocks usually rose in the twelve months after the cuts started.

Stocks and the Magnificent 7 reacted positively to the outsized rate cut. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), underperformed the S&P 500 on the week but are now only 6.6% below their early July highs. The S&P 500 reached a new all-time high during the week, eclipsing the July 16 high.

The U.S. economy remains resilient, with the Atlanta Fed's estimate of third-quarter GDP at 2.9%. These estimates provide a real-time estimate of economic growth since quarterly GDP reports are provided with a significant lag.

Other valuable high-frequency reports are the initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits. These claims have improved lately, but any significant softening in the labor market should be seen here first.

The job market has softened. While the unemployment rate at 4.2% remains low on an absolute basis, it has risen off the lows enough to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. There are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle.

Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is evidence of some less dire outcomes in the labor market and the economy so far. The employment-to-population ratio is a monthly statistic updated in the monthly jobs report, and so is the unemployment rate.

Separately, defensive stocks, less impacted by the economy, have often outperformed the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks during these easing cycles since they tend to correspond with periods of economic uncertainty or eventual contraction. Last week showed a better performance for economically sensitive stocks, bolstering the case that markets also viewed the Fed's actions as supportive of better odds of avoiding recession.

Banks tend to underperform the S&P 500 before and often during recessions since their loan losses and profits are inexorably tied to the economy. Bank stocks significantly outperformed last week, adding to the optimistic view of the impacts of the more significant Fed rate cut on the economy.

Finally, the consumer is crucial for the health of the economy. Looking at the relative performance of the consumer discretionary sector can help indicate when the consumer and, by extension, the U.S. economy might be in trouble. The equal-weighted S&P 500 consumer discretionary index is used; otherwise, Amazon.com (AMZN) would dominate the analysis given its massive size in the capitalization-weighted index. Consistent with the other measures shown, consumer discretionary stocks outperformed.

Based on the indicators reviewed in this analysis and current economic data, the base case remains a soft landing. This COVID-related economic cycle is unlike any other, so our typically reliable yield curve and Sahm rule indicators should be viewed more skeptically than usual. The initial reaction to the larger-than-expected 50 basis point rate cut from the Fed has been positive across the soft landing checklist. It indicates that market participants are assigning higher odds of avoiding recession following Chair Powell's aggressive start to easing monetary policy.

If history is any indicator, success in avoiding a recession is no sure thing. Since markets reflect a higher likelihood of a soft landing, investors should expect price declines for stocks and other risk assets if recession probabilities increase. Since the eventual outcome remains unknown, investors should be mindful of their asset allocation and consider rebalancing after the robust stock gains. Owning high-quality and less economically sensitive stocks alongside technology and cyclical companies should benefit equity portfolios if the economy and earnings falter."
"30 minutes from Springfield, another Ohio city welcomed immigrants  --  and got a boost",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/20/nx-s1-5108947/immigrants-ohio-dayton-economy-job-growth,2024-09-21T12:22:07Z,"Dayton, Ohio, launched an effort in 2011 to become more welcoming to immigrants. Backers say the newcomers have benefited the city, which was losing population for decades. Madeleine Hordinski for NPR hide caption

Beth Casella's family has been making things out of metal in Dayton, Ohio, for more than half a century.

FC Industries -- the company started by her grandfather, Frank -- has grown into an $85 million local manufacturing business, churning out everything from high-tech centrifuges to La-Z-Boy recliner frames.

""We're growing,"" Casella says. ""We keep breaking records, month after month.""

Finding workers to sustain that growth has not been easy, especially since the pandemic, in a city where the unemployment rate is just 5%. Casella has relied in part on immigrants, who now make up about 10% of FC Industries' 300-plus-person workforce.

""We've always prided ourselves on being very diverse,"" Casella says. ""Three of my grandparents were immigrants.""

The company has partnered with a local refugee resettlement agency to help recruit workers. Bilingual employees are paid extra to act as translators, and the company is setting up an English class. It's not altruism, Casella says. Just good business.

""We want good workers,"" she says. ""We want people who can grow here and grow us to the next level. And we're open to looking wherever that could be.""

It's not just Casella's company. Nationwide, immigrants are a vital force in powering the American job machine and keeping the U.S. economy humming. Over the last 12 months, nearly 1.5 million foreign-born workers have joined the labor force -- legally or illegally. In the same period the population of U.S.-born workers has shrunk.

The broader data shows that immigrants are not displacing native workers, but rather filling a hole that's been created by retiring baby boomers. Were it not for immigration, job growth likely would have stalled. And that's doubly true in places like Dayton -- an aging industrial city with a population that's half the size it was in 1960.

While nearby Springfield, Ohio, has become a lightning rod in the national debate over immigration, Dayton has been working for more than a decade to lure more immigrants, to help fill jobs and revitalize old neighborhoods. Dayton dubs itself an ""immigrant friendly city"" and launched a program in 2011 to make services more accessible to newcomers and integrate them into the local community.

""Our goal is to make Dayton a welcoming place for everybody,"" says City Commissioner Matt Joseph, who helped spearhead the ""Welcome Dayton"" initiative.

Joseph, who has business cards printed in Spanish, Mandarin and Croatian, says there was some pushback, but not much.

""Most of the people who complained about it came from out of town,"" he recalls. ""Sometimes out of state. Like, they would drive hours to come to our meeting to complain about it. But native Daytonians didn't, which I was really proud of.""

In a survey last year, 57% of Dayton residents said they'd be happy to have an immigrant family next door. That's down from 70% three years ago. City officials suspect hostile rhetoric from national politicians is partly to blame for the decline.

Some of the new arrivals have started their own businesses, like Moh Fardeen Ahmadi, who moved to Dayton from Afghanistan, where he'd worked as a translator for the U.S. military.

When he arrived a decade ago, Ahmadi spent a year working at Payless Shoes, then got a job as a truck driver. Eventually, he started his own trucking company with Afghan, Arab, Latino and U.S.-born employees.

""I started with one truck,"" Ahmadi says. ""I have nine trucks now. I have a total of 10 drivers. And I have three dispatchers. And I have a guy working in my office too.""

Since the Taliban's takeover of Afghanistan three years ago, more than 100 other Afghans have settled in Dayton. Ahmadi calls it a second chance to rebuild their lives.

Anita Nzigiye grew up in Rwanda and followed her sister to Dayton. After working for a time as a home health aide, she opened a market with her family, selling east African groceries to the growing community of African transplants.

""It's basically food from home,"" Nzigiye says of popular items such as smoked fish from Tanzania and specialty flours made from cassava and yams.

Nzigiye used to rarely see African immigrants in Dayton but says more are arriving every week, building a customer base for her store and a built-in welcoming committee for new arrivals.

""The housing is affordable,"" Nzigiye says. ""Even if their English may not be their first language, they can still find a job.""

Those are the same qualities that drew waves of European immigrants and Black workers from the South to Dayton in the last century.

""My parents owned Evans Bakery right across the street,"" says Dayton native Jennifer Evans. ""I grew up there. Went to the local Catholic school here in the neighborhood.""

Today, Evans and her husband, Matt Tepper, are active in the Old North Dayton Neighborhood Association. The arrival of new immigrants has given a welcome boost to the aging community.

""Families were buying these abandoned houses and fixing them up immediately, occupying them,"" Tepper says. ""So Old North Dayton doesn't have the -- quote -- abandonment problem that a lot of urban areas had.""

A group of ethnic Turks from Russia and Ukraine converted an old funeral home into a mosque. It shares a parking lot with the Polish social club next door. Luckily, the growing crowd at Friday prayers typically clears out just as happy hour at the social club is getting underway.

That friendly co-existence between new and old residents is a stark contrast with the ominous picture of immigrants that former President Donald Trump and his running-mate JD Vance like to paint.

To be sure, many Americans from across the political spectrum would like to see changes in national immigration policy. Evans says she would too. But however people make their way to Dayton, she tries to make them feel welcome, and thinks most of her neighbors feel the same way.

""I'd be lying if I said there was never anybody that said, 'I don't want all these new people in my neighborhood,'"" Evans says. ""I'm sure there are still some people here that would prefer it to be the way it was 60 years ago. But it just isn't. For the most part, we're all working together to make us all stronger.""

The city's Welcome Dayton office has three full-time staffers who spend part of their time mediating between immigrants and longtime residents to prevent small conflicts from spiraling into something bigger. Recent cases involved people parking their car on the grass instead of the driveway and drying their clothes on the bushes. A quiet conversation in the right language can make a big difference.

""When those small things become a huge monumental mountain, Welcome Dayton has been instrumental in putting them back to mole-sized hills,"" Tepper says.

The foreign-born population in Dayton, like Ohio as a whole, is still relatively small -- about 5%, compared to a national average of nearly 14%. But Dayton's immigrant community has grown large enough to be noticeable in some areas.

At Kiser Elementary School, for example, 40% of students now speak a native language other than English. Instructions on the walls are printed in Spanish, Turkish and the central African language of Kinyarwanda.

City Commissioner Joseph acknowledges there are costs associated with providing services to the new arrivals, and he wishes his city had more control over things like work permits.

On the whole, though, Joseph says Dayton has prospered by reaching out to immigrants rather than turning them away.

""This is the best the city has done in 50 years -- since before I was born,"" Joseph says. And welcoming immigrants, welcoming everyone, has played a role in that."""
Inflation Progress & Labor Market Cooling: The Fed's Rate Cut Thinking,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/billconerly/2024/09/21/inflation-progress--labor-market-cooling-the-feds-rate-cut-thinking/,2024-09-21T11:38:32Z,"Bill Conerly connect the dots between the economy ... and business!

The Federal Reserve made a relatively large reduction in short-term interest rates at its September 2024 meeting. They were not, though, in a panic or worried about an imminent recession. Instead, they were thinking that the old interest rate would not be appropriate going forward. That's a very sensible position.

The phrasing of Jerome Powell's statement to the press is telling: ""Today, the Federal Open Market Committee decided to reduce the degree of policy restraint by lowering our policy interest rate by 1/2 percentage point."" He did not say they were shifting to an easier monetary policy, but merely reducing restraint. That's a critical distinction.

The economy has been strong. Growth of gross domestic product (GDP) was above trend last quarter and unemployment below its long-run average, though somewhat above its pre-pandemic reading.

The Fed, however, believes that the previous Federal Funds interest rate, 5.33% was restrictive. Bringing it down to 4.83% is simply less restrictive. What they don't know, however, is what exactly is the neutral interest rate. They presume that a neutral rate exists, but they cannot see it in real time. In fact, they can look at rough estimates of past values, and they don't believe it's steady over time. But they are pretty sure it's below the current rate.

Referring to the Fed as if it's of one mind is certainly wrong (though occasionally useful). For the long-run tendency of the Fed Funds rate, the 19 members of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) had 11 different answers, spread from 2.375% to 3.75%.

Adding to the Fed's difficulty is uncertainty about the time lags in monetary policy. Milton Friedman famously concluded that the lags were long and variable. Estimation of the time lags from historical data is confounded by structural changes in the economy. The financial system has evolved in recent decades, as has the role of international trade, the importance of services relative to goods production as well as economists' understanding of the economy.

Saying that the Fed is ""flying blind"" relative to the neutral rate and the time lags may be an overstatement, but ""visibility impaired"" would be entirely accurate.

Although the FOMC vote had one dissent in its latest decision (Michelle Bowman who argued for cutting rates by a quarter percent rather than a half), the Fed has greater differences than their final vote shows. Joseph C. Sternberg recently wrote in The Wall Street Journal, ""The Fed seems skittish about the idea that the children on Wall Street might see the parents arguing in Washington.""

Nonetheless, the is a general consensus on two points: that the Fed has made progress against inflation, and that the labor market is not as strong as it recently was.

The inflation performance is undeniable, with the Fed's preferred measure of inflation dropping from 5.6% in early 2022 to 2.6% in the July reading. (August data are not yet available.) The Fed also thinks that they have more improvement in the pipeline. Remember those time lags. If the old interest rate was restrictive, then additional drops in inflation should be coming, even if the Fed shifts to neutral now. The fact that they believe that interest rates are still restrictive, just less so, means that they really want inflation to come down more.

Great concern about inflation must come from the huge federal deficits being rung up, with more deficit spending on the way regardless of the presidential election. Economists argue among ourselves about the effect of deficits on inflation, but even the slightest role for deficits would imply the Fed needs to keep interest rates restrictive for quite a while.

While inflation has come down, the employment side of the Fed's ""dual mandate"" has turned less hot. Not only is unemployment a little higher than two years ago, but the number of voluntary quits and open job positions have both fallen. Neither is flashing warnings signs, but they are not super-strong anymore. Initial claims for unemployment insurance, a decent leading indicator of the overall economy, has increased since the first of 2024, though it's well below long-run average.

The Fed believes -- and I agree -- that the economy is strong, but in a middle ground going forward. They are likely to continue cutting interest rates through this year and the end of 2025, but what happens after that is a wide open question."
What's Next After The Fed's Big Interest Rate Cut?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreymarcus/2024/09/21/whats-next-after-the-feds-big-rate-cut/,2024-09-21T10:03:56Z,"Our expert contributors explain what the Fed's decision means for investors, businesses, job seekers, home buyers and more.

The Federal Reserve's decision this week to cut interest rates half a percentage point reverberated up and down the U.S. economy, with economists, business owners and investors wondering -- what's next?

""This decision carries profound implications for the trajectory of monetary policy and the broader financial landscape, igniting a spirited debate among market participants, economists, and policymakers alike,"" Forbes contributor Dan Irvine writes.

Irvine, who follows market trends closely, predicted that the robust rate cut ""could stimulate investment, spur consumer spending, and reinvigorate economic activity, fostering a more favorable environment for financial markets"" at a pivotal time for the U.S. economy.

Other Fed watchers, like Forbes contributor Erik Sherman, have expressed concerns that even though this change in policy was expected, recalibrating now may be difficult as prices and employment are still shaking out.

For all the Fed's effort to engineer a soft landing, it remains to be seen if the timing and size of the cut -- and any future cuts -- will be successful.

Forbes' expert contributors help explain what the Fed's move means for investors, businesses, job seekers, home buyers and more.

The stock market didn't initially respond with its usual enthusiasm for rate cuts, writes Forbes contributor Jim Wang, who posits that, ""perhaps the market believes the Fed is a bit behind on cutting rates.""

Investors made their real feelings known on Thursday, when stocks and bonds rallied. The S&P 500, the Dow and the Nasdaq had recorded their biggest daily percentage gains since mid-August, Reuters reported. By the time the markets closed on Friday, they managed to notch a 1% weekly gain, with investors already considering whether the November Fed meeting will bring another half-point cut -- or just .25%.

Fed Chair Jerome Powell had indicated in his news conference earlier in the week that after cutting rates for the first time in four years, more may be coming. But he was careful not to box himself in.

""Powell avoided committing to any specific timetable for rate policy actions, opting instead to underscore that the Fed is data-dependent and that Fed policy is 'not on any preset course,'"" economist Jason Schenker writes.

Indeed, Powell said he will take it ""meeting by meeting,"" though most observers believe ""it is likely to be the beginning of a trend in additional monetary policy accommodation as the Fed cuts interest rates further in the years ahead,"" Schenker adds.

Though unemployment is relatively low by historical standards, Forbes careers contributor Jack Kelly writes that calls for Powell and the Fed to shift from fighting inflation to supporting the job market were mounting.

A cut in interest rates is designed to stimulate spending and lead to a stronger economy and, ultimately, higher employment and a more competitive job market. That can be good for job seekers and those looking to move up or on to better gigs, Kelly writes. But nothing is certain.

""While a rate cut is generally seen as positive for job growth, its effectiveness can depend on broader economic conditions, business confidence, and how companies choose to use the lower-cost capital available to them,"" Kelly says.

The Fed's decision to lower rates is a bet on the longer-term prospects of the economy, but one that can also help small businesses now, writes Rohit Arora, who covers lending and small business growth on Forbes.

""Lower interest rates will lead to reduced interest payments for small business owners,"" Arora says, and could free up money for consumers that are ""hurting badly with all the credit card delinquency and with auto loan delinquency at record levels,"" Arora writes.

Lots of types of businesses are affected. ""High interest rates hurt the economy by making it more expensive to borrow for mortgages, auto loans, and credit cards -- or in many cases, for growing a business,"" Forbes contributor Benjamin Adams writes, adding: ""And no sector needs the break more than the cannabis industry.""

The monetary policy shift announced this week represents an opportunity for families and individual investors ""to reassess and optimize their financial situations,"" contributor Brian Menickella writes. Refinancing debt, rebalancing saving and investment plans, and unlocking home-equity potential are all on the table.

""Federal student loan rates will remain unchanged until at least July 1 of next year,"" Forbes personal finance contributor Robert Farrington writes. ""Whereas the impact on private student loans will be more immediate.""

""This isn't great news for those who will or have had loans disbursed after July 1, 2024,"" Farrington says. But variable rates on private loans could drop and borrowers interested in refinancing student loans with private companies, ""may find more competitive rates now than last year.""

Daryl Fairweather, a Forbes real estate contributor and the chief economist at Redfin, was cautiously optimistic in her predictions earlier this summer, advising home buyers to watch carefully.

""The way down for mortgage rates will likely be bumpy as economic data continues to roll in, and the Fed's actions will play a significant role in determining the path for mortgage rates,"" Fairweather said last month.

""Home buyers may want to try to time the market, but getting the timing exactly right is difficult, if not impossible,"" she added.

Cutting the interest rate could 'trigger' additional upside in cryptocurrency prices as greater liquidity drives heightened demand for riskier assets, according to Forbes contributor Charles Lloyd Bovaird II.

But Dave Birnbaum, who writes about digital assets on Forbes, is less certain. He says that the size and timing of the Fed's policy shift signals that it's in ""damage control mode.""

""While monetary easing typically weakens the dollar, strengthening bitcoin, the speed and size of this cut may indicate that the Fed is seeing something more ominous on the horizon -- a possibility that could lead to increased volatility across all markets, including cryptocurrencies,"" Birnbaum writes.

These indicators suggest that macroeconomic instability, sluggish consumer spending and signs of strain on the U.S. labor market continue to stoke fears of a recession even as Powell and the Fed try to stick the landing."
"The Fed Rate Cut, Mortgage, Auto And Credit Card Rates: What To Expect",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2024/09/20/the-fed-rate-cut-mortgage-auto-and-credit-card-rates-what-to-expect/,2024-09-20T17:21:44Z,"In a rather surprising move, the Fed cut its benchmark interest rate by 0.50%, bringing it down to a range of 4.75% to 5.00%. Most were expecting a 0.25% cut. Does it indicate a serious problem with the economy? How will this rate cut affect home loans, auto loans, and credit cards? Is such a substantial cut, just before an election, politically motivated?

Immediately after the Fed announced the rate cut, stocks rose on the news. Then, just as fast, stocks fell, indicating some confusion amongst investors. Now that the dust has settled, stocks are higher. Does this larger-than-expected rate cut indicate a problem with the economy?

According to Fed Chair Powell, ""The labor mkt is growing at a strong pace."" Even so, unemployment is slightly higher, but that is largely due to immigration. With the large influx of immigrants, there are more people seeking jobs, pushing the unemployment rate up. Inflation is falling, but prices remain elevated. Overall, the economy has proven to be quite resilient. Therefore, it's likely the Fed is simply trying to get ahead of the inflation struggle, which is why it cut by 0.50%.

I've heard it reported on a few news sites that if the Fed were to cut interest rates (which of course it did), it would translate into lower mortgage rates. This is largely untrue. Fixed rate mortgages are closely tied to the rate on the 10-year Treasury and are unaffected by a change in the fed's short-term rate. However, there is an exception. Home equity loans and variable interest loans do share a relationship with short-term rates and may benefit from the cut.

A rate cut by the Fed is helpful to auto loans as these loans are tied to shorter term rates. Automobile loans from commercial banks are down about 7.5% from their high on October 5, 2022. Thus, the Fed's rate cut should reduce auto loan rates and could spur additional growth in this area. However, according to Kelley Blue Book, auto loan rates may be the slowest to move. Why? Because of the lagging effect of interest rate changes. Specifically, now that the Fed has cut its short-term rate, the prime rate will follow. Since many loans are tied to the prime rate, auto loan rates may be slower to adjust.

Will the rate on credit cards move lower? According to Jonathan Smoke, Chief Economist with Cox Automotive, ""Consumers should see more immediate changes in the rates charged on credit cards, which should help improve the financial status of consumers who have built up balances to maintain spending.""

The short answer is not likely. I put this issue to the test a few years ago while attending a Fed conference in Jackson Hole, Wyoming. I asked two sitting Fed presidents, Dennis Lockhart (Atlanta) and Charlie Evans (Chicago), how fiscal policy, which is under the purview of the federal government, might influence their decisions on monetary policy. Without hesitation, each said the Fed stays in its own lane (i.e. monetary policy) and did not comment on or consider fiscal policy in its decisions.

Today's Fed seems to be more willing to comment on fiscal policy's effect on the economy and has suggested several times that federal government spending is too high. You see, excessive federal government spending tends to stimulate the economy, which is what the Fed has been trying to avoid. While it's not uncommon, the federal government and the Fed are once again working against each other. While the Fed is trying to slow the economy to bring inflation down, the federal government is in campaign mode, spending excessively, which stimulates economic growth.

This rate cut does not seem to indicate a problem with the economy. While the 0.50% cut will help auto loan and credit card rates, the benefit to the mortgage market will be limited to home equity lines of credit (HELOC) and adjustable-rate mortgages.

Finally, it's unlikely this move was politically motivated. Powell was appointed to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors by President Obama (2012), then to the Chair position by President Trump (2018). He was renominated by President Biden. Powell is a Republican."
Harris Vs. Trump On The Economy: Trump Now Holds Just Slim Lead On Issue In Latest Poll,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/20/harris-vs-trump-on-the-economy-trump-now-holds-just-slim-lead-on-issue-in-latest-poll/,2024-09-20T13:19:55Z,"Americans now only slightly favor Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump to lead the U.S. economy over Democratic candidate Kamala Harris, according to polling released Friday, as the American economy sits at a potential inflection point heading into the election.

Trump's economic plan has largely focused on deregulation in the energy and financial industries, touting the much-better inflation during his presidency than Biden's, and instituting significant tariffs on Chinese goods. The U.S. economy performed very well under both Trump and Biden by most metrics, with historically low unemployment, strong stock market performance and steady economic output growth occurring during both administrations, save for a 2020-21 global blip during the depths of the COVID-19 pandemic (see here for detailed data on how the economy fared under Biden and Trump). The president often has a less direct impact on the U.S. economy than public perception may suggest, considering the difficulty in implementing policies, the global nature of the economy and the fragile nature of the stock market, which ultimately relies on earnings growth for multinational corporations.

Though presidential impact on stock prices is often negligible in the long run, strategists suggest it's likely that stocks in sectors like banking and oil production would get a boost from Trump, while companies which rely heavily on manufacturing in Taiwan (like semiconductor chip maker Nvidia), or on sales in China (like Apple), could be hurt due to Trump's policy in the region."
Second Chance Hiring Has Become A Critical Need For Manufacturers,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimvinoski/2024/09/20/second-chance-hiring-has-become-a-critical-need-for-manufacturers/,2024-09-20T13:12:45Z,"Hiring the formerly incarcerated has long been a values-driven pursuit of a small fraction of American companies. But now it is fast turning into a necessary pillar of effective recruiting, particularly in manufacturing where deficiencies in both the numbers and the skills of prospective employees are an increasingly daunting challenge.

Jeffrey Korzenik, chief economist for one of the country's largest commercial banks and author of Untapped Talent: How Second Chance Hiring Works for Your Business and the Community, saw the problem coming. ""I kind of marked my calendar decades ago with the date the Baby Boomers would start to retire, because I knew that was going to be a challenge for the labor force,"" he said. ""I thought, you know, how do we get people back into the labor force to solve our coming labor shortage? My conclusion was that social ills were the reason our workforce, our labor force participation rates were so low: long-term unemployment, the opioid epidemic, and then justice involvement-and they're interconnected.""

As he studied the problem, he realized there were already a small group of people working to solve it. He explained, ""And then, frankly, by accident I started coming across employers who had figured out how to tackle this vast opportunity, find people who were ready to turn their lives around and were committed to do so, and then give them the tools they needed to thrive. I realized they all had the same model. So I started spreading that model, and the book is the culmination of that effort.""

Chapter four of Korzenik's book is entitled, ""Success Is Not Random,"" and the man whose name kicks off that chapter would agree. Dan Meyer is CEO of Nehemiah Manufacturing in Cincinnati. He started off his career with 15 years in corporate America, doing stints with companies such as Procter & Gamble and Bristol-Myers. Then it was time for a change.

""I started a company-I always wanted to start my own-called Changing Paradigms."" That was his first foray into contract manufacturing for national brands, including P&G. He sold the company in 2006 and began searching for what was next.

A devout Catholic, Meyer explained the driving factor: ""My faith really drives everything I do."" That led to his founding principles. ""Let's come into the inner city and provide stable employment for those who need it most. I always say we knew the 'why' of the company before we knew the 'what.' He founded Nehemiah in 2009.

He already had a strong relationship with his former customers at P&G, so he told them he wanted to do it again. Co-manufacturing for them remains Nehemiah's main business.

The plant was right across the street from the City Gospel Mission. In Nehemiah's year two, they asked Meyer if he would hire someone with a felony. He decided they had to give it a shot. ""We hired one,"" he said. ""Then another, Then another. Each one was motivated, dedicated, hard-working, thankful for a job. Then we'd lose them.""

Digging into the problem, the Nehemiah team discovered why. ""You must have a job when you come out,"" said Meyer. ""But that's 1A. 1B is how do I get there. And 1C is where do I live. All those barriers are daunting, particularly when you first come out.""

Lester Young discovered the same problems from the other end of the equation when he was released from prison after serving over 22 years. Now an accomplished speaker and author, he has just written his fifth book on the subject, The Five Keys 2 ReEntry: A Handbook for Life After Incarceration. ""There are so many challenges a person faces after incarceration, and most people enter back into the workforce in survival mode and never get a true acclimation into the workforce,"" he said. ""I didn't realize how I was going to experience the culture shock of going back into the workforce. It was a lot of emotions, a lot of anxiety, a lot of panic attacks.""

Nehemiah hired social workers to help employees with those problems and to get them the help they need. Today they have three full-time social workers serving 170 second chance employees.

Another manufacturer Korzenik featured in his book is Butterball Farms, a specialty butter producer in Grand Rapids, Michigan. A family business founded by the late Leo Peters in 1951, it's now run by Leo's son, Mark Peters, the company's CEO and author of The Source: Using the Power of Collaboration to Stabilize Your Workforce and Impact Your Community. ""About 35% of our workforce in total has been incarcerated at some point,"" he said. ""And that's not just entry level. We've got some people that have been working for us for 20 years, who have really built a nice career with our company.""

It was in the mid to late 1990s when Butterball first started its second chance hiring, after participating in a local work-release program. ""We had this great experience with these guys, and what started happening is they would get paroled, and [then] they'd quit coming to work,"" Peters said. ""We started asking some questions. Some of what we learned was pretty simple. If we knew they were going to be out on parole, we'd say that's great... but we really need you to keep coming to work. You're an important part of our workforce and we want you to keep coming back.

""No one had ever said that to them.""

That's a point Young makes as well. ""Learn first-person language,"" he said. ""Look at your application for words like felon and ex-con. They're human beings-they shouldn't be treated like they have leprosy. Don't isolate, don't discriminate. Be welcoming.""

""The number one indicator of someone going back into the prison system is whether or not they have a job,"" added Peters. ""And the second biggest thing is whether they go back to the same group of associates they had before they went in. We should be hiring people because it's the right thing to do. Some of the people coming out of the prison system have the skill set, they have the dedication, they have the desire to work hard to change their lives.""

For those considering launching into second chance hiring but worried about potential risks, Peters offered what Butterball has experienced over the decades: ""We have some people who were violent offenders. But we've never had any workplace violence or threats or any sort of unrest because of people that we've hired who have come out of the prison system.""

Meanwhile, the workforce challenges certainly aren't going to fix themselves, as retirements accelerate for our largest generation, and we don't have the numbers to replace them. ""The message to employers is what worked for you in terms of talent acquisition and retention over the last forty or fifty years isn't going to work going forward,"" said Korzenik. ""You have to react to this."""

Doing so would require Congress to pass legislation, a move lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have proposed in recent years. Consumer banks like JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup earn a tidy share of the roughly $120 billion in credit-card interest and fees Americans pay each year, and industry groups have fought past efforts to cap fees by arguing that it would make it difficult for Americans to get approved for credit cards.

The Fed's Interest Rate Cut Reflects an Increasingly Troubled Economy

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point. The action will take the rate to between 4.75% and 5% immediately. The Fed also announced more cuts are likely before the end of the year. The combination suggests the Fed is taking the threat of a slowdown to the American economy seriously. It's about time; in fact, it's long past time. The signs of trouble in the economy are increasing. Credit card debt has been rising over the past year. So, too, have credit card delinquencies, which are now at their highest rate since the 2008 financial crisis. Auto loan delinquencies are up as well. Unemployment, though still a relatively low 4.2%, is nearly half a percentage point higher than a year ago. Payroll growth is slowing, and the job market is stagnating, particularly for white-collar workers. [MSNBC]

JPMorgan in Talks with Apple over Goldman Credit Card Partnership

JPMorgan Chase is in talks with Apple about replacing Goldman Sachs as the tech giant's credit-card partner. The discussions started earlier this year and have advanced in recent weeks, but any potential deal could still be months away. Goldman and Apple reportedly pulled the plug last year on their partnership, which included credit cards and savings accounts. Goldman is facing a costly exit from the partnership that is seen by other lenders as too risky and unprofitable. After its foray into consumer banking flopped, Goldman has refocused on its traditional mainstays: investment banking and trading. [Reuters]

CFPB Takes Aim at ATM, Debit Card Fees

Banks must maintain evidence that customers have opted in to overdraft coverage, the CFPB said. The agency is fighting what it calls ""phantom opt-in"" agreements, in which banks claim they obtained customers' consent to charge fees on overdrawn accounts but have no proof of that accord. A signed form, an unalterable electronic signature or a recorded phone call can serve as proof that consumers opted in to overdraft coverage. The bureau also emphasized that under the Electronic Fund Transfer Act's Regulation E, overdraft coverage is an opt-in process rather than a default from which consumers opt out. [Payments Dive]

How The Fed's Interest-Rate Cuts Could Impact The Labor Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/09/19/how-the-feds-interest-rate-cuts-could-impact-the-labor-market/,2024-09-19T19:44:58Z,"The Federal Reserve made a significant move on Wednesday, cutting its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to a range of 4.75% to 5%. This marks the first reduction in borrowing costs since March 2020, signaling a pivotal shift in monetary policy after more than two years of aggressive rate hikes aimed at combating inflation.

The decision reflects the Fed's growing confidence in taming inflation and its renewed focus on supporting the job market.

In July, the unemployment rate in the United States increased to 4.3%, marking its highest level since October 2021, as reported by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The rate remained relatively stable at 4.2% in the following month.

While unemployment remains low by historical standards, the recent government data has signaled a trend of ""cooling"" in the labor market, prompting a letter by three Democratic senators on Monday asking Fed Chair Jerome Powell to ""consider implementing rate cuts more aggressively upfront to mitigate potential risks to the labor market.""

""Employment numbers adjust slowly, so the Fed should frontload rate cuts to avoid sliding towards a potential crisis,"" wrote Senators Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) and Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.).

In the memo, the senators also stated, ""At the end of August 2024, the Bureau of Labor Statistics released their preliminary benchmark annual review of employment data, which revealed that there were 818,000 fewer jobs in the 12 months that ended in March of this year than were initially estimated. While these are not job losses, they do indicate that job growth has been much slower than the data previously indicated. Some conservative economists believe that job growth has been even weaker since then.""

A 50-basis-point rate cut by the Fed signals its strong desire to stimulate economic growth. Lower interest rates generally make borrowing cheaper for businesses, which can encourage them to expand operations, invest in new projects and potentially hire more workers. This increased economic activity can lead to job creation across various sectors.

For consumers, lower rates can stimulate spending, which in turn can drive demand for goods and services, potentially leading to more hiring to meet this demand.

A stronger economy often results in a more competitive job market. As businesses expand, employers may need to offer higher salaries to attract and retain talent, which would strengthen the bargaining positions of workers in salary negotiations. With the high cost of living, employees may push for larger salary increases to maintain their purchasing power.

In a growing economy, employees may feel more confident about seeking promotions or career advancements, even if it means changing employers. This was evidenced during the Great Resignation, when a large number of workers voluntarily left their jobs. The Covid-19 pandemic triggered a significant shift in the American workforce, with over 50 million employees quitting in 2022, following 47.8 million resignations in 2021.

Rate cuts could lead to a more stable job market, reducing the risk of layoffs and providing greater job security. As companies find it cheaper to borrow and invest, they may be more likely to retain existing staff and potentially create new positions.

Moreover, lower mortgage rates can boost construction activity and create jobs in that sector. While a rate cut is generally seen as positive for job growth, its effectiveness can depend on broader economic conditions, business confidence, and how companies choose to use the lower-cost capital available to them."
Hiring A Job And Navigating A Career Begins In K-12 Schools,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brunomanno/2024/09/19/hiring-a-job-and-navigating-a-career-begins-in-k-12-schools/,2024-09-19T18:57:07Z,"The jobs-to-be-done theory has implications for K-12 career education.

A successful move from one job to another is not only about organizations hiring individuals to do something for those organizations. It's also about individuals hiring organizations to do something for themselves. This makes job moves a mutual engagement between the demands of job needers and the supply of job seekers.

This approach to jobs is an application of the jobs-to-be-done theory, described by Clayton Christensen and his colleagues in a 2016 Harvard Business Review article. They write, ""People buy products and services to get jobs done, where 'job' is shorthand for what an individual really seeks to accomplish in a given circumstance. Jobs are never simply about function -- they have powerful social and emotional dimensions.""

Ethan Bernstein, Michael Horn, and Bob Moesta in their forthcoming book Job Moves: 9 Steps for Making Progress in Your Career, make this theory central to their approach to career development. For well over a decade, they've analyzed the activities of thousands of job switchers to distill 9 steps that help job seekers make their next job move.

The book begins by describing the four quests of job seekers: escaping a dead end; regaining control over life at work; aligning work with their knowledge and skills; and moving forward to develop their knowledge and skills and deepen what motivates them. It then details 9 steps for making progress in a career, like ensuring a job seeker builds pattern recognition over job moves, developing a balance sheet of career assets and liabilities, and creating a career story for the marketplace.

K-12 students often don't receive information from schools on practical pathways to careers and opportunity. A Morning Consult poll reports that less than half of Gen Z high schoolers said they had enough information to decide the best career or education pathway after high school. Two-thirds of high schoolers and graduates said they would have benefited from more career exploration in middle or high school. This gap between the career preparation that students want and what schools provide leaves students struggling in the transition from school to work, with lower wages when they enter the workforce.

K-12 schools are solving this career education problem by creating education and training frameworks and career navigation services that include partnerships with community colleges, four-year colleges, employers, and other community organizations. The jobs-to-be-done perspective is an important contribution to this work because it sees jobs as a mutual venture with social and emotional dimensions, including support structures, personal guidance, and mentorship.

For example, Colorado's work-based learning framework includes three categories: learning about work through events like career fairs with industry speakers; learning through work through activities like internships; and learning at work through hands-on experiences like apprenticeships with mentors.

Maryland's approach is based on career awareness, career exploration, career preparation, and career seeking and advancement. Texas Education Agency's Work Based Learning Continuum includes descriptions of the roles of providers, K-12 schools, colleges, workforce boards, and other community organizations.

Career navigation includes three elements, according to the Harvard University Project on Workforce: acquiring knowledge about one's skills and goals, including career training pathways; making informed career plans and charting a pathway to that career; and keeping informed of changing industry standards and taking steps to continue career advancement. These involve support services like coaching and mentoring, tools that help individuals assess their progress, programs and courses that provide knowledge, and structures and organizations like career centers that offer advice and personal support.

Career navigators and navigator organizations are central to these approaches. Career navigators are advisors that provide guidance and information to individuals and families as they explore learning options and career pathways. They help people make informed choices by identifying their strengths, understanding job requirements, and getting the education and credentials needed for career success.

Navigator organizations use technology platforms to collect and aggregate information that assists in the navigation process, including using artificial intelligence to help navigators and their clients. For example, YouScience uses artificial intelligence to create assessments that help young people discover personal strengths and aptitudes and match them to potential careers.

The international 38-member Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) examined the link between 15-year-old students' participation in career education and adult career outcomes in 8 countries, including the U.S. The report concludes that there is ""evidence that secondary school students who explore, experience and think about their futures in work frequently encounter lower levels of unemployment, receive higher wages, and are happier in their careers as adults.""

A Jobs for the Future report shows how career education develops the technical knowledge and material aspects of success and its relational dimensions, especially for Black learners (and workers). This includes mentoring relationships and professional networks that help them navigate their careers.

Career education also deepens young people's knowledge of the culture of work and fosters their capacity to aspire to, create, and navigate the work pathways that make their ambitions a reality. Additionally, it has psychological benefits like helping them develop an occupational identity and vocational self, which gives them a better sense of their values and abilities.

On a practical level, career education creates faster and less expensive pathways to jobs and careers. Finally, career education fosters local civic engagement from employers and other community partners by cultivating the connections and bonds essential to innovation, economic dynamism, and a flourishing local civil society.

Jobs-to-be-done theory sees a job search as a two-way venture, a cooperative activity between job seekers and job needers. This contributes to making the workplace a social environment that nurtures social capital or networks of relationships between individuals.

The American Perspectives Survey by the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) reports that adults name the workplace as the top generator of social capital, greater than places of worship, schools, and neighborhoods. It cites research that shows workplace social capital explains almost 30% of the variation in job satisfaction. It also increases job performance and reduces mental health issues like depression.

The survey finds that more than half of Americans said that they made a close friend in their workplace (42%) or that of a spouse's or partner's workplace (10%), though having close friends in the workplace is more likely to occur for those with college degrees (45%) than those without degrees (35%). Additionally, women -- no matter what level of education -- are social capital catalysts in the workplace. They devote more time and effort than men organizing and participating in workplace social activities, with college-educated women reporting the highest levels of activity.

Finally, there is an educational divide on workplace career guidance and mentoring. More than 6 out of ten (62%) college graduates report that they check in with their boss about career guidance at least occasionally compared to around 4 out of ten (44%) of those without degrees. The college-educated are far more likely to have work mentors (57%) than those with a high school degree (31%). While men and women with degrees are about equally likely to have a mentor (56% versus 57%), working men without a degree are more likely than women to have a mentor (36% versus 26%).

The jobs-to-be-done perspective on pathways to jobs and careers has significant implications for young people and K-12 schools. It requires career frameworks that help young people move from career exposure to career exploration to career experiences. Navigating this range of activities helps young people develop the knowledge, skills, and relationship networks they need to pursue opportunity. As the adage reminds us, it is not only what you know but also whom you know. In short: Knowledge + Networks = Opportunity.

The jobs-to-be-done viewpoint also has the potential to help individuals overcome degree and gender differences found in the social workplace. Exposing young people to this approach from the earliest years of schooling and providing them with career navigation support gives young people a way to develop the knowledge, social skills, and networks they need to reach their potential.

Opportunity pluralism is a complement to the jobs-to-be-done perspective. It encourages multiple pathways to work, careers, and opportunity. This makes the nation's opportunity structure more pluralistic, allowing individuals to pursue opportunity through many avenues linked to labor-market demands. It also aims to ensure that every individual -- regardless of background -- has pathways to acquiring the knowledge and networks needed for career success.

The jobs-to-be-done approach to careers reorients the goal of K-12 public schools. It suggests a sea change in them, one that has the potential to allow students to gain the economic and social benefits of work, flourish in life, and reach their potential."
Why The Fed's Lower Rates Will Boost Small Business Earnings,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rohitarora/2024/09/19/why-the-feds-lower-rates-will-boost-small-business-earnings/,2024-09-19T10:11:47Z,"The Federal Reserve's intention to slash interest rates at its Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on Sept. 18, was perhaps the worst kept secret in America. However, the extent of the cut was a source of speculation until Chair Jerome Powell announced a half-percent (50 bps) drop in the Federal Funds rate Wednesday afternoon.

The long-anticipated cut, larger than the typical quarter-percent (25 bps) drop, was the first since the Fed started raising rates in 2022 to curb skyrocketing inflation.

The move came after a split vote at the Fed's scheduled two-day FOMC meeting on Sept. 17-18 and brings the central bank's benchmark interest rate down to a new range of 4.75%-5.0%. For more than a year since July 2023, rates have been stuck at the upper range of 5.5%. The figure was the highest seen in more than two decades.

""Recent indicators suggest that economic activity has continued to expand at a solid pace. Job gains have slowed, and the unemployment rate has moved up but remains low,"" Chair Powell reported. ""Inflation has made further progress toward the (FOMC) Committee's 2% objective but remains somewhat elevated.""

Inflation has slowed throughout 2024. GDP rose at an annual rate of 2.2% in the first half of the year, and data points to a similar rate of growth this quarter. Chair Powell explained that the economic outlook is uncertain, and the FOMC is attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate of maximizing employment and keeping inflation low.

""In light of the progress on inflation and the balance of risks, the committee decided to lower the target range for the federal funds rate by 1/2 percentage point to 4-3/4 to 5%,"" he said at his press conference in Washington. ""In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.""

This could mean additional rate cuts in 2024 and perhaps even into 2025. In assessing its next interest rate move, the Fed will take into account a wide range of information, including labor market conditions, inflation pressures and expectations, and financial market and international developments.

What it means for small businesses

The interest rate cuts could lead to increased lending appetite among traditional lenders, as lower interest rates help rebalance their portfolios. This could result in more borrowers qualifying for bank loans, which typically come with more favorable rates than non-bank lenders offer.

Lower interest rates will lead to reduced interest payments for small business owners. Most small business loans are variable rate loans, and the steady stream of rate hikes initiated by the Fed increased the cost of loan repayments, thereby hurting their earnings. Reduced interest payments for businesses should positively impact their earnings in the short term. Mortgages, in contrast, are often fixed rate, which shields homeowners from enduring the cost of rising interest rates.

Additionally, lower interest rates will lead to reduced interest payments for consumers, which should help improve the country's overall economic health. Consumers are hurting badly with all the credit card delinquency and with auto loan delinquency at record levels.

During his press conference, Chair Powell said the U.S. economy is in good shape; it is growing at a solid pace, inflation is coming down, and the labor market is strong. This is good news for small business owners whose earnings have been hurt by inflationary costs, as well as high interest rates over the past two years.

One note of caution, however: while short-term earnings may benefit from lower interest rates, the long-term effects on the economy and potential structural changes remain uncertain.

The Fed's decision to cut rates is seen as a bet, and the next few months will reveal whether it leads to a soft landing or a more significant economic impact. Inflation is driven by numerous factors, and the outcome will depend on whether money supply increases lead to higher core inflation or if core inflation remains unchanged. In the coming months, the Fed will no doubt assess the effectiveness of the rate cuts and their impact on the economy to make adjustments accordingly."
The Fed's Half Percentage Point Rate Cut Could Mean Worry,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/eriksherman/2024/09/18/the-feds-half-percentage-point-rate-cut-could-mean-worry/,2024-09-19T00:28:30Z,"The focus for weeks on the Federal Reserve's rate cut today has been on how large it would be. A quarter of a percent? Half a percent? Now we know it's the latter. The question is what that means for the economy and expectations of the near future.

During the central bank's annual retreat in Jackson Hole, Wyoming in late August, Chair Jerome Powell made two things clear in his remarks. One was that the ""time has come for policy to adjust."" In other words, a first rate cut would start in September. The amount wasn't clear.

His other point: ""It seems unlikely that the labor market will be a source of elevated inflationary pressures anytime soon,"" Powell said. ""We do not seek or welcome further cooling in labor market conditions.""

The formulation was due to the Fed's dual mandate of maintaining price stability and also full employment. Inflation has already been on a path down toward the central bank's 2% target. The last year-over-year inflation figure from the Consumer Price Index was 2.5%.

The labor market, though, has given concerns to many. The Bureau of Labor Statistics revised job market reports from April 2023 to March 2024 by a total of 818,000 downward. Previous such annual revisions typically reset the original numbers by 0.1%. This time the correction was 0.5% -- five times as large. There were some categories, such as utilities as well as transportation and warehousing, that saw upward revisions. Nowhere near enough, though, to overcome plummets in manufacturing, professional and business services, and leisure and hospitality.

Then came the August jobs report, released in early September. The number of new jobs, 142,000, was 11.8% lower than the median economists' forecasts of 161,000 collected by Dow Jones. July had an even larger miss, with 117,000 jobs rather than the expected 185,000. With those numbers were several months of manufacturing contraction and weakening wage growth.

In one aspect, all this was good news for rate cuts, especially among those who have believed economic theories that unemployment has to rise to tamp down wage growth pressure on inflation.

Then there's the other hand. Weakening labor markets also mean that companies don't need as much help because the businesses are looking ahead with the assumption that there will be a slowdown, so why hire now?

As consulting economist Claudia Sahm -- who had in the past worked at the Fed and White House and had advised Congress -- wrote about the coming rate cut, ""The disappointing labor market data since the July FOMC meeting should add another 25 basis points [0.25 percentage points] to the cut"" on top of a similar amount for the falling inflation rate.

There's also the question of economic growth. First, look at a graph of straight-ahead GDP per quarter growth based on data from the U.S. Bureau of Economic Analysis and made available by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis.

Seems fine, right? Now look at a graph, by quarter, of year-over-year GDP growth.

A different picture entirely. From the 1940s up to the late 1970s, there was a throughline of increasing growth. The 1980s saw the trend tip over toward a long decline up to the Covid-19 pandemic crash, then an upward spike because there was big growth over the global slowdown. But now, year-over-year growth was sliding.

Whether slowing growth brought worry about a recession or concern about the labor market being a bad sign, the assumptions of a happy time with a ""soft landing"" for the economy should look at what the Fed is doing and reconsider.

Or, as Oxford Economics wrote after the announcement, ""The Fed doesn't like to admit policy errors,"" but it probably started cutting late and is trying to keep a soft landing in sight."

""We've waited. And I think that patience has really paid dividends in the form of our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably under 2%, so I think that is what enables us to take this strong move today,"" Powell said during the press conference.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told reporters at the Capitol on Wednesday the ""timing"" of the cut ""is a little suspect,"" before adding the decision is ""welcome news for consumers."" Vice President Kamala Harris called the move ""welcome news for Americans.""

The Fed had not slashed rates since March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic began. The reduction brings the federal fund rates down between 4.75% and 5% after it remained between 5.25% and 5.5% since last year, after the Fed moved to aggressively hike rates to combat decades-high inflation. Trump suggested months ago the Fed could cut rates before the election, telling Bloomberg a pre-election rate cut is ""something that they know they shouldn't be doing."" However, the move to lower rates coincided with the cooling of inflation and a rise in unemployment (the Fed usually increases rates when inflation swells), though the 50 basis point cut was on the upper end of consensus estimates. Powell said the decision involved ""a lot of discussion back and forth"" but, despite one dissenting vote within the Fed, there was ""broad support"" for slashing rates 50 basis points.

Fed Cuts Interest Rates For First Time In 4 Years: Here's What It Means For You (Forbes)

Kamala Harris' interview with Black journalists 'lacked specifics': CNN host Abby Phillip,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-interview-black-journalists-lacked-specifics-cnn-host-abby-phillip,2024-09-18T23:12:27Z,"CNN host Abby Phillip said Tuesday that Vice President Kamala Harris' interview with Black journalists ""lacked specifics"" on Wednesday, and specifically called out the vice president for not having a quick and ""understandable"" answer to a question about the economy.

""Black journalists today at the NABJ [National Black Journalists Association] pressed vice president Kamala Harris on policies from guns to the war in Gaza, but many of her answers lacked specifics,"" Phillip began.

The CNN panel discussed Harris' interview with Black journalists, as well as Hillary Clinton's assertion that it was a ""double standard"" to ask the vice president about policies.

Podcast host Kara Swisher said she didn't necessarily agree with Clinton, and noted that polls show people want to ""know more"" about Harris.

59 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO A PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

Phillip played a clip of Harris responding to a question about whether voters were better off than they were four years ago.

""We came in during the worst public health epidemic in centuries. We came in after the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War and a lot of it due in large part to the mismanagement by the former president, as it relates to COVID and, obviously, January 6. And we had then a lot of work to do to clean up a mess. As of today, we have created over 16 million new jobs, over 800,000 new manufacturing jobs. We have the lowest Black unemployment rate in generations,"" Harris said.

Phillip argued that Harris should have something ""quick"" and ""understandable"" ready in response to a question like that, adding, ""and that wasn't really it.""

CNN political commentator Ashley Allison said she wished Harris would have alluded to the next four years in her answer to the question about whether Americans were better off during Trump's presidency.

""Answer the question,"" CNN political commentator Scott Jennings said. ""She got the same question at the debate, and you know what else, why I went back and watched the debate again, every single policy question she got at the debate, she totally ignored and never answered. Why is it that she believes she does not have to answer to journalists who are asking pretty basic questions of a presidential candidate?""

Swisher said that Harris needed to be ""specific while being vague.""

CNN political analyst Colman Hughes suggested Harris keeping her answers vague was working for her.

""What has worked for Kamala Harris is literally to not make headlines, to give vague but presidential sounding answers to questions, and allow voters to project the image of who they hope she is onto her,"" Hughes said.

Hughes added that while he wanted to know more about her strategies on Russia and Ukraine, Harris ""does tend to get into trouble when she answers off the cuff, she can be a gaffe machine when she's unprepared.""

Following the interview, Politico reported on Wednesday that Harris refused to ""veer off script."" The report said Harris evaded questions about important issues, adding, ""she did not break much ground or stray far from her talking points."""
Opinion | The Fed's interest rate cut reflects an increasingly troubled economy,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-economy-rcna171501,2024-09-18T22:00:36Z,"By Helaine Olen, reporter in residence at the Omidyar Network

On Wednesday, the Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point. The action will take the rate to between 4.75% and 5% immediately. The Fed also announced more cuts are likely before the end of the year.

The combination suggests the Fed is taking the threat of a slowdown to the American economy seriously. It's about time -- in fact, it's long past time.

Yes, at first glance the U.S. economy, appears to be doing ""basically fine,"" as Powell put it in his press conference today. The stock market is booming, and retail sales and consumer confidence remain solid. But under the surface, signs of trouble are increasing.

Credit card debt has been rising over the past year. So, too, have credit card delinquencies, which are now at their highest rate since the 2008 financial crisis. Auto loan delinquencies are up as well. Unemployment, though still a relatively low 4.2%, is nearly half a percentage point higher than a year ago. Payroll growth is slowing, and the job market is stagnating, particularly for white-collar workers.

As a result, many Americans are, if not completely abandoning the YOLO attitudes of recent years, getting increasingly picky about their spending. While overall retail sales are inching higher, restaurant sales are flatlining, and the post-pandemic travel bonanza is slowing, with hotels reporting less demand from vacationers. Aside from Taylor Swift, musicians are struggling to draw crowds. Even Jennifer Lopez canceled a planned tour this summer in the face of flagging sales. Other acts, especially on the nostalgia circuit, joined forces, giving audiences two-for-one deals, seemingly to make it more likely they could fill up the seats. (Elvis Costello and Daryl Hall toured together this spring and summer. So did Rick Springfield and Richard Marx.)

That this would happen has all been clear for some time -- the last of the savings built up over the pandemic ran out in March -- but the Fed cavalierly prioritized its battle against inflation even as it became increasingly obvious that the battle against pandemic-era price increases and gouging is all but won. Last month's consumer price index came in at an annual rate of 2.6%, just a tick higher than it was pre-pandemic. Gasoline prices average about $3.20 a gallon nationally, down 50 cents since April, and some experts think the national average could go below $3. Major retailers like Walmart and Target have dropped prices on thousands of items, so much so they've put pressure on traditionally lower-price-point dollar stores.

The Biden administration has already moved to take on corporate price gougers, and Vice President Kamala Harris says she will continue that effort if elected. Last month, the Justice Department sued software company RealPage, alleging its rent management software offered landlords a backdoor way to collude on rental prices.

The inflation that's hurting American families the most right now is high interest rates -- and the Fed's rate cut can do something about that. Credit card debt now comes with an average rate of well over 20%, while store-branded cards are at a record high with an average annual rate of 30.45%, according to a recently released study from Bankrate. The Fed's move Wednesday should begin to bring these eye-popping rates down.

The same is true of housing costs: While the interest rate on mortgages is most closely tied to the yield on 10-year Treasury bonds -- which are already coming down as inflation eases -- that number is also often influenced by the benchmark rate. The new cut will almost certainly make it easier for millions of Americans to find new homes.

Donald Trump and some of his Republican supporters will most likely argue this was a political decision by the Fed. Trump has said in the past that he believes interest rates are too high but that making a decision this close to the presidential election is ""something they shouldn't be doing.""

Please. This isn't an attempt to throw the election. It's something that should have been done months ago. Powell admitted as much, saying Fed officials ""may have cut earlier"" had they had the economic knowledge they have now in the summer.

As for Trump, always remember: He's only out for one person -- himself. That's why he's complaining both that interest rates should come down and that inflation is higher than ever in U.S. history (as someone who lived through the 1970s, he should know that's a lie). The only purpose of this incoherent position is to argue for his election.

Since 1977, the Federal Reserve has had a dual mandate: to balance and maximize price stability with maximum employment. It's finally back on both cases -- and not a moment too soon."
September Fed Meeting: Fed Cuts Rates For The First Time In Four Years,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/september-fomc-meeting-federal-reserve/,2024-09-18T21:38:04Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

In a move that was widely anticipated and hoped for, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) opted on Wednesday to cut its fed funds interest rate by 50 basis points to a new target range of between 4.75% and 5%.

Wednesday's rate cut marks the first time the Federal Reserve has changed its interest rate target since July 2023 and the first time it has lowered rates since the COVID-19 pandemic began in March 2020. The Fed's rate cut likely means interest rates will continue to drop in the months ahead, but investors and economists remain uncertain about the pace of FOMC rate cuts moving forward.

In addition to the interest rate decision, the Federal Reserve also said it will continue to allow up to $25 billion in Treasury securities and $35 billion in agency mortgage-backed securities (MBS) to mature and roll off its more than $7.1 trillion balance sheet per month.

U.S. inflation is now well below peak levels in 2022, allowing the Fed to take its foot off the gas pedal and begin easing monetary policy. For more than a year, the Fed has delayed an interest rate cut over concerns about choppy and inconsistent inflation data. Wednesday's rate cut suggests Fed officials are finally convinced they have won the battle against inflation and should now shift their attention to supporting a softening labor market.

The first rate cut in four years is a milestone for the Fed, but the next several months will be critical in assessing whether or not the FOMC can achieve a ""soft landing"" for the economy. If the FOMC cut interest rates too soon, it could facilitate a rebound in inflation and undermine years of progress. But if the Fed waited too long to cut rates, the economy could still slip into a recession.

Markets reacted positively to the Fed's policy decision on Wednesday, with the S&P 500 trading one-half percent higher on the day.

Lower interest rates decrease borrowing costs for both companies and consumers, stimulating economic activity. Unfortunately for the Fed, a stronger economy can exacerbate inflation.

Earlier this month, the Labor Department reported the consumer price index (CPI) rose 2.5% year-over-year in August, down from a 2.9% gain in July and well below a 40-year high of 9.1% in June 2022. Food and shelter inflation remain stubbornly high, but lower energy prices have helped ease overall price growth.

In late August, the Commerce Department reported the Fed's preferred inflation measure -- the personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index was up 2.6% year-over-year in July, in-line with its 2.6% gain in June and down from a 2022 peak of 5.3%. The Fed's long-term target for core PCE inflation is 2%.

""The Committee has gained greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably toward 2 percent, and judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals are roughly in balance,"" the FOMC said in its statement on Wednesday.

The Labor Department reported the U.S. economy added 142,000 jobs in August, missing economist expectations of 161,000 new jobs. Average U.S. wages were up 3.8% from a year ago and up 0.4% compared to July. August marked the fourth month out of the last five in which job growth has come in below 200,000.

The U.S. unemployment rate ticked down to 4.2%, but the U-6 unemployment rate reached 7.9%, its highest level since October 2021. The U-6 unemployment rate includes Americans working part-time jobs who would prefer full-time jobs and discouraged workers who have given up seeking employment.

In his post-meeting press conference on Wednesday, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said the large rate cut is not a sign the Fed waited too long to begin easing policy and is now forced to play catch-up.

""We don't think we're behind-we think this is timely. But I think you can take this as a sign of our commitment not to get behind,"" Powell said.

""We've waited, and I think that patience has really paid dividends in the form [of] our confidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%.""

In addition to its monetary policy decisions, the Federal Reserve also updated its long-term economic projections on Wednesday. Committee members estimate a year-end median fed funds rate of 4.4% in 2024, down from their previous projection of 5.1% back in June. The latest rate projections suggest another 50 basis points in rate cuts by the end of 2024.

The Fed's ""dot plot"" depiction of individual members' interest rate expectations indicates nine of the 19 FOMC members believe rates should drop another 25 basis points or less by the end of the year.

The committee projects a 2024 U.S. unemployment rate of 4.4%, up from 4% in June. Fed members cut their 2024 U.S. gross domestic product (GDP) growth projection from 2.1% to 2%. The Federal Reserve also maintained its 2025 GDP growth projection of 2%.

On the inflation front, the Fed's projected 2024 core PCE inflation growth rate dropped from 2.8% to 2.6%.

Some investors have been concerned the Fed waited too long to begin cutting interest rates and the lagging economic impact of higher rates will ultimately trigger a recession. Despite a strong year-to-date performance by the S&P 500, the New York Fed's recession probability model still estimates a 61.7% chance of a U.S. recession sometime in the next 12 months.

Chris Zaccarelli, chief investment officer for Independent Advisor Alliance, says an aggressive Fed opens the door for the S&P 500 to rally to new all-time highs.

""The Fed front-loaded this rate cutting cycle with a jumbo 50 bps rate cut and signaled in their statement that they are focused squarely on the labor market, saying they are 'strongly committed to supporting maximum employment,"" Zaccarelli says.

""Although they pay lip service to the other part of their dual mandate (i.e. inflation), clearly they have taken their eye off that ball,"" Zaccarelli continued. ""And although inflation is much lower now than the peak we saw in 2022, igniting a stock market rally and goosing a growing economy with lower rates risks letting inflation come roaring back before this bull market ends.""

According to CME Group, markets are currently pricing in a 64.1% chance the Fed will issue an additional 25 basis-point rate cut at its next meeting, which concludes on November 1. However, investors and central bankers have roughly six weeks of economic data to monitor between now and then that could significantly impact monetary policy.

Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial, says the Fed's larger rate cut suggests it is concerned about risks to the labor market.

""Equity markets applauded the Fed's decision to initiate its easing cycle with 50 basis points, as the statement noted that the Fed's dual mandates are in balance,"" Krosby says.

""Given how much discussion has surrounded this move, the announcement certainly wasn't a surprise;, however, the lack of guidance by Fed officials indicates that although there was only one dissent there must have been a forceful discussion and work towards building a consensus.""

In the near term, investors will be watching for the August core PCE reading on September 27 to see if inflation is still trending lower heading into the fourth quarter. In addition, the University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment Index reading on September 27 will provide some critical insight into the health of the U.S. consumer."

Key Takeaways

After climbing for the past couple of years, CD rates have been slowly declining in 2024. CD rates tend to track the federal funds rate. When the fed rate goes down, CD rates decline, and vice versa. The Federal Reserve held the federal funds rate steady for nearly a year but made its first rate cut in September 2024. It is likely to continue making modest rate cuts throughout this year. National average CD rates are higher than in years past but are starting to fall. The average 12-month CD earns 1.88% as of September 2024, according to FDIC data.

As the Federal Reserve starts to cut rates, what's happening to interest rates on certificates of deposit (CDs)?

After steady increases over the past couple of years, it appears CD rates are starting to decline. Forecasters say savers should keep their expectations in check.

Here's an overview of where CD interest rates could be headed in 2024 and beyond.

Are CD Rates Going Up?

CD rates are starting to decline. In September 2024, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC)lowered the federal funds rate for the first time in four years, this time to a range spanning from 4.75% to 5%.

Banks generally use the federal funds rate as a guide when setting rates on savings and lending products. As the federal funds rate decreases, you can expect CD rates at many banks to follow suit, and vice-versa.

Right now, the federal funds rate is the federal funds rate is likely to keep declining as inflation continues to cool. ""We certainly have made progress on the inflation front,"" says Amiyatosh Purnanandam, a professor of finance at the University of Michigan.

Rates accurate as of September 17, 2024

In January 2022, the typical APY, or annual percentage yield, for a one-year CD sat at a mere 0.13% -- a pandemic low, according to FDIC data. As of September 2024, average one-year CD rates are at 1.88%.

Other CD terms saw similar increases during the same time frame, including two-year CDs and five-year CDs. The average rate for the former increased from 0.17% to 1.55% and from 0.28% to 1.42% for the latter.

While the current averages may not sound very impressive, the best CD rates now surpass 5.00% APY for one-year CDs and 4.50% APY for two-year CDs and five-year CDs.

CD Rates Forecast 2024

The federal funds rate experienced its first cut in four years in September 2024. Rates are expected to continue to fall by the end of the year. The CME FedWatch Tool, which measures market expectations for federal funds rate changes, shows that most experts expect rates to sit between 4.25% and 4.75% by December 2024.

At its 2024 meetings, the FOMC held the federal funds rate steady at a target range of 5.25% and 5.50%. It projects one rate cut by the end of the year.

Financial markets expect almost a 96% chance of a rate cut by the end of the year. But the Fed's decisions are going to be very data dependent. Inflation and employment readings over the next few months will be closely watched. For now, we are in a holding pattern.

-- Amiyatosh Purnanandam, Michael Stark professor of finance at the University of Michigan

CD rates will likely continue to drop as the federal funds rate decreases throughout the rest of the year.

CD Rate Trends From 2022 Through 2024

While there are no guarantees concerning how interest rates will move in the coming months, here are two predictions for CD rates moving into 2024.

Banks' Motives Dictate Rates for CDs

Banks will do what's best for their bottom lines, and having a gap between mortgage rates and CD rates increases profit. As the inflation rate cools from its 2022 highs, mortgage rates and CD rates are likely to fall as well, but at different paces.

While mortgage rates increased by over three percentage points in 2022, average CD rates only went up by around 2%. For now, banks will likely increase mortgage rates at a quicker pace than CD rates to maintain profit margins.

Treasury Bonds Will Pay More Than CDs

CD rates may be flattening, but if Treasury yields go down in 2024, CD rates could follow -- regardless of what the federal funds rate does. Banks are often slow to adjust CD rates, which means the rates you find at your bank may pale in comparison to Treasury yields. There's an incentive for banks to keep rates on savings products lower: Banks use CDs and other deposits to fund loans and investments in Treasurys, so the lower the rate they pay, the more they profit.

CD Rates From 2009 to 2023

The graph below uses historical FDIC data to display national average rates on CDs from 2009 to 2023 and highlights how CD rates responded to changes in central bank policies, inflation rates and broader economic indicators over the analyzed time span. Rates have been averaged for each year using data available from every month.

Source: FDIC National Rates and Rate Caps

In the years after the 2008 financial crisis, the country entered the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. During this period, the Fed aggressively slashed interest rates to stimulate the economy and restore liquidity to the banking system. As economic conditions improved in the subsequent years, CD rates adjusted accordingly, stabilizing and eventually creeping upward.

In 2019, The Fed cut interest rates again in response to the economic slowdown caused by the U.S.-China trade war.

The year 2020 brought an unprecedented global pandemic that caught the world off guard. Within weeks, this virus spread around the globe and led to severe economic consequences. In the United States, roughly 20.5 million people lost their jobs in April 2020, and the unemployment rate jumped to 14.7%.

In an effort to support the economy, the FOMC dropped the federal funds target rate to a range of zero to 0.25%. However, as the economy bounced back shortly after, so did inflation. The strained supply lines due to Covid-19 -- paired with an increase in demand -- caused prices to surge, and the FOMC had no choice but to implement consecutive rate hikes. CD rates responded accordingly and jumped drastically from 2021 to 2023.

Factors That Influence CD Rates

Just like mortgage rates, savings rates and credit card interest rates, CD rates correlate strongly with the federal funds rate. When the Federal Reserve increases its benchmark rate, interest rates across the economy, including CD rates, increase. Similarly, decreases in the federal funds rate cause CD rates to fall.

Part of the draw of opening a CD is that its earnings are guaranteed regardless of economic environment changes. If you lock in an interest rate by purchasing a CD, you'll be paid that guaranteed rate for the entire term of the CD.

At the beginning of 2023, many Americans believed we were headed for a recession, but current opinions among economic pundits are decidedly mixed. The Federal Reserve typically reacts to recessions by reducing interest rates to trigger an increase in consumer and business spending.

Do CD rates go up with inflation?

Yes, CD rates typically rise with inflation but not directly because of inflation. Rather, the Federal Reserve increases the federal funds rate to combat inflation. And because interest rates throughout the economy are tied to the federal funds rate, when the Federal Reserve increases its benchmark rate, CD rates generally increase.

Do CD rates go up with the prime rate?

The prime rate is a benchmark widely used by banks when setting interest rates. Returns on savings accounts, interest-bearing checking accounts and CDs typically track the prime rate, which in turn tracks the federal funds rate. When the prime rate goes up, you can expect CD rates to rise.

Do CD rates go up during a recession?

Historical data suggests that CD rates track the federal funds rate, which has held true during past recessions. Typically, the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates during a recession to spur growth and reduce unemployment. Because CD rates follow the federal funds rate, CD rates will usually go down during a recession.

Will CD rates go up when the Fed raises interest rates?

Yes, like other deposit accounts, CD rates tend to rise whenever the federal funds rate increases. Banks and credit unions use the federal funds rate as a guide when setting rates on deposit products like CDs.

How Often Do CD Rates Change?

CD rates are variable, meaning they can change at any time. Most banks adjust CD rates according to fluctuations in the federal funds rate, which can change every month or two when the FOMC meets to make monetary policy decisions.

The FOMC may decide to maintain rates steady, in which case CD rates likely won't change much either. If the Fed rate goes up, CD rates will likely increase shortly thereafter, and if the Fed rate goes down, CD rates will likely decrease.

How To Maximize the Benefits of Current CD Rates

With CD rates elevated, now is the time to take advantage of savings opportunities. Below are some tips to maximize savings benefits with CDs.

Shop around. Compare CDs at several banks and credit unions to find the highest rates. CDs have fixed rates, which means guaranteed returns based on the rate, account balance and term length. Securing the highest rate will help you earn the most interest over the course of the CD term. Choose the best CD term. Consider how long you can keep available funds tied up in the bank when deciding which term length to choose. The last thing you want is to choose a term that is too long and end up having to withdraw funds early and pay a penalty. Also, keep your eye open for banks with higher promotional CD rates on specific terms. Create a CD ladder. Increase your savings while maintaining some flexibility by creating a CD ladder. This strategy involves opening several CDs with different term lengths. When a CD reaches maturity, reinvest the funds into a new CD. CD ladders keep some money accessible in case you need it. Remember to shop CD rates each time you open a new CD to lock in the best rates.

Where To Find the Best CD Rates

It might be a good time to shop around for the best CD rates while APYs are still high, especially if you have funds you won't need access to right away. Here's where to find them.

Online banks often offer the highest rates -- and charge the lowest fees -- because they don't carry the same overhead costs as brick-and-mortar banks. Credit unions are also more likely to offer competitive CD rates. Because they're nonprofit organizations, they can reinvest earnings into providing better accounts and services to members. One-year CDs are currently paying some of the highest APYs. If you're flexible on term length, you can also look for promotional CDs, which pay temporarily elevated rates on unconventional terms (like 11 or 19 months) to attract customers.

Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)

Will CD rates go up in 2024?

Not likely. Many experts agree there's a good chance CD rates have topped out for now, and rate cuts may take place later on in 2024.

When will CD rates go up?

Rates are unlikely to go up this year. How various interest rates -- including those on CDs -- move during the coming months will depend greatly on what the Federal Reserve does. The Fed boosted its benchmark federal funds rate numerous times throughout 2022 and the first half of 2023, finally holding rates steady at a target range of 5.25% to 5.50% through the second half of 2023. Rates may eventually begin to decline in 2024.

How much money should I have in CDs?

The amount of money you should keep in a CD depends on your financial situation and goals, and there's no perfect number you should aim for. Instead, look at CDs as one piece of your overall investment strategy.

Keep in mind that CDs aren't a great option for emergency savings because you'll often pay penalties for withdrawals prior to a CD's maturity. CDs also aren't a good long-term investment option because returns on CDs are generally lower than returns on investments. In any case, you'll need to deposit enough funds to meet the CD's minimum opening deposit requirement.

Should I invest in a CD?

CDs offer guaranteed returns and are federally insured. If you have funds available to invest that you won't need right away, CDs are an excellent way to build up your savings. It's a good idea to have a fully-funded emergency fund in place so you don't have to withdraw money from a CD before it reaches maturity.

If you decide to open a CD, consider future financial needs, how much money you can afford to keep locked up in a CD account, and for how long.

If you're unsure if you can part ways with your cash long-term, you might be better off looking for the best high-yield savings accounts, which may offer rates comparable to CD rates.

Mortgage Rates Are Coming Down. When Does It Make Sense To Buy Or Refinance?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/rates-are-coming-down/,2024-09-18T19:29:14Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

Borrowers are finally starting to see signs of hope.

Mortgage rates are at their lowest point in 18 months -- and expected to fall further -- after the Federal Reserve cut short-term interest rates by 0.50% or 50 basis points for the first time since the onset of the pandemic. One basis point is one one-hundredth of a percentage point.

If you're debating whether to refinance or thinking about buying a home, this new environment presents a question: When should you act?

Don't expect mortgage rates to fall dramatically after the Fed's decision to cut the federal funds rate.

""The first rate cut has been baked in,"" says Jessica Lautz, deputy chief economist at the National Association of Realtors (NAR).

Mortgage rates are influenced by 10-year Treasury yields rather than the federal funds rate. Bond traders have been expecting a lower rate environment for a while, which has resulted in 10-year yields dropping from roughly 5% in October 2023 to around 3.60% now.

Over the same period of time, the rate on a 30-year mortgage fell from 7.79% to 6.20%, according to Freddie Mac.

While mortgage rates are expected to continue to decline, they may not fall as fast in the near future.

When we look at the last 11 rate hikes set by the Fed and mortgage rate trends in the table below, the weekly average 30-year fixed mortgage rate saw minimal changes immediately following each meeting. The significant changes are seen over a longer time horizon.

That's because the economy has remained relatively strong, growing at an inflation-adjusted annual rate of 3% in the second three months of the year, and is currently forecast by the Atlanta Fed's GDPNow Tool to grow by 2.9% in the third quarter.

And inflation, which has decelerated in recent months, is still above the Fed's 2% target. The Fed's preferred inflation metric, the core personal personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, shows prices were 2.5% higher in July than a year prior.

The Fed, then, will be cautious as it lowers rates further.

Since 10-year Treasury yields tend to fall when the economy is expected to slow, it's entirely possible mortgage rates will settle at a level well above where they were before the pandemic.

The Mortgage Bankers Association expects mortgage rates to level off at about 6.4% this year, 5.9% in 2025 and 5.5% by the end of 2026, compared to 3.70% at the end of 2019.

In the meantime, buttress your credit score before you apply for a mortgage.

""You want to have your best credit score, your best scenario of income when you apply for a loan,"" says San Francisco-based certified financial planner Sarah Behr.

It's hard to take advantage of better rates if you've recently racked up credit card debt or experienced a job loss or lower income. Make sure you're using a small proportion of your available limit on your credit cards and that you've been gainfully employed over the past two years, preferably with the same employer without interruption.

You'll have difficulty receiving a loan if you've been out of work for more than six months in the preceding two years or if your overall debt level exceeds 36% of your income.

This could be a challenge for some since credit card debt now sits at a record $1.14 trillion, per the New York Fed, and the unemployment rate has jumped 0.7 percentage points over the past year to 4.2%.

Check these boxes before considering a new loan.

If you bought a home when mortgage rates were around 8% and have a clean financial record, you may be itching to refinance your mortgage.

But you don't want to refinance just because rates are lower. The plurality of homebuyers in 2022, according to NAR, purchased a home with a rate between 5.5% and 6%.

Refinancing comes with closing costs typically from 2% to 6% of the loan. If you've got $500,000 left on your mortgage, that means you'll owe somewhere between $10,000 and $30,000 in fees.

Given the costs, you should put off a refinance until you can save 2 percentage points on your mortgage rate, says David DeVita, a wealth advisor at Girard, a Univest Wealth Division.

With tens of thousands of dollars in fees, you don't want to find yourself refinancing every few years, especially if you just closed on the house a few years earlier.

""You need to get into the math,"" says DeVita. ""If you're only saving a couple hundreds of dollars a month, let's find something else in your budget that you can cut.""

Your goal, says Behr, is to knock off enough from your monthly payment to cover your refinance fee within a year or so.

The trade-off in waiting for a lower interest rate, though, is dealing with higher interest payments now.

While it's ideal to wait for lower rates, you may want to pull the trigger more quickly if you overextended yourself to purchase your current home.

""If you're struggling financially, where you are in the range where it'll make a significant difference to your monthly cash flow, then it's something to consider now,"" says DeVita.

If you can't afford the upfront costs, your lender will let you add it to your new loan. But that just adds to the amount you'll owe.

The past few years have been the worst time to buy a home in at least the past 15 years, according to the Atlanta Fed's Home Ownership Affordability Monitor.

The index looks at housing conditions, such as average prices and interest rates, and creates an index with an affordability threshold of 100. Anything higher than that tells buyers that homes are broadly affordable, while a lower reading signifies the market is frothy.

The average reading in 2023 was 71.9 and 70.9 in the first half of 2024. To put that in perspective, the reading was 73.7 in 2006.

In 2019, the last full year before the pandemic, it was 105.2.

The good news is that conditions are starting to improve.

The median sales price on homes sold was $412,300 in the second quarter of 2024, which is roughly $25,000 lower than two years ago. Mortgage rates are coming down, and the supply of homes for sales has ticked up in recent months, according to NAR.

If you're looking for a new home, you don't want to wait to make a bid just because mortgage rates may fall in the months to come.

Builders in housing developments can offer incentives in terms of lower prices or reduced financing costs if you use their preferred lender, Behr says.

This can take the form of credits that lower closing costs when you finalize your mortgage or a lower interest rate for a set period of time, such as two years.

You can use the savings on closing costs today toward refinancing fees when you ultimately go to apply for a lower rate.

Mortgage originations declined by 6.8% in the first quarter of the year, according to data firm ATTOM, and have declined in 11 of the last 12 quarters to their lowest level in 24 years.

Since demand has been low, potential buyers have a good opportunity to make lenders compete against themselves for your business.

""You need to shop for your mortgage,"" says Phoenix-area CFP Raman Singh.

Once you have a good quote, contact your other potential lenders to see if you can get a better deal.

If your finances are lined up, and you've found a house you like, put in an offer soon.

With interest rates set to decline over the next few years, the demand for homes could rise, thereby causing prices to rise.

""If you want to buy a house and you wait until rates come next spring, there could be pent-up demand -- and then you're back into bidding wars,"" says Behr. ""You can buy a house now and plan to refinance in two years as long as you're not overextending yourself.""

While there's no October FOMC rate-decision meeting, experts predict more rate cuts in November and December. What's more, those experts also expect more rate cuts as we move into 2025. This makes for a crucial time to keep an eye on the market as a home buyer or homeowner looking to purchase or refinance.

At this point, it's unclear what future rate cuts may look like, but Goldman Sachs analysts are forecasting another 25 basis point rate cut in both November and December."
What The Fed's Rate Cut Means For Bitcoin,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/davidbirnbaum/2024/09/18/what-the-feds-rate-cut-means-for-bitcoin/,2024-09-18T18:46:49Z,"The Federal Reserve cut interest rates by 50 basis points today (bps), bringing the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The aggressive rate cut, doubling the widely expected 25 bps reduction, signals deepening concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. For bitcoin, a unique asset often heralded as a hedge against central bank mismanagement, this decision introduces both opportunities and possible near-term risks.

The Fed's decision to cut by 50 bps represents more than just monetary policy adjustment - it's a clear acknowledgment that the economy is struggling more than policymakers have publicly let on. After a year of aggressive tightening aimed at taming inflation, this shift signals that the central bank is now in damage control mode. It reflects growing anxiety over potential recessionary forces, stagnating job growth, and the underlying structural weaknesses in the financial system.

Bitcoin has traditionally thrived on economic uncertainty, positioning itself as a hedge against inflation and fiat currency debasement. However, today's rate cut presents a more complex reality. While monetary easing typically weakens the dollar, strengthening bitcoin, the speed and size of this cut may indicate that the Fed is seeing something more ominous on the horizon - a possibility that could lead to increased volatility across all markets, including cryptocurrencies.

For bitcoin, the 50 bps cut sends mixed signals. Historically, rate cuts have been positive for hard assets like bitcoin, as such cuts are inflationary, leading to capital find its way into assets that can serve as stores of value. But this rate cut doesn't feel like a traditional monetary easing; rather, it's a borderline emergency response to growing economic instability. If the markets interpret this cut as a sign that the U.S. economy is in deeper trouble than anticipated, bitcoin could be caught in a risk-off selloff.

In recent weeks, bitcoin has struggled to hold onto the gains it made earlier in the summer. After reaching highs of $65,000 in August, its exchange rate with the dollar slipped under $59,000, reflecting broader market uncertainty and concerns about the Fed's next move. With today's 50 bps cut, bitcoin could face even more turbulence in the coming weeks as investors reassess the state of the economy.

Today's rate cut comes against a backdrop of growing macroeconomic instability. The U.S. labor market, which had been resilient in 2022, is showing signs of strain. Last week's jobs report revealed troubling data, with the U.S. economy creating fewer jobs than expected and a notable rise in unemployment to 7.1 million. This weakness, coupled with sluggish consumer spending and declining industrial output, paints a picture of an economy that may be slipping into a recession.

Globally, the picture is equally concerning. Europe remains mired in stagnation, with the Eurozone posting lackluster GDP growth of just 0.2% last quarter. In Japan, the central bank faces mounting inflationary pressures while attempting to unwind decades of ultra-loose monetary policy. Meanwhile, China's economy continues to falter, with a slowdown in factory output, consumption, and rising unemployment threatening its once-robust growth engine.

The Fed's 50 bps cut, therefore, isn't just about managing U.S. economic risks; it's about responding to a global slowdown that could have far-reaching implications for all asset markets. For bitcoin, this means navigating a highly volatile environment where macroeconomic forces exert influence on price movements that is difficult to predict.

Despite the short-term volatility that this aggressive rate cut may introduce, the long-term case for bitcoin remains strong. As central banks around the world grapple with economic weakness, their collective response is to increase the supply of money. Whether through rate cuts, quantitative easing, or other forms of liquidity injections, the financial system is increasingly reliant on monetary expansion to maintain even modest growth. In such an environment, bitcoin will continue to be valued as a global financial network independent of any single jurisdiction or central bank policy.

In the long run, this wave of monetary easing will likely reinforce bitcoin's appeal to those seeking refuge from fiat debasement. However, in the short term, the price of bitcoin may be subject to increased volatility, particularly as the market digests the implications of today's 50 bps cut.

The Federal Reserve's decision to cut interest rates by 50 basis points marks a significant moment in the ongoing saga of global economic instability. For bitcoin, this could mean a turbulent few months ahead as markets react to the potential for a deeper economic downturn. However, as central banks resort to repeated monetary intervention, bitcoin's fundamentals continue to strengthen.

In a world where fiat-based economies face ever-growing pressure from mismanagement and politicization, bitcoin continues to offer a compelling alternative. Investors may face volatility in the near term, but those with conviction in bitcoin's role as a decentralized, sound money system will see today's rate cut as another step toward validating its long-term value."
GDP By State: States With The Biggest 5-Year Growth In 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andrewdepietro/2024/09/18/gdp-by-state-states-with-the-biggest-5-year-growth-in-2024/,2024-09-18T18:46:29Z,"The stock market has been beating back worries about an imminent recession. The Fed still has rate cuts up its sleeve. On the ground, unemployment is still at historic lows. In most but not all sectors, businesses are doing quite well. And, whether for better or worse, home values and prices continue to climb.

In order to discern the strength of state economies, economic data was analyzed, sourced from the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) on real GDP in chained 2017 dollars, used to provide a true picture of economic growth as opposed to using nominal GDP figures, which don't account for inflation. Read on to find out the strength of the economy in terms of states by GDP and see which are the fastest growing states in terms of GDP growth over the years.

Examining the change in quarterly real GDP by state, the state that has the experienced the most significant five-year growth is Idaho. From the first quarter of 2019 to the first quarter of 2024, Idaho's real GDP grew by 23.3%, from $79.57 billion to $98.12 billion, respectively (in chained 2017 dollars).

But that's looking at quarter-to-quarter over five years. What about annual real GDP growth from, say, 2018 to 2023 (since 2024 isn't over, there's no annual GDP). By this standard, Idaho is still No. 1, growing 22.2% to No. 2 Florida's 21.8%, and No. 3 Utah's 20.4%. Idaho's real GDP grew from $77.65 billion in 2018 to $94.91 billion in 2023. 2023, from $1.08 trillion to $1.28 trillion. And this is in chained 2017 dollars, which means it accounts for inflation. Regular GDP growth, unadjusted, was 40.5%, from $84.55 billion in 2019 to $118.79 trillion in 2023.

Below is a table of states by GDP ranked by greatest five-year growth, from Q1 2019 to Q1 2024:

The percent change in real GDP from fourth quarter 2023 to first quarter 2024, Idaho's grew by 5%, which is the highest quarter-over-quarter rate out of all 50 states. What's most revealing though is that the biggest contributing industry to this 5% growth was real estate and rental and leasing; this industry contributed 0.97 percentage points to that 5%. Initially, much of Idaho's explosive real estate markets was due to the pandemic-induced remote work policies, with many flocking to the state for relocation. Yet, this boom is still going.

Florida's 22.8% real GDP growth from Q1 2019 to Q1 2024 is second to only Idaho. Florida is also second to Idaho only in terms of its annual GDP growth over the last five years, 21.8%. Like Idaho, real estate and rental and leasing was the biggest contributing industry, responsible for 0.49 percentage points of Florida's 3% growth from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024.

Arizona too has put up fantastic numbers. In in terms of real GDP, Arizona's grew from $366.27 billion in Q1 2019 to $423.94 billion by Q1 2024. That's growth of 20.2% over five years. In terms of annual real GDP, the five-year growth of 19.6%. Not coincidentally, it is once again the real estate industry that's responsible for the greatest growth, contributing 0.76 percentage points to 3.2% of growth from Q4 2023 to Q1 2024. The retail trade industry contributed 0.61 percentage points.

"The Fed Just Cut Interest Rates, And More Rate Cuts Are Coming",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/09/18/the-fed-just-cut-interest-rates-and-more-rate-cuts-are-coming/,2024-09-18T18:36:08Z,"The Federal Reserve announced an interest rate policy decision to cut interest rates by 0.5% on September 18. This decision was accompanied by FOMC member forecasts, which reflect expectations of additional Fed interest rate cuts through the end of 2026.

The Federal Reserve cut the federal funds rate today by 0.5%, targeting a range between 4.75% and 5%. An interest rate cut was largely expected across markets, as seen in the CME FedWatch Tool. However, market expectations were divided between a 0.25% and a 0.5% rate cut.

A rate cut of 0.5% is bigger than many market participants had expected, and it is likely to be the beginning of a trend in additional monetary policy accommodation as the Fed cuts interest rates further in the years ahead.

The Fed has a dual mandate to foster full employment and keep prices low and stable. Given the relatively solid labor market but elevated consumer inflation, future interest rate cuts are coming, although the Fed still has the license to cut interest rates slowly.

Investors, economists, and business leaders anticipated an interest rate cut on September 18. They were also eagerly awaiting the quarterly forecasts of the Federal Open Market Committee, especially the FOMC member median forecasts of future interest rates.

Accompanying the September 18 Fed decision, FOMC forecasts were released in a table with interest rates, GDP growth, PCE inflation, and the unemployment rate. The forecasted interest rates also appeared in a graphic depiction that economists and investors refer to as the dot plot, which shows anonymized individual FOMC member forecasts of future interest rates.

As Prestige Economics expected, the dot plot of median FOMC member forecasts conveyed that Fed members expect to enact additional rate cuts in 2024 and 2025.

The last set of FOMC forecasts was released in June 2024. The FOMC median forecast of interest rates was 5.1% for the end of 2024, 4.1% for the end of 2025, and 3.1% for the end of 2026.

The updated September FOMC median forecast of interest rates was lowered to 4.4% for the end of 2024, lowered to 3.4% for the end of 2025, and lowered to 2.9% for the end of 2026.

Fed member forecasts of future real GDP growth remain relatively positive and inflation is expected to improve more than previously forecast. Unemployment is expected to be weaker than previously forecast.

The median FOMC forecast for Q4 2024 unemployment rate was raised to 4.4% from 4%. Meanwhile, the median year-on-year real GDP forecast for Q4 2024 was lowered slightly to 2% from 2.1%.

On the upside, the median FOMC forecast for Q4 2024 and Q4 2025 year-on-year PCE and Core PCE inflation improved, although they are expected to remain above the Fed's 2% target in both Q4 2024 and Q4 2025.

The September Fed rate cut was bigger than some investors had expected, even though the CME FedWatch Tool had reflected the 65% chance of a 0.5% rate cut as of 9:30 a.m. ET on September 18.

A larger-than-expected interest rate cut often presents upside risks to equity and bond prices while weighing on the dollar. Plus, the September interest rate cut is expected by the FOMC to be one of many cuts, which is also supportive of equity and bond prices and bearish for the greenback. This is especially true, given the FOMC forecasts of more interest rate cuts than previously

As always, this isn't the end of the Fed's story today, and a great deal of attention will be paid to Fed Chair Jerome Powell's remarks in his 2:30 p.m. ET press conference on September 18, especially about the timing of future additional Fed interest rate cuts.

What do you think of the September 2024 Fed policy decision and FOMC member forecasts?"
The Federal Reserve starts cutting interesting rates in a big moment for the economy,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/18/nx-s1-5115909/federal-reserve-interest-rate-cut-inflation,2024-09-18T18:10:56Z,"The Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates Wednesday, signaling a turning point in the long-running battle against inflation. Win McNamee/Getty Images North America hide caption

The Federal Reserve moved aggressively Wednesday to start cutting interest rates as easing inflation fears give way to growing concern about the job market.

The central bank lowered its benchmark interest rate by half a percentage point, which will make it cheaper to get a car loan, finance a business or carry a balance on your credit card.

Wednesday's rate cut is the Fed's first since 2020, but it won't be the last. On average, members of the Fed's rate-setting committee expect borrowing costs to drop by another half-percentage point this year, and an additional full point next year. That's a more rapid decline than committee members were projecting just three months ago.

The shift to lowering interest rates marks a major turning point in the Fed's two-and-a-half year battle to curb inflation. The central bank began raising rates in March 2022 in an effort to tamp down demand and bring prices under control. By last summer, interest rates had climbed to between 5.25 and 5.5%, their highest level in more than two decades.

The rate cut on Wednesday comes as the annual inflation rate has fallen sharply, to 2.5% last month, from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022.

At the same time, job growth has slowed and the unemployment rate has inched up to 4.2%, leaving Fed officials worried that high interest rates could become an unnecessary drag on the economy.

""The upside risks to inflation have diminished. And the downside risks to employment have increased,"" Fed chairman Jerome Powell said last month, during a speech in Jackson Hole, Wyo. ""The time has come for policy to adjust.""

The pace of future rate cuts is still uncertain, however. One member of the committee, Michelle Bowman, wanted to proceed more cautiously on Wednesday, cutting the benchmark rate by just a quarter percentage point. Committee members are divided on how much further rates will need to fall next year.

While falling interest rates will help borrowers and potentially spur economic growth, they come with a cost for savers. The interest paid for online savings accounts and money market funds will likely decline.

The timing of the Fed's move is politically sensitive, coming less than seven weeks before a presidential election in which the strength of the economy is a key issue for voters. Powell has said repeatedly that he and his colleagues try to do what's best for the economy and are not swayed by partisan politics."
"No, Welfare Isn't 'What's Eating The Budget' - This Is",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/benritz/2024/09/18/no-welfare-isnt-whats-eating-the-budget--this-is/,2024-09-18T15:19:34Z,"A column in the Wall Street Journal last week by House Budget Committee Chairman Jodey Arrington (R-Texas) and former Senator Phil Gramm (R-Texas), titled ""Welfare is What's Eating the Budget,"" argued that ""means-tested programs, not Medicare and Social Security, are behind today's massive debt.""

And it's profoundly wrong.

To make their argument, Arrington and Gramm rely upon a measure called ""unobligated general revenue,"" which they define as ""total revenue net of Medicare and Social Security payroll taxes and premiums and mandatory interest on the public debt."" They argue that means-tested ""welfare"" programs - those that provide benefits only to people below a certain income threshold - claim a higher share of this revenue than Medicare and Social Security, making them the bigger fiscal challenge facing the federal government.

The first problem with the Arrington-Gramm analysis is that it compares total spending on means-tested programs to only a fraction of Medicare and Social Security spending. Medicare and Social Security were ostensibly designed to be ""earned benefits"" financed primarily by payroll taxes on workers' wages and contributions from beneficiaries, although those dedicated revenue sources now only raise $3 for every $4 spent by the programs. Means-tested welfare programs, on the other hand, were designed from the start to be financed primarily by progressive income taxes. That income taxes are considered general revenue while payroll taxes aren't is a political distinction, not a mathematical one. And the math is clear: in 2024, Medicare and Social Security together will cost taxpayers nearly 70% more than all means-tested programs combined.

But even if the share of each program financed with general revenue were the appropriate metric of comparison, it still wouldn't support the assertion that welfare is a bigger contributor to today's budget deficits than Medicare and Social Security.

The chart below shows the change in total spending on means-tested programs and general revenue used to cover the gap between dedicated revenue and spending on Medicare and Social Security benefits each year since 2001 - the last year in which the federal budget was balanced. In almost every year, the increase in annual welfare spending relative to 2001 levels was less than or equal to 1% of gross domestic product (GDP). The only exceptions were the years following the 2008 financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic, both of which were times in which unemployment sharply increased and so more people fell into the social safety net. By comparison, the same measurement for general revenue used to pay for Medicare and Social Security was roughly twice that amount in every one of the last 15 years.

The picture gets even clearer when looking at what's expected to occur over the next 15 years. As our country's population ages and health-care costs continue to rise, the general revenue transfers needed to support Medicare and Social Security on their current spending path will roughly double. Meanwhile, spending on welfare programs will be almost perfectly flat, as increases in Medicaid costs are canceled out by shrinking spending on other programs that support low-income households. In 20 years, annual general-revenue support for Medicare and Social Security will exceed total projected spending on means-tested welfare programs.

Yet the most egregious misdirection in the Arrington-Gramm column comes not from how they measure spending, but their decision to present it as a percent of ""unobligated general revenue."" Even if spending is flat, this metric can create the appearance of an increase if revenue falls. And in the years since the budget was balanced, Republicans in Washington have passed a series of tax cuts - many of which benefited the wealthiest Americans - that reduced annual revenue by more than 2% of GDP. The federal government also had to take out additional debt to finance these tax cuts, on which it is now paying more interest, further reducing the amount of general revenue considered ""unobligated.""

In other words, Arrington and Gramm have based their primary argument on a metric that allows them to blame spending on the poor for deficits actually caused by tax cuts for the rich.

Former Senator Alan Simpson, the Republican co-chair of the bipartisan National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility in Reform in 2010, often liked to say: ""If you torture the statistics long enough, eventually they'll confess."" The degree to which Arrington and Gramm tortured statistics in their column may well violate the Geneva Convention.

Any fair interpretation of the data makes it abundantly clear that welfare spending for low-income Americans isn't ""eating the budget"" - retirement spending and tax cuts are."
"Raising Corporate Tax Rate To Expand Child Tax Credit Would Hurt Economy, Says New Study",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammillsap/2024/09/18/raising-corporate-tax-rate-to-expand-child-tax-credit-would-hurt-economy-says-new-study/,2024-09-18T14:07:37Z,"Many provisions of the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) expire at the end of 2025, including the individual income tax cuts and the doubling of the standard deduction. This looming expiration means the next President and the 119 Congress will have to pass a new law to prevent tax increases on the middle class at a time when families are still struggling with inflation. Some have suggested a larger child tax credit (CTC) be included in any new law, but a new study finds that raising the corporate tax rate to pay for a bigger CTC would reduce economic growth, wages, and employment.

Prior to the TCJA, the maximum CTC was $1,000 per child under 16 and it phased out after $75,000 for a single earner or $110,000 for a married couple filing jointly. The TCJA expanded the CTC to $2,000 per child and increased the phase outs to $200,000 for a single earner and $400,000 for a married couple, along with some other small changes.

Many Democrats did not think the changes in the TCJA went far enough, so an even larger CTC was included in the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) passed in 2021 on partisan lines with all Republicans opposing. The ARPA temporarily increased the CTC to $3,600 per child aged zero to five and $3,000 for each child aged six to 17. Vice President Kamala Harris has supported this larger CTC and will likely advocate for it during any negotiations next year if she wins in November. Some Republicans in Congress have also signaled support for a larger CTC.

One possible way to pay for a larger CTC is to raise the corporate tax rate. The TCJA permanently reduced the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21% and studies show this change increased investment and wages. It follows that reversing this tax cut to pay for a larger CTC would undo at least some of these economic benefits, and that is precisely what a new study from the American Action Forum (AAF) finds. The study estimates that the corporate tax rate would have to increase by 10 percentage points to 31% to fully pay for the permanent, expanded CTC. This tax increase would reduce GDP, after-tax wages, investment, and jobs, as shown in the table below.

The AAF study is consistent with other studies that show that increases in corporate tax rates reduce wages, investment, and employment. Given these harmful economic effects, lawmakers should think twice about raising the corporate tax rate to pay for the CTC or any other government program.

To the extent a bigger child tax credit is needed, there are dozens of ineffective federal programs that could be reformed or cut to pay for a child tax credit. The Government Accountability Office recently identified $236 billion in improper government payments last year alone, which is more than enough to pay for a larger CTC.

There are better ways for policymakers to help families that do not involve raising taxes. A strong economy that provides plentiful job opportunities is the best way to strengthen families and reduce poverty. The federal government can eliminate unnecessary red tape and reform rules like the National Environmental Policy Act to make it easier for us to build things like housing, roads, mines, and power plants. Construction creates good-paying jobs, especially for people without four-year college degrees, and children from families with at least one consistently working parent do better than those from families where the parents experience long periods of joblessness.

State policymakers also have a role to play in creating a strong economy. Like federal regulation, state regulation can slow the economy and hurt the labor market. Structural reforms such as the one recently passed in Kansas that requires legislative approval for high-cost administrative rules give elected lawmakers more control over regulations. Ultimately, this can lead to better, less burdensome regulation by increasing transparency and accountability.

Raising the corporate tax rate is not a good way to help children or families. Though it may seem harmless, studies consistently show that higher corporate tax rates reduce wages and employment, and AAF's new study shows these costs offset any benefit that may come from a larger CTC. Strong economic growth is the best way to help families, and lawmakers should remember this when tax negotiations start."
"Chime Executive Janelle Sallenave Talks Disrupting The Financial Sector, Recent Survey, More In Interview",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevenaquino/2024/09/18/chime-executive-janelle-sallenave-talks-disrupting-the-financial-sector-recent-survey-more-in-interview/,2024-09-18T13:10:30Z,"Popular fintech company Chime announced on Wednesday the findings of a survey it commissioned called Forced To Miss Out. There are key findings aplenty, with the highest-level takeaways being 43% of working Americans were forced to miss out on things due to financial restraints. Working parents are most likely to miss out, as are younger folks such as Gen Z. Traditional pay cycles are ""messing"" with time spent with family and friends, as well as participating in social activities and necessities.

According to Chime's Janelle Sallenave, with the company since 2020 and now its first-ever Chief Spending Officer, Chime's ""deep understanding"" of the spending habits and behaviors of everyday consumers proved instrumental in doing the survey. The company's goal, she said, is to share its wealth of knowledge with people in an effort to help them ""understand trends and opportunities that can better help them unlock financial progress in their lives."" Sallenave added traditional pay scales are incongruent with the realities of modern life, telling me the company's report shines a spotlight on how waiting for one's paycheck leads them to miss out on valuable experiences such as bonding time with loved ones. Chime's report found more than 70% of Americans must wait at least two weeks to get paid, with Sallenave lamenting how if people don't live two weeks at a time, it makes zero sense whatsoever to be paid that way. In order to remedy this and help people ""better handle whatever life throws their way,"" Sallenave said Chime launched MyPay. It's a program, she said, that enables members to receive up to $500 of their pay between pay periods -- all with the conventional strings like fees, interest, and credit check being unattached. The conceit is simple: with a Benjamin more in one's bank account, maybe those funds go towards a baby shower or something.

People know the FOMO acronym -- the fear of missing out -- but Sallenave said Chime coined the aforementioned FTMO after coming to the realization that the outdated modalities of getting paid has profound impact on the lives of many, MyPay is a manifestation of those learnings, because Sallenave said Chime was confronted with the monetary ""challenges"" faced by so many everyday people in this country.

""The shift from FOMO to FTMO can carry an emotional toll, leaving consumers feeling disconnected socially and forcing them to pick and choose activities or purchases,"" Sallenave said of the struggle to survive. ""For example, 43% of working Americans report they have had to miss out on at least one event with family or friends, a product purchase, or service/repair due to waiting for a paycheck in the past six months, with 63% anticipating facing similar challenges over the next six months.""

At a high level, he #1 most loved banking app told me Chime, which she said is ""the #1 most loved banking app"" with over a million 5-star reviews, was created in order to help the over 60% of Americans, or almost 150 million people, living paycheck-to-paycheck live easier. Most of the biggest financial insitutiitions don't treat these people well, with Sallenave saying Chime operates under a ""new approach"" not predicated on legacy ideas such as exorbitant fees. This model, she added, is disruptive to the traditional model because big banks make big money on those extra charges. It's this member-first mindset that sets Chime apart in the industry. According to Sallenave, the company designs its products based on direct feedback; this ensures the services Chime provides really do help the Average Jane or Joe live more comfortably.

I've covered the intersection of disability, finance, and technology before. Without rehashing too many prior points, disabled people are amongst the poorest populations -- namely because so many in the community receive social services like governmental services, which have rigid financial regulations on eligibility. What's more, disabled people have the highest rate of unemployment largely due to (a) companies' unwillingness to hire them; and (b) a commensurate unwillingness to accommodate their needs accordingly. Where society has built a support system based on dependency, most disabled people crave autonomy. They want the agency to live life on their terms, which obviously includes financially. Thus, it isn't hard to see how a product like Chime may appeal. Free of fees and other kinds of fiduciary fluff, a disabled person could well see Chime as a plausible means of living a fuller, more independent life. Chime's mission is to ""unite everyday people to unlock their financial progress."" Lots of people cope with a disability, multitudes even -- so the inclusivity angle aligns with Chime's mission.

""Whether it's building a stronger credit score, taking more control over your pay or more transparent and easy products to manage your money,"" Sallenave said. ""Chime is helping more than 7 million members.

Sallenave reiterated a few highlights (or lowlights, if you prefer) of Chime's report. To wit, she emphasized 58% of people missed out because their pay cycle ""didn't align with the timing of planned events"" such as family gatherings and other noteworthy events. Likewise, 40% reported missing birthdays while 21% missed out on non-emergency expenses such as veterinarian bills and various types of repairs.

When asked about feedback from customers, Sallenave pointed to a slew of testimonials -- all of whom praise Chime for its ease of use, general friendliness, and more. One person, named Kristofer C, lauded Chime for helping them open a bank account when he couldn't at a traditional bank. After opening their account with Chime, said they ""no longer desired a traditional account"" and lauded the company for giving them ""immeasurable"" joy and peace of mind. Both poignant sentiments.

As to the future, Sallenave expressed her excitement for ""all the ways Chime can continue to help our members unlock financial progress in their lives and really continue to change the industry for the better."" She also pledged the company's steadfast commitment to continue to listen to its customers, telling me taking the time to be active listeners, as well as investing in data and research like its FTMO report, ""will help make sure we really understand some of their challenges and opportunities."""
Fed Rate Cuts Are Set To Begin,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/09/18/fed-rate-cuts-are-set-to-begin/,2024-09-18T13:10:25Z,"Investors, economists, and executives eagerly await a cut in the federal funds rate today. The size of the Federal Reserve's September rate cut today is up in the air. However, cuts are set to begin, which could provide a much-needed boost to interest-rate-sensitive industries, the labor market, and growth.

The Federal Reserve is likely to cut the federal funds rate today. However, while an interest rate cut is expected, market expectations are divided about the chance of a 0.25% or a 0.5% rate cut.

As of September 18 at 8:29 a.m. ET, the CME FedWatch tool reflected the odds of a 0.5% rate cut at 45%, with the odds of a 0.25% rate cut at a higher 55%. These odds have changed greatly in the past week. In fact, the odds of a 0.5% rate cut was only 14% on September 11.

The Fed has a dual mandate to foster full employment and keep prices low and stable.

The labor market is solid, with a low unemployment rate of only 4.2% in August and almost 7.7 million open jobs in July. Jobless claims also remain relatively low.

However, inflation remains elevated, with year-on-year Total CPI up 2.5% and Core CPI up 3.2% in August. The latest PCE inflation data is for July when the U.S. PCE was up 2.5%, and Core PCE was up 2.6%. All of these key year-on-year consumer inflation rates are above the Fed's 2% target.

Since inflation is elevated, this is likely to keep the Fed from raising rates very quickly or significantly.

While financial market participants will be watching the Fed's interest rate decision closely, they will also be paying close attention to the forecasts of the Federal Open Market Committee -- or FOMC. Most important will be the FOMC member median forecasts of future interest rates.

A table of all the FOMC forecasts will be released today at 2 p.m. ET, including interest rates, GDP growth, PCE inflation, and the unemployment rate. The forecasted interest rates also appear in a graphic depiction that economists and analysts refer to as the dotplot, which shows anonymized individual FOMC member forecasts of future interest rates.

Prestige Economics expects the dotplot of Median FOMC member forecasts are likely to convey that the Fed members expect to enact additional rate cuts in 2024 and 2025. Any change from the June 2024 dotplot will be critical for financial markets.

The last set of FOMC forecasts from June 2024 reflected that the FOMC median forecast of interest rates for the end of 2024 was 5.1%, for the end of 2025 was 4.1% in June, and for the end of 2026 was 3.1%. Fed member forecasts of jobs and GDP growth were still generally positive in June.

If the median end-of-year expectations for interest rates fall in the September FOMC forecasts, this would likely weigh on the dollar and bond yields, while also being supportive of equity, industrial commodity, and bond prices.

Following the FOMC statement and forecasts, a great deal of attention will be paid to Fed Chair Powell's remarks in his press conference, especially the timing of future additional Fed interest rate cuts. He is likely to reiterate the notion that Fed policy is not on a set course and that the FOMC will be data-dependent in their decision-making.

What do you expect from the Fed's policy decision and FOMC member forecasts today?"
U.S. Bank Wealth Management BrandVoice: Is A Market Correction Coming?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/us-bank-wealth-management/2024/09/18/is-a-market-correction-coming/,2024-09-18T12:43:52Z,"Drawdowns of 5% to10% or more in a given year are not unusual, even in the context of a generally positive market environment.

Bull market momentum extending back to October 2022 was interrupted in early August. Investor sentiment shifted, reflecting concerns about the strength of the U.S. economy. These concerns stemmed from a jobs market report, issued on August 2, showing relatively modest job gains in July along with an uptick in the nation's unemployment rate.1 It raised concerns that the economy may face increasing headwinds, and that the Federal Reserve (Fed) may have been too slow to initiate long-promised interest rate cuts, which are expected to bolster the economy. Stock markets experienced precipitous declines on consecutive trading days (August 2 and August 5).

""Despite the negative market action, we don't believe that there's a reason for equity investors to exercise significant caution,"" says Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""We still think it's a great time to be invested and for those with money in cash, it represents an opportunity to put capital to work in longer-term assets.""

Based on the definition of a market correction representing a 10% or greater decline in value, the technology-heavy NASDAQ Composite Index experienced a correction. At the end of August 5th's trading day, it was down 13% from its July 10, 2024, high. The S&P 500 neared correction territory, dropping 8.5% from its July 16 peak.2 Investors may now be asking whether the recent setback for the market is a temporary blip in what has been a year of solid equity performance, or if it is a signal of what could represent serious economic challenges that might have more significant market ramifications.

Markets may prove resilient

The market's sudden decline is not out of the ordinary. ""It's important for investors to remember that drawdowns of 5% to 10% or more in a given year are not unusual, even in the context of a generally positive market environment,"" says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.

""The early August correction appears to be more of a reflection of challenges in the financial economy rather than in the real economy."" Haworth says some traders who used borrowed funds to purchase equity positions had to quickly sell off some of their stock holdings to meet obligations of their borrowing arrangements. In addition, a surprise interest rate hike by Japan's central bank resulted in the Japanese yen appreciating in value, resulting in suddenly higher borrowing costs that put pressure on leveraged investors. ""That represents some of the financial stress we've seen in the system,"" says Haworth. ""Today's circumstances do not represent an economic crisis, or a repeat of the market crash environment of 1987.""

Markets are closely attuned to the Fed's actions. Between March 2022 and July 2023, the Fed bumped the federal funds target rate it controls from near 0% to a peak of 5.50%. After the policymaking Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) met in July, Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated the likelihood that the Fed would cut rates at its September meeting.3 Two days later, the jobs report triggered market questions surrounding whether or not the Fed should lower interest rates more quickly.

""This gets back to the state of the real economy. It's not as strong as it was, but it doesn't show signs yet of breaking down,"" says Haworth. ""Corporate earnings remain strong, the unemployment rate is up, but mainly because more people are entering the labor force. Most fundamental signs remain positive.""

A broad-based decline

Investors have been waiting for the market's gains, concentrated to this point on large-cap stocks, to extend to mid-cap and small-cap issues. In July, small stocks outperformed, with the Russell 2000 Small-Cap Index gaining 10.16%, compared to 1.22% for the large-cap S&P 500.4 ""Prospects of Fed rate cuts resulted in a short-term pivot into smaller stocks,"" says Haworth. But the rotation to smaller-cap stocks was sidetracked in early August.

The August turnaround took a toll on stocks regardless of market capitalization. In just the first three trading days of the month, both the large-cap S&P 500 and the Russell Mid-Cap Index were down close to 6%. The small-cap Russell 2000 lost 9.5%.4 In July, markets were enthusiastic about the potential that pending Fed rate cuts could ease the burden of borrowing costs, which fall disproportionately on smaller companies than on large-cap stocks. ""But now markets became concerned that the Fed's delays might have negative economic ramifications, which could affect forward earnings for small cap stocks,"" says Haworth. August's significant equity market setback tempered year-to-date returns among the three primary market capitalization performance measures.

A modest rotation begins

Throughout 2023 and up to June 30, 2024, technology stocks drove S&P 500 performance. Since the end of June, the technology and communication services sectors lagged the rest of the S&P 500. While most of the 11 S&P 500 sectors experienced negative performance since June 30, utilities, consumer staples and real estate stocks gained ground during this period.

Notably, based on year-to-date through August 5, utilities stocks overtook information technology, and only slightly trailed communications services stocks.

Key stock market drivers for the remainder of the year

What are the keys to a sustained bull market? The primary considerations that deserve attention include:

External risks must also be considered. Current issues include the impact of global tensions highlighted by the Israel-Hamas conflict and the Russia-Ukraine war. The heated lead-up to what appears likely to be a contentious presidential election may ultimately draw more investor attention.

Equities still offer opportunity

While the forward view for diversified portfolios remains constructive, recent market events may offer an opportunity to reassess your financial assets relative to goals. You want to ensure that your portfolio is aligned with your long-term objectives.

Haworth says investors may wish to consider diversifying with an equal-weighted S&P 500 exchange-traded fund. Such a fund puts less emphasis on the largest stocks in the Index compared to a traditional S&P 500 fund, seeking to capitalize on opportunities in what have been underperforming stocks in the index.

Haworth adds that ""for those with money on the sidelines waiting for a bell to ring to get back into the market, the bell has rung."" He suggests investors ""consider putting a portion of your portfolio to work in equities in a systematic way, such as dollar-cost averaging available cash over a series of months.""

Freedman encourages investors to view markets with a long-term lens. ""Timing the markets and trying to be precise on when to be in and when to be out is challenging,"" says Freedman. ""Markets will do things at the exact opposite time you expect them to.""

This is an important time to check in with a wealth planning professional to make sure you're comfortable with your current investments and that your portfolio is structured in a manner consistent with your time horizon, risk appetite and long-term financial goals.

The S&P 500 Index consists of 500 widely traded stocks that are considered to represent the performance of the U.S. stock market in general. Diversification and asset allocation do not guarantee returns or protect against losses. The Russell MidCap Index provides investors with a benchmark for mid-sized companies. The index, which is distinct from the large-cap S&P 500, is designed to measure the performance of mid-sized companies, reflecting the distinctive risk and return characteristics of this market segment. The Russell 2000 Index refers to a stock market index that measures the performance of the 2,000 smaller companies included in the Russell 3000 Index.

U.S. Bank Wealth Management BrandVoice: How To Invest In Today's Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/us-bank-wealth-management/2024/09/18/how-to-invest-in-todays-market/,2024-09-18T12:43:38Z,"Bond markets have struggled, as interest rates trend higher this year.

While the U.S. stock market set new record highs - led by a narrow band of large-cap stocks - in the first half of the year, many other S&P 500 sectors haven't kept pace. And bond markets continue to face challenges as long-term interest rates linger higher for longer.

Where today's market stands

S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite indexes continue to extend their respective bull market rallies, which date back to October 2022. As was the case last year, equities are led by tech stocks in 2024.

Stock market's year-to-date performance

So far in 2024, stock results have been widely divergent. Through June 30, 2024, the S&P 500 generated a total return of 15.29%. Meanwhile, the Russell MidCap Index gained a more modest 4.96%, and the small-cap Russell 2000 Index rose just 1.73%. International stocks also lagged the U.S. market.

Bond market's year-to-date performance

After a period dating back to 2022 when interest rates moved up dramatically, the bond environment has recently demonstrated more stability. Federal Reserve (Fed) monetary policy is the main bond market driver. While investors anticipated the Fed would begin cutting interest rates earlier in 2024, the Fed has, to this point, held the line on the federal funds target rate it controls. Even though the Fed succeeded in its goal of lowering inflation from peak levels reached in mid-2022 (over 9%), the Fed has indicated that it remains concerned that inflation remains above 3%. Market reactions to Fed interest rate inaction moved yields on the benchmark 10-year Treasury note up and down over the course of the year's first half.

U.S. economy still growing

The underlying economic environment remains positive, although growth as measured by Gross Domestic Product (GDP) slowed in 2024's first quarter. GDP grew by an annualized rate of 1.4% over the first three months, down from 2023's 2.5% growth rate.2 ""1.4% is not a stellar rate of growth, but it's still positive,"" says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""As we look forward from here, most of the data points to a still-expanding economy."" The economic environment proved beneficial for equity markets, while inflation's persistence created some challenges for bonds.

""The economy today can best be described as resilient,"" says Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. Freedman attributes the economy's ongoing expansion to persistent consumer activity. ""Consumers have been spending more than most thought they would, and that has boosted corporate profits."" Freedman also notes the strength of business capital expenditure spending as a contributor to ongoing economic growth.

""The economy today can best be described as resilient,"" says Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Wealth Management. ""Consumers have been spending more than most thought they would, and that has boosted corporate profits.""

""The economy's held up reasonably well to this point because of the strong labor market (unemployment at 4%), and consumers' fairly strong financial position,"" says Freedman. ""Our U.S. Bank economics teams believes these factors continue to help us avoid a recession in the near term.""

Still, with interest rates elevated, consumers and businesses face higher borrowing costs. That could slow economic activity as consumers reassess potential big-ticket purchases or businesses re-think capital expenditures. Yet consumers remain engaged. ""The strong labor market and solid wage gains have given consumers the wherewithal to maintain enough spending activity to keep the economy on track,"" says Haworth.

What's driving the markets

As was the case in 2023, much of the market's strong 2024 performance can be attributed to technology-oriented stocks. Earlier in the year, leadership broadened out to other sectors, but in May and June, investors were increasingly focused on companies positioned to benefit from recent and projected advances in artificial intelligence (AI). ""Below the surface of the headline numbers, there's a fair amount of turmoil in equity markets today,"" says Haworth. ""To this point, most of the upside movement is about AI and the earnings growth it provides.""

In the fixed income market, Haworth says opportunities are more limited. ""With the Fed holding the line on interest rates, bonds, especially among investment grade categories, had a negative start to the year,"" says Haworth. ""Fixed income investors may want to consider other options outside of traditional Treasury and investment-grade corporate bonds.""

What to invest in right now

Haworth says given the degree of uncertainty in the market, some may want to consider dollar-cost averaging as a way to effectively invest in equities. ""By making regular investments over a period of time, you aren't anchored to an investment at a single price; you stretch your investment out at different price points over time,"" says Haworth. ""It also gets you going on an investment plan so you can start growing your wealth now.""

Assets that are set aside to meet funding needs in the next 18 months should capitalize on today's elevated interest rate environment by utilizing higher-yielding savings accounts, CDs and money market mutual funds.

""Be prepared to take what the capital markets offer given the current environment's realities,"" says Freedman. He advises that long-term investors consider positioning their portfolios with an above-neutral mix of equities and real assets (such as commodities), while reducing weightings in fixed income investments. Freedman adds, ""It's critical to have a financial plan that's tied to the specific goals you hope to achieve."" With a plan in place, you can more readily identify investment strategies that align with your goals.

Based on your situation and goals, other portfolio strategies that can play a potentially contributory role in your portfolio include:

Discuss options with your wealth management professional and be sure to understand the risks associated with each of these investments. Determine whether any can help you more effectively diversify your portfolio.

Freedman adds it's important to regularly review your plan with your wealth management professional. Determine whether there are opportunities to rebalance your portfolio in ways that more appropriately reflect your investment objectives, time horizon, risk appetite and the current market environment.

German Stock Market Thrives Despite Economic Struggles,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/garthfriesen/2024/09/18/german-stock-market-thrives-despite-economic-struggles/,2024-09-18T12:13:17Z,"Not long ago, the German economy was the envy of Europe. It had low unemployment, sound fiscal policies and exported luxury cars and value-added industrial goods to a growing global economy. Germany was a poster child for the benefits of globalization. However, recent years have not been so kind.

There is virtually no economic growth, business bankruptcies are soaring, and the once-competitive German industrial giants are fighting for survival. Given the dim outlook, one might find it odd to see the DAX index make new all-time highs. How can the stock market be so strong when the economy is so weak?

The DAX, the German blue-chip stock market index that tracks the performance of the 40 largest companies trading on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange, is up 11.8%, significantly higher than the 7.5% return for the European-wide SX5E index.

The strong stock market performance has come despite lackluster GDP growth. The German economy shrank 0.1% in 2023, and growth is expected to be close to 0% in 2024 and will likely accelerate to just 0.8% in 2025.

Industrial production is 10% below pre-pandemic levels, and the latest release of German composite PMI decreased further to 48.4. Manufacturing PMI was an abysmal 42.4, levels only reached during the Global Financial Crisis or the COVID Crisis.

There are two main culprits behind the decline. The first is the shock attributed to the spike in energy costs following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The German industrial machine was highly dependent on cheap gas imported from Russia, and skyrocketing gas prices caused a 20% decline in energy-intensive industries, according to the IMF, and shaved 1.25% off of potential output.

The second blow to Germany's industrial complex came from China. China's economic contraction has paused Chinese consumers' once-insatiable demand for luxury cars from companies like BMW, Porsche, and Mercedes Benz. BMW's sales in China fell by 3.8%, Mercedes-Benz by 12%, and Porsche by 24% in the first quarter of 2024. These companies face intense competition from local Chinese manufacturers offering lower-cost electric vehicles.

China's pivot away from real estate toward exports of value-added industrial goods is also pressuring German companies. Heavy subsidized Chinese EVs are flooding the European market, hurting the German automotive industry, which accounts for 17% of aggregate exports.

The German economy is no longer a European pillar of strength, but the strength of the widely followed DAX would indicate otherwise.However, the DAX is unique.

Similar to the situation in U.S. markets, where a handful of technology stocks have been responsible for the majority of the overall gain in the S&P 500, the performance of the DAX can be attributed to a small subset of the 40 companies that comprise the index.

While automakers have seen share prices collapse between 30% and 73% from their highs, technology-focused companies such as SAP have benefited from the AI boom and have experienced massive growth in revenues and earnings. Shares of SAP, which has just under a 13% weight in the DAX, have risen 44% year-to-date.

Other large-cap companies are contributing to the performance of the DAX. Shares of Deutsche Telekom, the second largest company in the index, are up 23.25% so far this year, and Siemens Energy, a global powerhouse in engineering and technology and the third largest stock in the index, is up a staggering 143%.

A look at the performance of German mid-sized and small-cap stocks tells a different story. The MDAX index, which tracks a basket of 50 mid-cap German companies, and the SDAX index, which contains 70 small-cap firms, are a better reflection of the weak domestic economy. The MDAX is down 5.00% this year, and the SDAX has fallen 1.75%, underperforming the rest of Europe.

Small and medium-sized companies in the SDAX and MDAX are more sensitive to the local German economy. SDAX companies generate 50% of their revenue inside Germany, and MDAX constituents get 33% of their sales from the domestic market. On the other hand, companies in the DAX get just 18% of sales from German sources.

In addition, similar to the situation in the U.S. with companies in the Russell 2000 small-cap index, smaller firms in Germany have lower profit margins. They are typically more leveraged, making them more vulnerable to the rise in interest rates over the last two years.

Investors shouldn't look to the DAX as a metric for the health of corporate Germany. The DAX is similar to the U.S. in that a narrow set of companies are responsible for the majority of index returns and earnings-per-share growth. Its strength is driven by the same global themes powering most stock markets- AI, renewable energy, and technology.

The strength of the DAX isn't due to the German economy but rather a few companies benefiting from global trends. Small and medium-sized firms, as well as large-cap companies reliant on domestic revenue, are struggling. The MDAX and SDAX are better forward-looking indicators of where the German economy is heading. At the moment, these indexes indicate more economic pain is ahead."
"How One Man Collaborates With Investors, Zambians For A Big 'Win-Win'",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/katevitasek/2024/09/18/how-one-man-collaborates-with-investors-zambians-for-a-big-win-win/,2024-09-18T11:03:17Z,"Win-win opportunities can occur practically anywhere across the globe. Innovative ideas can spur sustainability, improve the local economy and drive collaboration between diverse groups of people.

One example is Acres Club - an organization focused on sustainable farmland investment opportunities in Zambia - that is creating win-win opportunities for both investors and Zambians who live in the investment areas.

The investment in agriculture is particularly noteworthy for Zambia because the country operates at just 20% of its potential capacity in agriculture development. In addition, unemployment and underemployment is extremely high with the World Bank reporting poverty levels at an astounding 60%.

I had the opportunity to learn from Jeff Bordes - an edtech innovator, real estate investor who founded Acres Club. Bordes shared his vision behind Acres Club and how his collaborative spirit is lifting profits for investors and the paychecks of local Zambians.

Bordes was first inspired to invest in Zambia when he visited Africa as part of his work with his edtech company. Bordes explains. ""During this trip was when I really came to understand the vast disparities that exist in terms of education and economics for many people there. At the same time, I recognized that with the right approach, there was also vast potential for U.S.-based investors that could simultaneously create lift in these underserved areas.""

His first step was expanding his edtech company's operations to Africa. But Bordes felt more could be done. He decided to found Acres Club as a land investment company with the goal to make direct investments in agricultural development and renewable energy projects in Zambia. As part of this investment strategy, Bordes and his team collaborate with local Zambians to ensure that land investments also lead to increased education and job opportunities for surrounding communities.

A report from The IGC highlights the significance of investing in agriculture, noting that the current underutilization of modern agriculture development represents ""an enormous potential for Zambia to increase its agricultural production significantly. Such expansion could meet the increasing global and regional demands for key crops like soybeans and maize and substantially contribute to Zambia's economic development and food security.""

For Bordes, one of the biggest hurdles in launching Acres Club was the initial resistance he faced from investors, who were wary of making land investments Africa. ""We worked hard to build trust by showing case studies and being transparent with our data regarding the opportunities and risks,"" he explains.

""Being able to demonstrate the successes early investors had experienced -- and particularly the way their investments had impacted the local communities -- was key to gaining trust and demonstrating our commitment to ethical, sustainable practices. Working alongside Acres Club's COO, Carl Steinmann, and CDO, Brandon Clymer, showing that we were truly practicing what we preached, we were able to form connections and get support from like-minded investors who wanted to achieve something good with their investment.""

This emphasis on sustainability alongside investment returns is a critical part of Bordes' mission, and a key differentiator that allows the organization to work alongside the Zambian government's own priorities.

As an analysis from the World Bank notes, Zambia's ""reforms of agricultural input subsidies are promising and should incentivize private sector investment, increase productivity, and favor diversification. Financing for expanded irrigation is a priority, and blended financing packages and aggregation models may help to commercialize promising pilots.""

With a sustainable focus, Acres Club doesn't just create wins for socially conscious investors -- it also has a direct impact on the people living in the communities where the investments are made.

When it comes to the results Acres Club has achieved, Bordes is most proud of the wins the investments has created in the community surrounding the investment areas. ""We've been able to enhance the overall quality of life for people in several key ways,"" Bordes says.

""We've helped train local farmers in modern, sustainable agricultural practices that increase productivity and their earning potential. The farm itself also creates numerous jobs, not just in farming, but also in other essential areas such as administration and maintenance. We also aim to improve the quality of life for local villagers by building a modern infrastructure with improved roads, utilities and housing, along with a community center that will house essential facilities such as a hospital and school.""

In addition to these solutions that seek to improve economic stability and the general well-being of the local population, Bordes intends to provide entrepreneurship training to local residents. By helping locals develop the skills and access resources needed to grow their own businesses, Acres Club's investments can help yield greater self-sufficiency.

In a country where poverty levels reached an astounding 60% in 2022, over 1,000 farmers have already benefited from specialized training programs subsidized by Acres Club to enrich their agricultural expertise and practices.

The potential scope of the training's impact can only increase in the future as Bordes is able to generate more buy-in from socially conscious investors. As reported by USAID regarding its own efforts to improve farming productivity and sustainability in Zambia, 65% of Zambians are employed in the agricultural sector, yet this only contributes to 5% of the country's GDP -- an indicator of the significant potential that makes such training especially valuable.

""Our ultimate aim is to create a sustainable, thriving community,"" Bordes concludes.

""By improving agricultural practices and socioeconomic conditions in Zambia, while also creating meaningful opportunities for investors, we're able to create a solution that provides lasting wins across the board. With our commitment to sustainability for everyone involved, we hope to help everyone involved achieve the goals that matter to them.""

As Bordes' experiences reveal, organizations have the power to create wins for multiple groups with their initiatives and services. Being mindful of different ways that you can provide value for various audiences will ultimately help your business broaden its impact and build a solid foundation for success."
Inside Billionaire Leon Cooperman's Efforts To Revitalize Downtown Newark,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahyoung/2024/09/18/inside-billionaire-leon-coopermans-efforts-to-revitalize-downtown-newark/,2024-09-18T10:33:08Z,"In a conference room on the top floor of Newark's New Jersey Performing Arts Center, billionaire Leon Cooperman enjoys a Pastrami sandwich from local staple Hobby's Deli. The 81-year-old, who is almost always photographed wearing a suit and tie, is dressed in a white graphic t-shirt emblazoned with an American flag under his navy blue Columbia Business School vest.

He folds his hands on the table and then opens up about his health: he was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease three months back, is blind in his left eye from a stroke, and recently had to have a stent put in. Despite these setbacks, he's eager to talk about his $20 million gift to revitalize Newark.

""Shrouds don't have pockets and I don't intend to take [the money] with me,"" says Cooperman. ""Anything I want I can buy, but there's nothing I want. I'm an investor.""

Cooperman has already given away several hundred million dollars to various recipients in gifts that range from $100 million to Livingston New Jersey's St. Barnabas Hospital, which was subsequently renamed Cooperman Barnabas Hospital, to $50 million to create the Cooperman College Scholars Program to send over 1,000 young people from New Jersey's Essex County to attend universities across the country.

What Cooperman doesn't manage to give away in his remaining years, he plans on leaving to charity. Forbes pegs his net worth at approximately $2.8 billion, a number that Cooperman describes as our ""opinion.""

""[Forbes] has got me at a lower number than I have, but I don't help 'em,"" says Cooperman. ""I don't like to talk about it.""

His latest gift is a $20 million donation to the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark to build the Cooperman Family Arts Education and Community Center. Construction is slated to begin in September on a three-story building with floor-to-ceiling windows that will house rehearsal spaces and classrooms with programs for all ages-from toddlers to seniors.

""He has a deep interest in giving young people, under-resourced young people, opportunities they might not have otherwise have,"" says NJPAC president and CEO John Schreiber, who floated the idea for the arts education center to Cooperman for this very reason in 2018. ""I pitched it on a Friday. We went to a deli for lunch and had sandwiches and he said, 'Look, I'll get back to you soon.' And on Monday morning he called me and said, we're going to give you $20 million for this.""

In all, the building, to be erected in place of hundreds of often-empty parking spots, will cost $70 million and open in 2027; much of the rest of the funding will come from a combination of New Jersey Economic Development Authority tax credits and a capital campaign that raised nearly a quarter billion dollars.

""Without Cooperman, we wouldn't be here,"" explains NJPAC's Schreiber, who called Cooperman's gift ""the impetus for us to say, okay, we can do this."" Schreiber, who says the area is a food and retail desert, and one of the poorest parts of the city, described the new plans as ""transformational for central Newark.""

Along the bend of the Passaic River, in the heart of Newark's downtown district, the New Jersey Performing Arts Center has served as a cultural hub of the city since its inception in 1997. Known colloquially as the NJPAC (pronounced ""N.J. Pack"" by locals), the building, and eponymous nonprofit organization behind it, entertains over 600,000 people a year at events that range from K-Pop shows to the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra.

The new building will take it from a performance center into what is hoped to be a lively new neighborhood, with retail, dining and housing. NJPAC's plans include the creation of a walkable neighborhood of apartment buildings, townhouses, restaurants, shops and parks on the land surrounding the NJPAC, currently occupied mostly by parking lots. Twenty percent of the 350 new dwellings will be affordable housing.

Unlike many members of the three comma club, Cooperman has spent his life avoiding the tangible luxuries commonly associated with massive wealth. He has no sports teams to his name, claims to have collected no art, and drives a Hyundai. But if his money is not earmarked for personal spending, where will it go?

Cooperman offers a concise response: ""Healthcare and inner city education.""

For Cooperman, who signed The Giving Pledge back in 2010, the gift to NJPAC serves as a means of supporting the causes that he is passionate about, particularly in areas close to his Short Hills, New Jersey home, a mere 10 miles from Newark. In accordance with his goals, the NJPAC Cooperman Family Arts Education and Community Center will provide opportunities for students from near and far to receive training and education in arts-related areas such as theater performance, hip hop, jazz, and backstage production for film and stage in programs that range from summer camps to classroom lessons that run year round.

Born and raised in the South Bronx by Polish immigrant parents, Cooperman claims that his expertise is extracting profits from the stock market, while his purpose is giving those profits away. To Cooperman, an effective approach to philanthropy is the same approach that made him billions on Wall Street.

""I spent my entire career picking stocks that will go up, and so I try to pick organizations that are run by people who know what they're doing,"" said Cooperman. ""These guys [at the NJPAC] know what they're doing.""

While the NJPAC's planned expansion seems to some the starting point of a bright future for Newark's downtown, others are worried about potential consequences that the new era could have on current local populations. Newark is among New Jersey's poorest cities, with a median household income of $49,688 and an unemployment rate upwards of 55%, according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

""I think it's wonderful,"" said lifelong Newark resident Taqull Williams, when asked for his opinion on the NJPAC expansions. ""I just think that there's a lot of gentrification going on. I think Newark is a city that has a great opportunity for growth, but we want to incorporate the community, the people, the natives that were here.""

Asked about the potential gentrification of downtown Newark as a result of the development, Schreiber admitted that it was a concern, but added that the developments will only take place in currently unpopulated areas.

""We don't want to be Brooklyn,"" said Schreiber. ""We're building on parking lots. We're not pushing people out."""
The Bond Bulls Better Be Right,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bobhaber/2024/09/17/the-bond-bulls-better-be-right/,2024-09-18T00:31:29Z,"We are still in the midst of one of the most fascinating bond market periods ever in history -- and ""ever"" is a long time. Just a few years ago, we had grown accustomed to ZIRP (Zero Interest Rate Policy), with rates near zero across maturities, and even negative in large parts of Europe and Asia. Then came 2022, with an inflationary shock not seen since the 1970s, driven by aggressive fiscal spending -- cash flowing from the federal government directly to businesses and consumers, all financed by Federal Reserve money printing. This was a real-world trial of Modern Monetary Theory (MMT), though before that term was coined, it was more accurately known as Weimar Treasury Theory. Add supply chain disruptions to the mix, and we saw the most aggressive global interest rate hikes since the Volcker era, leading to the worst bond market returns on record.

After bond investors went through this punishing period, they were left speculating whether the Fed's policy was too restrictive and when rate cuts might begin. This period saw the longest yield curve inversion in history -- from July 2022 to September 2024, lasting 24 months. Holding anything other than cash during this time meant enduring low returns and high volatility. Yet, not holding longer-duration bonds left investors at risk of missing out on a future bond rally that ""was bound to happen"" someday.

Finally, after two years, during the annual Jackson Hole Economic Symposium this August, where the current ""Lords of Finance"" (as chronicled in Liaquat Ahamed's excellent book) meet amidst the scenic Wyoming backdrop, Jerome Powell hinted that it was time to reduce interest rates and focus more exclusively on the labor market. His remarks sparked a 'bull steepening trade,' where short-term yields fell faster than long-term yields. The market took this as a signal, and now the forward rate curve projects as many as 10 rate cuts -- over 200 basis points -- by the end of 2025.

This 200-basis-point figure is particularly noteworthy, as history provides a precedent that suggests it might be on target. In late 2022, I wrote an article for Forbes titled titled ""I'm a believer"" (The Monkees big hit of 1966-67, written by Neil Diamond)"", outlining the bullish case for equities by drawing on a similar period in 1967, when an inverted yield curve did not lead to a recession. At that time, the Fed Funds Rate dropped from a median of 5.76% in November 1966 to a low of 3.69% in July 1967, a dramatic decline in just nine months -- without the instant market feedback we get today through social media or Bloomberg terminals.

The Fed's nearly 200-basis-point cut in 1967 did have short-term merit. Real GDP growth fell to just 0.3% (SAAR), corporate profits declined by 7.5%, and unemployment rose from 3.6% to 4.0%. These figures pointed to a soft-landing scare, which motivated the Fed to cut rates. However, in hindsight, then-Fed Chair William McChesney Martin admitted upon his retirement in 1970 that he felt he had failed, possibly recognizing that those 1967 cuts had opened Pandora's box for future inflationary problems.

Today, the market is betting that the Fed Funds Rate will be at 3.00% by this time next year. Unlike in 1966, though, today's stock market is near all-time highs, corporate profits are strong with nearly 11% growth, and while the labor market may be sending mixed signals, the effects of mass immigration over the last four years on the labor force are unclear. More importantly, the services sector remains robust, household and corporate balance sheets look solid (according to Federal Reserve data), and the Treasury continues its stimulative spending.

So why is the bond market betting on 200 basis points of rate cuts? Are we about to lift the lid on another Pandora's box? Could the bond market be preparing for yet another U-turn?"
The Federal Reserve is on the verge of cutting interest rates. Here's what to know,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/nx-s1-5115907/federal-reserve-interest-rates-inflation,2024-09-17T22:05:32Z,"The Federal Reserve is about to start cutting interest rates for the first time since 2020, but a big question looms: How far will they go?

It won't be an easy call. For more than a year, the Fed has kept borrowing costs at their highest level in more than two decades. That's made it more expensive to get a car loan, finance a business, or carry a balance on a credit card.

Now that the Fed has made clear it will be cutting interest rates, it will need to decide whether to opt for a modest quarter-percentage-point rate cut, or a more aggressive half-a-point cut.

That uncertainty has made this meeting one of the most highly anticipated in a while.

Here are three things to know ahead of the Fed's decision, due out at 2 p.m. ET.

The only certainty is that the central bank will be cutting interest rates. That's not exactly a ""stop the presses"" headline. Fed chairman Jerome Powell telegraphed it nearly a month ago.

It's the size of the rate cut that remains in doubt.

It's a tough call. Inflation has fallen substantially, with consumer prices rising by an annual 2.5% in August, down from a pandemic peak of 9.1% in June 2022. But prices are still climbing somewhat faster than the Fed would like.

At the same time, the U.S. job market is starting to show some weakness. Hiring has slowed and unemployment is inching up, hitting 4.2% last month.

All in all, the data is not pointing in a clear direction, meaning the Fed could really go either way.

Some economists who worry about the labor market believe the Fed should go bigger, delivering a half-percentage-point cut. Others feel the Fed can be more patient, starting with a quarter-percentage-point cut while it continues to assess the incoming data.

Bets on a quarter- vs half-a-percentage point cut have swung wildly on Wall Street. As of late afternoon on Tuesday, investors thought a larger cut was nearly twice as likely as the quarter-point move.

The size of the rate cut is bound to create split opinions in markets, but analysts also say that at least one thing is clear: Wednesday's rate cut won't be the last.

Investors expect the Fed to continue cutting rates in the next few months, marking a turning point from an extraordinary period in the U.S. economy when the Fed was forced to sharply raise interest rates to fight surging inflation.

Uncertainty about the pace of rate cuts will continue -- but Wall Street also has other things on its plate, including the looming presidential election.

September is historically a bad month for markets -- and, in election years, that rough patch extends through October. Investors are also keeping an eye on the tech sector, which has been volatile amid fears that companies are spending too much on artificial intelligence for too little return on their investments.

It's a lot to juggle, and analysts are urging investors to be patient.

""I'm a little dubious about the rate cut reducing uncertainty,"" says Steven Wieting, the chief investment strategist for Citi Wealth.

But Wieting also noted some of this uncertainty will likely die down in the coming months, especially following the U.S. elections.

""Ultimately, we'll get a clearer direction,"" he adds.

Borrowing money is going to get a little bit cheaper. Interest rates on car loans and credit cards should come down a bit. For people with money in the bank, on the other hand, the interest rate they get on their savings might also drop.

Meanwhile, mortgage rates have already come down in anticipation of the Fed's move. The average rate on a 30-year home loan is now 6.2%, the lowest since February 2023. That's still higher than the rates around 3% common during the pandemic, but it's down substantially from the peak last year of nearly 8%.

But here's one thing to keep in mind: Whether the Fed cuts rates on Wednesday by a quarter-percentage-point or by half-a-percentage point, it's going to take some time for these falling rates to really make a difference in the economy.

Monetary policy is like the hot water in some older houses. You can crank the water all the way to hot, but it still takes time for it to get there."
Puncturing The Phillips Curve Myth,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/vipinbharathan/2024/09/17/puncturing-the-phillips-curve-myth/,2024-09-17T20:45:58Z,"We are approaching September 19th when the Fed is widely expected to cut the Fed Funds rate by 25 basis points, if not more. The Fed's twin mandate, keeping inflation under control and aiming for low unemployment is really in the service of the American economy and in the public interest. Most of the other functions are regulatory. The choice between the twin mandates are meant to be expressed in the Phillips curve. The Fed and the economic establishment relies on the Phillips curve based models to help them choose between the Scylla of high unemployment and the Charybdis of inflation.

""Reassessing the Effectiveness and Transmission of Monetary Policy,"" was the theme of the economic symposium sponsored by the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas City, Jackson Hole, Wyoming in August. The Fed telegraphed that rate cuts are on the way. They give themselves credit for falling inflation, which they claim is due to the ""Effectiveness and proper Transmission of Monetary Policy"". They were late to raise interest rates, and now they are late to cut. Mostly, this is due to their reliance on flawed models. Add to this the delay and lack of integrity in the measurement of various economic indicators. Bad models plus bad data yield results once in a while, similar to a broken clock that is right twice a day. The first paper presented during the symposium extends the Phillips curve towards the vertical leg of the Phillips curve.

The Phillips curve, interpreted today as the classic seesaw between unemployment and inflation, was created from pre-WWI data for the UK. That such a curve fitting exercise on local empirical data from the long eclipsed British Empire has become the staple of economic theory and the rationale for action or the lack of it, is completely normal in a discipline that hopes to measure, and control complex phenomena. Today's economic conditions bear no resemblance to the late Victorian era.

Economics is not physics. Even physics is not an exact science when it comes to modeling complex phenomena such as weather and climate. Models depend on simplification. Linking two economic measures such as inflation and unemployment is one of those simplifications. The economic establishment glosses over this simplification.

Low inflation for two decades lulled the economic establishment into a transitory mindset as inflation started going up in 2021. The Fed held down the overnight and fed fund rates. As Jerome Powell noted in his Jackson hole 2024 address team transitory was vanquished and the Fed tightened interest rates in an unprecedented manner. Prominent economists such as Lawrence Summers opined in 2022 that we need huge unemployment over multiple years to bring inflation under control. This is a Phillips curve maximalist view. Some of them even predicted that inflation cannot be controlled without a recession.

The Phillips curve has undergone revisions and updated thinking. This defense of a model, which has lost its predictive power, especially at the ends of its curve speaks to the myths of economics and the paucity of tools that have predictive or even analytic power. Revisions and add-ons have yielded at least nine Nobel prizes. Phillips himself did not consider the eponymous curve significant. The Phillips curve has become somewhat of a shibboleth in economic circles. The fact that an orthodoxy exists is due to the fact that almost all of the economists of note and power in the government and in control of major economic publications come from a handful of institutions. An echo chamber that amplifies these myths.

Phillips curve as Phillips created it was not about inflation at all. The curve shows the relationship between unemployment and rate of change of wages in the years 1861-1913 in the UK. As part of the myth-making process of the 70s and before, the rate of change of wages was meant to stand in for the money supply in the economy. When there is more money, people are willing to pay more for the same goods or services. When people are willing to pay more, then inflation takes hold. Or so the argument goes. As the economist James Forder has shown, the myth of the Phillips curve as a choice between inflation and labor costs was created by an anti-labor cost sentiment among economists. You can read about it in ""Forder, James (2014). Macroeconomics and the Phillips curve myth. Oxford University Press.""

There was a period of low inflation coupled with low unemployment in about two decades leading up to 2020. This phenomenon caused economists to concentrate on the horizontal part of the Phillips curve. Then inflation took hold during the post-pandemic period and later post Ukraine invasion. Further shocks were delivered by the Gaza war. Such unexpected inflation may very well have to do with the amount of money in the system; due to low unemployment as well as pandemic spending. In a globalized economy, the complete stoppage of production in China during the zero-covid period caused supply side ructions and hence higher costs. Rising energy costs due to supply constraints as Russia went offline for most of the developed world as well as the recent disruptions in the supply routes by the Gaza invasion contributed as well. Apportioning inflation to supply or demand is a tough challenge. Nonetheless, it has not deterred academics from trying, they attribute 60% to low unemployment and 40% to supply shocks. They do some fancy somersaults to justify these figures.

If inflation can be traced to price-inflation, because of greed and because of the shutdown of the Chinese economy, America's factory then the Fed is helpless to control it. It does not seem to be wage-inflation that is the main culprit. The executive branch and fiscal policy are also off the hook.

The myth of the Phillips curve as a trade off between unemployment and inflation was born during the ideological struggles of the 70s. This myth focused on short run Phillips curve being flat by the labor friendly economists. It is nearly vertical as unemployment reaches a low point. It is as if, it hit a wall. Arguments about union aggressiveness, the natural rate of unemployment and other such myths get trotted out when inflation rises and unemployment goes down. There is almost no justification for inflation to tend toward infinity as the unemployment rate goes below 1.5 percent. Labor's power to effect wages has also gone down over the years as union representation has gone down. This is notwithstanding the victories eked out in the recent year by the UAW, the Teamsters and others.

The fact that many goods get manufactured globally, the role of innovation and increase in productivity and many of the economic facts of modern production and consumption are not present in a Phillips curve based interpretation of inflation vs. unemployment. Globalization and the export of manufacturing and even services to other countries is not factored in. Immigration is another phenomenon missing in the Phillips curve based analysis in the recent past in the US. Immigrants both legal and illegal have contributed to productivity and lowering labor costs. The numbers in the late Victorian era for the British empire have also been subject to globalization. Captive raw materials, both agricultural and otherwise, flowed into the British Isles. A boom in British manufacturing followed. The Phillips curve should be retired. A new paradigm needs to be born.

A paper presented at the Jackson Hole symposium injected the Beveridge threshold at the lower end. The authors of the paper contend that when the Beveridge threshold is breached, the Phillips curve percentage of wage increases are almost vertical, tending almost to infinity.

Only in dreams can labor hope to get wage increases tending to infinity as unemployment goes down. Instead of abandoning the Phillips curve as they should have, economists double down on it. Creating many variants, this time with the Beveridge threshold.

That there is an inverse relationship between unemployment and wage increases is not a great revelation. That wage increases trigger inflation is not a given. This is true especially when goods and services are produced in lower cost regimes, with lower labor protections and costs. These goods are then shipped to countries that can afford to pay for them. They are also targeted to these richer nations. It is doubtful whether items such as Santa figurines will find much of a market in China or India.

Added to this there are problems with measurement of basic economic data. Vacancy rates, unemployment itself, prices and other data that feed inflation measurements have a lot of lag. They are also often revised, even after actions to counter the wrong numbers have already launched.

So what can be done to bring macro-economic policy closer to reality. Models are important, however we need more insight into what the models lack and to be a little more objective. Milton Friedman had suggested replacing the Central Bank with an algorithm. His concept of the algorithm was a steady increase in money supply, say four or five percent a year. There are others who have also argued for the complete elimination of the Fed.

Without the Fed, the 2008 crisis would have seen the bottom drop out of the world. However, the Fed did bail out the wrong parties. Big institutions, banks and the investors got bailed out over main street. We have seen how this drama plays out without Fed intervention. Decades of misery such as during the Great Depression. Ditto with the pandemic. Intervention and counter-cyclic action is paramount. This sort of immediacy and daily intervention is part and parcel of Open Market Operations. The Fed intervenes in the overnight lending market through OMO to stabilize the economy.

We have much more sophisticated tools now. How about collecting data at the source? The first step is collecting and aggregating such data in a verifiable and audited manner through the intermediary of a decentralized apparatus such as a blockchain, which is excellent for provenance. Once the data has more integrity, AI would be effective to steer the economy, with human intervention of course. Monetary policy changes will be made more frequently than the 9 times a year that the FOMC meets. This would go a long way towards the elimination of what is called the business cycle. A steady state is what the Fed and all of us are after. Close to full employment without run-away inflation. Reliance on outmoded and incorrect tools such as the Phillips curve results in our current state where every forecasted move of the Fed causes market volatility and the destruction of perfectly viable enterprises."
How CFOs Can Start Implementing AI In The Financial Department,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/09/17/how-cfos-can-start-implementing-ai-in-the-financial-department/,2024-09-17T16:02:53Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

IBM's new Global CFO Study finds that CFOs are in a position to make big changes in their companies. Technological innovation, understanding of data and risk, and broad opportunities to influence company decisions put CFOs into the driver's seat in achieving strategic outcomes.

The study states that CFOs should be ""both guardians of stability and agents of transformation. At the epicenter of strategy development and execution, CFOs, working hand in glove with tech leaders, supercharge technology as the transformative force in their organization."" More than six in 10 CFOs said they need to rewrite their organizational playbook, bringing new strategies to the fore and taking advantage of technology. CFOs ranked modernizing technology as the most important driver of competitive advantage over the next few years, with many eyes on using AI to make standard calculations more efficient and make more effective predictions.

Some high-performing CFOs are taking advantage of all that is in front of them and playing a key role in strategy, the study found. However, several CFOs could do more to accelerate their influence, and they seem to be more hesitant to push for major changes. The report reviews what CFOs can do to be better and more effective change agents. Many have to do with data and AI: Work closely with your CIO on tech priorities. Upgrade data management so the information is more useful with AI systems. Use that data to transform strategic principles into measurable metrics. Learn your company's risk tolerance and make calculated bets. Look for ROI, but be sure you're investing in both short-term and long-term payoffs. And make sure your team is trained in areas including data security, data curation and sustainability.

These strategies are not all easy to employ, especially given finance departments have generally had set policies and procedures for decades. However, IBM's study shows that there can be rewards for CFOs who take a position more central to company strategy. Leading CFOs tend to outperform their peers in finances -- returning 39.3% more revenue growth and 10.6% more revenue growth last year -- and with retention, strategy, brand reputation and tech maturity.

How, exactly, can technology help your finance department? Jeff Bronaugh, a partner in financial advisory firm CrossCountry Consulting's national business transformation practice, explained some of the ways to start using it, and provided some advice on implementation. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are now open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Today's the day that countless economists, financial professionals, executives and investors have had circled in red on their calendars for more than a month: The beginning of the Federal Reserve Board meeting at which interest rates are going to be cut. The announcement will come Wednesday afternoon when the two-day meeting concludes, but it's an understatement to say their decision is anxiously anticipated.

Interest rates have been at a 23-year high of 5.25% to 5.5% since July 2023, and economists are currently wondering how much they will be cut: 25 or 50 basis points. But with last week's consumer price index report showing 2.5% inflation compared with August 2023, and the unemployment rate for August ticking up to 4.2% amid weak job growth -- as well as assurances from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell himself, it's clear something will happen this week.

However, a rate cut won't be an automatic cure-all for the economy's woes. JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said last week that an overly aggressive rate cut could cause stagflation -- economic stagnation and high inflation and unemployment, writes Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly. Dimon warned that too-aggressive action from the federal government could lead to overspending, which could keep the rest of the economy from fully recovering. Dimon has been an economic pessimist overall; he projected a high chance of a recession last month.

Last week, labor unions showed what businesses would portray as the best of times and the worst of times. On Thursday, about 33,000 unionized machinists in the Pacific Northwest working for Boeing went on strike after rejecting a deal the aerospace manufacturer proposed. Nearly 95% of union members rejected the deal in a vote, and 96% supported going on strike.

The contract Boeing offered employees would have provided 25% pay raises, shifted more health insurance costs to the company, and guaranteed that the company's next plane model would be built in the Puget Sound area. Employees felt they didn't go far enough, and did not flinch from their demands of 40% pay raises and the reinstatement of Boeing's pension plan.

Also on Thursday, about 28,000 American Airlines flight attendants represented by the Association of Professional Flight Attendants overwhelmingly approved a five-year contract with the airline, writes Forbes senior contributor Ted Reed. The new contract provides raises of up to 20.5% starting next month, as well as boarding pay and retroactive pay that will reach five figures (up to $50,000) for many. APFA President Julie Hedrick said that while the contract is ratified, there's still work the union needs to do with American Airlines: Make the corporate workers better understand the human side of flight attendants.

The presidential election is seven weeks from today, and Republican candidate Donald Trump sidestepped the campaign Monday night to announce a new family business venture: A cryptocurrency called World Liberty Financial. The new cryptocurrency, which was announced on a livestream on X, would be run by Trump's older sons Don Jr. and Eric, though 18-year-old Barron Trump -- who the former president says is a crypto enthusiast -- is also listed on a white paper describing the business as a ""DeFi Visionary."" Details of the cryptocurrency, including when it would be available, its purpose or details of how it will work were scarce on the livestream, media outlets reported.

In the past, Trump was not a supporter of cryptocurrency, calling bitcoin a ""scam"" in 2021. He's been slowly changing his tune, and has pledged to fire Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler for his agency's crackdown on bad crypto actors and recent attempts at regulation. This year, he's heavily courted the cryptocurrency industry, accepting crypto campaign donations and speaking at the Bitcoin Conference this summer.

Vice President Kamala Harris has not taken any specific position on cryptocurrency.

Ethics experts are concerned Trump's direct involvement in a cryptocurrency could be a serious conflict of interest if elected. Trump would be able to set government crypto policy tailor-made to World Liberty Financial. He also could move the U.S. toward a strategic cryptocurrency reserve, which he's said he plans to do in speeches -- a huge policy shift, and one from which he could directly benefit.

While there's so much talk about bringing AI into the finance department, the practical applications sometimes get lost in the conversations. I talked to Jeff Bronaugh, a partner in financial business advisory firm CrossCountry Consulting's national business transformation practice, for some practical advice and applications. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

How can AI help in the CFO's office today?

Bronaugh: Most CFOs are looking for AI to help out by driving efficiency. Within the office, there's enhanced productivity, generating financial reporting from source documents. There are products that ingest leasing terms and can report on the lease payments. They can create content for external and external and executive reporting. They can write technical accounting memos, board decks, and PowerPoint.

Another area we're seeing AI particularly prevalent is in strategic finance. Products can help provide a predictive element to forecasting, or even provide corporate due diligence on companies using public documents and natural language.

AI's picking up around reconciliations and closed workflow. There are a lot of products that can help provide workflow around the close, and automate reconciliations and accounts, generate commentary when account balances have issues. The idea is taking the monotonous work out of the accountant's hands and having them spend more time on value-added activities.

What kind of advice would you give to a company trying to bring AI into its financial organization?

Start small. Think about solving smaller problems before you try to tackle the macro and look for quick wins.

When you're standing up AI in the organization, it's important that it's done in a constructive way. There has to be governance around the AI. Set up a governance committee so you're thinking holistically about how you want to deploy the architecture within the organization, and drive standards and consistency across business units. If you don't have the framework in place, it is going to be next to impossible to really corral that effort.

When I think of a governance model, there are four key areas that I like to focus on. One is learning and development. The second is around system monitoring and adoption. Think about managing KPIs, making sure it's up and running and that the user can get benefit out of it. Third is really around data privacy, compliance and ethics and making sure that PII or other sensitive information isn't being exposed. And then the fourth is innovation governance. How do we define use and business cases around AI in a way that captures ROI and measures the benefit to the organization to make sure that we're doing things that structure or drive value to the imperatives of an organization.

Many organizations are looking for the efficiency AI can bring. Do you see a lot of them ready to implement AI or do they need to do more in terms of cleaning their data or getting their systems in order?

Organizations that don't have a strong enterprise architecture in place, as I mentioned earlier, are going to struggle with adoption across the entire firm. Data is critically important. I always think of data as garbage in, garbage out. If you don't have good data and good information, it's going to be very tough for an organization to get good value out of AI.

However, the days of mapping AI to data maturity in an organization have gone. There are so many point solutions where AI can be injected in different parts of the financial process that you may not necessarily need to have gold-standard data. AI can still read the invoices, correctly map them, code them, and operate within your ERP. If you have good system controls in place, there are opportunities for AI to come in without a perfect set of information or data.

As you think about larger sets of information, data becomes much more important, particularly when you're marrying internal data with external data around geopolitical economics or industry-related data. That's where good data standards, good data governance are really important.

There are many ways that AI can be used to enhance your business's operations, but there are also many great ideas that won't work. There's a good chance that you may make a wrong choice, and that's OK.

Brace For Crash And Trillions Wiped Out With Fed Rate Cut,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/17/brace-for-crash-and-trillions-wiped-out-with-fed-rate-cut/,2024-09-17T15:28:12Z,"Markets are now pricing a roughly 60% chance for a 50 bps rate cut by Chair Powell's Federal Reserve on Wednesday. Results will be announced at 2 pm EST after the conclusion of the Fed's September 17/18 FOMC meeting.

We're scared of this high expectation.

We believe this is a recipe for huge disappointment. In fact, we consider a 25 bps cut by the Federal Reserve more likely. We certainly hope this doesn't happen but offer this analysis so investors can consider the full range of scenarios as a contrast to our more optimistic views of the Fed's next move.

The thing is, if Chair Powell goes with a 25 bps cut and doesn't add language that comforts investors, markets will pull back in a big way.

This could be much worse than the $2+ trillion wipeout the benchmark S&P 500 index witnessed in the first 3 days of August. We see the magnificent 7 - especially high-growth firms like Nvidia - dropping by 10-20% just like they did last month; erasing hundreds of billions of investor money among them. Expect the broader market to see a drop of at least 5% in the next couple of days with the Nasdaq index losing more. The small caps index Russell 2000 is likely to be hit the worst. Smaller companies, on average, have less cash in hand and rely on near-term debt to finance their operations. Higher rates don't help them. (Do you know how the Trefis HQ strategy, which has outperformed S&P, works with downside protection?)

What's worse?

Just see what happened last month - the S&P 500 had one of its worst string of days when the market wiped out more than 20% from companies like Nvidia (how low can Nvidia go?), with significant drops across the tech sector for giants like Google and Amazon, and for the S&P 500 as a whole. Investors had nowhere to hide. If the Fed decides to go with a 25 bps rate cut on Wednesday, it will be much worse this time around. Things can turn uglier in a hurry if a few bad jobless claims reports over the coming weeks show increased unemployment and inflation continues to stay flat near-term. This will conjure images of a recession in the minds of investors.

In all of this - what can we learn from history? How low can stocks and ETFs/indices go - from the S&P 500 to tech innovator AAPL to pharma giant Merck, which stocks dropped most during past market crashes? Of course, we believe investors will be better off not being too reactive. However, bad times don't make for calm participants.

The truth is companies like Alphabet, Nvidia, and Microsoft are fantastic investments in the long run. However, the near-term volatility for individual stocks can be hard to stomach. If you don't like the rollercoaster ride, learn how the select 30 stocks that constitute the Trefis High Quality portfolio (HQ) strategy have outperformed the S&P 500 - consistently. And how we add downside protection to HQ. HQ has seen >80% return since its Sep 2020 inception. Hint: it's simple, and right there in the HQ strategy's performance metrics. It is not just about the size of the companies, but also their defensible revenue growth and margins, strong balance sheets, and other quality criteria.

The Debt Bomb

Bad times also focus the mind on follies. The current U.S. debt situation is not just a folly - in some quarters it's considered a ticking time bomb. JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently raised a big red flag about the now $1 trillion in annual interest payments the U.S. owes on its debt. This is unprecedented. It is uncharted territory. The point is near-term unfavorable data in the event of a 25 bps drop can quickly lead to new stories of doom and gloom imagined - adding to the downward spiral in investor sentiments, and the stock market.

The other risk is default on loans. All market crashes happen because someone can't pay back their loans. For one, commercial real estate has been suffering for a while, Covid's work-from-home gift was a big curse for the Retail and Office real-estate sector. In addition to an altered demand landscape, commercial real estate loans maturing near-term continue to face high rates and tough refinancing conditions. Things could break, though that hasn't happened - and with Fed rates finally on the downtrend, it's less likely.

Finally, there is consumer defaults - personal loans, auto loans, and credit card loans in particular. That makes banks like JPM, Citigroup, and BofA with large credit card books vulnerable (How low can JPM stock go in a market crash?). We hope this risk is transient - because we believe the Fed will do whatever it takes to create a soft landing.

In fact, as we've argued in our contrasting scenario of the Fed's moves - with rates as high as they are currently, the Fed has even more power. There is a lot of room to cut rates and release more liquidity if things go south. They can do a 100 bps cut if things come to that. The Fed can rapidly infuse liquidity if the economy needs a shot for any reason. The big question is - will they do it in the near term?

The sum of it all

All things considered, we believe the short term is likely to be volatile. And we are particularly uncomfortable with high expectations of a 50 bps rate cut by the Federal Reserve. We see a higher chance of more attractive market conditions in the medium term, though, and that's good for investors.

We've developed Trefis strategies to take advantage of such opportunities, especially HQ with downside protection, while carefully managing risk in developing our Trefis portfolio strategies."
Examining The Fed's Rate Cut Conundrum,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/danirvine/2024/09/17/examining-the-feds-rate-cut-conundrum/,2024-09-17T15:04:05Z,"The Federal Open Market Committee, the pivotal decision-making body of the Federal Reserve, finds itself at a critical juncture as it prepares for its highly anticipated policy meeting this week. Amidst a backdrop of wide-ranging economic narratives, the committee faces a consequential choice: implement a substantial rate cut of 50 basis points or opt for a more measured approach with a 25 bps reduction.

This decision carries profound implications for the trajectory of monetary policy and the broader financial landscape, igniting a spirited debate among market participants, economists, and policymakers alike.

The Case For A Jumbo Rate Cut

Proponents of a substantial 50 bps rate cut argue that the current economic landscape warrants a bold and decisive move by the Federal Reserve. One of the primary drivers behind the call for a jumbo rate cut is the recent softening in the labor market. While the August employment report revealed a respectable addition of 142,000 jobs, the pace of job gains has slowed considerably compared to the first half of the year. Moreover, downward revisions to job growth in June and July have further amplified concerns about the robustness of the labor market.

Advocates of a larger rate cut, such as former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Bill Dudley, argue that a proactive approach is necessary to safeguard the labor market's resilience and prevent a potential downward spiral. In a Bloomberg op-ed, Dudley contends, ""...a bigger move now makes it easier for the Fed to align its projections with market expectations, rather than delivering an unpleasant surprise not warranted by the economic outlook.""

By lowering borrowing costs and stimulating economic activity, a substantial rate reduction could help sustain job creation and mitigate the risks of a more severe labor market downturn. Additionally, in the face of heightened uncertainty and concerns about an economic slowdown, a substantial rate reduction could serve as a powerful signal of the Federal Reserve's commitment to supporting the economy and promoting financial stability.

By injecting liquidity into the system and lowering borrowing costs, a 50 bps rate cut could stimulate investment, spur consumer spending, and reinvigorate economic activity, fostering a more favorable environment for financial markets.

The Case For A Measured Approach

While the arguments for a substantial rate cut carry weight, a significant contingent of market participants and policymakers advocate for a more cautious and measured approach. They contend that a 25 bps rate reduction strikes a prudent balance between addressing economic concerns and maintaining policy flexibility.

In an interview with Yahoo Finance, Goldman Sach's chief economist Jon Hatzius said he believes a 25 bps cut is ""...more consistent with the data that we've seen,"" adding, ""I would also expect them to signal clearly, as Governor Waller did on Friday, that they'd be very willing to scale up the pace if the data disappoint.""

Another concern is the potential for unintended consequences stemming from an overly aggressive rate cut. By opting for a smaller rate cut, the Federal Reserve could strike a balance between supporting economic growth and maintaining financial stability, mitigating the risks of unintended consequences that could undermine the economy's long-term health.

Navigating Uncharted Waters

Since 1954, there have been ten recessions, each occurring during a rate-cutting cycle. However, two rate-cutting cycles did not lead to recessions, highlighting the non-deterministic nature of monetary policy actions. And while past rate-cutting cycles often signaled impending recessions, the present situation demands a more nuanced interpretation. The U.S. economy, emerging from an unprecedented period of growth and stimulus following the COVID-19 pandemic, is exhibiting a controlled deceleration rather than a precipitous decline.

Key economic indicators paint a picture of an economy transitioning from extraordinary highs to more sustainable levels. Although GDP growth is slowing, it's important to contextualize this deceleration as an adjustment from historically high, unsustainable levels towards long-term averages, a process that aligns with the Federal Reserve's objectives.

Job creation continues, albeit at a more moderate pace compared to the record-breaking post-COVID years, with the current unemployment rate of 4.2% remaining historically low. Consumer spending persists at historically elevated levels, significantly above long-term averages, suggesting underlying economic resilience.

The effectiveness of previous rate hikes is evident in the moderation of inflation, with the Consumer Price Index approaching the Federal Reserve's target range of mid to low 2.5%. These factors collectively suggest that the U.S. economy, while decelerating, maintains considerable strength, characterized by a controlled slowdown rather than an imminent recession, distinguishing it from many previous rate-cutting cycles.

The Road Ahead

Regardless of the initial rate cut size, it is widely anticipated that the Federal Reserve will continue to adjust its policy stance in the coming months. Many economists and market analysts expect additional rate cuts to follow, with projections generally ranging from 100 to 200 bps in total reductions by the end of 2024.

The Federal Reserve's ability to navigate this complex economic landscape will hinge on its commitment to data dependence, clear communication, and a nuanced understanding of the intricate interplay between monetary policy, economic growth, and financial stability.

As the world watches, the FOMC's decision next week will undoubtedly shape the trajectory of the global economy and financial markets, serving as a pivotal moment in the ongoing quest for sustainable growth and economic resilience.

As the Federal Reserve weighs each approach's potential benefits and risks, it must strike a delicate balance between addressing pressing economic concerns and preserving policy flexibility. Ultimately, the success of the Federal Reserve's actions will be measured not only by their immediate impact but also by their ability to foster long-term economic resilience and sustainable growth."
"Tina Brown, And When Even Autism Becomes Politicized",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelbernick/2024/09/17/tina-brown-and-when-even-autism-becomes-politicized/,2024-09-17T13:55:46Z,"""That's my father"": Within minutes of Gus Walz's pronouncement at the Democratic National Convention in August, the autism blogosphere filled with positive comments about Gus and the heightened profile of an upbeat young man seen as being on the autism spectrum.

But it wasn't long before even this positive, non-political moment became politicized. In a New York Times guest essay two days later, Tina Brown used Gus's moment to contrast a supportive worldview toward autism she attributed to Gus's father, Vice President nominee Tim Walz, with the dark worldview of the Trumps and their supporters. In turn, the essay quickly brought 570 comments from Times readers, nearly all of them congratulating Ms. Brown and denouncing Trump, Republicans and conservatives for their indifference and even cruelty toward individuals with autism and other developmental differences.

This politicizing of autism and disabilities is not surprising: nearly all issues today are seen through the lens of partisan politics. But in the case of autism, it is especially misplaced and counterproductive. For some years, the autism community has stood apart from most of America precisely in its lack of partisanship. Republicans, conservatives, and Trump supporters all are active in the community, along with Democrats and Independents. Nobody thinks of linking autism to Tim Walz, Donald Trump or any other politician. Further identity politics, so prevalent elsewhere, are largely absent: race, gender, religion, sexual orientation are recognized as unimportant and divisive in favor of shared goals.

The Autism City -- an economy and society that has a role for all adults with autism -- can only be based on rejecting any partisanship. And partisanship makes no sense, since both incidences of autism and community involvement cut across all partisan lines. Let's briefly explain.

****

In her essay, Ms. Brown writes about recognizing Gus Walz as ""one of 'ours,' a sweet, unfiltered, slightly bewildered-looking young man who wasn't quite sure what was expected of him in this epic moment of political adulation."" Gus has been described as having a learning disorder and ADHD. In him, Ms. Brown sees her son George, 38, who is on the autism spectrum, and also unfiltered and of a positive nature.

George struggles to find steady employment and social connections. Brown notes, ""Their loneliness can be agonizing...Having a friendly, forgiving workplace to go to is critical. It's often their only taste of community and what makes them such reliable and rewarding employees. The work from home movement has been a killer for people with special needs, often depriving them of the only social connections they have.""

Ms. Brown is correct. Among all the priorities in the autism community, finding and retaining a job is at the top. In fact, having a steady job is usually far more important for adults on the autism spectrum than for adults in the general population. It provides a role in the economy, self-esteem, and (most of all) somewhere to go every day.

George's struggles are no different than most adults with autism. The estimates of employment among adults with autism vary widely from 40% without any paid work to up to 70% unemployed/underemployed. Whatever the precise employment number is, it is at least four to five times higher than the general population. Even those who are employed are often employed part-time, and/or have a tenuous link to their jobs.

Ms. Brown points to Governor Walz as a model, and Governor Walz and his wife do appear to be highly dedicated and devoted to Gus. Minnesota, like other states, has a system of government-funded job placement efforts that has been in effect for decades preceding Governor Walz, along with neurodiversity private sector hiring initiatives, such as the prominent Disability:IN Minnesota of Northwest Airlines, 3M, Express Financial Advisors and other major Minnesota employers. However, it is worth noting that the labor force participation and employment rates in Minnesota among adults with autism are no higher than in other states. The labor force participation rate, the key indicator of working age adults employed or looking for work, has been a dispiriting 33.6% for Minnesotans with disabilities in recent years.

Improving the employment of adults with autism, finding a place in the job market for George and Gus, will require multiple strategies. Some of these strategies involve significantly restructuring the edifice of government departments and non-profit groups and the hundreds of millions of dollars spent each year on and autism and neurodiversity employment activities. Other strategies involve expanding the network of mutual assistance groups: adults with autism, family members, and advocates who volunteer and join together to address employment, housing and mental health challenges.

Both sets of strategies require that autism remain free of partisanship. That's currently the case, and needs to remain so. The mutual assistance group that I've been part of since 2011, AASCEND, has members from all backgrounds and political views -- even in the deep-blue Bay Area. Similar volunteer groups exist in the more rural and conservative areas of the state. Republicans, conservatives and MAGA supporters in California are no less supportive of autism initiatives than others, and the many with family members participate in rates similar to others.

Ms. Brown claims to be pained by the ""scorn of strangers"" toward George, ""the whispered insults or titter at the next table."" She provides no more detail on who are these ""strangers,"" or what she is referring to. Views toward persons with autism have shifted dramatically over the past three decades, in good part due to demographics and social awareness. Autism cuts across all politics, races, and religions.

The Times readers are more direct in characterizing Republicans, conservatives and MAGA supporters as hostile toward adults with autism. ""Trump and his minions are ignorant, insensitive, and xenophobic,"" one reader writes, and another adds, ""Are we surprised by the horrible comments coming from the putrid MAGA crowd when their leader and some of his progeny have time and time again demonstrated their lack of the most basic empathy."" A good part of the comments are along these lines, including ""It is upsetting to think that Gus...will have to content with the online bullying and rollout from this conversation that MAGA generated"", and ""Too many of the cruel, tiny-minded bullies who mocked and stalked our kids starting in early childhood have grown into adults who are just like that.""

The rhetoric is not dissimilar from that of most reader responses to any mention of Republicans or MAGA supporters. No evidence is provided for these characterizations. Anyone who is actually engaged in the autism community would know how preposterous these characterizations are.

****

A few days after Tina Brown's essay appeared, Times columnist Nicholas Kristoff weighed in with an essay, ""Here's Why We Shouldn't Demean Trump Voters."" The ""We"" appears to be Kristoff and similarly-situated affluent, college educated liberals. Kristoff tells us that he knows about Trump voters because he lives in a rural area of Oregon and talks to a few of them. He assures readers that the Trump voters may be misled and mistaken, but they are not bad people.

Those of us who are old timers in autism have watched over the past few decades as younger members, especially those who are on the spectrum, have led a self-advocacy movement. It is a movement that is in opposition to attempts by any one group to own autism, and also in opposition to the condescension of the college educated liberal.

These recent essays by Ms. Brown and Mr. Kristoff, and the responses from Times readers, show we can all learn much from these autism self-advocates."
SAP BrandVoice: Forging Ahead: How Cloud ERP Drives Growth For Mill Products Manufacturers,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2024/09/17/forging-ahead-how-cloud-erp-drives-growth-for-mill-products-manufacturers/,2024-09-17T11:10:53Z,"By Jennifer Scholze, Team Lead - Energy and Natural Resources Marketing, SAP

From metals and building materials to paper products and packaging goods, there's no question that every sector of the mill products industry is growing. But the significance of that growth rate remains uncertain for midsize competitors without the right technology.

""Boosting competitiveness and growth comes with its share of risks,"" a recent Oxford Economics report reveals. ""Respondents ranked macroeconomic issues like inflation, unemployment, and the rising cost of materials as the top threat (39%). Also on the list of threats is the inability to find the right talent (33%) or retain the right talent (31%) - indicating that staffing issues are tough.""

So, how can midsize mill companies grow without risking their stability and profitability? Overcoming these obstacles lies in leveraging cloud-based solutions and artificial intelligence (AI).

A significant challenge for midsize mill products manufacturers is visibility into production processes. For many, their production floor is a ""black box"" - materials go in and finished products come out, but the journey in between is unclear.

This lack of visibility impacts the ability to meet customer demands in ways that address top business objectives, including:

For example, they often can't answer critical questions, such as ""Can we fulfill and deliver promised products efficiently and on time?"" and ""Which products and customers are profitable?""

Oxford Economics also reports that half of respondents struggle to ""scale systems to match organic business growth or lack visibility into supply chain and manufacturing capacity."" But more troublesome is the 40% that are ""unable to support new businesses, enter new geographies, or deploy new business models.""

As these findings clearly show, an outdated IT infrastructure stifles growth. Many companies are stuck using systems that are 15 to 20 years old, often relying on spreadsheets or legacy software that is difficult to upgrade.

For a deeper look into the value of cloud ERP for midsize mill companies, read the SAP-sponsored Oxford Economics report, ""Blueprint for Success: How Mill Products Manufacturers Can Lean into Technology to Outpace Competitors

These systems are time-consuming to maintain, highly risky from a security standpoint, and leave little room for innovation. Additionally, the manual nature of these processes leads to inefficiencies in departments like shipping and finance, where hours are spent preparing shipments or generating reports.

According to Oxford Economics, the best solution to this common challenge is ""having a single source of truth - a reality made possible with well-integrated data and driven by cloud ERP.""

With cloud ERP and one source of the truth across the company, companies can quickly adjust and pivot their strategies, operations, and processes based on new information or shifting priorities. With the addition of embedded AI and automation capabilities, they can quickly respond to customer demands and make informed decisions about production capabilities.

For example, a cloud-based ERP system can streamline the process of receiving and shipping orders to multiple locations, as well as automate batch goods shipping. Additionally, label generation and printing can be automated, saving time and reducing errors in the shipping process. These process improvements not only increase operational efficiency but also enhance the ability to scale - all without the need for manual intervention.

Beyond visibility and automation, midsize mill products manufacturers can drive revenue and margins with the integration of AI and industry best practices into cloud ERP. With Business AI, companies enhance various aspects of the customer experience, including:

In addition to improving operational efficiency and customer interactions, cloud ERP helps mitigate risk. By moving away from on-premise solutions, mill products manufacturers no longer need to worry about the costs and complexities of software upgrades and security vulnerabilities. Instead, cloud providers manage system updates and ensure data security, allowing companies to trust that their core systems will remain operational even during updates.

Adopting cloud-based ERP with embedded AI is the catalyst midsize mill products manufacturers have been demanding to fuel a meaningful growth trajectory. By overcoming the limitations of their legacy IT infrastructure, businesses can innovate, scale efficiently, and remain resilient in the face of industry challenges - achieving continuous growth without the disruptive risks of traditional approaches."
California GOP pushes back on bill that would give unemployment benefits to illegal immigrants,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/california-gop-pushes-back-bill-would-give-unemployment-benefits-illegal-immigrants,2024-09-17T01:40:14Z,"Fox News senior national correspondent William La Jeunesse has the latest on the home loan assistance proposal on 'Special Report.'

California Democrats are working to advance another bill aimed at providing benefits to illegal immigrants, but Republican lawmakers are pushing to block the new bill.

""It's insulting that California Democrats are even considering expanding unemployment benefits to illegal immigrants,"" Senate Majority Leader Brian Jones said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""Under the Newsom administration, the unemployment insurance fund is already broke with a $20 BILLION deficit. We cannot afford to expand benefits to those here illegally.""

In a letter to Gov. Gavin Newsom, Jones explained that the Employment Development Department (EDD) is still recovering from its shortcomings in managing the overwhelming demand for benefits following the COVID-19 shutdowns.

SB 227, introduced by Democratic Senator María Elena Durazo, would require the EDD to develop a detailed plan to establish a permanent Excluded Workers Program to provide cash assistance that resembles unemployment insurance benefits to unemployed workers who are ineligible for unemployment insurance due to their immigration status.

NEWSOM VETOES CONTROVERSIAL BILL THAT WOULD HAVE GIVEN HOUSING LOANS TO ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS

Jones mentioned that not only is the EDD still recovering from COVID-19, they are also dealing with its failure to prevent tens of billions of dollars in fraudulent unemployment claims.

""Until the EDD demonstrates it has effective systems and procedures to ensure timely benefits and prevent fraud, it should not be tasked with new responsibilities and costs,"" Jones continued.

Jones also stated that enacting this bill would impose additional demands and expenses on the EDD, divert resources away from implementing essential reforms, and further plunge the state into undermining federal immigration laws.

GOV. NEWSOM SIGNS BILL TO RESUME HARSH PENALTIES FOR SMASH-AND-GRAB ROBBERIES IN CALIFORNIA

""This radical proposal sends a dangerous message: come to California and get free money for not working. As California goes, so goes the rest of the nation."" Jones said. ""Americans should be very concerned about a Harris-Waltz Administration taking this policy nationwide.""

California Assemblyman James Gallagher also echoed Jones and said small businesses are suffering due to the mismanagement of funds.

""Newsom is already jacking up taxes on small businesses to pay off the debt he rang up with his mismanagement of our unemployment system during COVID,"" Gallagher said. ""Democrats plan to open up the benefits to illegal immigrants is only going to invite more fraud and waste more money.""

CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN LAWMAKER REACTS TO 'CRAZY' BILL THAT WOULD GIVE UNDOCUMENTED FIRST-TIME HOMEBUYERS MONEY

""Wouldn't it be great if Democrats focused as much on bringing down our highest-in-the-nation unemployment rate as they do on pushing new giveaways to illegal immigrants?""

Gov. Newsom's office told Fox News Digital that the measure will be evaluated on its merits and that the deadline to sign or veto legislation on the Governor's desk is September 30.

This is the second bill the senate has introduced that would provide benefits for illegal immigrants.

Last month, the California legislature advanced AB 1840, known as the ""California Dream for All"" loan program, which would have given illegal immigrants up to $150,000 in first-time homeownership loans -- a bill that if signed into law would have given first-time homebuyers up to 20% of a home's value or up to $150,000 as down payment assistance.

""This bill seeks to prohibit the disqualification of applicants from one of California Housing Finance Agency's (CalHFA) home purchase assistance programs based solely on their immigration status. Given the finite funding available for CalHFA programs, expanding program eligibility must be carefully considered within the broader context of the annual state budget to ensure we manage our resources effectively,"" Newsom said in the veto letter.

""For this reason, I am unable to sign this bill.""

"As Fed Readies Potential Rate Cut, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon Warns Of 'Stagflation'",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/09/16/as-fed-readies-potential-rate-cut-jpmorgan-ceo-jamie-dimon-warns-of-stagflation/,2024-09-16T16:38:17Z,"While the first interest rate adjustment is expected to take place at the Federal Reserve's upcoming meeting this week, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said that the United States economy is not ""out of the woods"" yet.

""I would say the worst outcome is stagflation -- recession, higher inflation,"" Dimon said at a Council of Institutional Investors conference in Brooklyn on Tuesday. ""And by the way, I wouldn't take it off the table.""

Inflation in the U.S. appears to be cooling, offering a glimmer of hope for consumers and the Fed. Recent data shows that consumer prices have reached their lowest 12-month inflation rate since February 2021, signaling a significant retreat from its alarming peak -- 9.1% -- observed in June 2022 .

Additionally, wholesale price measures suggest that pipeline price increases are largely under control, which indicates that inflationary pressures in the supply chain are easing.

The focus now shifts to how forcefully the Fed should respond. If the central bank is too aggressive, and the U.S. commits to plans of higher deficits and increased infrastructure spending, Dimon predicts it will have an adverse effect on an already strained economy, resulting from the Fed's heightened interest rates.

""They're all inflationary, basically in the short run, the next couple of years,"" he stated. ""So, it's hard to look at [it] and say, 'Well, no, we're out of the woods.' I don't think so.""

Claudia Sahm, who previously worked as a Fed economist and now serves as the chief economist at New Century Advisors, suggests that initiating a half-percentage-point cut in interest rates could help prevent further deterioration in the job market. This approach might establish a minimum threshold to safeguard against potential employment declines, according to Sahm.

""The labor market [since] last July has gotten weaker,"" she said in a CNBC interview on Friday. ""So there's an aspect of just recalibrating. We got some more information. [Fed officials] need to kind of clean it up, do a 50-basis-point cut and then be ready to do more.""

Dimon's stagflation concerns likely stems from its potential to create a prolonged period of economic hardship that is difficult to resolve through conventional monetary and fiscal policies.

The term ""stagflation"" refers to an environment in which persistently high inflation coincides with an economic downturn and consistently elevated unemployment levels.

Economists consider stagflation -- last seen in the U.S. in the 1970s -- to be worse than a recession, as it can severely impact the stock market, 401(k) plans and other retirement savings.

In 2022, former Fed chairman Ben Bernanke also warned that the U.S. was on the path to stagflation.

""Even under the benign scenario, we should have a slowing economy,"" Bernanke told the New York Times. ""And inflation's still too high, but coming down. So, there should be a period in the next year or two where growth is low, unemployment is at least up a little bit and inflation is still high. So, you could call that stagflation.""

In a stagflationary environment, the economy stagnates while prices continue to rise, creating a difficult situation for consumers, businesses and investors alike.

It has the potential to hamper economic growth while eroding purchasing power. As prices increase, consumers' ability to buy goods and services diminishes, leading to reduced spending and economic activity. This, in turn, can further dampen the economy, creating a vicious cycle.

Companies could struggle with higher input costs and reduced consumer spending, which would lead to lower profits and declining stock price

In the job market, stagflation can be particularly harmful. High unemployment would persist due to the stagnant economy, yet workers would be facing rising living costs, making it increasingly difficult for them to make ends meet.

Businesses may struggle to expand or hire new employees due to increased costs and reduced consumer demand, further exacerbating unemployment issues.

Traditional tools used to combat economic downturns, such as lowering interest rates, may be less effective or even counterproductive in a stagflationary environment, as they could further fuel inflation.

The Fed will be meeting September 17 to September 18, and an announcement of at least a 25-basis-point cut to interest rates is anticipated Wednesday. Sahm, as well as Wall Street traders, project that a 50-basis-point cut is also on the table."

ast week was quite a week! I was thrilled to host this year's Forbes Future of Work Summit on Thursday -- perhaps our best one yet. Did you miss joining us online or in person? Forbes' Maria Gracia Santillana Linares was onsite with a live blog, capturing everything from Lattice's Sarah Franklin opening up about leading the human resources platform to an in-depth and thought-provoking discussion with IBM's Nickle LaMoreaux, LinkedIn's Aneesh Raman and Deloitte's Anthony Stephan about AI -- and what it all means for humans, soft skills and work.

I'll have more to recap soon, and we'll post video from the event that will be available for Forbes members as soon as it's available. One thing that was clear from this year's summit: The two issues chief human resources officers are most focused on right now are the impact of AI on individual jobs, workforces and even humans at large -- and how to become more of a skills-based organization. On the latter issue, we spoke exclusively with Walmart's chief people officer, Donna Morris, about a new project they're working on with other large companies about creating a common skills ""taxonomy"" -- see more details below. Hope it's a great week.

Thousands of Boeing's unionized factory workers voted to go on strike Thursday night, a major blow to the plane maker, which is already facing scrutiny over the safety of its aircraft. The workers rejected a tentative deal that included 25% raises over four years and lower healthcare costs, Siladitya Ray reported. After announcing the result of the vote, District 751 IAM President Jon Holden said: ""This is about respect, this is about the past, and this is about fighting for our future.""

Former President Donald Trump said Thursday he intends to remove federal taxes from overtime pay, marking his latest proposal this presidential campaign to significantly alter federal tax policy. Trump did not provide further details on the proposal, Antonio Pequeño IV reported. The Republican candidate made the new proposal after repeating plans he announced earlier this summer to exempt tip and Social Security income from federal taxes. Missed the debate last Tuesday? Forbes' Derek Saul laid out the facts after Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris sparred about jobs.

The Associated Press took a deep dive into what AI's impact on jobs could really be, exploring the shifting assessment that the more likely outcome will be changing and reshaping many jobs, but not mass unemployment. The story spotlights companies like Alorica, which is using AI to help customer service agents interpret more languages, and IKEA, which is using a customer-service chatbot to handle simple inquiries and retrained 8,500 customer-service workers to advise on interior design and field more complicated calls.

At the Forbes Power Women's Summit, I had the opportunity to talk with Handshake chief talent engagement officer Valerie Capers Workman and Kenvue chief people officer Luani Alvarado about culture, the future of work, and well-being. My favorite quotes of the session came from Workman, who also spoke at 2023's Future of Work Summit: ""Flexibility is about productivity. If you want to get more out of your workforce, if you want them to work harder, take things off the table,"" she said. I also loved this insight about Gen Z: ""This is a post-pandemic generation. They have seen layoffs. They have seen parents at challenging times,"" Workman told the crowd. ""Contrary to what everyone believes about Gen Z, they want stability.""

Meanwhile, Forbes' Maggie McGrath had a big week, from helping host the Power Women's Summit -- her conversation with Lumen CEO Kate Johnson was a highlight -- to this daily cover story about venture capitalists Jenny Abramson and Heidi Patel, who have signed up investors such as Melinda French Gates and UBS for their third Rethink Impact fund dedicated to female CEOs. The buildout comes at a time when targeted funds have come under scrutiny -- in June, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit issued a preliminary injunction blocking the Fearless Fund from awarding grants exclusively to Black women entrepreneurs.

There's been a lot of talk from business leaders about skills-based organizations. Now, some of them want to find a common language.

Walmart chief people officer Donna Morris plans to share Monday that not only do more than 75% of its U.S. roles no longer require a degree -- the retailer announced a year ago it would remove degrees from most job requirements -- but the company has also started a project with about a dozen other large corporations to describe skills in a common fashion. By creating what she calls a ""shared skills taxonomy,"" the goal is to make those skills more transferable for workers without degrees, help training providers better understand what's needed and assist employers with recognizing qualified candidates.

The group of companies, Morris told Forbes in an exclusive interview ahead of the Blackstone Career Pathways Summit in New York Monday, includes names such as Bank of America, Verizon and Microsoft -- in addition to Walmart and Blackstone -- that were present at an event in April that Walmart convened.

""Our desire over time is to develop a skills vocabulary that can be leveraged across industries, across companies,"" Morris told Forbes. The classification system would be open source and available to other employers, Morris says, and they hope to build it out over the next year.

When someone goes to college, the degree they receive validates their course of study, Morris says. But as more organizations eliminate degrees from job descriptions -- only about 40,000 of Walmart's 1.6 million U.S. employees are in jobs that now require diplomas, Morris says -- there need to be more ways to validate those skills. ""We're going to accredit these skills by a third party to say these are really the skills that are required,"" she told Forbes. ""Eventually what we want to do is build a way to assess individuals against those skills.""

Currently, for instance, one company might say that to be a store manager, a worker needs skills such as inventory management, leadership, merchandising and teaching. But a different company might say store managers need skills such as stock management, people management, display setup and coaching, even if they are referring to the same skills.

Matt Sigelman, president of the nonprofit research organization Burning Glass Institute, which is working with the companies to pull data both from job descriptions and resumes to help create the taxonomy, says ""I would think about this project as potentially trying to create a Rosetta Stone."" He continued the analogy saying ""we're not going to get everyone to speak Esperanto [an artificial, constructed language designed to be universal], but what we can do is create a translation mechanism on the back end.""

Sigelman says the move is important because similar jobs can be described differently, impeding applicants from getting the necessary keywords on their resumes, but also because skills are quickly evolving. He gives the example of a job like purchasing managers, which have traditionally been a cross between clerical work and negotiating prowess. After the pandemic's disruption, it's fast becoming a job that's more about forecasting and supply chain management, and companies that want the newer skills may not find them without the right terminology. ""There's a huge problem that both sides have, of being able to distinguish between the signal and noise.""

Major indices posted strong gains last week with the S&P 500 up 4%. The Nasdaq Composite was higher by nearly 6%. Meantime, the Russell 2000 and Dow Jones Industrial Average were higher by almost 4% and 2.5%, respectively. This week, the market is focused on one thing and one thing only, Wednesday's Federal Reserve Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting.

If you recall from the last FOMC meeting, it was a forgone conclusion for a long time in advance of that meeting that rates would not be cut. This meeting is anything but certain. Heading into the week, the CME Fed Watch Tool has been bouncing around. Last week, the probability of a half-point cut was less than 20%. That has since shifted dramatically. In premarket trading, the chances of a half-point cut stand at 59%.

There are arguments on both sides for how big a cut we need, or if we even need a cut at all. While the economy has certainly cooled from earlier in the year, it doesn't appear to be at risk of a recession. Unemployment is still in the 4% range despite a slowdown in new jobs. Prices have largely stabilized; however, both the Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) showed a slight uptick last week. Last quarter's earnings were also strong and outlooks for the rest of the year didn't change much. On the other hand, other indicators, such as oil prices, have fallen sharply of late as a global slowdown could be a concern.

While I'm not a member of the Fed, my preference would be to see a quarter point cut this week. My concern with a half point cut is that it sends the message the Fed is very concerned about a potential recession. That is a risky message to send markets as it could be interpreted as the Fed being out in front of things, which could be good for stocks, or that the economy is about to take a fall, which would likely be bad for stocks. However, cutting rates now by just a quarter-point doesn't mean the Fed can't cut rates again at their next meeting, or even between meetings if necessary. It would also be unusual for Powell to make such a big move in light of how he's operated historically.

Some stocks I'm watching today include Boeing, Starbucks, Disney, Uber and Alphabet. Starting with Boeing, there are concerns the company, which is already dealing with a strike by machinists, is also facing a cash crunch. What you pay for a cup of coffee at Starbucks may increase as coffee futures have been rising due to a weak coffee bean harvest. Over the weekend, Disney and DirectTV reached an agreement and DirectTV subscribers will not need to worry about watching tonight's Monday Night Football game. Also, Uber is expanding their agreement with Waymo which could lead to more self-driving cars making their way to a city near you. Finally, there is Alphabet.

The Justice Department began their second antitrust lawsuit case against Alphabet. Last month, the company lost a case regarding illegal practices to maintain its dominance in search. That ruling could potentially lead to the company being forced to separate its Android and Chrome platforms from its search business, according to The Wall Street Journal. The current lawsuit centers on Google's ad-tech business. Shares of Alphabet are down around 14% since the beginning of the quarter. This is one I'm monitoring as a breakup could set a precedent for other companies.

For today, I am keeping my eye on the U.S. dollar which is at its lowest level in more than eight months. That is likely a reflection of the impending interest rate cut. Lower rates would result in a cheaper dollar. As for the rest of the market, I expect little sustained directional movement. Markets are waiting on a decision from the Fed and given the uncertainty over the rate cut size, I don't think traders want to make commitments to anything prior to Wednesday afternoon. As always, I would stick with your investment objectives and long-term goals."
Vulnerable House Dem chalks up GOP 'fearmongering' as 'number one' public safety issue with border crisis,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vulnerable-house-dem-chalks-up-gop-fearmongering-number-one-public-safety-border-crisis,2024-09-16T12:04:00Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A Democratic congressman in a tight re-election race in New York took part in a Zoom town hall where he said ""the impacts"" of Republican ""fearmongering"" is ""number one"" when it comes to the border and public safety.

""Last year I think all these districts lost on the crime issue and now, is crime still a big issue that you are fighting there? You said it was crime, economy, and border,"" Democratic Rep. Pat Ryan was asked in a Zoom call with Democrat activists from the New York Buddy Group last week. ""So, the crime issue is BS too. So is that, but is that still strong?""

Ryan, who responded without challenging the premise that the ""crime issue is BS"" said, ""Yeah, I'd say that, you know, in our polling the, 'the border' and immigration, which I think is a broad category for this kind of like public safety fearmongering. The impacts of the fearmongering that Republicans have been doing, that is number one.""

""Economy is a close second, and specifically the cost, not like the macro, what's the GDP, what's unemployment, but the cost of living, housing, groceries, and healthcare are the three,"" Ryan said. ""We actually polled specific subcategories of costs that people are experiencing. So the way I see it as setting up message wise, Republicans are going to really continue to focus on fear, crime, border where they are more trusted right now.""

DEMS RUN ON BORDER BILL REPUBLICANS SAY 'WAS NEVER DESIGNED TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM'

""We, of course, are going to continue to focus rightly on abortion rights, reproductive freedom where we're way more trusted,"" Ryan continued. ""That middle lane is the economy and what we've done and will do more importantly to lower costs on housing, healthcare, groceries, gas, utilities, which we have a track record, we have plans, it's just about communicating those and I think we're making good headway there especially on our campaign.""

Ryan is running for re-election in New York's 18th Congressional District against Republican Alison Esposito in a race that the National Republican Congressional Committee (NRCC) has identified as one of its top 40 targets in November.

""Pat Ryan made Ulster County a sanctuary county and then took that same mentality to Washington where he pretends to be a moderate on television, but then votes like an extremist. He does not care about the important issues facing NY-18, like the ongoing migrant crisis that is harming New Yorkers every day,"" NRCC spokeswoman Savannah Viar told Fox News Digital in a statement.

Ryan spokesperson Sam Silverman, in a statement to Fox News Digital, said, ""Congressman Ryan served 27 months in combat - he knows what it means to secure a border. That's why he's been one of the few Democrats to consistently and aggressively push President Biden to restore order at the border. But let's be clear - there's a massive difference between working in good-faith for a bipartisan solution to secure our border and bizarre far-right fearmongering like lying about migrants eating people's pets.""

""The truth is that Congressman Ryan has the strongest record on border security in this race,"" Silverman continued. ""Pat led a bipartisan effort with Congressmen Lawler and Molinaro calling on President Biden to declare a state of emergency in New York in response to the migrant crisis, was one of only 15 Democrats to demand President Biden take executive action to restore order at the border and has gotten multiple pieces of border legislation signed into law, including the 'Securing America's Borders Against Fentanyl Act' and the 'Stop Chinese Fentanyl Act.'""

Silverman added that ""unfortunately"" this is ""an uncomfortable reality for Alison Esposito, who opposed the strongest border security legislation in decades, so she's desperately searching for any opportunity to score cheap political points to salvage her failing campaign. Alison can spend her time politicizing the border; Pat is doing the actual work to fix it.""

Esposito has labeled Ryan ""Sanctuary Pat"" while criticizing him for his immigration policies focusing on what most polls say is the second most important issue, behind the economy, for voters in November.

HARRIS DOUBLES DOWN ON SUPPORT FOR LEFT-WING BENEFIT FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS: 'SMART SOLUTIONS'

""Pat Ryan can try to run from his record on sanctuary and open border policies, but Hudson Valley residents know the truth,"" a spokesperson for the Esposito campaign told Fox News Digital. ""In 2019, he declared Ulster County a sanctuary county, prohibiting cooperation with federal agencies. His record speaks for itself: he opposed H.R. 2 in May 2023, which aimed to secure the border; he voted against the Laken Riley Act; and he supports allowing illegal migrants to vote in our elections.""

""If Pat Ryan were serious about border security, he would have taken action long ago -- now, we're nearly 50 days from Election Day. Ryan's recent comments are a slap in the face to the millions of Americans affected by the Biden-Harris border crisis. From the fentanyl flooding our borders to the countless victims of crimes committed by illegal migrants, this crisis is not fear mongering, and it is no joke.""

The Cook Political Report ranks the race in NY-18 as ""Lean Democrat."""
Why The 'Broke Millennial' Stereotype Is Wrong,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/savings/broke-millennial-myths-debunked/,2024-09-16T11:03:40Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

Millennials have spent the majority of their adult lives haunted by the specter that they're doing worse than their parents. If true, this would be a tragic result for the more than 72 million Americans born between 1981 and 1996.

Thankfully, it's not.

While Millennials have endured their fair share of economic turbulence and hardships, including graduating into the worst economy since the Great Depression, they have managed to endure, and even prosper, especially in recent times.

It's time to shed this misbegotten Millennial stereotype.

The idea that Millennials are doing well might be surprising to you if you were born in 1988.

These now 36-year-olds had the misfortune of entering the workforce in 2009, as the unemployment rate was flirting with 10%, the stock market had just bottomed out and the housing sector was still reeling from its bubble bursting.

A few years into their career, they were still struggling.

In 2013, median income was a little more than $68,000 (in 2023 dollars) for those households helmed by someone between 25 and 34, per the Census. That was about $10,000 less (accounting for inflation) than a similar family in 2000.

But as the economy began to recover through the latter part of the decade, so did their paychecks.

Those between the age of 25 and 34 earned an average of $84,600 in 2023, while those between 35 and 44 took in nearly $101,000; both figures far outstripped what earlier generations earned at similar ages, even adjusting for inflation.

In the aftermath of the Great Recession, Millennials made less than earlier generations at a similar age. However, as the economy has recovered, so too have millennial earnings, so much so that they even out earn their parents. It's worth remembering, too, that earlier generations struggled with recessions in the early 1990s and 2000s.

Things got off to a rocky start for Millennials thanks to an abysmal housing market that cratered at the end of the 2000s and took years to recover. For instance, the median home sales price peaked at $257,400 in the beginning of 2007 and then didn't reach that level again until six years later.

Given the slowly convalescing labor market, it's not surprising that Millennials fell behind. For instance, the median net worth of households led by someone under 35 was just $13,000 in 2013, per the Federal Reserve, compared to $22,000 in 2004. Millennials were poorer than earlier generations at a similar age.

With time, though, Millennials' balance sheets improved dramatically.

Take housing.

Data from the Atlanta Fed Home Ownership Affordability Monitor showed that thanks to low interest rates and a growing economy, home prices were basically affordable, if not especially so, for most of the time between 2010 and 2020.

Moreover, the stock market has been on a tear since 2009, only letting up for a brief period during 2022. The S&P 500, for instance, has delivered an average annualized return of 11.80% over the past 15 years, according to Morningstar, boosting 401(k) balances.

The result is that Millennials (both older and younger) have more assets than their parents at a similar age.

Millennials, who comprise the largest share of homebuyers, have a higher net worth than earlier generations at a similar age as home prices, and the stock market, soared for much of the past 15 years. Even after starting from behind, a 2024 report by the St. Louis Fed found that Millennial wealth was ""37% above expectations"" based on the experiences of previous generations.

Millennials have had to deal with college costs, and subsequent debt, in a way that their parents just didn't.

The average yearly all-in cost for all 4-year institutions in 1980 was a little more than $12,200 (in 2022-2023 dollars), per the National Center for Educational Statistics, compared to about $29,200 in 2010.

In fact, it was about 240% (in constant dollars) more expensive to graduate from a four-year college in 2013 ($120,400) as it was to do so 30 years earlier ($50,400).

And millennials have the debt to show for it.

The average cumulative debt in the 2011-2012 school year for undergraduate borrowers at four-year institutions was about $33,000 (in 2022 dollars), according to the College Board, while 60% of graduates took out loans to pay for their college.

While this debt is real, it's manageable for most millennials. Only 7% of those with a college degree said they're behind on their student loan payments in the 2024 Federal Reserve Report on Economic Well-Being.

No one wants to start off their career with a big IOU, but conventional wisdom says that you should only borrow as much as you expect to earn once you enter the workforce. The median salary for those between 15 and 24 in 2023, per the Census, was $48,680, much more than the typical amount borrowed.

While most millennials had to take on debt to finance their education, the cost to do so has been reasonable for most borrowers. This is especially true given the low interest rates at the time the debt was taken on, and the fact that those with a college degree earn more and have better employment prospects. Moreover, the federal government allowed federal student loan borrowers to pause payments interest-free for more than three years between 2020 and 2023, freeing up borrowers to save their payments or spend them elsewhere.

There are, of course, millennials who are struggling.

It's not difficult to imagine that our person born in 1988 struggled to find gainful, rewarding employment for years after. Perhaps they missed out on affordable real estate prices in the latter half of the 2010s because they hadn't yet had time to build up savings for a down payment.

Perhaps they had to go to graduate school, taking on yet more debt, and had only established themselves in their career when the pandemic struck and they were laid off.

They've been able to scrape by with the help of friends and family, as well as plush Covid-era benefits, their 401(k) is negligible because they've never been at a job long enough to meaningfully save.

This story, or at least parts of it, isn't uncommon.

But it's not the experience of the typical Millennial who has seen their wages and net worth spike as the economy fully recovered from the Great Recession.

The typical Millennial enjoys higher wages, and a bigger net worth, than their parents did at a similar age.

Like generations before, Millennials have struggled through tough times. But they're no longer behind, and are instead, prospering."
Profit From The Fed's Next Move?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/15/profit-from-the-feds-next-move/,2024-09-16T03:19:00Z,"We believe Chair Powell and the Federal Reserve's next move will not be pivotal. There is an opportunity to step back, see the bigger picture -- and potentially take advantage of that.

Specifically, the Fed's upcoming move from the two-day Sep 17th and 18th, 2024 meeting, could go one of three ways.

[1] Reduce rates by 25 bps, with a weak statement about future cuts

[2] Reduce rates by 25 bps, with a strong statement about more cuts to come

[3] Reduce rates by 50 bps

Option 1 is a less likely scenario right now. Option 2 and 3 will be cheered -- in spirit and action.

Markets won't respond well to Option 1

We'll see a moderate drop in S&P and other major indices, likely less than or around 5% levels, and hopefully not more than 10% levels -- and very unlikely a market crash. However, this can easily deepen in the near-term if additional weaker jobs reports show up, or companies report weak Q3 earnings in October -- especially if, in addition, inflation continues to show upward bias. In either case, we believe such downswings, if they happen, present a buying opportunity (how low can stocks and ETFs/indices go -- from SPY vs. AAPL, to pharma giant Merck, which stocks dropped most during past market crashes?). At the least, we believe investors will be better off not being too reactive.

Why is that?

Here's the thing. Irrespective of what the Fed does as part of their next move, there is little doubt about one thing: this is a data-driven Fed. If they make a smaller 25 bps cut to start, and unemployment data continues to show deterioration, they'll make bigger moves. This Fed has managed inflation, no, a monstrous 8%+ inflation, and restored price stability to 2-3% levels, without killing the job market. They did it extremely well. The Fed has ""0"" interest in messing with the success they've seen. Chair Powell knows well, now -- at this juncture -- the risk to job growth and unemployment is real, the risk has shifted -- it is no longer weighted towards a runaway-inflation, instead unemployment growth is the risk. He said as much in the last meeting.

Point is -- even if the first move is a 25 bps cut, if, and as more data comes in, the Fed will act with 50 bps cuts, and maybe larger cuts. The Fed will do whatever is needed to ensure a soft-landing.

The Fed's on your side. Period. If you agree, then isn't this, and more so if there is a drop in markets, the time to buy?

So now is the time for investors -- to invest in technology, infrastructure, better health outcomes -- better protection and preparation for the next Covid? Sure, invest in Nvidia, other AI stocks -- SMCI (what's a better AI stock SMCI or Nvidia?), invest in Lilly's weight loss drug's success, and DNA/CRISPR tech, Moderna, the new infrastructure projects, Google and Waymo's self-driving efforts, and GE, and everything in the middle? And if you don't like the rollercoaster, invest in the S&P 500, or, learn how the select 30 stocks that make up Trefis High Quality portfolio strategy has outperformed the S&P 500 -- consistently. HQ has seen >80% return since its Sep 2020 inception, Hint: it's simple, and right there in the HQ strategy's performance metrics -- not just size, but defensible revenue growth, and margins, but companies with strong balance sheets, and other quality criteria.

So, is anything to be feared at this time? While in the medium-to-long term things should do well, near-term volatility is likely to persist. Right now, we see this mostly due to the geopolitical unrest, the middle-eastern Gaza conflict, Ukraine/Russia war, and their potential for accompanying destruction. Why? Well, for one, wars are like that. They're an extreme of human expression -- creates more opportunity for results in the long tail. By definition, more volatility, less control, more uncertainty -- more risk. If that's how you see risk. Let's not forget, there is an upside as those conflicts wane and normalcy returns. Not just a psychological upside, but a real flow of goods and services as supply chains become less risky, shorter paths to trade, reliability, and trust develop.

Though it's good to be hopeful, the overhang from wars and conflict isn't going away, not anytime soon. On the flip-side, markets seem to have settled-in with these conflicts. And things can get better.

The other risk -- and always is -- is default on loans. All market crashes happen because someone can't pay back their loans (5 largest market crashes compared). For one, commercial real estate has been suffering for a while, Covid's work-from-home gift was a big curse for the Retail and Office real-estate parts (big variety in real-estate sector). In addition to an altered demand landscape, commercial real-estate loans maturing near-term continue to face high rates, and tough refinancing conditions. Things could break, though that hasn't happened -- and with Fed rates finally on the downtrend, it's less likely. Finally, there's consumer defaults -- credit card, auto loans -- especially credit card loans. That makes the financial sector -- banks like JPM, Citi, and BofA, with large credit card books, vulnerable (How low can JPM stock go in a market crash?). Again, we see this risk only as a transient -- because we believe the Fed will do whatever it takes to create a soft-landing.

There is something else. With rates as high as they are -- the Fed has even more power. There is a lot of room to cut rates, and release more liquidity if things go south. They can do a 100 bps cut. Power to release more money if the economy needs a shot for some reason, for any reason.

We believe, on balance, though the short term is likely to be volatile - there is a higher chance of more favorable market conditions in the medium term, and that's good for investors.

We've developed Trefis strategies to take advantage of such opportunities, while carefully managing risk in developing our Trefis portfolio strategies."
Fed Rate Cut This Week: How Deep?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/09/15/fed-rate-cut-this-week-how-deep/,2024-09-15T11:08:10Z,"After a rough previous week for the stocks and the Magnificent 7, a positive update from NVIDIA regarding their next-generation artificial intelligence chip provides some positive mojo. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), were sharply higher on the week and are about 9% below their early July highs. Year-to-date, the Magnificent 7 dominated all others and helped drive the S&P 500 returns well above the gains from the smaller capitalization stocks.

This week will be dominated by the decision from the Federal Reserve on Wednesday, September 18. While a rate cut is a virtual certainty, the magnitude of the cut and its possible impact are still uncertain.

Futures pricing assumes a cut to short-term interest rates of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the September meeting and a 50% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut.

The U.S. economy remains resilient, bolstering the argument for a smaller or no cut. The Atlanta Fed's estimate of third-quarter GDP is 2.5%.

On the other side of the coin, the job market has softened. While the unemployment rate remains low on an absolute basis, it has risen off the lows enough to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. There are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle.

Despite the report being released with a significant lag, the U.S. job openings (JOLTS) data can help gauge the tightness or softness of the labor market. Job openings have fallen precipitously and have reached levels more consistent with a normalized market. One caution in interpreting this data is that it is hard to know how many open positions are phantom jobs with no real opportunity for employment. Still, one should assume that the actual number of openings is lower than the headline.

Last week, the August consumer inflation (CPI) report reflected a 2.5% year-over-year growth rate, which was as expected and below July's 2.9%. The annualized growth rate of the last three months moved slightly higher but showed a benign short-term inflation trend at 1.2%.

The core CPI, which excludes food and energy costs, was as expected at 3.2% year-over-year and unchanged from the previous month. Primarily driven by housing costs, the month-over-month core reading was higher than expected, and the annualized growth rate of the last three months rose to 2.4%. This unanticipated firming in core and producer prices (PPI) last week could remind the Fed that inflation pressures remain, making a 25 basis point cut this week's most likely course of action.

The real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate illustrates that the Fed's monetary policy is very restrictive. Though the Fed has not changed short-term interest rates since July 2023, monetary policy has become more stringent as the inflation rate falls. Looking back on the Fed's last successful soft landing of the economy in 1995, the real Fed Funds rate was similar to current levels before rate cuts began.

One could argue that the lower interest rate sensitivity of the economy following the ultra-low yields in the wake of COVID and the elevated real Fed Funds rate level should favor a 50 (0.50%) basis point cut to increase the odds of a positive outcome.

While in seven of the last nine easing cycles, the economy was either in recession when the rate cuts began or ended up in recession, stocks have usually been higher in the twelve months after the cuts started, as discussed in depth last week.

Separately, defensive stocks, less impacted by the economy, have often outperformed the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks during these easing cycles since they tend to correspond with periods of economic uncertainty or eventual contraction.

Based on market expectations and current economic data, the base case should be a soft landing. This COVID-related economic cycle is unlike any other. Still, success in avoiding a recession is no sure thing, especially given the lessons of history. If a recession does occur, investors should expect price declines for stocks and other risk assets since earnings estimates and current valuation point to a low probability of recession being priced in currently. Since the eventual outcome remains unknown, owning high-quality and less economically sensitive stocks alongside technology and cyclical companies should add some stability to portfolios if the economy and earnings falter. With bond yields back to offering a reasonable return over expected inflation, history would indicate that high-quality bonds should provide some cushion in an economic downturn.

At the Federal Reserve meeting on Wednesday, investors should expect a 25 basis point cut to short-term interest rates. The Fed's economic projections and Chair Powell's comments will be scrutinized for clues as to the future path of cuts. A half percentage point cut remains well within the range of possibilities due to solid arguments in favor. Still, the relative resilience of the economy and the recent core inflation data make it less likely. Given the atypical economic cycle associated with COVID and the Fed easing this tight monetary policy in advance of economic weakness, the odds of avoiding a recession should be above what history might indicate."
How do you help young Afghan refugees heal? A new program in Maine offers a way,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/09/14/nx-s1-5107707/afghan-refugees-afghanistan-mental-health-support-maine,2024-09-15T11:04:40Z,"Khadija Rahmani says her son, Mujib Ur Rahman, 12, looks forward to visits from Shabana Siddiqui, a health educator who left Afghanistan in 2022. The Rahmani family arrived in the U.S. in January and settled in Maine. Raquel C. Zaldívar/New England News Collaborative hide caption

It's midafternoon, and Shabana Siddiqui has just hopped into an Uber.

Siddiqui, who is from Afghanistan, moved to the United States with her husband in 2022, and for the past couple of years, she's worked in Maine with a project helping other Afghan refugee families with children.

On this day, Siddiqui is visiting a family she's been working with for a few months. The parents moved to the U.S. in January with their two youngest sons, ages 19 and 12.

The family spent more than two years living in fear under the Taliban. ""When the government collapsed and the Taliban took over, they were really scared for their lives,"" explains Siddiqui.

But since their arrival in Lewiston, the 12-year-old boy has struggled with symptoms of anxiety and post-traumatic stress, says Siddiqui.

""One day he was at school and he got pushed by a bully,"" she says. ""It triggered him so much that he started crying and he even had a panic attack. And he called his mom and he was like, 'Mom, can you come pick me up? I cannot breathe.'""

Research shows that when people fleeing violence and persecution resettle in a new country as refugees, the toll of the trauma they've been through can haunt them for a long time. Children are especially vulnerable. The toxic mix of past traumas and the stresses of resettlement puts such kids at a significantly higher risk of long term mental health challenges, researchers say.

""We know from years of research that children exposed to violence, separation and loss due to armed conflict and forced migration have elevated risks for problems with depression, anxiety, traumatic stress reactions,"" says Theresa Betancourt, director of the research program on children and adversity at Boston College.

Studies have shown that rates of depression among refugee and asylum-seeking children range from 10% to 33%. and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) rates range from 19% to 53%. Anxiety disorders are also prevalent with rates ranging from 9% to 32%.

Parents or primary caregivers can buffer against these long-term mental health consequences, but refugee parents are often struggling with their own mental health and hesitant to seek care, says Betancourt.

""Parents may feel stigma in mentioning their own struggles with problems like depression or anxiety,"" she says. ""And they may be concerned about discussing their child's emotional behavioral problems, too.""

That's why Betancourt and her colleagues launched an effort to support refugee parents and children in the United States, as a way to prevent long term mental health and behavioral problems. It's an effort run jointly by Boston College and the local non-profit Maine Immigrant and Refugee Services in the Lewiston-Auburn area.

""We're really trying to work with the family a lot earlier with a prevention focus and a mental health promotion focus,"" says Betancourt.

Their approach employs people like Siddiqui who share the same language, culture and lived experience with newly arrived families. Siddiqui and her colleagues receive training to provide evidence-based emotional, social and practical support to parents and children. The organizers have used it successfully in resettled Somali Bantu and Bhutanese communities in Maine. Now, they have adapted that solution for recently resettled Afghan families in Maine and Michigan.

The Uber drops off Siddiqui on a wide, tree-lined street in Lewiston with big houses on either side. She walks up to a house and knocks on the front door. A lanky boy with big eyes and thick, black hair opens the door and greets Siddiqui in Dari, their shared language.

This is Mujib Ur Rahman, the 12-year-old Siddiqui told me about. His parents -- Khadija and Mohammad Rahmani -- are waiting upstairs, outside their first floor apartment. They greet her with smiles and an effusive welcome in Dari.

""You go there as a friend and you build [a] rapport, so they can easily share everything with you,"" Siddiqui says.

The Rahmanis welcome Siddiqui into their rental apartment. Khadija brings out a large silver platter filled with dried apricots and almonds, and two thermoses full of cardamom tea, before settling into the sofa next to Mujib and Shabana. Her husband, Mohammad, sits across from them on a chair.

The family is from Afghanistan's third largest city, Herat, where Mohammad owned a small grocery store. They still have a house in Herat with a big garden where they grew vegetables and fruit.

Mujib remembers spending most of his summer evenings doing the thing he loved most.

""After I came home from school, I would play with kites on the roof of my house,"" he says.

He particularly enjoyed kite fighting with his neighbors. It's a beloved tradition in Afghanistan and neighboring Pakistan and India, where people try to cut others' kite strings with their own and set others' kites free. (Although it's a bit controversial because the strings are sometimes coated with glass and other additives to sharpen them; the Taliban has banned the practice.)

""When they saw me flying kites, they would take down their kites,"" says Mujib, beaming as he brags about his kite-fighting skills. ""There was one who rivaled my skill and I could never free his kite. We were in competition.""

But life as Mujib knew it came to a halt in 2021, when the Taliban took control of the country.

""They did a lot of scary things right in front of people's eyes,"" he says, his voice getting softer, more hesitant as he remembers that time. ""For example, hitting and stabbing people with knives, arresting them. I thought they would come to my home and arrest me and beat me, too.""

His mom, Khadija, had been a well-known nurse and women's rights advocate in their community. Part of her job was to identify and advocate for girls and women who were forced into marriage or were victims of domestic violence. This work made her a target for the Taliban.

So Khadija and Mohammad moved to a relative's house along with their two younger sons, Mujib and the then 17-year-old Munib. The family stayed in hiding for two years.

""We didn't sleep all the time, we were scared,"" says Khadija. ""When there was any noise, we were thinking how to run from home. For example, if the Taliban came from this side, how could we jump over the wall and run?

Then, in 2023, the family received news that they could leave Afghanistan with her two youngest sons. Despite having to leave her mother, and two adult kids -- her oldest son and a daughter -- behind, Khadija feels grateful to be in the United States with Mohammad, Mujib and Munib.

""We thank God a thousand times that we can start our life anew here,"" she says.

But the chronic stress of the past few years has followed them here. ""My husband and I stay awake until 1:30, 2 or 3 o'clock at night,"" says Khadija, ""because I still have that trauma from the Taliban's regime in my brain.""

And 12-year-old Mujib has struggled the most. He is easily triggered by sudden noises, she says. ""He gets pale, and his breathing gets hard. He gets panicked and runs to get out. One time there was a knock on the door, and he started crying non-stop.""

""A lot of the responses that you see in a young boy like that, those are expectable when you've been through the sort of frightening, traumatic events that he's been through,"" says Betancourt.

Khadija's training and professional experience working with victims of domestic and sexual violence have helped her understand trauma reactions and identify them in her son.

But most refugee parents might not know or understand similar reactions in their children, says Betancourt. They might not understand that if their child is acting out or having trouble following their parents' directions, it may be related to their past trauma or current stress.

""And the child can feel quite alone in their experience,"" she says, which increases the risk of symptoms of mental illnesses like depression and anxiety.

Like many newly resettled refugee kids, Mujib has struggled at school.

""He'd say to me, 'Mother, I don't want to go to this school because everyone is bullying me, and I don't like this school. I don't understand their language,'"" says Khadija.

The language barrier is a big source of stress for Khadija and her husband, Mohammad, too. She wants to get certified to work as a nurse here, but she needs fluency in English first. She and Mohammad have been desperately looking for jobs, but most positions require some language proficiency.

""We have to learn the language because we have a hard time not knowing the language,"" says Khadija.

They are taking driving lessons, even though it may be a long time before they can afford to buy a car. For now, they depend on other people in the Afghan community to give them rides for everything from grocery shopping to health appointments to visits with others in their community.

These are common sources of stress among newly resettled refugees, says Siddiqui.

It can take a long time for refugees to find a job even if they're fluent in English, as Siddiqui was when she arrived.

""I applied for like three or four jobs at a time,"" she recalls. Nothing came through for a while.

""That takes a really big toll on your mental health,"" explains Siddiqui. ""I was so anxious. I was diagnosed with anxiety, because my mind was running 100 miles per hour just to get a job.""

It also took months for Siddiqui and her husband to find an apartment they could rent because they had no credit history; they lived with relatives while they looked for a place of their own.

All this stress, she says, takes a toll on families.

""I can even tell you from my own experience, that the lack of getting a job, or unemployment, really strains your relationship,"" says Siddiqui.

And strained relationships lead to family conflicts. There can sometimes be an elevated risk for violence within the home, says Betancourt, because parents are also struggling with their past traumas.

""We know this from military families, that when parents are exposed to significant violence in other settings, and they come back to rejoin their family environments,"" says Betancourt, ""we can see elevated problems with emotion regulation and sometimes more harsh disciplinary practices or harsh interactions between parents and children.""

She and her colleagues have also seen this in the refugee communities they have worked in.

Those harsh interactions can hurt a child's emotional development and increase their risk of mental health problems later on, she says.

But when parents are doing well, they are better able to buffer their kids from the long term impacts of past trauma and stresses.

""We really want to think about addressing those harsh interactions between parents and children and providing parents with the skills to navigate better, to regulate their own emotions, to not take those sort of violent actions towards their children,"" says Betancourt.

Siddiqui and her colleagues who work with individual families, teach parents positive parenting skills, as well as ways to better manage their own stress through mindfulness strategies. Practicing gratitude, looking for moments of joy and various breathing techniques are some of the mindfulness tools that parents learn.

The peer educators also help parents navigate the everyday problems of starting afresh in a new and unfamiliar place.

Betancourt and her team found that families who participated reported fewer family arguments and a reduction in symptoms of depression and traumatic stress in their kids.

Khadija Rahmani tells me how Shabana Siddiqui has supported her, for example, when she was feeling disheartened about learning English.

""She motivated me, saying 'It's not hard. At least you are educated and you can read and write, and it will help you to learn English.'""

Siddiqui also helped Khadija find a job at a FedEx packaging facility where other Afghan women work, too. The position did not require knowledge of English..

And the tools of communication and emotional support that Khadija has learned from Siddiqui have helped her support Mujib.

She tries to boost Mujib's confidence so he feels better about going to school.

""To motivate him, I say 'No one is better than you. No one is more handsome than you,' "" Khadija says, smiling. Studies show that this kind of warm, supportive relationship with a parent is protective for kids who have experienced trauma.

Mujib still struggles with homesickness. ""The first thing that I miss most is our garden, the rest of my family, my land, my home and my dog,"" says Mujib.

And he misses flying kites so much he sometimes cries about it.

But Siddiqui herself has had a huge impact on Mujib, his mother says.

""Shabana sat with him, told him good stories, and talked about safety and security. She said 'This place is safe and you don't need to stress.'""

Siddiqui also encouraged him to engage more at school -- a big source of anxiety for him.

Mujib says he looks forward to visits from Siddiqui and talks to her a lot about his life.

""We talk about learning English,"" says Mujib. ""We talk about my school. We talk about everything.""

It's helping him start to move past the shadow of old traumas and toward building a hopeful future in this country.

And in recent months his attitude toward school has become more positive. ""I like learning English, I like playing soccer, I also like the gym,"" Mujib says. ""I like all sorts of things."""
Trump's own version of reality continues to confound political actors and observers,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/nx-s1-5111649/trump-fact-check-reality,2024-09-14T09:05:09Z,"Eight years ago this month, Donald Trump announced that he had personally laid to rest the controversy about President Obama's country of origin. He gave himself credit for clearing up any questions that may have arisen because of something, he claimed, Hillary Clinton had said years earlier.

Those familiar with the facts were stunned. They knew the so-called birther conspiracy had been hatched by various Obama opponents to suggest he was ineligible to be president because he had been born not in the U.S. but in Kenya or some other country. It had been kept alive and promoted for years by a variety of Obama critics, including, most prominently, Donald Trump.

It could even be said that Trump had facilitated his transition from TV reality show star (The Apprentice and The Celebrity Apprentice) to bona fide political candidate by exploiting the birther myth.

What Trump was actually announcing in September 2016 was a decision to stop talking about a non-issue he himself had helped sustain for years. But in finally renouncing one falsehood, he insisted on substituting another -- casting himself as a hero of the tale.

Nearly a decade after Trump began running for president we should all be accustomed to his reliance on falsehoods.

But back in 2016, the birther flip-flop seemed to deserve special recognition. It was not just blatant, it was preposterous.

Or so we thought. Surely it would diminish the man even in the eyes of his admirers. And it may have done so, in some cases. But it did not alter his trajectory. He stunned the world a few weeks later by winning the Electoral College vote for president.

It was said in the early Trump years that the media took him literally but not seriously. It's hard to deny that many of us took him too literally and not seriously enough. At the same time, many of Trump's ""base"" voters were said to take Trump seriously but not literally. That worked for him, and those attitudes surely persist in 2024 much as they did in his first two campaigns.

Ten years ago, the media were accustomed to politicians who could be shamed or at least embarrassed over errors of fact and even minor exposures of ignorance. Trump seemed then, and still seems now, quite impervious to either.

Still, the most egregious trait of Trump's campaign was his willingness to state highly consequential claims that were entirely at odds with reality, standing by them when challenged and sailing on -- dismissive or seemingly oblivious to all criticism.

Far from being disqualifying, this feature of the Trump persona presents itself as part and parcel of his appeal.

This week, after a debate with Vice President Harris that he apparently did not take entirely seriously, Trump said he would not debate her again. He said there was no need for a ""third debate"" because he had clearly won the first two. He was including the June 27 debate he had with President Biden, who had been the presumptive Democratic nominee at the time.

Perhaps that was not surprising, as Trump kept Biden in his sights throughout his debate with Harris this week -- name checking Biden repeatedly without naming Harris once.

But what was surprising was Trump's claim to having won both debates. Few would question he won the June 27 meeting with Biden, who seemed so diminished as to be hard to recognize.

But quite the opposite impression prevailed after Trump's match with Harris, who had swept to the Democratic nomination without opposition after Biden's July 18 decision to withdraw.

The first CNN polls after Tuesday's debate showed nearly two-thirds of those who watched thought Harris did better than Trump (even if they were not planning to vote for her). A sizable fraction of Republicans were not willing to say Trump had won the faceoff.

Yet here was Trump, on the afternoon after the debate, telling reporters he was not interested in a rematch with Harris because he had ""won the debate according to every poll -- every single poll, I think.""

In fact, the only polls where Trump won were online polls of self-selected website samples rather than the randomized scientific samples actual pollsters use. One poll Trump cited had him winning 98% to 2%, according to Trump.

Meanwhile, actual polling organizations such as Reuters and YouGov had done their soundings and found Harris the winner in the eyes of a clear majority -- though not as large a majority as CNN's poll. Trump came out on top for just 31% of the respondents in YouGov and 24% in Reuters.

This willingness or compulsion to present claims that are utterly counterfactual has set Trump apart from conventional candidates. It continues to pose a problem for the media and the political community alike -- including conservative media such as Fox News and a sizable portion of the Republican Party itself.

Trump's claims are often expressed in hyperbolic superlatives. Trump insists he had ""the best economy"" and Biden had ""the worst inflation"" ever -- two statements that are easily disproven. The nation's economic growth was stronger for longer under Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton, just to name two relatively recent presidents. Inflation was far higher and more sustained in the late 1970s and early 1980s.

But Trump has never been troubled by making such outlandish statements. Moreover, he is rarely satisfied with telling his crowds that yellow is green. It has to be the greenest green there has ever been. It is not sufficient to say up is down, it must be down farther than down has ever been.

The escalating statement of the stupendous is also a specialty. Take, for example, his casual references to the number of immigrants present in the United States illegally. On Tuesday night he started referring to millions, mentioned 21 million, then said it was surely far more than the official government estimate of 11 million. Then he again said it was more like 21 million before adding he thought the figure was ""a lot higher than"" that.

And all this without a shred of actual evidence or even a hint at the source of these wildly disparate numbers.

In the June 27 debate against Biden, the incumbent's stumbles overshadowed Trump's own missteps. But Trump still had his share of howlers. At one point he said illegal immigrants had taken ""110%"" of all the jobs created during the Biden presidency.

That would mean they had taken more jobs than were created, strongly suggesting Trump was not paying much attention to what he was saying. Indeed, as a general rule when he starts spouting statistics, he seems far more interested in what shock they may cause than whether they add up.

There may have been a time this kind of behavior could be dismissed as ordinary political rhetoric, which most Americans expect will contain exaggerations and oversimplifications. It is clear from the polls that whatever Americans think of Trump's relationship to fact, something approaching half of them still plan to vote for him.

Fact-checking has been around for more than a generation, giving newspapers and magazines a chance to offer something different and escape the ""he said, she said"" pattern. In the later decades of the 20th century, most newspapers and big broadcasters were steeped in the values of ""middle of the road"" reporting as media owners sought ever-larger and more diverse audiences.

Stories were considered balanced when different sides were presented with equal weight and respect. Deciding which side was right or more accurate or more worthy was left to the news consumer or voter.

That was never entirely satisfactory, either to the consumer-voter or to the journalists themselves. More and more news outlets turned to ""fact-checks"" or ""fact-checking,"" an effort to find and follow the facts on crime, unemployment, trade, health care, immigration and any other issues that drove the debate.

For some journalists this became a full-time assignment. The Washington Post has used veteran reporter Glenn Kessler as its official guru of fact for many years. The Poynter Institute in Florida, related to the St. Petersburg Times (now the Tampa Bay Times) pioneered Politifact several election cycles ago.

NPR and PBS have been fact-checking debates and other key moments in national campaigns for decades, online and on air. This week, the fact-checking operation in both shops had its hands full.

So when ABC moderators David Muir and Linsey Davis made a few factual corrections during the debate about a particular claim or statement, they were carrying on a custom that has been increasingly common in broadcast journalism.

As they did not see a need to correct as much in what Harris said, their efforts struck many Trump supporters as unnecessary, unfair and evidence of Democratic bias. Trump himself said the debate had been ""3 against 1.""

The anchors' defense was that Harris said nothing to compare with Trump's assertions about states allowing abortion after birth or Haitian immigrants eating people's pets in Ohio.

That's a judgment call, of course, and just the kind that mainstream journalists were once trained to avoid. That they now feel compelled to make those calls has a lot to do with how Trump himself has changed the rules. But it should not be surprising that changes the media have made prompt protest from those who feel abused -- particularly Trump himself.

This entails also the sea change over the use of the three-letter word we were trained as journalists to avoid: lie. We might say a politician was misstating facts or making inaccurate claims. But we could never make the leap of imputing motive. Maybe the pol was just mistaken and sincerely believed his opponent was guilty of this or that accusation. We could say he was wrong, but calling someone a liar was a big deal.

Trump has led to a change in that policy in much of the industry. Even in 2016, some TV anchors were using the word, at least on late-night TV. It has since become quite common for mainstream news organizations to refer to lies and lying.

With his latest portrayal of what happened in the Harris debate in front of 67 million TV viewers this week, Trump once again has thrown down the gauntlet to challenge the fact-checkers and the commentators alike.

Now, even the practice of fact-checking has become controversial, with Trump acolytes questioning what constitutes a fact. We have reached a point where the idea of fact-checking is regarded as polarizing.

And the more we talk about how polarized things have become, the more polarized they get."
Markets Crave A 50 Basis Point Cut From The Federal Reserve,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeosullivan/2024/09/13/markets-crave-a-50-basis-point-cut-from-the-federal-reserve/,2024-09-13T17:24:52Z,"Next week the Federal Reserve will very likely cut interest rates, for the first time since the COVID related rate cutting cycle. Recall of course that at the end of this speedy sets of cuts, most of the leading central banks had declared inflation to be 'transitory'. The Fed cut will come on the back of a series of rate cuts from 'elder' central banks - the Bank of England, Riksbank and the Swiss National Bank, as well as the European Central Bank from whom we had another rate cut last week.

The anticipated move by the Federal Reserve is instructive in several respects. Market based interest rates are lower than Fed rates and many investors expect (or rather crave) the Fed to make a 50 basis point cut, as opposed to a 'standard' one of 25 basis points. At the weekend, the lead headline in the Financial Times read 'Investors raise bets on bumper half-point Fed rate cut'.

This is yet another sign of monetary addiction - the result of the conditioning of investors to financial liquidity. In mid-August, following a dip in the stock market, I wrote that the idea of the 'Fed put' - the notion that the Fed would react to a fall in asset prices by cutting rates - is very much alive in markets.

The market dip led several seasoned and apparently credible investors to call for an emergency cut in rates. However, the Fed has only ever taken such dramatic action in the thick of deep crises (LTCM/Russian economic collapse, the dot.com collapse, 9/11, the global financial crisis and the COVID crisis). Similarly, it has not begun a rate cutting cycle with a 50 basis point cut, outside of financial crises. There is no financial crisis today (though plenty of mounting financial risks such as very high debt levels), but a crisis of expectations.

That crisis of expectations is at play as investors position for the Fed meeting next week. In my experience, the Fed is, in normal economic conditions, a cautious and slow-moving beast, and it would be untypical for them to begin a rate cutting phase with an outsized rate cut. To do so would suggest that they are in a hurry to correct a mistake of their own making.

To the extent that investor behaviour demands a 50-basis point cut, this recalls the quip from Paul Samuelson, the first winner of the Nobel Prize in Economics, that the market has predicted nine out of the last five recessions.

Set against this apparent concern by investors (do they fear a recession or desire lower rates?) is a debate around a relatively new economic rule of thumb called the Sahm Rule, named after research by economist Claudia Sahm at the Federal Reserve. Her rule states that when the medium-term unemployment rate rises an impending recession is signalled (the three month average of unemployment needs to rise by 50 basis points). It is a surprisingly simple rule that appears to have prefigured eleven US downturns going back to 1953. Sahm's aim in establishing a reliable rule was that stimulus checks can be sent out at the outset of recessions (as opposed to waiting for GDP data to indicate a recession).

I am tempted to trump the Sahm Rule with two observations.

The first is Goodhart's Law, named after Bank of England and LSE economist Charles Goodhart which states that 'when a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure', or more colloquially that fame kills a good model.

More seriously, most of the last ten business cycles were conventional ones, whereas this business cycle bears the scars of reversing demographics, the lingering effects of COVID fiscal policy and labour market distortions (work from home) not to mention the contortions of strategic industrial policy (i.e. the CHIP's Act, Inflation Reduction Act) and the political ramifications of high inflation and immigration. It is anything but a typical business cycle, and very hard to read.

Somewhat unusually at this stage in the cycle government finances are weak (from France to the US) whilst the large corporates of the Western world are in a generally healthy financial state. Of the major economies, China poses the greatest risk to the downside in the near-term.

With different components of the US economy moving in different directions, my expectation is for a slowdown than a deeper recession (this may eventually come at the end of 2025 if inflation rises again). Equally, I expect the Fed to make a series of rate cuts rather than deep cutting cycle. If that view is correct, the interest rates market will be very volatile, as investors periodically over react to data points and price in 'booms' and busts'.

Expect a market tantrum next week with investors complaining that the Fed is behind the curve. Samuelson would tell us that the curve has got it wrong."
"China is raising its retirement age, now among the lowest in world's major economies",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/13/g-s1-22510/china-retirement-age,2024-09-13T13:27:15Z,"BEIJING -- Starting next year, China will raise its retirement age for workers, which is now among the youngest in the world's major economies, in an effort to address its shrinking population and aging work force.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the country's legislature, passed the new policy Friday after a sudden announcement earlier in the week that it was reviewing the measure, state broadcaster CCTV announced.

The policy change will be carried out over 15 years, with the retirement age for men raised to 63 years, and for women to 55 or 58 years depending on their jobs. The current retirement age is 60 for men and 50 for women in blue-collar jobs and 55 for women doing white-collar work.

""We have more people coming into the retirement age, and so the pension fund is (facing) high pressure. That's why I think it's now time to act seriously,"" said Xiujian Peng, a senior research fellow at Victoria University in Australia who studies China's population and its ties to the economy.

The previous retirement ages were set in the 1950's, when life expectancy was only around 40 years, Peng said.

The policy will be implemented starting in January, according to the announcement from China's legislature. The change will take effect progressively based on people's birthdates.

For example, a man born in January 1971 could retire at the age of 61 years and 7 months in August 2032, according to a chart released along with the policy. A man born in May 1971 could retire at the age of 61 years and 8 months in January 2033.

Demographic pressures made the move long overdue, experts say. By the end of 2023, China counted nearly 300 million people over the age of 60. By 2035, that figure is projected to be 400 million, larger than the population of the U.S. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences had previously projected that the public pension fund will run out of money by that year.

Pressure on social benefits such as pensions and social security is hardly a China-specific problem. The U.S. also faces the issue as analysis shows that currently, the Social Security fund won't be able to pay out full benefits to people by 2033.

""This is happening everywhere,"" said Yanzhong Huang, senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations. ""But in China with its large elderly population, the challenge is much larger.""

That is on top of fewer births, as younger people opt out of having children, citing high costs. In 2022, China's National Bureau of Statistics reported that for the first time the country had 850,000 fewer people at the end of the year than the previous year , a turning point from population growth to decline. In 2023, the population shrank further, by 2 million people.

What that means is that the burden of funding elderly people's pensions will be divided among a smaller group of younger workers, as pension payments are largely funded by deductions from people who are currently working.

Researchers measure that pressure by looking at a number called the dependency ratio, which counts the number of people over the age of 65 compared to the number of workers under 65. That number was 21.8% in 2022, according to government statistics, meaning that roughly five workers would support one retiree. The percentage is expected to rise, meaning fewer workers will be shouldering the burden of one retiree.

The necessary course correction will cause short-term pain, experts say, coming at a time of already high youth unemployment and a soft economy.

A 52-year-old Beijing resident, who gave his family name as Lu and will now retire at age 61 instead of 60, was positive about the change. ""I view this as a good thing, because our society's getting older, and in developed countries, the retirement age is higher,"" he said.

Li Bin, 35, who works in the event planning industry, said she was a bit sad.

""It's three years less of play time. I had originally planned to travel around after retirement,"" she said. But she said it was better than expected because the retirement age was only raised three years for women in white-collar jobs.

Some of the comments on social media when the policy review was announced earlier in the week reflected anxiety.

But of the 13,000 comments on the Xinhua news post announcing the news, only a few dozen were visible, suggesting that many others had been censored."
"In Jordan's elections, anger at Israel over the Gaza war fuels Islamist gains",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/12/g-s1-22336/jordan-elections-islamists-israel-gaza-war,2024-09-12T19:33:29Z,"AMMAN, Jordan -- Jordan's Islamist opposition made the biggest gains of any opposition party in parliamentary elections held this week, winning one-fifth of the seats amid increasing anger against Israel over the war in Gaza.

The Islamic Action Front, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, is now the single biggest opposition bloc in the 138-member parliament. The legislative body has limited power, and will continue to be dominated by pro-government and tribal political groups.

The IAF's showing in the election has been widely watched as a gauge of whether the increased support for Hamas, which is at war with Israel, would translate into more seats for the Brotherhood-linked party in Jordan and more influence for Islamist parties in other countries.

Voting turnout was relatively low -- an average of 32% across the country. The percentage of voters going to the polls was much higher in tribal areas and much lower in the capital Amman.

Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood leader Murad Adailah told Reuters the IAF victory was a ""popular referendum"" endorsing support for Hamas and its allies and rejection of the 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel.

Jordan's highest court dissolved the Muslim Brotherhood organization four years ago, citing failure to comply with registration laws. The Brotherhood stills operates in Jordan but is not allowed to directly field parliamentary candidates. Many Arab rulers have banned the Brotherhood, fearing threats to their hereditary power and to more secular political agendas.

Jordan's monarchy has tried to balance legislative and judicial moves to limit the power of the Brotherhood while allowing its supporters some free expression. At protests after Friday prayers, Brotherhood speakers regularly lead chants of ""we are all Hamas"" and call for Jordan to break its peace treaty with Israel.

The United States, Jordan's main foreign donor, has designated Hamas a terrorist organization.

Jordan signed its 1994 peace treaty with neighboring Israel under the late King Hussein, becoming the second country to do so after Egypt. A majority of Jordan's population is originally Palestinian, descendants of families who fled or were forced from their homes in the war in 1948, the year Israel was created -- and in subsequent wars, and were never allowed back.

Anger has grown along with the death toll in Gaza, where the health ministry says more than 40,000 people, many of them women and children, have been killed in Israeli attacks. Israel says it needs to destroy Hamas after Hamas militants led a cross-border attack last October that Israeli authorities say killed roughly 1,200 people.

Along with appealing to Jordanians enraged over Israeli attacks in Gaza and the West Bank, the IAF managed to form alliances to appeal to a wider group of voters than its traditional urban conservative Muslim base and successfully fielded candidates including tribal leaders and Christians.

Jordan is a constitutional monarchy and King Abdullah II implemented electoral reforms two years ago aimed at encouraging the role of political parties as a step toward greater democratization. The new laws also increased the number of seats for women and lowered the age at which candidates can run from 30 to 25.

The king still appoints government leaders and can dissolve parliament, which introduces and passes laws and has the ability to force a government resignation through a no-confidence vote.

Jordan, a resource-poor country, has been hit particularly hard by the economic fallout of the Gaza war. Tourism, one of the country's main sectors, has plummeted and unemployment, while officially about 22% of the working population, is believed to be much higher.

The head of European Union election mission, Željana Zovko, praised Jordan for succeeding in holding elections as scheduled, despite the ongoing turmoil in the region."
Fed Expected To Start Interest Rate Cuts Incrementally On September 18,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/09/12/fed-expected-to-start-interest-rate-cuts-incrementally-on-september-18/,2024-09-12T16:09:24Z,"Markets expect the Federal Open Market Committee to most likely cut interest rates by 0.25% to 5% to 5.25% on September 18. That's according to the CME FedWatch Tool which tracks the implicit forecasts of fixed income markets.

Previously a larger rate cut was a strong possibility, but the chance of that has receded to around 10% currently after recent jobs and inflation data. Forecasting site Kalshi gives a 99% chance of a rate cut at the September meeting. FOMC policymakers have also clearly signaled that lower interest rates should be expected in the near future.

Headline Consumer Price Index inflation was reported at 2.5% for the 12 months to August. Core inflation, which removes food and energy price changes, is running slightly higher at a 3.2% annual rate. Personal Consumption Expenditure inflation, a metric is the FOMC typically prefers is running at a 2.5% annual rate to July 2024, and 2.6% excluding food and energy. Those figures will be updated for August on September 27.

To the extent inflation is running over 2% currently within the CPI that's mainly due to shelter costs, this category is rising at a 5.2% annual rate as of August and carries a high weight within the CPI series because shelter is a large part of most household budgets.

Inflation is now much less of a concern than in recent years, but is still not at the FOMC's 2% annual target. This is perhaps prompting a more measured approach to potential interest rate cuts. The FOMC want to eliminate the risk of inflation returning, even though that risk is generally considered to be declining and relatively close to target. If inflation were at 2% today, then the FOMC might be more aggressive in bringing rates lower, since the primary reason for hiking rates since 2021 was to fight elevated inflation.

On the other side of the FOMC's dual mandate, August's Employment Situation Report was somewhat reassuring, at least relative to some fears of weakening data.

Unemployment ticked down to 4.2% and non-farm payrolls grew 142,000. Nonetheless, unemployment has risen gradually for much of 2024, but August's jobs offered a degree of reassurance that the jobs market is not deteriorating as fast as some forecasts feared it might.

If the jobs market were to weaken further or faster, then the FOMC may be prompted to cut rates more aggressively. That said, there are two sides to this analysis. On the one hand, unemployment is edging up gradually from very low levels. As such this return to a more normal unemployment rate may not be a concern. However, historically it hasn't take much of a step-up in unemployment to trigger a recession. Indicators such as the Sahm Rule, which looks for a 0.5% rise in a normalized unemployment within a 12-month window to call a recession, suggest that we could be at risk of a recession from the absolute rise in unemployment in 2024 relative to 2023 already.

Nonetheless, with inflation not completely at the FOMC's target and the jobs market cooling but suggesting a less severe decline so far, the FOMC may avoid larger interest rate cuts, at least for the September meeting.

However, fixed income markets assess that a larger interest rate cut of perhaps 0.5% is quite possible when the FOMC meets in November or December. That could be because markets project further rises in unemployment.

There are three more Employment Situation Reports to come in 2024. These are on October 4, November 1 and December 6. If these show further deterioration in the jobs market, and especially if inflation moves even closer to 2% over the same period, then the FOMC may lean towards more aggressive rate cuts."
"In The Struggle For Public-Sector Workers, Pensions Help",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dandoonan/2024/09/11/in-the-struggle-for-public-sector-workers-pensions-help/,2024-09-11T17:24:30Z,"The job market in the United States has been drum tight since the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite a sharp rise in unemployment during the initial pandemic shutdown, the labor market has recovered over the four years since. Even with the most recent jobs report, the unemployment rate remains at historically low levels, averaging 3.8 percent since January 2023. Additionally, prime-age workers (ages 25-54) are participating in the labor force at strong levels.

This labor market means employers still are competing for employees. Workers, especially those with lower-incomes, have seen their wages rise as a result. But there are other forms of compensation and benefits that employers can leverage to compete for talent. A defined benefit (DB) pension plan has long been a tool used by employers to recruit and retain employees, which has proven particularly effective for public-sector workers like teachers, police officers, firefighters, and sanitation workers.

The overwhelming majority of local, state, and federal government workers today have access to a pension. In some places, the pension plan accompanies a mandatory defined contribution (DC) plan for a hybrid arrangement. In some jurisdictions, public employees are offered a choice between participating in a DB or a DC plan. Regardless of the structure, a pension plan is available for most public workers.

Pensions Promote Public Service Careers

There is a good reason why public-sector employers continue to offer pensions: these plans keep workers in their jobs for careers. Some public-sector jobs, like accountants or attorneys, have direct counterparts in the private sector, so it's relatively easy to switch between the two sectors. Other public-sector jobs, such as teaching, policing, or firefighting, don't have direct private-sector counterparts, so it's harder to find workers who have experience in those areas. Moreover, many public-sector jobs require years of training and experience for workers to reach their peak effectiveness. This training often comes with costs, and impacts the quality of public services. Public-sector employers and taxpayers therefore have a strong incentive to keep these workers for a career to get a return on their investment.

For decades, employee tenure has been longer for public jobs as compared to the private-sector. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) finds that the average tenure for a public employee is eight years compared with four years for a private-sector worker. This data is backed up by an analysis of U.S. Census Bureau data from the Employee Benefits Research Institute (EBRI), an analysis that found the median tenure for a public-sector employee in 2022 to be seven years versus four years for a private-sector employee. During the period from 1983-2022, those median tenures have remained fairly steady: public-sector tenure rose from six years in 1983 to a peak of 8.3 years in 2012, then down to seven years in 2022. For private-sector tenure, the comparable numbers were 3.5 years to 4.3 years to four years.

There's A Pattern of Low Teacher and Public Safety Staff Turnover With Pensions

The ways in which pensions contribute to these longer tenures can be shown in two simple charts. The first chart below displays data from a sample of six public safety pension plans. It shows public safety employee turnover is higher in the first five years when workers are making decisions about whether to continue down this career path. But after about five years, turnover flattens and remains low throughout the middle years of a career until the pension plan's retirement provisions take effect. Then, the expected increase in turnover occurs as workers begin to retire.

The same holds true for teachers. An analysis of a sample of six teacher pension plans (distinct from the six public safety plans mentioned above) again shows the same pattern. In the chart below, there is slightly higher turnover in the early career years, remarkably low turnover during the middle of a career, and then higher turnover at the career end as teachers begin to retire.

Both charts show the pension plans working as intended. Pensions help with the ""three Rs"" of workforce management: recruitment, retention, and retirement. Also, surveys of public-sector workers consistently show high ratings for retirement benefits similar to strong favorability for salary and health insurance. Pensions retain those workers who have committed to a career in the public sector, then help those workers transition to retirement when it is appropriate at the end of their career. It's important to remember, however, that retirement from a public-sector job may be earlier for a firefighter or a police officer than for a teacher, due to the physical demands of the work.

The public sector likely will never out compete the private sector in pay. Private-sector employers can almost always offer a higher salary than public-sector employers in a direct competition for talent. But the public sector offers competitive benefits such as pensions, which workers want. This is true even for younger workers who value ""flexibility"" and change jobs frequently. It turns out, as evidenced by the data, young people today are the same as young people in the past: they move around in jobs until they find the right job. Then they want the same job features workers have always wanted: a decent salary, a sense of purpose, and retirement security. And public-sector employers know that retirement security is best achieved with a pension."
Inflation Fell To 2.5% In August -- Lowest Since Early 2021 With Fed On Cusp Of Declaring Victory,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/11/cpi-inflation-fell-to-25-in-august-lowest-since-early-2021-with-fed-on-cusp-of-declaring-victory/,2024-09-11T12:36:58Z,"Inflation continued its downward trajectory in August, according to data released Wednesday morning, though the focus for the health of the U.S. economy has largely shifted from whether inflation will subside to what the cost of that shift is.

The most commonly cited measure of inflation, CPI tracks price changes in a predetermined, weighted basket of goods and services the typical American may purchase in a given period. Inflation ran amok beginning in 2021 as several factors came to a head, including the U.S. economy kicking back into gear as the COVID-19 pandemic eased, a surge in energy prices globally as the U.S. and its allies cut off Russian imports and the lingering effects of pandemic stimulus checks. Headline CPI inflation peaked at a 41-year high of over 9% in mid-2022. Subsiding inflation came as the Federal Reserve hiked interest rates from their near-zero level from March 2020 to March 2022 to the 5.25% to 5.5% range they've sat since last July.

The Fed's rate-hiking campaign bore the desired fruit of tamed inflation, but the potentially damaging second-order effects of such aggressive monetary policy has started to rear its head. As is historically the case, lower inflation has brought higher unemployment, with the jobless rate up almost a full percentage point from its 2023 low, escalating fears about the health of the U.S. labor market and the potential for a full-fledged recession.

21%. That's how much the consumer index rose from August 2020 to August 2024, equating to annualized inflation of 5.3%. Average hourly wages have climbed by 19% over the period, reflecting the discontent among many Americans as paychecks stretch thinner than they used to.

The Fed's policy-setting committee will meet next Tuesday and Wednesday to determine whether they will cut rates. Traders price in a full 100% chance the central bank will lower rates, but the question is how sharply they will act to stimulate the economy. The CME FedWatch Tool indicates the market-implied odds of a 0.25 percentage point cut is about 70% compared to roughly 30% for a more aggressive 0.5 percentage point cut."

Employee productivity is one of the biggest concerns for executives. But research shows that those at the top may be the most guilty of ""fauxductivity,"" or fake productivity.

A report from software company Workhuman found that nearly half of managers say that faking productivity is a problem on their team, but managers were actually more likely to admit to exaggerating their productivity compared to non-managers. C-suite execs were the most likely to admit to ""performative productivity"" among those surveyed.

The trend could be a symptom of the growing expectation to be ""always on,"" writes Forbes' Maria Gracia Santillana Linares in this week's Careers newsletter, which you can sign up for here.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump squared off in Tuesday night's presidential debate, speaking on a range of issues including inflation, abortion and immigration. Both candidates were flagged by fact-checkers for various statements, including Trump repeating a false viral claim that immigrants in Ohio ""are eating the pets of the people that live there."" Harris, meanwhile, falsely claimed that Trump ""left us with the worst unemployment since the Great Depression,"" despite the fact that unemployment had fallen to 6.4% by the time Joe Biden took office.

MORE: Following a strong performance Tuesday night, Harris vaulted past Trump to become the bookmaker's favorite to win the election. According to the Election Betting Odds tracker, bookmakers now believe Harris has a 51.8% chance of winning -- a jump of more than four points in 24 hours.

Larry Ellison's wealth soared by nearly $18 billion Tuesday, propelling him to the third spot on Forbes' real-time billionaires list. The Oracle cofounder surpassed both Facebook cofounder Mark Zuckerberg and Europe's richest man Bernard Arnault. Ellison's $191 billion fortune was boosted as shares of his cloud computing firm shot up over 11% following its positive earnings report.

Tron, Tether, and blockchain intelligence firm TRM Labs have joined forces to form a strategic alliance focused on curbing cryptocurrency crime. Stablecoins like Tether's USDT are the lifeblood of crypto markets, but with a market cap exceeding $118 billion and more than half of USDT's supply running on Tron, its scale and ease of use have made it a magnet for malicious actors.

South Korean e-commerce giant Coupang led an approximately $3.5 million fundraising round for Episoden, the Seoul-based video chat app. Episoden allows users to video chat one-on-one with people who are looking to practice their English, and the video chat service says it has more than 200,000 users across 165 countries.

Billionaire pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris as her debate with former President Donald Trump concluded Tuesday. Swift told her 283 million Instagram followers that Harris ""fights for the rights and causes I believe [in],"" and praised Harris' running mate, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz. She said she decided to issue the endorsement after Trump shared a series of AI images that suggested Swift had endorsed the Republican candidate, which raised fears about ""the dangers of spreading misinformation.""

Israel's military said on Tuesday it is ""highly likely"" that American Aysenur Eygi was ""indirectly and unintentionally"" shot and killed by the Israel Defense Force during a protest in the West Bank last week.

TOPLINE UFC 306 on Saturday is the first sporting event to come to the state-of-the-art Las Vegas Sphere, and the fight promotion is pulling out all the stops. Forbes got an exclusive look at the knockout production, which CEO Dana White says is ""a completely different animal than anything we've ever done.""

Initially, no one at the company, including White, had any idea how expensive it would be to stage a promotion at the 18,600-seat venue. When the CFO at TKO Group Holdings, UFC's New York City-based parent company, asked what the budget might be for the event, UFC executive vice president and chief content officer Craig Borsari estimated $8 million. In the end, it cost White and Borsari more than $20 million to realize their vision for UFC 306.

Saturday's spectacle will include six short film segments before each fight, tracking Mexican history from the dawn of man through to hundreds of years in the future, each with its own animated graphics, practical effects and elaborately costumed octagon girls.

The hope is to prove that live sports in the Sphere is viable, and perhaps even spectacular, both for attendees and viewers around the globe.

For TKO, a company founded last September when Ari Emanuel's Endeavor merged UFC and WWE into one $20 billion publicly traded entity, the real money is made from media rights. Some two-thirds of TKO's $851 million in revenue last quarter comes from the category, including UFC's current pact with ESPN, which expires at the end of 2025. Negotiations are expected to begin early next year. In other words, now is the perfect time for a noisy, attention-grabbing event.

WHY IT MATTERS ""Dana White claims that UFC's event at the Sphere will change the way sports broadcasts are thought of forever,"" says Forbes reporter Matt Craig. ""He's no stranger to hyperbole, of course, but if you think about it, the way sports are presented on TV hasn't changed much over the past few decades. UFC 306 is not only a pivotal moment for that company, with billions of dollars in the next media rights negotiation hanging in the balance, but it could present some fresh ideas for others to adopt. A lot of people will be watching closely to see if it succeeds or fails.""

The economy was a key topic at Tuesday night's debate, with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump sparring back and forth on issues like inflation. But both Trump and the Biden Administrations oversaw strong economic output and labor markets during their time in office:

3.5%: The annualized expansion of real GDP during President Joe Biden's first three years, compared to 2.7% during Trump's

16.3%: The annualized return of the S&P 500 index under Trump, compared to 11.8% since Biden took office in 2021

19%: The increase in inflation over the first 42 months of Biden's term compared to 6% during Trump's first 42 months

The biggest loser in the Trump-Harris debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/biggest-loser-trump-harris-debate,2024-09-11T05:52:05Z,"The biggest loser in the first (and likely only) presidential debate between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump was ABC News, which hosted the face-off. The moderators, David Muir and Linsey Davis, embarrassed themselves and their network by, among other things, fact-checking Trump in real time on more than one occasion - sometimes incorrectly - while allowing Harris to spout serial lies and distortions.

Social media blew up early on in the debate with commentators on the right, in particular, calling Tuesday night's face-off the worst and most one-sided debate in history.

IN THE TRUMP-HARRIS FACE-OFF THERE WAS A CLEAR WINNER BUT DON'T BELIEVE THIS ELECTION IS OVER

Some of the non-truths Harris could (and should have been) fact-checked on:

1. Talking about Project 2025 as if it were Trump's manifesto, and saying that he will pass a nationwide abortion ban

2. Dredging up Trump's Charlottesville comment - that there were ""very fine people on both sides"" - which has been debunked

3. Saying Trump had overseen the worst unemployment since the Great Depression, which was caused by the pandemic

4. Saying Donald Trump has opposed IVF

5. Denying that Kamala Harris ever called for gun confiscation (there are videos of her doing just that)

6. Saying that Trump's tax cuts only helped rich people

7. And my special bete noir - saying that she and Biden have ""created"" 800,000 manufacturing jobs, which is simply not true.

There were others. Harris lied about her record and about Trump's and was not challenged on any of it.

LEFT WING FACT-CHECKER ADMITS TRUMP NEVER CALLED CHARLOTTESVILLE NEO-NAZIS 'VERY FINE PEOPLE' IN BLOW TO BIDEN

Perhaps that was inevitable; the liberal media is in full panic mode now that Harris' honeymoon appears to have faded and Trump has pulled even and, in some polls, moved back into the lead.

Harris' pathetic effort to avoid committing to any policies while on the campaign trail has failed; her refusal to do solo interviews and press conferences has left American voters in the dark. Consequently, the debate was important. People want to know where she stands. Unfortunately, because she deflected on most of the questions and did not flesh out the very few policies she has offered, they still have very little idea of her views.

ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT OF HARRIS

That should have been the job of the moderators, but they declined to do it. Instead, they allowed her to prattle on with Biden-like platitudes. Once again, a bitterly partisan candidate is promising to bring the country together. Remember that one?

The moderators asked Harris early on whether people were better off under the Biden-Harris administration than they had been under Trump, and instead of citing areas of progress (perhaps because there are none), she launched into describing her ""opportunity economy."" This denotes her ""plan,"" which she touted frequently and which apparently rests on giving people money to buy a home, giving people money to start a business and giving people money to help them raise children.

How taxpayers will pay for all these ""opportunities"" was left unsaid. This is, of course, very Bidenesque - promise money to important voting groups like young people who have drifted away from Democrats and small business owners, who have historically lined up behind Trump.

TRUMP SPARS WITH HARRIS, MODERATORS DURING HEATED PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'SHE DOESN'T HAVE A PLAN'

Trump, on the other hand, failed to prosecute his case. While Harris appeared over-prepared and practiced, with ready-to-go gestures and studied mannerisms, Trump was clearly under-prepared. It is frustrating to his supporters, because he has the facts on his side. He actually did build a strong economy, but saw it slammed by COVID. He actually did leave the world at peace, and negotiated significant new alliances between Middle Eastern countries. He actually did demote Iran's ability to wage proxy wars through sanctions and constrained Russia's energy dominance by cancelling the Nordstream 2 Pipeline. And, he alerted the world to China's dishonest intentions and rule-breaking; none of his predecessors had tried to rein in Beijing.

But instead of forcefully arguing about his successes, he meandered. And, he forgot to smile.

TRUMP FLIPS 'I'M TALKING' SCRIPT FROM 2020 DEBATE AGAINST KAMALA HARRIS DURING PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE SHOWDOWN

Rather than patiently and systematically challenging Harris with evidence that his administration had helped the middle class more than hers, Trump reverted to form, claiming once again that he actually won the 2020 election.

That was a mistake, and the liberal press was doubtless jumping for joy. His comments will breathe new life into Biden and Harris' warnings about Trump being a threat to democracy, a talking point that had all but vanished from the political discourse in recent months.

He repeatedly bashed Harris over her failure to curb illegal immigration, but failed to specify the damage done by the inflow of migrants to our cities, neglected to talk about the huge number of people killed by fentanyl because of our open border or the 320,000 children that the White House has lost track of. That was low-hanging fruit, and an opportunity missed.

He also rose to the bait more than once. When Harris slammed his rallies, saying people got bored and walked out, he couldn't resist devolving into arguing about crowd sizes...again.

Trump did manage to make some good points, noting, for instance, that despite criticism over his tariff policy, the Biden-Harris White House had left intact his fees on imports from China, because they were effective. He also pushed back on the jobs supposedly ""created"" by the current White House, calling them ""bounce-back"" jobs. He's right.

His most effective moment of the evening was asking, in his concluding statement, why she hadn't moved forward with her ""opportunity economy"" and her other plans during the past three and a half years? Why hadn't she fixed the border or created more jobs?

That's the question the moderators should have asked."
Fact checking the Donald Trump-Kamala Harris presidential debate,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/11/g-s1-21932/fact-check-trump-harris-presidential-debate-2024,2024-09-11T05:09:30Z,"Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump faced off in their first -- and possibly only -- debate of the 2024 campaign Tuesday, taking questions on key issues like the border, the economy and abortion.

With the candidates virtually tied in the polls, and just 55 days until Election Day, Trump and Harris sought to define their visions for America in front of a national audience, and deflect attacks from the other side.

NPR reporters fact-checked the candidates' claims in real time. Here's what they found:

TRUMP: ""I had no inflation, virtually no inflation. They had the highest inflation, perhaps in the history of our country, because I've never seen a worse period of time. People can't go out and buy cereal or bacon or eggs or anything else.""

Inflation soared to a four-decade high of 9.1% in 2022, according to the consumer price index. While inflation has since fallen to 2.9% (as of July), prices -- particularly food prices -- are still higher than many Americans would like.

Other countries have also faced high inflation in the wake of the pandemic, as tangled supply chains struggled to keep pace with surging demand. Russia's invasion of Ukraine also fueled inflation by driving up energy and food prices worldwide.

Government spending in the U.S. under both the Biden-Harris administration and Trump also may have contributed, putting more money in people's pockets and enabling them to keep spending in the face of high prices.

While high prices are a source of frustration for many Americans, the average worker has more buying power today than she did before the pandemic. Since February 2020 (just before the pandemic took hold in the U.S.) consumer prices have risen 21.6% while average wages have risen 23%.

Many prices were depressed early in the pandemic, however, so the comparison is less flattering if you start the clock when President Biden and Vice President Harris took office. Since early 2021, consumer prices have risen 19.6% while average wages have risen 16.9%. Wage gains have been outpacing price increases for over a year, so that gap should eventually close.

HARRIS: ""Donald Trump left us the worst unemployment since the Great Depression.""

At the height of the Great Depression in 1933, the national unemployment rate was near 25%, according to the Franklin D. Roosevelt Presidential Library.

At the start of the COVID pandemic, the unemployment rate peaked at 14.8% in April 2020, a level not seen since 1948, according to the Congressional Research Service.

But by the time Trump left office, unemployment had fallen to a lower, but still elevated level. The January 2021 unemployment rate was 6.3%.

-- NPR producer Lexie Schapitl

TRUMP: ""You see what's happening with towns throughout the United States. You look at Springfield, Ohio, you look at Aurora in Colorado. They are taking over the towns. They're taking over buildings. They're going in violently. These are the people that she and Biden let into our country, and they're destroying our country. They're dangerous. They're at the highest level of criminality, and we have to get them out.""

Trump attacked Harris and Biden's records on immigration, arguing that they're failing to stem people from other countries from entering the U.S. and causing violence.

In the last two years, more than 40,000 Venezuelan immigrants have arrived in the Denver metro area. And it is true that many now live in Aurora.

A few weeks ago, a video of gang members in an Aurora, Colo., apartment building had right-wing media declaring the city's takeover by Venezuelan gangs. NPR looked into these claims.

Shortly after the video appeared, Colorado's Republican Party sent a fundraising letter claiming the state is under violent attack, and Venezuelan gangs have taken over Aurora.

It's also true Aurora police have recently arrested 10 members of a Venezuelan gang called Tren de Aragua. But Aurora's interim police chief, Heather Morris, says there's no evidence of a gang takeover of apartment buildings in her city.

What's more, violent crime -- including murder, robbery and rape -- is way down nationwide, according to the most recent data from the FBI. Notably, analysts predict violent crime rates this year will fall back down to where they were before they surged during the pandemic, and may even approach a 50-year low.

Trump also claims that migrants are driving up crime rates in the U.S. That is not true. Researchers from Stanford University found that since the 1960s, immigrants have been 60% less likely to be incarcerated than people born in the U.S. The CATO Institute, a libertarian think tank, found undocumented immigrants in Texas were 37% less likely to be convicted of a crime.

-- NPR immigration correspondent Jasmine Garsd and criminal justice reporter Meg Anderson

TRUMP: ""In Springfield, they're eating the dogs. The people that came in, they're eating the cats. They're eating the pets of the people that live there.""

This remark refers to a debunked, dehumanizing claim that Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio, are abducting pets and eating them.

The claim, which local police say is baseless, first circulated among far-right activists, local Republicans and neo-Nazis before being picked up by congressional leaders, vice presidential candidate JD Vance and others. A well-known advocate for the Haitian community says she received a wave of racist harassment after Vance shared the theory on social media.

The Springfield News-Sun reported that local police said that incidents of pets being stolen or eaten were ""not something that's on our radar right now."" The paper said the unsubstantiated claim seems to have started with a post in a Springfield Facebook group that was widely shared across social media.

The claim is the latest example of Trump leaning into anti-immigrant rhetoric. Since entering the political arena in 2015, Trump accused immigrants of being criminals, rapists, or ""poisoning the blood of our nation.""

-- NPR disinformation reporter Jude Joffe-Block

TRUMP: ""A lot of these illegal immigrants coming in, [Democrats] are trying to get them to vote.""

It is illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal elections, and there is no credible evidence that it has happened in significant numbers, or that there is an effort underway to illegally register undocumented immigrants to vote this election.

Voter registration forms require voters to sign an oath -- under penalty of perjury -- that they are U.S. citizens. If a noncitizen lies about their citizenship on a registration form and vote, they have created a paper trail of a crime that is punishable with jail time and deportation.

""The deterrent is incredibly strong,"" David Becker, executive director of Center for Election Innovation and Research, told NPR.

Election officials routinely verify information on voter registration forms, which ask registrants for either a driver's license number or the last four of social security numbers.

In 2016, the Brennan Center for Justice surveyed local election officials in 42 jurisdictions with high immigrant populations and found 30 cases of suspected noncitizens voting out of 23.5 million votes cast, or 0.0001%.

Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger launched an audit in 2022 that found fewer than 1,700 suspected noncitizens had attempted to register to vote over the past 25 years. None were able to vote.

-- NPR disinformation reporter Jude Joffe-Block

TRUMP: ""[Harris] was the border czar. Remember that she was the border czar.""

Republicans have taken to calling Harris the ""border czar"" as a way to blame her for increased migration to the U.S. and what they see as border security policy failures of the Biden administration.

There is no actual ""border czar"" position. In 2021, President Biden tasked Harris with addressing the root causes of migration from Central America.

The ""root causes strategy ... identifies, prioritizes, and coordinates actions to improve security, governance, human rights, and economic conditions in the region,"" the White House said in a statement. ""It integrates various U.S. government tools, including diplomacy, foreign assistance, public diplomacy, and sanctions.""

While Harris has been scrutinized on the right, immigration advocates have also criticized Harris, including for comments in 2021 where she warned prospective migrants, ""Do not come.""

-- NPR immigration correspondent Jasmine Garsd

TRUMP: ""It's execution, no longer abortion. ... You could do abortions in the seventh month, the eighth month, the ninth month, and probably after birth.""

As ABC News anchor Linsey Davis mentioned during her real-time fact check, there is no state where it is legal to kill a baby after birth. A report from KFF earlier this year also noted that abortions ""after birth"" are illegal in every state.

According to the Pew Research Center, the overwhelming majority of abortions -- 93% -- take place during the first trimester. Pew says 1% take place after 21 weeks. Most of those take place before 24 weeks, the approximate timeline for fetal viability, according to a report by KFF Health News.

A separate analysis from KFF earlier this year noted that later abortions are expensive to obtain and offered by relatively few providers, and often occur because of medical complications or because patients face barriers earlier in their pregnancies.

""Nowhere in America is a woman carrying a pregnancy to term and asking for an abortion. That isn't happening; it's insulting to the women of America,"" Harris said.

Harris also invoked religion in her response, arguing that ""one does not have to abandon their faith"" to agree that the government should not control reproductive health decisions.

As Davis also noted, Trump has offered mixed messages about abortion over the course of the campaign. He has bragged about his instrumental role in overturning Roe v. Wade, while appearing to backpedal on an issue that polling makes clear is a liability for Republicans.

TRUMP: The U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan ""was one of the most incompetently handled situations anybody has ever seen.""

Trump and Republicans in Congress say President Biden is to blame for the fall of Kabul to the Taliban three years ago, and the chaotic rush at the airport where 13 U.S. troops died in a suicide bomb attack that killed nearly 200 Afghan civilians trying to flee. Of late, Republicans have been emphasizing Harris' role. But the Afghanistan war spanned four U.S. presidencies, and it's important to note that it was the Trump administration that signed a peace deal that was basically a quick exit plan.

Trump regularly claims there were no casualties in Afghanistan for 18 months under his administration, and it's not true, according to Pentagon records.

-- NPR veterans correspondent Quil Lawrence

HARRIS: ""There is not one member of the military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world for the first time this century.""

This is a common administration talking point, and it's technically true. But thousands of troops in Iraq and on the Syrian border are still in very dangerous terrain. U.S. troops died in Jordan in January on a base that keeps watch over the war with ISIS in Syria.

-- NPR veterans correspondent Quil Lawrence

HARRIS: ""I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as vice president United States, and in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the inflation Reduction Act which opened new leases for fracking.""

When she first ran for president in 2019, Harris had said she was firmly in favor of banning fracking -- a stance she later abandoned when she joined President Biden's campaign as his running mate.

In an interview with CNN last month, Harris attempted to explain why her position has changed from being against fracking to being in favor of it.

""What I have seen is that we can grow, and we can increase a clean energy economy without banning fracking,"" Harris told CNN's Dana Bash.

Under the Biden/Harris administration, the U.S. produced a record amount of oil last year -- averaging 12.9 million barrels per day. That eclipsed the previous record of 12.3 million barrels per day, set under Trump in 2019. 2023 was also a record year for domestic production of natural gas. Much of the domestic boom in oil and gas production is the result of hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"" techniques.

In addition to record oil and gas production, the Biden-Harris administration has also coincided with rapid growth of solar and wind power. Meanwhile, coal has declined as a source of electricity.

TRUMP: ""I had a choice to make: Do I save [the Affordable Care Act] and make it as good as it can be, or do I let it rot? And I saved it.""

During his presidency, Trump undermined the Affordable Care Act in many ways -- for instance, by slashing funding for advertising and free ""navigators"" who help people sign up for a health insurance plan on HealthCare.gov. And rather than deciding to ""save"" the ACA, he tried hard to get Congress to repeal it, and failed. When pushed Tuesday on what health policy he would put in its place, he said he has ""concepts of a plan.""

The Biden administration has reversed course from Trump's management of the Affordable Care Act. Increased subsidies have made premiums more affordable in the marketplaces, and enrollment has surged. The uninsurance rate has dropped to its lowest point ever during the Biden administration.

The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 and is entrenched in the health care system. Republicans successfully ran against Obamacare for about a decade, but it has faded as a campaign issue this year."
Trump And Harris Spar Over Jobs At Debate: Here Are The Facts,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/09/10/trump-and-harris-spar-over-jobs-at-debate-here-are-the-facts/,2024-09-11T01:48:33Z,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris feuded in Tuesday's debate over job creation, ever a hot-button topic ahead of presidential elections -- and while the labor market has performed better during Joe Biden's presidency than it did under Trump in terms of total job creation and unemployment, that is far from the whole story.

Wage growth has been slightly higher under Biden, with average hourly earnings growing by 17% under Biden thus far compared to 15% during Trump's presidency. But the Trump-era wage growth went much further for Americans, as it outpaced inflation more strongly, with the consumer price index rising by 8% from Jan. 2017 to Jan. 2021 compared to 19% from Jan. 2021 to July 2024. Americans saved an average of 8.7% of their monthly paychecks under Trump compared to less than 6% under Biden, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis' monthly personal savings rate metric.

It's ""very difficult"" to say the changes in the labor market were a product of ""one presidential administration versus the other,"" Felix Koeing, a professor of economics at Carnegie Mellon University, told Forbes. The labor market was ""very strong"" prior to COVID-19 under Trump and remains so under Biden, according to Koeing. The macroeconomic factors driving much of the labor market trends that were ""not so unique to the U.S.,"" like 2020's massive uptick in unemployment and labor shortages. ""Lots of this might just be coincidence"" rather than the result of Trump's and Biden's policies, noted Koeing.

The stronger spending power is perhaps the best feather in Trump's cap in terms of shepherding the world's largest economy, reflected in polling which suggests just 19% of Americans believe they are better off financially since Biden took office, compared to 50% who think they are worse off. Just as the Biden economy benefited at a high level from inheriting a weak labor market, it was similarly doomed by grappling with a global inflation crisis partially stemming from a variety of factors outside of Washington's control like supply chain delays due to COVID-19. Still, the U.S. economy has been remarkably robust under both presidents. Gross domestic product, a metric which measures the total value of all goods and services produced in the U.S., is up 50% from 2015 to 2023. Under both presidents, the unemployment rate has been below where it was for the entirety of Barack Obama's 2008-2016 presidency marred by the fallout from the financial crisis, save for the 2020-2021 pandemic blip.

The labor market is at a potential inflection point, with unemployment sitting above 4% for the last four months, breaking a 2.5-year streak below that threshold, and August job growth coming in at its weakest level since 2017."
Trump Falsely Claims Inflation 'Worst In Our Nation's History': Here's The Truth,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/09/10/trump-falsely-claims-inflation-worst-in-our-nations-history-heres-the-truth/,2024-09-11T01:24:44Z,"Former President Donald Trump wrongly stated inflation is ""probably the worst in our nation's history"" during Tuesday's debate with Vice President Kamala Harris -- repeating the false claim he frequently makes to criticize President Joe Biden's economic policies, though inflation has been higher than usual in recent years.

Harris has promised to tamp down on ""price gouging"" if she's elected, as the Biden-Harris administration has sought to blame inflation partly on what Democrats have referred to as ""greedflation,"" accusing companies of selling a smaller amount of goods for the same price. Some research (such as a study by the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco) shows that markup patterns over the past three years were on par with previous recoveries. Some economists also say general cost-reduction mechanisms could be counterproductive, and price-gouging restrictions are unnecessary as inflation has cooled.

Trump has pitched higher tariffs on imported goods -- especially from China -- as well as lower taxes and more energy production. Most experts believe Trump's tariff proposals would lead to an increase in costs and generally hurt the economy, in part by contributing to a decrease in consumer spending, increase in unemployment rates and slower economic growth, according to an analysis by the nonpartisan think tank the Peterson Institute for International Economics. Some 56% of economic experts polled by the Wall Street Journal also believe inflation would be worse under Trump than Biden, while 16% said it would be better and the rest said there would be no difference (the newspaper polled 68 experts in early July). Those who believe it would be worse primarily cited Trump's tariff policies and his promise to deport all undocumented migrants, which could leave a hole in the labor market in some industries.

Harris and Trump met for the first time Tuesday in their first and only scheduled debate before Election Day, hosted by ABC News, in what's widely considered the most consequential night of the 2024 campaign.

81%. That's the share of registered voters who say the economy is ""very important"" to their vote in the 2024 election, more than any other issue, according to an Aug. 26-Sept. 2 Pew Research survey. The majority, 55%, are confident Trump would make good decisions about the economy, versus 45% who said they're confident in Harris.

Harris has centered her economic proposals around boosting the middle class, including plans to tackle the rising cost of groceries by tamping down on ""price gouging,"" expanding tax credits for low- and middle-income families and ending taxes on tips -- a policy Trump also endorses and initially proposed. The agenda is largely reflective of Biden's policies, but is strategically vague in order to avoid attacks from the business community and instead garner its support, according to The New York Times. Trump, meanwhile, has centered his economic agenda around raising tariffs and cutting regulations and taxes, such as the corporate tax rate.

Questions For The Kamala Harris And Donald Trump Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmichelson2/2024/09/10/questions-for-the-kamala-harris-and-donald-trump-debate/,2024-09-11T00:17:13Z,"As Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump do their last minute preparations for tonight's debate, I queried a handful of experts for questions they suggest - or would like - to be asked, and tossed in a few of my own.

Here are proposed questions the moderators might want to use:

2. Do you believe in democracy? What is your definition of democracy?

3. The peaceful transfer of power is a fundamental principle of democracy. You and Vice President Harris never met in person before tonight because you refused to attend the peaceful transfer of power during the inauguration. Why didn't you attend?

4. You have repeatedly threatened there would be violence, including referring to a ""bloodbath,"" if you lose this election. We experienced that on January 6th when your supporters stormed the Capitol and tried to hang Vice President Mike Pence. Why are you promoting violence?

5. How will you bring the American people together after the election if you win when at least half the public thinks you are unfit to be president again?

7. You repeatedly say that the United States is a failing nation, yet inflation is now lower than it was when you left office, the stock market has achieved historic highs, unemployment is lower than it was when you took office. The U.S. economy has rebounded faster and better than any other nation after the pandemic. What metrics do you have for describing the U.S. economy as failing?

8. The Inflation Reduction Act is pumping billions of dollars in to Republican-dominated, so called ""red"" states, including Texas, Florida, and Georgia, creating thousands of new jobs and boosting those states' economies. Members of Congress and Senators who voted against those bills have even taken credit for them with their constituents and shown up at ribbon cuttings for projects funded by them. If you are re-elected, you have claimed on the campaign trail that you'll reverse this legislation. Why would you undo all that economic growth across the country?

9. The Securities and Exchange Commission has issued its final climate risk disclosure rules, which are on hold as legal challenges work their way through the system. However, investors have been clamoring for such rules for years, because of the measurable financial risks of climate change as visible in the devastation to communities, homes and businesses from extreme weather events. The financial markets see these rules as a way to measure the financial risk companies are taking and how they are preparing for it. Other countries have similar rules and companies that do business overseas need to meet most of those rules too, so they have to do the same reporting. What action would you take regarding those climate rules?

10. You appointed U.S. Supreme Court judges who would overturn Roe v. Wade and bragged about it. Yet, you have changed your position on abortion over the years. What is your position on abortion and reproductive rights?

1. You have pivoted positions on fracking and oil and gas. Why did you change positions and what is your position today on fracking and can the American people trust that you will stick to that position this time?

2. The Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Act that you helped develop and pass include billions of dollars for energy projects, including mostly clean energy, but also carbon capture and natural gas, which favor the oil and gas sectors. But permitting challenges cause these and other energy and infrastructure projects to take as long as seven years in some cases. What specifically will you do to expedite the permitting process without compromising the analysis of the potential impact on the environment and communities?

3. President Biden angered the environmental community by approving the Willow pipeline and allowing some oil and gas drilling in public lands. What is your position on pipelines and why?

4. What is your position on nuclear energy and why? How will you ensure that communities with even the small nuclear reactors are safe?

5. During the campaign and at the Democratic National Convention, climate change and related policies seem to have been sidelined. There were a couple of very short presentations related to it at the convention, but all the mentions focused on clean air and water and not on the impact of climate change. Why and how much importance will addressing climate change have in your administration?

6. Many areas of the country have repeatedly had devastating hurricanes and floods, yet communities continue to rebuild in those areas, putting their lives, homes, businesses and communities at risk. Some insurance companies have even pulled out of those areas because they are tired of the high payouts. NOAA and other scientists predict that these storms will become more ferocious and more frequent and, therefore, potentially more damaging and life-threatening. Extreme weather events over the past 30-40 years have already cost nearly $3 trillion, according to NOAA. Will your administration put limits on where people can rebuild after such devastating weather events?

7. If elected, will you propose to increase the number of seats on the U.S. Supreme Court? If so, how and why?

. During the Biden-Harris administration, the influx of undocumented immigrants at the border hit historic highs. The numbers are much lower now, down to levels from when you and President Biden took office. What will your border and immigration policies be in your new administration and how will you get them passed if you have a divided Congress and Senate?

9. Most Americans want abortion to be safe, legal and rare, and there are millions of people who are offended by abortion as well. When the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and turned these decisions over to the states, about 26 state legislatures passed bans of some level on abortion rights and their governors signed them into law. What will your abortion policy be that respects the various choices of all Americans on this issue?

10. Polling on the American electorate reflects that there is a great deal of divisiveness in the country. If you are elected, there will still be millions of people who did not vote for you and who support the very different policies of Mr. Trump. How will you bring such a divided country together if you are elected?

And then there are plenty of foreign policy questions, related to Israel and Gaza, Ukraine and Russia, China, The European Union and beyond."

SHANNON BREAM, FOX NEWS ANCHOR: Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris prepare to go head-to-head for the first time on the debate stage in battleground Pennsylvania.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT & 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She was in charge of the border. It's the worst border in the history of the world. There's never been a country that allowed 21 million people to come in over a three-year period.

KAMALA HARRIS (D), VICE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES & 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: He plans to give billionaires massive tax cuts and to cut corporate taxes by over a trillion dollars even as they pull in record profits.

BREAM (voice-over): The candidates going on the attack over the top issues for voters, from the border crisis to the economy, and guns after yet another school shooting in America -- all sure to come up at Tuesday's debate.

We'll hear from senators from both sides of the aisle, Republican John Cornyn, who represents the key border state of Texas, which has struggled to deal with millions of migrants, and Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy, a Harris-Walz campaign surrogate.

Then --

REPORTER: Do you think your father might pardon you now that he's no longer running for re-election?

BREAM: A twist in the Hunter Biden saga as the embattled first son pleads guilty to federal tax evasion charges, sparing the family a lengthy and potentially embarrassing trial.

We'll get reaction from our Sunday panel who also weigh in on how judges in two of Trump's four criminal cases may test the bounds of his Supreme Court presidential immunity victory.

All, right now, on ""FOX News Sunday"".

(END VIDEOTAPE)

BREAM (on camera): Hello from FOX News in Washington.

Here's a look at some of your headlines:

A manhunt underway this morning in southeastern Kentucky after several people were hurt in a shooting and a crash on I-75. The sheriff's office says five people were shot, all are in stable condition, two other people were injured in a vehicle crash during all the confusion. Authorities do not think the gunfire was sparked by road rage. The search for the shooter resumed at daybreak.

Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets in Tel Aviv this weekend, calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach an agreement with Hamas to release the rest of the Israeli hostages.

And former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are gearing up for the ABC presidential debate on Tuesday. In a moment, we'll bring in two senators to discuss the stakes, Texas Republican John Cornyn and Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy.

But, first, we're going to give you some live team coverage of the campaign. Alexis McAdams live in Pittsburgh following the Harris team, but we begin with Rich Edson live in Hudson, Wisconsin with the Trump team.

Hey, Rich.

RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Shannon.

Former President Donald Trump's final campaign event before Tuesday's debate, at least that's on his schedule, it was a rally here in Wisconsin part of the northern Midwest blue wall the Democrats will likely have to defend if they want to maintain control of the White House.

The president began the rally. His airplane flew a few hundred feet above the tarmac at Mosinee, Wisconsin, a conservative area, about 90-minute drive west of Green Bay. In a speech lasting 100 minutes, the former president said he'd raise tariffs, secure the border and have the war in Ukraine finished, done and settled before Inauguration Day.

He touted his VP pick, Senator J.D. Vance, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who suspended his campaign to endorse Trump.

He called the current administration stupid and corrupt.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: He is the worst president in history. She will be worse than him. She will be worse than him, and Trump is never wrong. I am never ever wrong.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

EDSON: Trump's been outlining plans for the economy. On top of tariffs, he's pushing a new commission on government efficiency led by Elon Musk. He says he also wants to cut regulations, in taxes. Democrats say his proposals are little more than a giveaway to the rich.

Now, we asked the Trump campaign how the former president is preparing for Tuesday's debate, campaign official responded, what's debate prep? Shannon?

BREAM: Okay, we'll see how that pans out.

Rich Edson, reporting from Hudson, Wisconsin, thank you.

Joining us now, Alexis McAdams, live in Pittsburgh where the prep is a little bit different.

Hello, Alexis.

ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Shannon. Trump might not be preparing and locked away in a room. He might be at rallies, but that's not the case here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Kamala Harris, the vice president, has been in a hotel for a few days, really hunkering down and trying to prep to get ready to take on Donald Trump on the debate stage on Tuesday.

She basically said it's like cramming for finals, right? Where you can't wait to get out and the getting out part was the best part. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: Being at this spice store I finally got out of the debate prep, to look at these spices, best part of debate prep so far.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCADAMS: But it was not just a visit to any spice store, Shannon. The vice president stopped at Penzeys Spices in downtown Pittsburgh. Penzeys is known for posting attacks about the GOP. The nationwide chain even offered a discount the other month to celebrate Trump's indictments, sending this out in an email, saying: Re-indicted and it feels so good, and calling that spice ""Justice"".

The Trump team firing back about that stop, saying: Sorry, Kamala, scary spice is already taken.

Despite being at that shop Harris says America is ready to move on from political attacks.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: Look, it's time to turn the page on the divisiveness. It's time to bring our country together, charting a new way forward.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCADAMS: Harris also thanking Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney for their endorsement.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: I think that what they both as leaders who are well respected are making an important statement that it's okay and if not important to put country above party, and I'm honored to have their support.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCADAMS: Ahead of the debate, the Harris campaign says they're not happy with some of ABC's rules, including muted microphones, which it claims will benefit Donald Trump, saying this, quote: We understand that Donald Trump is at risk to skip the debate altogether if we don't do this preferred format. We don't want to jeopardize this debate, so for that reason, we accept this full set of rules.

But they don't seem too happy about it.

Back out here live in Pittsburgh, Shannon, Trump won the coin flip, so he'll get the final word at the debate. We'll have to see what happens -- Shannon.

BREAM: All right. Alexis McAdams from Pittsburgh, thank you so much.

Joining us now, Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn.

Welcome to ""FOX News Sunday"".

SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): Great to be with you.

BREAM: So I know last year during the primary season, you had some concerns about whether President Trump was the right way forward for the party. You wanted to know whether he can expand beyond his fervent base which is clearly sticking with him.

Do you think he's done enough to build a coalition outside of that? What does he need to do Tuesday night?

CORNYN: Well, I think he needs to let Kamala Harris talk, something she's been reluctant to do unless she's reading a teleprompter. And I think -- you know, we've seen the polls very close, but mainly, she's coming off of this -- as James Carville called it -- a sugar high, after the coup d'etat that was committed against Joe Biden, and then, of course, the convention.

So I'm looking forward to a repetition of the good debate performance that President Trump had with President Biden and I think -- I think he's up to it.

BREAM: So after that change at the top of the ticket, there's been a lot of new enthusiasm, new fundraising and there is talk about how that's impacting down ballot.

""Politico"" says that Republicans are starting to get a little concerned about the fundraising gap, saying this: Panic is starting to set in. The only thing preventing us from having a great night in November is the massive financial disparity our party currently faces. That's from the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

He says: Unless something changes drastically in the next weeks, we will lose winnable seats.

Are you worried about this down ballot impact on efforts by the GOP to retake the Senate?

CORNYN: Well, fundraising is important, but so are the issues, so are the quality of the candidates. And I think we have an outstanding group of candidates running for the Senate. I'm optimistic about our chances to regain the majority, and I hope they have enough money to defend themselves and to talk about what they are for, what they would do if elected and I'm confident they will.

But, yeah, the money is just astronomical. It just blows my mind.

BREAM: It really is. I mean, when you watch she's taking in, the millions that have come in just at the presidential race, hundreds of millions just the last few weeks.

Of course, you were in the running to replace Mitch McConnell as the Senate's top Republican. What will your priorities be should you achieve that post and how might that differ if you're dearing (ph) -- dealing with a Harris-Walz administration versus a Trump-Vance administration?

CORNYN: Well, when President Trump is reelected along with my colleague J.D. Vance, I expect we'll be helping the administration pass their agenda and I don't see a lot of daylight between what Republicans in the Senate want to do or know we need to do, things like reauthorize the expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We need to reestablish ourself, our nation, as the preeminent leader in the world when it comes to national security matters under President Biden. Our friends don't trust us and our enemies don't fear us. It was the opposite under President Trump.

So we'll be working very closely with the administration to accomplish their priorities, and I don't really see, as I said, a lot of daylight between what my colleagues in the Senate want to do next year.

We're going to have to also though look at the -- look at the debt. We're now spending more money on interest on the national debt than we are on defense.

And, right now, the world has gotten more dangerous, and most dangerous since World War II. So we have a lot of heavy lifting to do and it'll help the more -- the bigger our majority is.

BREAM: So let's talk about a couple things you mentioned there, the tax cuts. You know, Democrats from the vice president on down say that they are -- President Trump, a rich guy, giving cuts to rich people. And when you talk about the debt that those kinds of tax cuts actually leave a revenue lag for the federal government and contribute to things like the debt.

CORNYN: Well, the American people are not under taxed. The federal government spends too much.

BREAM: Do you mean (ph) both parties do that?

CORNYN: Well, there's some complicity there. Certainly during COVID-19, there was a lot of bipartisan efforts to keep our economy afloat and to help deal with this pandemic.

But there's been a lot of partisan spending, gasoline really on the inflation fire, $2.7 trillion in partisan spending bills post-COVID. But I think we're at an inflection point.

Part of the problem is we spend money in ways that are not just appropriations. We spend $1.8 trillion in the tax code. There's about $200 billion alone that's spent through the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit.

I'm for those but I do think they need to be offset. They need to be paid for. And so, we need to look at all of that $6 trillion in federal spending and determine what our priorities are as a nation. I think that's our job.

BREAM: Well, and we also are about to get to the end of government funding facing another continuing resolution sort of that short-term financial band-aid. It looks like the House is going to send it over with the SAVE Act attached, which basically says if you're going to go register to vote in federal elections, you have to show proof that you're a U.S. citizen.

A number of Senate Democrats have said that's dead on arrival. It's not going to happen.

How worried are you about this thing pinging back and forth and facing a shutdown? Is that going to hurt Republicans in, you know, this final stretch of an election?

CORNYN: Well, Shannon, in a sane world, the SAVE Act would be non- controversial. It essentially is a national voter ID, and I would think both parties and everybody would be interested in protecting the integrity of the ballot, making sure that people only legally qualified to vote do so.

But it's become a partisan issue which is amazing to me, and -- but I don't think there's going to be a shutdown. We'll see -- the House will have to move first and they got to get to 218. And then it comes to the Senate, I hope we'll have a debate and an opportunity to vote on it.

And I can't imagine that Senator Schumer is excited about having his incumbents who were running tough Senate races voting against a bill that just says you have to be an American citizen to vote.

BREAM: That'll be in the next couple of weeks we think.

But I want to touch down the border because, clearly, Texas bears a huge brunt of this and what's going on there. The vice president though has been touting her work. She says she -- she was tough on cartels and gangs and she's litigated against these people, held them accountable.

She also said this in her DNC speech:

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades, the Border Patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign. So he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal.

(BOOING)

HARRIS: Well, I refuse to play politics with our security.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: I won't be surprised if your colleague, Senator Chris Murphy, brings this up when we talk to him next. It has been a messaging talking point that has stuck for Democrats, this idea that President Trump is the one who kept the border problem alive because he told you guys not to vote for it.

CORNYN: Well, that's just false is a short answer to that. And the truth is that the Biden-Harris administration has spent three and a half years dismantling all of the Trump border security policies that produced a far better outcome at the border.

I was just down in the Rio Grande Valley a couple weeks ago with Senator John Boozman from Arkansas, and the way the Border Patrol explained it to me, they said, this is a shell game.

Now, the federal government if you use the CBP One app, Customs and Border Protection One app, you can schedule an appointment at a port of entry, and the Biden administration -- the Biden-Harris administration will simply usher you into the United States and give you a work permit.

That is a huge magnet on continued illegal immigration. So we need to return to the policies of the previous administration. Remain in Mexico just is one of them, but this is all a shell game in my view.

BREAM: We will see and whoever wins White House, House, Senate, whether it's divided or together, there hasn't been much progress on the issue of immigration. So, we'll see.

Thank you for stopping by. Always good to see you, Senator.

CORNYN: Thanks, Shannon.

BREAM: All right. Up next, less than 60 days until Election Day, both Vice President Harris and former President Trump revealing new details about their economic plans this week. We're going to bring in Harris-Walz campaign surrogate, Senator Chris Murphy, to discuss what Harris is proposing and whether she's actually breaking from President Biden. He's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BREAM: Ahead of Tuesday's showdown, Vice President Kamala Harris is in practice sessions sharpening her attack lines against the former president as a brand new ""New York Times/Siena"" poll shows the race in a dead heat.

Joining me now, Harris-Walz Campaign Surrogate, Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, member of the Harris-Walz Campaign's National Advisory Board. Welcome back. Good to see you.

SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Yeah, great to be here.

BREAM: OK. So we're all looking at this debate. There is a lot at stake for both of these candidates, given how tight this race is. Mark Penn, longtime Democratic strategist, worked for both the Clintons, has this to say. He says, ""One interview. One debate. Some rah rah stump speech you read over and over. And voila, you have a 50% chance of being president."" He goes on to say, ""No two years of primaries, coalition building, no detailed policy development, and no daily press briefings or tests of leadership. It's only the most important job in the world, with a $6 trillion budget and thousands of nuclear weapons."" He says, ""real democracy calls for more debates, more interviews.""

Listen, the policy section of the website remains blank last I checked. So when are we going to get more from the Vice President?

MURPHY: Well, I think you have heard the Vice President roll out several very important detailed policy proposals. She just proposed a massive tax cut for small businesses. She's proposed a massive investment in housing to bring the cost of rent and mortgages down for Americans. She's going to go after price gougers to try to make sure that we continue to drive inflation down. She wants an expansion of the child tax credit. She's investing in the middle class.

She's talking about an opportunity agenda where everybody has the chance to succeed, which is very different than Donald Trump's agenda. Donald Trump has made it very clear, if you put him back in power, he's going to think about only one group of people, and that's his friends at Mar-a-Lago, another massive tax cut for the richest people in America.

So I don't doubt that Kamala Harris will continue to roll out proposals to invest in small businesses, to invest in the middle class. I think the contrast is pretty striking between a candidate on the Democratic side who wants to make sure that we grow the economy from the middle out. And Donald Trump, who still believes in this magical thinking of trickle-down economics, where if you give him and his friends billions of dollars, eventually that'll find its way down to everybody else. That's just not how it works.

BREAM: Well, you know there's analysis. These are IRS numbers, so we assume that's neutral data, and they say that every class of taxpayer benefited from the round of tax cuts that came under the Trump administration, that it wasn't just the top 1%, that it really did benefit everybody who pays taxes in any way.

We've also got, this week, in talking about the Vice President's economic rollout, one of the skeptics of her plans wrote this over the ""Washington Free Beacon,"" listening to Harris extol the virtues of enterprise, you'd have no idea that she cast the deciding vote on the spending splurge that drove historic inflation, that her administration has imposed almost $1.4 trillion in regulations, and that she wants to weaken right-to-work laws and wants Congress to pass $5 trillion of new taxes over 10 years.

MURPHY: Well, listen, let's compare the economic record of Donald Trump against the economic record of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Under this administration, we have seen record job growth in this country. We have manufacturing booming, unemployment at a record low.

When Donald Trump left office, we had unemployment at a record high. He told us if --

BREAM: We were in the middle of the pandemic, to be fair.

MURPHY: We were going to rebuild the manufacturing sector under Donald Trump. We lost manufacturers' jobs. So there is a clear contrast between Donald Trump's record as president where our economy fell to pieces and Kamala Harris and Joe Biden --

BREAM: In the middle of the pandemic.

MURPHY: -- who have rebuilt the economy. And by the way, driven down inflation at a rate faster than all of our other high-income nation competitors.

BREAM: But, again, President Trump handed off, he will argue I'm sure Tuesday night, an inflation rate of 1.4% in the middle of a pandemic, the majority of jobs lost during the pandemic had come back. We spiked to 9, more than 9%. I mean 40 years we haven't seen those kinds of numbers.

MURPHY: Correct and that happened in every single high-income economy because coming out of the pandemic no country had the supply chains sufficient to be able to withstand the surge in demand, but it is also true that over the last four years, inflation has come down faster in the United States than those other countries.

GDP has grown at a faster rate than those other countries and today we are sitting in an economy where anybody who wants a job can get one because we have record low unemployment.

Donald Trump is advertising that he is going to bring back the same kind of chaotic economic policies the same investment in the top 1% in corporations that helped drive our economy into a ditch during his time in office.

BREAM: OK, again, what he's going to say is poverty was down, home ownership was up, inflation was at 1.4, gas was at 230 something a gallon. I mean he's going to maybe be happy to stand on his policies. And when we poll people they tell us they were doing better under President Trump than they've done under this administration. So they do have a head-to-head comparison.

And on this issue of inflation and where we go from here, there was a study out this summer from a bunch of folks including some MIT professors who said, the research shows that mathematically the overwhelming driver of a burst of inflation in 2022 was federal spending not the supply chain.

I mean, I'm no MIT scholar so I'll defer to them. But he says it was the massive spending that as I talked about with Senator Cornyn, people on both sides of the aisle voted for under this administration. But there were tough things where the Vice President was the tie-breaking vote. She says proudly on the Inflation Reduction Act which President Biden said this week they shouldn't have named it that because that's not what it was.

MURPHY: Although, look at the chart, the minute we pass the Inflation Reduction Act, inflation started to decrease at stunning levels in this country. And by the way, that piece of legislation is growing manufacturing jobs all over the country, is cutting prescription drug costs for senior citizens.

I'm proud of the fact that we are doing our part to try to clean up the environment. I'm proud of the fact that that legislation finally took on the drug industry and said we're not going to put seniors in a position where they go bankrupt because of their prescription drug costs.

Donald Trump was in office for four years he did nothing to take power away from the drug industry. Prescription drug prices skyrocketed under Donald Trump. The Inflation Reduction Act for the first time did something about transferring power from the drug industry to regular people. That's the difference between these two candidates.

Donald Trump is going to put power in the hands of the big corporations. He's promised the big oil industry that he will do anything they want as long as they donate a billion dollars to his reelection campaign.

Kamala Harris says that he's going to continue to take power away from the big oil companies, the big drug companies, the big insurance companies and put that power back in the hands of regular people.

BREAM: Well, one of his -- his arguing points about the economy is he does want to enable, you know, the industry oil and gas industry to do more production. He says we shouldn't be dependent on places that don't have our best interests at heart.

MURPHY: So ask yourself this, were we producing more domestic oil and gas under Donald Trump or under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? We're producing more domestic oil and gas today under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris than under Donald Trump.

What we are also doing is making historic new investments in renewable energy so we're also bringing much more wind power and solar power onto the grid. What Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have shown is that you can do both. You can continue to develop and explore for oil here in the United States and you can do our part to solve climate change.

Under Donald Trump, we weren't doing either. We were drilling for less oil. We were exploring less gas and we weren't doing anything about the climate crisis.

BREAM: OK let's talk about something else the Vice President put out this week which was raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. The Joint Committee on Taxation bipartisan congressional entity says that actually would mean even the lowest income Americans, I mean, they would be paying higher taxes. Because of that they say, in reason, puts it this way:

""Higher corporate taxes are passed along to consumers, employees, and investors in the form of high prices, lower wages and lower investment returns. If you buy things, have a job or save for retirement, higher corporate income taxes will fall on you no matter how many times Biden or Harris try to pretend otherwise.""

MURPHY: Yeah, I mean, this -- this is obviously the argument made by the billionaire class and the corporate class --

BREAM: OK but by the Joint Committee on Taxation.

MURPHY: If you raise taxes on us, ultimately we will just pass those down to other people. Some people want tax fairness in this country. They are sick and tired of these massive American companies paying 0% tax rates. That's what some of the biggest companies in the country were paying, zero under Donald Trump.

There's nobody in this country Republicans or Democrats that thinks that's fair except for Donald Trump. So yes Kamala Harris believes that if you're a corporation in this country you should pay some taxes. Yes, she believes that if you're making a billion dollars in this economy, you should help pay for our schools. You should help try to make our communities safer.

I don't think Americans believe this argument that by raising taxes by a couple percentage points on a handful of billionaires that, that ultimately is going to ruin the economy.

Kamala Harris also says that she's going to cut taxes on small businesses. She's going to use the money that we raise in higher taxes for billionaires and transfer that to tax cuts for small businesses and low-income taxpayers.

BREAM: All of that's got -- it's got to work out somewhere on the ledger and so that's going to mean more taxes and Joint Taxation Committee says that falls to everyone. So, we will watch to see, if she wins, what you guys do in Congress and how you handle it. But thank you for coming in.

MURPHY: Thanks.

BREAM: Always good to see you.

MURPHY: Appreciate it.

BREAM: All right with the race so tight, Tuesday's debate could be make or break for these candidates. Next up, we've got two debate prep experts who've got some final words of advice for these two. And our panel is here to break down what we're learning about the Trump and Harris economic plans and how they're actually going to impact your wallets. Next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: It's a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Secretary Clinton.

HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES AND FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.

TRUMP: Because you'd be in jail.

HARRIS: To hear you talk about the reputations of two United States Senators who have built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: Just sampling of how this year's White House contenders have tackled their debate opponents in the past. So will Tuesday be more about substance or style?

I sat down earlier with two campaign veterans who've prepped presidential candidates for this, the debate stage.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BREAM: Joining me now, former Obama campaign manager, Jim Messina. And GOP communications consultant, Brett O'Donnell, who has prepped several presidential candidates for their debates.

All right. It comes down to this week. This may be the only meeting between these two we get on the stage.

""New York Times"" puts it this way. ""The debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday will be, by far, the longest unscripted setting for Ms. Harris of her candidacy. A high-risk encounter against an opponent with little regard for decorum.""

Jim, who's got more at stake on Tuesday?

JIM MESSINA, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Oh, she does. I mean, let's be honest, you know, Donald Trump is the best counterpuncher in the history of American politics.

This is his seventh presidential debate over three cycles, and this is her first. And so we're in a tight race. It was -- it was under 60 days by the time we get to the debate. And she has still a bunch of swing voters who don't have an opinion of her or waiting to see who she is and what she's going to stand for. So, you know, I think the advantage is to Trump going into this. But, you know, as we all know, all strategy goes out the moment you get on that debate stage.

BREAM: Well, and I think it's fascinating. These two have never met face to face. Going to a presidential debate for your first meeting is a little bit intimidating. They've got different prep strategies. The vice president holding up in Pittsburgh for several days to hone what she's been working on.

President Trump and his team saying, he does debate prep every day simply by engaging in hostile interviews and doing these press conferences.

But, Brett, I want to play something about what he said he plans to do. Here's President Trump.

TRUMP: When I had Biden, you and I had the same discussion. And I let him talk. I'm going to let her talk because, you know.

BREAM: So, do you think he will be able to just simply sit back and let her explain her positions, get herself maybe into a hole she's got to dig out of?

BRETT O'DONNELL, GOP COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT: Well, he did in the first debate, especially for the first 30 minutes. That's where Biden done did himself. I mean, Biden actually fulfilled the one principle of presidential debates.

You can't win an election in one, but you can lose it. Joe Biden did it and it was because the president was more disciplined, particularly in those first 30 minutes.

BREAM: Well, and as for her debate, NBC News reports this about her strategy. They say, ""Harris and her team are focusing on homing in on how to needle Trump to rattle him. Another source said the Harris team plans to emphasize what it views as Trump's advanced age and lack of details on policy proposals.""

And, Jim, that's -- obviously, we've got different optics than we did about the June debate where President Trump and his team had spent, you know, tens of millions of dollars and invested in this strategy that President Biden was too old and unable to move forward in his campaign. Are the tables turned now?

MESSINA: Well, look, let me make you one guarantee, your first guarantee of this T.V. appearance. There's no way Donald Trump is going to sit back and let her just talk to country about what she wants and what she wants to do.

And the reason is, you know, we're in a tight race. He is -- he is stuck. He can't move over 47 percent. And so he's got to bring her down to him. And so what she wants to do is exactly that.

Her job -- she has two jobs. One is to look at the American public and be presidential. And the second is to draw a very clear contrast between him and her.

I used to say to Obama, if it's a referendum on you, we'll lose. If it's a choice between you and Romney or you and McCain, we will win. And so I think she's going into that exactly.

And Donald Trump, I promise you, is not going to sit there and let her have at it.

BREAM: All right. We'll see. Because it's 90 minutes. It's hard to resist the urge when both of these, you know, are, I would say, have known how to be combative fighter. She's been a federal prosecutor. You see him each time that he gets out there and defends his position.

Here's what we know about the rules. Obviously, no live audience, no opening statements, no props allowed. And candidates' microphones will be muted when their opponent is on the clock, a stipulation that's created controversy in recent days. The two teams fighting about this.

In fact, the Harris campaign, one of the senior advisors sent a letter to ABC which is hosting the event saying this. ""Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the vice president. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign's insistence on muted microphones.""

But, Brett, a lot of people who support President Trump actually felt it worked for him this particular rule in that Biden debate.

O'DONNELL: It did work for him from the first debate, but I do think that that message from the Harris campaign is nothing more than a head fake. It's meant to, again, bait the president into a personal debate.

I mean, I think the Harris campaign would love nothing more than if this debate was all about personality and persona and not about policy. Because as long as the debates focused on policy, that means Kamala Harris has to explain the differences between Kamala Harris four years ago and Kamala Harris now, which I think is an opportunity for President Trump to attack her on.

If the debate is about personality, and she can get under his skin, I think that is much better territory for the -- for the Harris campaign.

BREAM: OK. Real quick because we're almost out of time. I want to ask you both the same question. What's your, one, best piece of advice for, Brett, for you, for the Trump campaign?

O'DONNELL: Keep the debate focused on policy, not about persona.

BREAM: And, Jim, your piece of advice to the Harris team.

MESSINA: It's all about future. I would write future above my little white pad on there. And I would never stop putting her in the future and him in the past. And if she does that, she'll be the president of the United States.

BREAM: All right. Jim and Brett, we know you are both be watching as we all will on Tuesday night. Thanks for your insights.

MESSINA: Thank you.

O'DONNELL: Thanks for having us.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

BREAM: All right. Let's see what our Sunday group thinks. ""USA Today"" Washington Bureau Chief, Susan Page. You'll remember, she moderated the 2020 vice presidential debates. Mary Katharine Ham, Fox News contributor and OutKick columnist. Fox News senior political analyst, Juan Williams. And Guy Benson Townhall.com political editor, Fox News contributor, and host of The Guy Benson Show. Welcome, everybody.

All right. Susan, you have a piece out about this this morning. I mean, you were the last person to moderate a debate that Kamala Harris took part in.

SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, USA TODAY: That's right. Can you imagine she hasn't debated in four years? That might be a little bit of concern for them that she's rusty.

You know, in that debate, she hadn't been universally good in the primary debates that in -- that in 20 -- in the 2020 cycle, but she was good in the vice presidential debate. She was prepared and she made especially effective use of a putdown of Pence when he interrupted her. This may be one reason they wanted mics to be live.

She said, Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking. And the ""Mr. Vice President"" sounded very respectful and the, ""I'm speaking,"" made him risk looking disrespectful, if he kept talking over her.

BREAM: Well, we know how much is at stake. ""The New York Times"" today has brand-new polling saying this. The national poll of likely voters found Mr. Trump leading Miss Harris, 48 to 47 percent. The new poll underscores the risks and potential rewards particularly facing Miss Harris on Tuesday night when she and Trump face off.

I mean, Guy, it couldn't be any closer.

GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Tight race. Trump now slightly back in the lead to that big bounce she got in ""The New York Times"" poll from the month-long euphoria fueled by the media seems to have dissipated significantly.

And, Shannon, I think the most significant data point within that poll is a question about Jim Messina who was just talking about the future, the change question. A vast majority of Americans in this poll say they want change.

And in this survey, a majority see Donald Trump as an agent of change, and a majority see her as more of the same. That should be Trump's overarching hammered point on Tuesday night.

BREAM: And we saw at the DNC, there was very good messaging casting her as the challenger and him as the incumbent, but it sounds like within this poll, people are starting to have a reality check on that particular issue.

Now, they both rolled out economic plans this week. Reuters says this, citing a Goldman Sachs report. Under a Republican sweep, or even with a divided government led by Donald Trump, economic output would take a hit next year, mostly from increased tariffs on imports and tighter immigration policies, according to Goldman. They say he's not the one for your economy.

MARY KATHARINE HAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I think the tariffs are something that I personally disagree with and have some policy issues with. I think he needs to point out, look, I have a vision, she has nothing on her website.

She's giving you a hand -- a sprinkling of proposals that have been frankly widely panned, including this idea of giving individual homeowners this 25K that would up housing prices and end up hurting people.

I think that he can say, look, to the extent that he can connect the reality on the ground of what is happening right now and what people are feeling, people who are not Goldman Sachs, by the way. You can make that point about that division. He wins in the reality on the ground because he says, look what your life was like four years ago and look at it now. Compare the two. And I think that's what he has to drill down on.

BREAM: Well, and that's what this ""Hill"" opinion piece this week gets to. It says, ""If Trump's policies were so terrible, why do so many people think they were better off during his presidency? Why were small-business owners and consumers consistently more upbeat than they have been during the Biden-Harris years?""

I mean, Juan, how does she navigate that reality check that people get every day when they buy groceries?

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think people have a certain nostalgia about the past.

Joe Biden's numbers have gone way up since he decided --

BREAM: Well, now that he's off the ticket.

WILLIAMS: That's what I'm saying. I think people's -- but, you know, the reality is, if you look at the numbers, the economy is better now than it was then.

So you're dealing with this kind of memory sense of things.

BREAM: OK. But what context? Just to -- just to give us a --

WILLIAMS: What the -- what the context is, Goldman Sachs, they're no left- wing organization. They're saying the economy will be better under Kamala Harris.

HAM: They're also not mom buying groceries.

WILLIAMS: And also, I think you also look at -- I think this week there was 88 top executives who came out and said, we think that the economy will spur, will boost under Kamala Harris.

And this week, Trump went before the New York Economic Club to give a speech. And it should have been, you know, given the perception that he wants to say the economy was better, it should have been a knock out for him in front of all those rich men. Instead, he delivered word salad on a question about childcare.

And my sense is, look, the job numbers are good, the stock market is good. And right now, the Federal Reserve is in a position where they're likely to raise -- I'm sorry, lower interest rates.

BREAM: Yes. Please don't say raise.

WILLIAMS: I'm sorry. Right.

Lower interest rates, which will raise, I think, opportunities for Kamala Harris to say, we have a future that's better coming under my administration.

BREAM: Well, Mary Katharine, you mentioned moms out buying groceries. You're a mom of four. That's certainly the circle that you often run in, is to hear from them about what they think.

HAM: Well, and my perspective is, if it's hurting us, I know it's hurting other people much, much more.

And it's hard to argue that the inflation, although the rate of it is falling, you're not getting back to the 1.9 that we had in January 2017, 2016, when Trump was in office, right? And this hurts people.

And your -- and when you talk about the jobs market, yet, we're adding jobs, but it's mediocre at best. And we're revising down every single month to a cumulative number that's taken a pretty big hit on those numbers.

PAGE: You know, nothing more frustrating to the Democrats than the fact that they feel that Biden and Harris do not get the credit they really deserve on the economy we have. We see a little bit of brightening of views.

But the fact is in the New York Times/Siena poll and in the USA Today/Suffolk poll, Trump continues to be preferred when it comes to handling the economy.

The change question is important. The who do you trust more to handle the economy, that is a crucial, basic question.

BENSON: Prices are up 20 percent under Biden and Harris. That's why the frustration is there because the frustration is deserved. Prices are up 20 percent. People feel that.

BREAM: All right. Just --

WILLIAMS: I think people know that we went to a coronavirus. This is what you were stressing earlier with the Senator. And that things had to be done and that this economy is the envy of the world. There's no better economy in the entire world after the virus.

BREAM: And just a quick note here, there are two cases that are out there pending. I just want to make sure, because this race is so tight, RFK Jr. trying to get off the ballots in a number of states, both Michigan and North Carolina appeals courts, they are ruled. He comes off the ballot.

Those have been now appealed to their state's supreme courts. So we stand by this week to see in these critical states where if his name is offer on that ballot, after he fought so hard to get on, now fighting to get off.

OK. Panel, don't go anywhere.

When we come back, college students back on campus and so are those anti- Israel protests. Hear from students who say the problem starts at the top. You'll hear from them next.

And we'll discuss the implications, as tensions escalate in the Middle East and here at home.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KATIE ARYEH, BARNARD COLLEGE GRADUATE: These are protesters who are being influenced by outside organizations. The Islamic Republic of Iran is thanking them for their work. They are giving permission to these terrorists to continue their horrific acts, like murdering the American hostage, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, after he survived 11 months in captivity and torture.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: That was Barnard College graduate from our Fox Nation special ""Anti- Semitism on Campus: Back to School.""

Anti-Israel protests are starting to pop up again on college campuses as students head back to place - places like Columbia University in New York City this week. Police clashing with protesters and making arrests.

We are back now with our panel.

NBC News says this. ""Students are barely back on campus, but pro- Palestinian protests have already returned, putting a divisive issue back in the spotlight that Democrats had hoped the nomination of Vice President Kamala Harris might allow them to move beyond.""

Juan, it's not a good look.

WILLIAMS: Well, no. I mean, look, free speech is a right in our country, but there's no place for threats and intimidation and violence.

So, the thing about it is the politics, as you spotlight, Shannon, because the politics is big protests, pro-Palestinian protests, really are being used against the Harris campaign. The suggestion is that, oh, these people are more Democrats. Democrats embrace this chaos and all that.

But the Republicans have a problem with anti-Semitism. I mean this week, to see that Tucker Carlson, who spoke at the GOP convention, is giving a platform to a man who is saying that, you know, Winston Churchill was to blame for the Holocaust and the troubles during World War II, I mean that's just pathetic. That's sick! That's historical revisionism on a scale that's troubling. And I think that lots of people are starting to ask questions about this.

But in terms of the optics, if it's a big pro-Palestinian demonstration, the Republicans hope that, you know, it will be somehow a weight on the Democrats.

BREAM: Well, Mary Katharine, is it more of a problem for Democrats or Republicans, as Juan tries to make the point (ph)?

HAM: Well, one of the reasons that it can be connected to Democrats is because Tim Walz said just this week that the protesters are speaking out for all the right reasons. If you watch tape of these gatherings, yes, free speech is in action here. And the problem with colleges is they haven't been able to find the line between speech and vandalism and threats and violence. And at UCLA, blocking Jewish students from going to certain parts of campus. That was on a right-wing action happening there. But that's what I can be connected to them.

It can be connected to them also because they seem to be making, because of Walz's statement, they seem to be making political calculations about Michigan voters based upon how much they're able to come out and condemn these kind of things.

WILLIAMS: But I don't think - I think -

HAM: Although, I think Kamala Harris has had moments where she's gone there and been clear about these protesters.

WILLIAMS: I was just going to say to you that I think Walz's statement was a statement that if you look at the devastation in Gaza and the - a number of people who are dead. I don't think you have to be Republican or Democrat. You say, something is wrong here. You have a human instinct to say, can we get a deal? And you see thousands of Israelis in the street saying, let's get a deal. Let's bring the hostages home.

HAM: But if you say all the right reasons about a group of people who are carrying Hezbollah and Hamas flags and wearing masks, that is a problem. All the right reasons?

WILLIAMS: Stop the - stop the devastation!

BREAM: OK, well, Guy, we talked about the - during the commercial too, that Tim Walz is out there on the campaign trail and he did get a direct question about the death of Hersh Goldberg-Polin and said, OK, thanks, everyone, time to go. I am trying to figure out whether he didn't hear it or whether he does not want to touch that subject.

BENSON: Or any subject, right? They don't do a lot of interviews. They don't answer a lot of questions. And if you watch that particular video that you just referenced, it's - it's weird. He - he stands there. He absolutely clocks the question. You see his brain say, I'm not going to answer it. And he says, all right, thanks, everybody, and walks off with his ice cream. That's a strange response when you're asked about six hostages who have just been killed, including an American.

So, we'll see how he handles that question, if he gets something about that at the vice presidential debate, which I think we're still having. I think it's still on.

BREAM: I think it is. Yes, I hope so. We're looking forward to that one.

In the meantime, there have been protests in the streets in Tel Aviv. I mean thousands and thousands of people gathering as, Juan, you reference this, they want to deal done.

Here's a little bit of what Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is under a ton of pressure, said about trying to get there.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: It's clear Gaza must be demilitarized. And it can only be demilitarized if the Philadelphi Corridor remains under firm control and is not a - a supply line for armaments and for terror equipment. I think that's clear to most Israelis, to all Israelis.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: Susan, this is not an easy problem or - there are no easy solutions or we'd have that cease-fire. Are - are we getting further away or closer to one of those plans (ph)?

PAGE: Here's what's clear, we're not going to have a ceasefire. We're not going to have the kind of deal that the administration has - has been hoping to deliver for some time and some points said we were very close, within days of reaching. And that's because of - of actions on both sides.

Hamas has put new conditions on Israel, and Netanyahu has not been willing to make some of the compromises that the Biden administration wanted them to do. And this is an issue that divides Democrats more than Republicans. You've seen Kamala Harris continue to endorse U.S. support for Israel, not making threats about not continuing arm shipments here, but a kind of tonal shift with Harris in which she expresses more sympathy and concern about the plight of Palestinians. So, I don't know if that's enough to bridge the gap that Democrats have on this issue.

BREAM: I want to play something too from Secretary Blinken who's been traveling in the region again as they try to push towards some kind of ceasefire. Here's what he says about everyone not getting on the same page.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: Every day that goes by where it is not finalized, and the parties don't say, yes, period, is a day in which something else happens. And there is an intervening event, which simply pushes things off and runs the risk of derailing what is a - a pretty fragile apple cart.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: Guy, do you agree, that the hopes for a ceasefire are over at this point?

BENSON: Probably because one side doesn't want one. One side wants the other side to be completely obliterated and dead. And they don't just say that, they do it. They did it on October 7th, and they just murdered some more of those hostages that they stole. So, it's really hard to talk about peace or even a temporary peace when one side overtly, explicitly doesn't want one. They're not even Hamas. They're not even at the negotiating table.

We've had this series of offers that Israelis have said yes to, and Hamas had said no every time. And I saw an ""Axios"" pieces this week saying that the administration, Biden-Harris, might finally be realizing that maybe Hamas doesn't want and deal and is not acting in good faith and it's like, well, if they're coming around to that, it's - it's very late to the party.

WILLIAMS: You know, when you started speaking, I thought you were talking about Israel when you said don't want to deal. I mean, to me, the United States, and the Israelis who are in the streets in Tel Aviv, are putting pressure on the Netanyahu government and saying, we need a deal here. We want to bring our hostages home. They're not aiming their protest at Hamas.

And what we've heard from Netanyahu, in the clip that was just played is, we are intent on keeping troops on this line there with Egypt and Israel in the Gaza. And that is the absolute must, not making a deal. And I think Netanyahu doesn't want a deal because he doesn't want to any - do any favors for the Biden administration.

HAM: Existence is an absolute must, which is why they want to hold that line.

WILLIAMS: Well, they - they will exist. Yes.

BREAM: OK, panel, thank you very much. We'll see you next Sunday.

Up next, those massive demonstrations on the streets of Tel Aviv overnight demanding the Israeli government get a deal done to get the hostages out. And three Israelis shot and killed at a key border crossing overnight. We're going to take you live to Israel, next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BREAM: The Israeli government facing mounting pressure as called for a hostage deal intensify, as the country marks 11 months since Hamas' deadly attacks.

Joining us from Tel Aviv, Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst with the latest.

Hello, Trey.

TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good morning.

Organizer estimate half a million protesters gathered in the streets of Tel Aviv overnight demanding the release of Israeli hostages. The demonstration marked weekly calls for a ceasefire and hostage release deal, while putting pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Some of the protesters clashed with police and blocked the main highway that runs through Israel's second-largest city. Similar demonstrations unfolded in Jerusalem and at other locations.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ZAHIRO SHAHAR MOR, NEPHEW OF ISRAELI HOSTAGE ABRAHAM MUNDER: As long as Netanyahu remains in power, we will keep getting hostages back in body bags. Netanyahu must be removed from power in order to save the lives of the hostages and the country itself.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

YINGST: While chances of an agreement to end the war and bring the hostages home remain low, American negotiators are drafting a new proposal this weekend, trying to close the gaps between the two sides. The latest taking point reportedly has to do with Hamas demanding the release of higher-level Palestinian prisoners in the expected exchange for Israeli captives.

While diplomatic efforts continue, Israel conducted multiple air strikes against Gaza since Friday killing at least a dozen people.

While the southern front remains active, Israel's northern front is still heating up. Dozens of rockets were fired by the Iran-backed group Hezbollah, as daily exchanges of fire are ongoing along the Israel-Lebanon border. No casualties were reported from the attack.

As if the current fronts weren't active enough, today three people were killed when a gunman crossed from Jordan along Israel's eastern border.

Bosses Admit To Faking Productivity More Than Their Employees,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2024/09/10/bosses-admit-to-faking-productivity-more-than-their-employees/,2024-09-10T18:23:16Z,"This is a published version of Forbes' Careers Newsletter.

Coffee badging, quiet quitting, mouse jigglers ... there's really no need for another term to describe today's workforce. But each of those phrases could fall under the umbrella of ""fauxductivity,"" or fake productivity.

Productivity has been one of the top workplace issues discussed among experts this year, with companies fearing the effects of ""the great detachment."" Fortune 500 CEOs even ranked ""low productivity"" as their top organizational challenge for the year, according to software firm Atlassian.

And while the majority of employees are not exaggerating about their productivity, according to a Workhuman report, 48% of managers say that faking productivity is a problem on their team. But the call may be coming inside the house: 37% of managers surveyed in the report admitted to faking their productivity, compared to 32% of non-manager employees. Even more C-suite executives admit to participating in ""fauxductivity,"" with 38% saying they do.

It's clear that employees aren't the only ones faking their productivity -- their bosses are doing it, too. The phenomenon could be part of larger ""always-on"" workplace cultures.

""Managers especially are in the position to promote a workplace culture that allows employees to be human and say when they're struggling -- not turn to performative productivity,"" Meisha-ann Martin, senior director of people analytics and research at Workhuman said in the report. ""Managers themselves need to resist the urge to keep up appearances and instead be vocal about when they're taking a break.""

Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week!

Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter

As a real estate agent, broker and now CEO of his own firm, Ryan Serhant is in charge of his calendar. But it can be difficult to properly organize all the minutes of your day into the most productive, and effective, schedule. I spoke with him about how he first created his ""1,000 Minute"" rule of time management, how he's implemented it throughout his career, and the importance of establishing boundaries early on in your career. Our conversation below has been edited for length and clarity. You can check out our full interview here.

For everyone who doesn't know what this is, what is the ""1,000 Minute"" method?

So, I'm in sales, I'm an entrepreneur, which really means that I don't have a salary, I don't get paid hourly. There's no benefits. There's no nothing. You wake up every day, you eat what you kill, or you don't. When I was young, 22, living in New York City with no job, with rent, bills, electricity and food to pay, I had to figure out how to manage my day. Whether I'm trying to sell real estate or insurance or I was trying to act at the time, I saw everybody else had scheduled calendars based on their appointments, and a lot of what was set by, like, middle management or their bosses. Which then evolved to knowing that everybody has the same amount of time in a day. I just need to be the one who's the most productive with the time that I have. I also need to make sure that I don't throw days or weeks or months away if I have a bad hour or a bad call. So I looked at my calendar and said, 'all right, I've got 1,440 minutes a day. Roughly 440 of those minutes I'll sleep, I'll hang out, I'll eat, I'll do what I need to do.'

I've got about a thousand minutes a day to be productive. Now, some people have 200 minutes a day, some people have more than a thousand minutes. It really depends. But mine was about a thousand. I'm the CEO of my own bank of time, and every day I wake up with a fresh thousand dollars in my account that I get to be productive with. And it protects me against time vampires, it protects me against wasting time for all those meetings that turn into a two-hour lunch. Like, that could have been an email, that could have been a phone call, that could have been a text message. So it really helped me start to think about how I use my time wisely as an entrepreneur who does not have a salary or an hourly wage.

Has it ever become too restrictive to the point where you're stressed? So if this meeting went over 16 minutes and now you can't do this for whatever reason.

No, I don't allow myself to be like a prisoner to my own calendar. It actually helps me be far more free. For all the structure I'm talking about right now, I'll tell you, I feel far more restricted if I'm in a two hour meeting that didn't need to be two hours or if I'm on a one hour call that just didn't need to be this amount of time. There's a lack of respect there. And someone just took those minutes from me and they didn't pay me for them. Those are a far bigger waste of my time than operating under a calendar this way. Because I've been so public with my thousand minute rule, because Harvard's written about it and I wrote books about it, people know about it. People who work with me are very, very cognizant of my time. And if they don't like it, they don't have to work with me. It's okay. There's 8 billion people on the planet.

What's your biggest tip for someone who's maybe looking to get a new time management system?

The first thing I would do is do a time audit, the same way you would do a diet diary if you're trying to lose weight. Instead of just going cold turkey on sugar for the next month, which is impossible, you really just go about your day for the next week. It's the same thing with time. Actually go through and calendar every little thing you do, including access to social media. Use the screen time calculator right on your phone and it'll tell you how much time you spent on your phone and just write it down. Spend a week, seven days including the weekends, and really look at what you spent time doing. Then look back at it, color code it and say, 'holy macaroni! I thought I was working really, really hard, but I wasn't. I was just really busy and the busyness isn't productive.' So the doom scrolling and the this and that that I do is actually aiding towards making me feel bad about my life or my career or myself. How you spend your time affects you mentally as food would affect you physically. So I would tell everybody: Do a time audit for seven days, look at it and see where you can start to make compromises before you go crazy and start budgeting your time based on a thousand minutes.

News from the world of work

Fewer jobs than expected were added in August, with U.S. employers reporting an increase of only 142,000 nonfarm payroll jobs. The unemployment rate, however, dipped to 4.2%. Yet after revisions to June and July's job growth saw 86,000 fewer jobs created in that period than originally reported, the labor market remains unstable. ""August payroll data indicate risks are rising and the labor market is clearly softening,"" Carson Group strategist Sonu Varghese told Forbes' Derek Saul.

Employee retention is the name of the game -- at least that's what the Federal Reserve seems to think. In its latest ""Beige Book"" installment, which summarizes the current economic condition of the U.S. by federal reserve districts and across the board, the Fed says employment levels have remained relatively flat.

Aerospace company Boeing reached a tentative agreement with a worker's union representing 33,000 employees, potentially avoiding a strike. The deal includes 25% raises over four years for all union members and lowers healthcare cost share. Union members will vote on the tentative agreement Thursday.

The White House last week launched an initiative to fill 500,000 open cybersecurity positions across the country. The recruitment and hiring push is aimed at filling jobs in cybersecurity, technology and artificial intelligence, with a focus on bringing candidates without traditional qualifications into those positions.

Workers at major tech companies are overwhelmingly donating to Kamala Harris' presidential campaign, Reuters reports. Data from OpenSecrets, a nonprofit tracking campaign financing and lobbying, found that tech employees at Google parent Alphabet, Amazon and Microsoft are donating more to the Democratic bid for the White House, marking a stark difference from tech billionaires like Elon Musk and Marc Andreessen, who are backing Donald Trump.

That's the number of employees that companies have announced plans to hire so far this year, according to career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas, marking a 41% decrease from this time last year and the lowest year-to-date total recorded since the firm started tracking in 2005.

"Taxpayers lost more than $100B to COVID unemployment insurance fraud, committee finds",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/taxpayers-lost-more-than-100b-covid-unemployment-insurance-fraud-committee-finds,2024-09-10T12:05:14Z,"FIRST ON FOX: American taxpayers lost more than $100 billion to fraud and improper payments as a result of temporary unemployment insurance programs created in response to COVID-19, the House Oversight Committee found.

Fox News Digital obtained the House Oversight Committee's report after its monthslong investigation examining fraud in pandemic unemployment relief programs.

The report details information, documents and communications obtained by the committee showing how states across the country, including California, New York and Pennsylvania, processed and administered pandemic unemployment insurance claims with ""minimal oversight.""

The committee said that lack of oversight led to ""billions of taxpayer dollars lost to improper and fraudulent payments that will likely never be recovered.""

CUOMO TO TESTIFY ON COVID ORDERS, NURSING HOME DEATHS AS SPOKESMAN PREDICTS A 'MASTER CLASS IN GASLIGHTING'

The committee found that 11% to 15% of total benefits paid during the pandemic were fraudulent, totaling between $100 to $135 billion. The Department of Labor's Office of Inspector General estimated that at least $191 billion in pandemic unemployment insurance payments could have been improperly paid, with a ""significant portion attributed to fraud.""

The committee found that states have only recovered approximately $6.8 billion of those funds.

The committee also found that those receiving the benefits ""did not have to provide evidence that they were actively seeking work to continue receiving benefits.""

During the first nine months of the program, claimants did not have to provide any evidence of earnings, which the committee said made the program more susceptible to fraud. In December 2020, when Congress reauthorized the program, states began to require applicants to provide proof of prior employment and wages.

The Department of Labor reported that the program had a total improper payment rate of 35.9%.

FEDS WASTED 'AT LEAST' $191 BILLION ON FAKE COVID UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS, SAYS LABOR DEPARTMENT WATCHDOG

In March 2021, the Biden-Harris administration extended the pandemic unemployment insurance programs and benefits for an additional six months, even though states and businesses were open, and the vaccine rollout was underway.

""Citing labor shortages, 26 states chose to end federal benefits early citing that the exorbitant federal benefits were leading to labor shortages in those states,"" the committee found.

However, the committee also found that organized crime ""played a major role"" in unemployment insurance fraud by targeting pre-existing system vulnerabilities.

""Foreign nationals, organized criminal gangs, prison inmates, and those acting on their behalf, filed fraudulent claims in multiple states,"" the report states. ""Insiders, including those who worked for state workforce agencies, conspired with organized crime factions and other individuals to defraud state UI programs and the states did little to stop them.""

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., blamed the fraud on Democrats and the Biden-Harris administration, saying they ""spent trillions of dollars under the guise of pandemic relief.""

Comer said his committee's first hearing on the matter exposed how ""unchecked spending left taxpayer funds, including UI programs, vulnerable to significant waste, fraud, and abuse.""

CALIFORNIA, NEW YORK, ILLINOIS USED COVID-19 RELIEF FUNDS TO PUSH CRT IN SCHOOLS

""While Democrats turned a blind eye to this waste of taxpayer dollars, Republicans were committed to identifying how these taxpayer funds fell prey to fraudsters and criminal organizations,"" Comer said.

Comer said his committee's report includes recommendations to ensure future taxpayer-funded UI programs ""don't suffer a similar fate.""

""Rooting out waste, fraud, abuse, and mismanagement in the federal government remains a top priority for Oversight Republicans, and we will continue to work to protect all American taxpayers,"" Comer said.

The committee recommends that for future UI benefits programs, the government must require claimants to provide their proof of work before their claims are reviewed for eligibility.

""Unemployment insurance should always be tied to work,"" the report states.

The committee also recommends that future programs ""require state workforce agencies to cross-check"" claimants across federal databases - including federal prisoner databases.

Meanwhile, the committee recommended Congress consider extending the statute of limitations for the fraud programs associated with the pandemic UI programs, which are due to expire in March 2025, so that criminals that defrauded taxpayers may be brought to justice."
Manufacturing Weakness Could Signal Trouble For The Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/09/manufacturing-weakness-could-signal-trouble-for-the-economy/,2024-09-09T21:21:34Z,"The U.S. economy could be heading into choppy waters, and investors may be wise to buckle up. Recent data suggest that storm clouds could be gathering, with declines in U.S. manufacturing, a softening labor market and worrisome signs from the bond market all pointing to possible trouble ahead.

Manufacturing production signaled a significant weakening in demand in August. The S&P Global U.S. Manufacturing PMI posted a reading of 47.9, its lowest level in 2024 so far. Any PMI below 50 indicates contraction, and this is now the second consecutive month of declines.

Weakness in manufacturing isn't just a concern for the stock market. The industry is contracting at a time when Kamala Harris, the incumbent-party presidential candidate, is hoping to run on the administration's economic success.

If Harris takes office at a time when the business cycle is faltering, she'll face an uphill battle with a slowing jobs market, lagging home sales and a Federal Reserve caught between a rock and a hard place on interest rates. Geopolitical risks also continue to swirl in the background, creating even more uncertainty.

But the U.S. isn't alone in this struggle. In August, the JPMorgan Global Manufacturing PMI fell to 49.5, an eight-month low. Out of 31 countries surveyed, 18 showed deterioration in manufacturing conditions, including those in the euro area and Japan. The slowdown isn't confined to our shores -- it's a global issue that could have ripple effects on trade, jobs and investment opportunities.

The U.S. labor market has long been a source of strength for the economy, but it, too, is starting to send worrying signals. August's jobs report was underwhelming, and while the unemployment rate is still relatively low, the trend is going in the wrong direction. In July, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3%, which triggered what's known as the Sahm rule, a little-known but highly accurate recession indicator named after former Fed economist Claudia Sahm. As I discussed with you last month, the rule has successfully predicted every U.S. recession since 1970, so when it's activated, people take notice.

Payroll gains have also slowed over the past several months, and many economists expect that we'll see downward revisions in the number of jobs added. All of this is happening as inflation remains a persistent thorn in the side of policymakers, complicating the Fed's job as it tries to balance controlling prices with avoiding a deeper slowdown in the economy.

Sahm herself has expressed concern that the Fed might not be acting quickly enough to avoid a recession. ""The Fed can no longer afford to move gradually,"" she said recently in an interview with Goldman Sachs. ""Twenty-five basis point cuts would probably suffice to avoid the worst possible economic outcomes, but these cuts have to be delivered decisively, not gradually.""

One of the most reliable recession indicators over the last 50 years has been the yield curve, and last week, it turned positive again for the first time in over two years. An inverted yield curve, where short-term rates are higher than long-term rates, has preceded every U.S. recession since the 1970s. This occurs because market participants, anticipating future rate cuts to combat a downturn, drive long-term rates lower.

Typically, the spread between the 10-year and two-year Treasury notes is used to gauge this inversion. Before last week, the yield curve had been inverted for a staggering 783 consecutive days, the longest such period in U.S. history. Although the inversion has recently ""uninverted,"" meaning long-term rates are no longer lower than short-term rates, the damage may already be done.

Historically, there's been about a 12-month lag on average between the first inversion and the onset of a recession. But this can vary. For instance, the curve first inverted in January 2006, roughly two years before the financial crisis began in 2008. If history is any guide, the prolonged inversion we just experienced could be setting the stage for another economic downturn.

What does all this mean for investors? According to Peter Berezin, Director of Research at BCA, it may be time to rethink your portfolio strategy. Writing in the Financial Times, Berezin says that now may be the moment to rotate out of stocks and into bonds. For the last two years, stocks have been the place to be, but with a recession potentially on its way, Berezin believes bonds will soon offer a better risk-reward balance.

In a recessionary scenario, Berezin expects the S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio to fall from 21 to 16, with earnings estimates dropping by 10%. This would bring the S&P down to 3,800 -- an almost 30% decline from current levels. It's a sobering prediction, but one that can't be ignored, especially given the headwinds facing the global economy.

The Federal Reserve has been in a rate-hiking cycle for over two years now, but with economic data weakening, many expect that rate cuts are on the horizon. The first cut is anticipated to come at the September 17-18 FOMC meeting, with a reduction of 0.25% to 0.50%. While some might hope that this will stave off a recession, it's important to remember that rate cuts take time to filter through the economy.

There's also the risk that the Fed could be too slow in its actions. Sahm, Berezin and others argue that decisive cuts may be necessary to avoid the worst outcomes. The longer the Fed waits, the harder it will be to reverse the course of a slowing economy.

As always, I remain optimistic about the long-term potential of the U.S. economy, but the short-term outlook is uncertain. Now may be the time to reexamine your portfolio and prepare for the possibility of a slowdown. History shows that recessions are an inevitable part of the business cycle, but they can also present opportunities for savvy investors who are prepared.

Stay focused, stay informed and as always, happy investing!"

"A Quieter Back-To-Office Season, Outsmart The Resume Bots And AI Isn't Cutting Many Jobs -- Yet",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jenamcgregor/2024/09/09/a-quieter-back-to-office-season-outsmart-the-resume-bots-and-ai-isnt-cutting-many-jobs-yet/,2024-09-09T16:31:47Z,"This week's Future of Work newsletter highlights a more subdued post-Labor Day push to get workers onsite, a softer labor market and a Federal Reserve report examining AI and job cuts.

This is the published version of Forbes' Future of Work newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief human resources officers and other talent managers on disruptive technologies, managing the workforce and trends in the remote work debate. Click here to get it delivered to your inbox every Monday!

t's the Monday after Labor Day, and if it seems like the calls for returning to the office sound quieter this year, that's because they are. Over the past four years, Labor Day has been a common milestone for offices to launch back-to-office mandates, as children return to school across the country and summer travel comes to an end.

My colleague Maria Gracia Santillana Linares spoke with experts who follow hybrid work policies, and they confirmed that this year has been different. ""We've gone from the fifth annual post-Labor Day return-to-office battle to the fifth annual post-Labor Day return-to-office minor skirmish,"" says Brian Elliott, a future of work consultant.

Linares highlighted a midyear report published in August by staffing firm Robert Half which found the share of remote and hybrid work postings is actually increasing. The share of job postings for fully on-site roles dropped to 67% in the second quarter of 2024 from 75% last year, the report says, while the share of hybrid and fully remote jobs increased to 22% and 11%, from 14% and 10% in 2023, respectively.

Some are seeing growth in office visits: New data from security firm Kastle Systems, for instance, shows a spike in occupancy rates post-Labor Day, compared with pre-pandemic rates, especially in New York, Austin and Dallas. Buildings in Austin, for instance, had occupancy rates that were 67% of their pre-pandemic levels on the Wednesday after Labor Day in 2023; that figure rose to 73% on the same day this year.

Whether those numbers will stay elevated is unclear -- most agree that hybrid work arrangements are here to stay. As MillerKnoll vice president of global research Ryan Anderson writes in Forbes, fall RTO pushes have occurred annually, but they have generally not been successful and, in many cases, are even counterproductive. Meanwhile, contributor Gena Cox shares ways to maximize the impact teams have when they actually do report to the office.

And speaking of hybrid work: Here's one last plug for this week's Forbes Future of Work Summit on Thursday in New York. We'll have a dedicated panel discussion about how companies are managing this ongoing debate with Pinterest's Doniel Sutton, Neiman Marcus Group's Eric Severson and Aéto Strategy cofounder Tim Oldman. I'm sure it'll also be a thread of conversation throughout many of our discussions about AI, skills-based organizations and even the child care crisis.

The August jobs report from the Labor Department came in weaker than expected, Forbes' Derek Saul reports, with U.S. employers reporting an increase of 142,000 nonfarm payrolls in August, falling short of economist estimates of 160,000. The unemployment rate dipped to 4.2% last month, down from July's 33-month high of 4.3%. The report comes as investors await the Fed's lowering of interest rates, likely to begin in mid-September. Layoffs also spiked to a five-month high in August as the labor market softens, according to career services firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas. Senior contributor Jack Kelly shares overlooked reasons why U.S. job openings may have fallen short.

Thousands of hotel workers went on strike over Labor Day weekend, as about 10,000 Hilton, Hyatt and Marriott employees in eight states raised concerns over wages and lingering service cuts that began during the pandemic. About 40,000 workers in 20 cities who are represented by UNITE HERE face expired contracts, Reuters reported. The hotels said they remain willing to negotiate.

Forbes' David Jeans recently reported on the alarming issue in which thousands of companies have been inundated by remote IT workers assisting North Korea, a country designated by the U.S. as providing support for acts of international terrorism. While the threat grew alongside the rise of remote work, Jeans writes that a string of recent arrests and disclosures by companies like tech startup Cinder, which provides content moderation software and is led by former intelligence officials, have added attention to the issue. The company recently said in a blog post that it believed as many as 80% of its applicants from some job websites were North Korean.

Senior contributor Alonzo Martinez has the scoop on what employers need to know about the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) moving forward with its proposal to reschedule marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule III drug under the Controlled Substances Act (CSA). If finalized, the change would impact employers who conduct drug testing as part of their background check programs. The rescheduling of marijuana could add a new layer of complexity, Martinez writes, leading to increased pressure to accommodate employees who use marijuana for medical purposes, especially in states that protect its use under disability or discrimination laws.

Aligning Expectations Vs Reality With The U.S. Housing Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/franksorrentino/2024/09/09/aligning-expectations-vs-reality-with-the-us-housing-market/,2024-09-09T14:10:00Z,"Access to housing in the U.S. is just one of the many issues Americans face as they grapple with the economic environment today. That, paired with higher interest rates, and increased cost of groceries and basic essentials, makes homeownership -- once the cornerstone of the American Dream -- an increasingly elusive reality. Additionally, with the shortage of 4 to 7 million homes across the country, those who can find a home are spending a much larger portion of their paychecks than in previous years.

It's also becoming more apparent that as younger generations begin to buy homes, there is a growing disparity between lifestyle expectations and the cost of living. It's a moment that requires a realignment of what people should expect now and in the future. And as the broader economy stabilizes and inflation cools, many have reasons to be optimistic and an opportunity to find a better path that sets them up for a lifetime of success.

Recognizing Misaligned Expectations

Many younger buyers today are facing homes priced higher than ever before, driven not only by inflation and demand but also by the features and amenities that come as a standard in new homes today. Modern homes often include advanced technology, luxury materials, and energy-efficient systems that were not present in homes built decades ago. This evolution means that homes today are not directly comparable to those of the past, and buyers need to adjust their expectations accordingly.

Additionally, the broader market has experienced some decline in recent weeks, which many would suggest is the result of an overreaction. For instance, the combination of lower-than-expected job numbers combined with the Fed's decision to not decrease interest rates, caused temporary market shocks, leading many to mistakenly believe that the U.S. was heading toward a recession. This misalignment of expectations underscores a critical point for buyers, and waiting for the Federal Reserve to make interest rate changes before purchasing a home is not a viable strategy. Instead, individuals should focus on aligning their income with their lifestyle choices, to ensure they can afford a home in the current economic climate.

Rationale for Optimism

Despite the challenges, there are solid reasons to remain optimistic about the housing market and the broader economy. A ""soft landing"" for the economy is still within reach if the appropriate steps are taken. The Federal Reserve's actions have been deliberate, aiming to cool inflation without triggering a recession. While some pain points are inevitable -- such as rising unemployment and higher consumer debt, the overall trajectory points to the return of a stable and sustainable economic environment.

Efforts to shape new zoning policies intended to boost housing availability have been widely supported across the county. These initiatives coupled with policies that focus on enabling more access, like The HomeFirst Down Payment Assistance Program that provides incentives for first-time homebuyers, could play a significant role in enabling people to buy homes.

A Positive Path Forward

As we look ahead, the U.S. housing market is showing signs of stabilization. August's housing report indicate that a cooling of the market. While sales are still elevated, housing prices are beginning to level off, and we are seeing improvements to inventory. Importantly, we are seeing inventory begin to align around the resetting expectations of the buyer. Realtor's August Report found the median price of homes for sale this August decreased by 1.3% compared with last year, at $429,990. However, the median price per square foot grew by 2.3%, indicating that the inventory of smaller and more affordable homes continues to grow in share. Essentially, this reflects a shift towards more realistic valuations that align better with what buyers can afford. This stabilization, coupled with cooling inflation, suggests that the economic environment is becoming more conducive to sustainable growth.

Forbes Daily: Stocks Stumble In The Start Of September On Labor Weakness,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/09/09/forbes-daily-stocks-stumble-in-the-start-of-september-on-labor-weakness/,2024-09-09T12:13:09Z,"Slots are a casino's biggest cash cow, and slot machine maker Light & Wonder is on a winning streak. But it hasn't always been that way.

The pandemic shuttered casinos in the U.S., and the company was saddled with debt and had to sell off divisions. But a focus on its sweet spot in real-life slots, plus online and mobile versions of its casino games, has paid off. It's now the fastest-growing company in the industry, with its popular Huff N' Puff franchise, as well as slots based on Monopoly, Willy Wonka and James Bond.

""We've been on a nice little run,"" says CEO Matt Wilson.

Stocks staggered to their worst week of the year after Friday's jobs report revealed more weakness in an already-fragile labor market. The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed the week down 3%, the benchmark S&P 500 ended down 4% and the tech-leaning Nasdaq booked a 6% loss, but stocks are still up in 2024 -- the S&P has returned about 15%.

MORE: The jobs report revealed that U.S. employers added 142,000 jobs in August, falling short of economists' expectations, though the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2%. It was the weakest August for job growth since 2017.

Boeing reached a tentative union agreement, potentially averting a disruptive strike later this week after a tumultuous last few years for the aerospace company. The tentative deal includes 25% raises over four years, a lower healthcare cost share, and the company also signaled intent to build its next new plane in Washington state's Puget Sound area, which would keep production in Boeing's longtime hub for commercial jets.

According to veteran investor James Callinan, only about 20% of the small-cap Russell 2000 index is ""even investable for the growth investor."" He would know, his $380 million Osterweis Opportunity Fund has outperformed both the benchmark and the S&P 500, posting a 13.2% 10-year annualized return through June.

Telegram's CEO Pavel Durov announced the first updates to the social media platform since his arrest, including the removal of features he said are linked to illegal activity and pledging to revamp the company's heavily criticized lax moderation. Durov was charged with several crimes related to user activity on the platform, which prosecutors said failed to moderate ""child sexual abuse material, drug trafficking, fraud"" and money laundering, among other claims.

Leonid Radvinsky, the billionaire owner of OnlyFans, pocketed a $472 million dividend in 2023 from the social media subscription site best known for hosting adult content. New financials show that transactions processed over the platform grew 18.9% to $6.6 billion in 2023, with growth stemming largely from non-subscription based revenues. Forbes now estimates Radvinsky is worth $3.8 billion.

The fines former President Donald Trump has been ordered to pay in writer E. Jean Carroll's defamation cases against him have continued to accrue millions in interest as Trump's appeals have played out, adding up to over $90 million. An appeals court heard oral arguments Friday on whether the $5 million judgment against Trump in Carroll's first trial against him should stand.

Who is Lauren Chen? She is a conservative video host who founded Tenet Media, a right-wing media outlet the Justice Department alleges is funded by Russia. Chen -- who was not named or alluded to by the DOJ -- has posted praise for Russian President Vladimir Putin, and YouTube removed at least four channels associated with her after ""careful review"" by the site and its ongoing investigation to ""combat influence operations,"" the company told Forbes.

In a recent case before the U.S. Tax Court, a business owner represented herself to contest what the IRS initially determined was more than $428,000 in taxes owed, but the case repeatedly came down to a lack of records. It's critical to remember that taxpayers have the burden of proving they are entitled to any deduction claimed.

TOPLINE Over the last few decades, Takaya Awata has parlayed his tiny Japanese diner into a quick-service giant that is now Toridoll Holdings, which has nearly 2,000 quick-service restaurants across 28 countries and regions covering 21 brands.

Its flagship is Marugame Seimen, Japan's largest udon noodle chain by both revenue and store count. The entrepreneur's fast-food success has made him a billionaire.

Awata aspires to make it a $7 billion company by revenue in the next decade, and to get there, he wants to reduce Toridoll's dependence on domestic diners in a shrinking home market and focus on overseas expansion.

The global quick-service restaurant industry grew at a compound annual growth rate of 5% between 2019 and 2023 to more than $1 trillion, the fastest-growing sector among the overall food-service market. But in Japan, which is facing the challenges of a graying population, fewer full-time jobs and stagnant wages, restaurant operators must also grapple with rising costs and worker shortages.

Moreover, the country's food business is intensely competitive, Awata notes. To grow domestically would mean snatching market share from rivals, including American juggernauts such as McDonald's and KFC, which between them operate over 4,000 stores in Japan.

Despite this, Toridoll posted record revenue of $1.6 billion in the latest fiscal year ended March, with 38% generated from overseas. But Toridoll's shares, which had been trading at high earnings multiples after the pandemic as people resumed dining out, corrected 5% in the past 12 months. Awata, who became a billionaire last year and earned a place in the ranks of Japan's 50 Richest, was recently estimated to be worth $1.1 billion.

WHY IT MATTERS By March 2028, Toridoll targets a more than threefold increase in net profit on $2.9 billion in sales -- of which nearly half would come from outside Japan. This can be achieved, he explains, by more than doubling the total store count to 4,900, of which 3,000 should be overseas branches.

Trumponomics 2.0 Will Make China Great Again,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2024/09/09/trumponomics-20-will-make-china-great-again/,2024-09-09T10:11:23Z,"Finally, Wall Street economists are saying out loud what Beijing has long known: a second Donald Trump presidency would be an economic loser for the U.S. and, it follows, a boon for China.

President Xi Jinping isn't saying that publicly. Nor is his deputy, Premier Li Qiang. Rather, Beijing is hewing to the old adage that when your rival is shooting himself in the foot, you don't get in his way. And as top Wall Street economists are conceding, the tariff arms race Trump plans to wage -- starting with 60% taxes on mainland goods -- would fire even bigger rounds at the U.S. economy's foundations.

Goldman Sachs, for example, warns that Trumponomics 2.0 would lead to economic contraction, not the boom the Republic stand-bearer claims. JPMorgan and Moody's Analytics, too.

""It's a very bad idea,"" says Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ""If there is anything that most economists can agree on, it's that tariffs are bad."" Bottom line, Zandi says, ""even just a step in that direction is problematic.""

Far from making the U.S. economy great again, David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Asset Management, thinks Trump's tariffs are a ""perfect stagflation machine"" that would upend supply chains and trigger China and other rivals to retaliate, adding to global headwinds.

""It's one of those magical economic proposals that can actually cause inflation and put you into a recession - at the same time,"" Kelly told CNN in a phone interview.

Kelly warns new that tariffs would threaten to scramble supply chains and invite a punishing response from trading partners. ""It's a two-year-old's mentality: You punch someone in the nose and expect them not to punch you back,"" Kelly says, dismissing it as ""one of those magical economic proposals that can actually cause inflation and put you into a recession -- at the same time.""

The U.S. Customs and Border Protection agency calculates that Trump-imposed taxes on imports of steel, aluminum and solar panels forced American households to pay more than $230 billion more than they might've if another president led from 2017 to 2021.

Looking forward, the Peterson Institute for International Economics reckons that Trump's 60% tariffs would cost the average middle-class household at least $2,600 per year.

To be sure, Xi's Communist Party won't enjoy a Trump 2.0 White House. China's economy isn't in a good place. Between a deepening property crisis, deflation, near-record youth unemployment and increasing protest activity, stronger headwinds from the West is the last thing Beijing needs.

There's also the what's-next problem. Trump has expressed a willingness to go even bigger on tariffs. In the past, he's mulled canceling some U.S. debt held by Beijing -- in other words, defaulting on those IOUs. That's hardly comforting for a government holding about $780 billion of U.S. Treasury securities.

Trump has talked of engineering a weaker dollar to gain trade advantage. The Trump 1.0 White House wasn't shy about browbeating the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates -- or threatening to fire Chairman Jerome Powell. The ""Project 2025"" scheme the Heritage Foundation cooked up for a second Trump term favors messing with the Fed's mandate.

That would be an even bigger problem for Tokyo, which has more than $1.1 trillion of U.S. Treasuries. But the ways in which shenanigans by a Trump 2.0 White House could devastate trust in the U.S., the linchpin of global finance and trade, would play into China's hand in the longer run.

For all the domestic challenges Xi faces, his party continues to position the yuan as a ready dollar alternative. Xi has been skilled at getting the BRICS -- Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa -- Saudi Arabia and some Southeast Asian nations like Malaysia on the same page in devising a post-dollar world.

Xi has been investing trillions on dominating the future of electric vehicles, renewable energy, aerospace, artificial intelligence, biotechnology, green infrastructure and robotics. Here, Joe Biden's administration has invested in building muscle by raising America's game in chips, infrastructure and climate change pursuits in ways Trump didn't.

Whether one likes Bidenomics or not, it's been focused on readying the U.S. for the global economy it will confront in 2025 and beyond. Trump seeks to drag the U.S. back to policies that prevailed in 1985 -- from giant tariffs to trickle-down economics.

It's great that Wall Street economists are calling Trump out, warning that his plans are a recipe for recession, but prosperity. Equally important, though, is how Trumponomics 2.0 would go a long way to make China great again."
What To Expect On Interest Rates For The Remainder Of 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/09/09/what-to-expect-on-interest-rates-for-the-remainder-of-2024/,2024-09-09T09:19:49Z,"The Federal Open Market Committee has three scheduled meetings remaining in 2024 and markets expect interest rates to be cut at all of them. Statements from FOMC policymakers have generally become more dovish.

In part this is a response to economic conditions. Inflation has eased substantially and the labor market is weakening somewhat, albeit from a period of very low unemployment. Economic theory suggests both factors typically call for less restrictive monetary policy when compared to current levels.

There are 12 voting members of the FOMC. Not all members make frequent public statements, but those that do have expressed a similar theme of looking to ease restrictive monetary policy because inflation is expected to return to target levels.

Of course, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell exerts significant influence on monetary policy. In an August 23 speech he said that, ""the time has come for policy to adjust. The direction of travel is clear, and the timing and pace of rate cuts will depend on incoming data, the evolving outlook, and the balance of risks.""

FOMC voting member and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic recently released a statement that was also more dovish than many of his recent comments. He wrote on September 4 that, ""we must not maintain a restrictive policy stance for too long. I believe we cannot wait until inflation has actually fallen all the way to 2 percent to begin removing restriction because that would risk labor market disruptions that could inflict unnecessary pain and suffering.""

President of the New York Federal Reserve, John Williams made similar comments in a September 6 speech, ""with the economy now in equipoise and inflation on a path to 2 percent, it is now appropriate to dial down the degree of restrictiveness in the stance of policy by reducing the target range for the federal funds rate.""

On August 10, Fed Governor Michelle Bowman said, ""My baseline outlook is that inflation will decline further with the current stance of monetary policy. Should the incoming data continue to show that inflation is moving sustainably toward our 2 percent goal, it will become appropriate to gradually lower the federal funds rate to prevent monetary policy from becoming overly restrictive on economic activity and employment.""

As such FOMC policymakers appear to be sending a clear and relatively unified message that interest rates can be expected to move lower from current levels.

Assuming the FOMC does ease monetary policy over the coming months as broadly expected, the question is how much. The FOMC will provide information on this in an update to the Summary of Economic Projections. This will include expectations for the Federal Funds rate at the end of 2024. An update here will come with the FOMC's decision on September 18.

Fixed income markets as assessed by the CME's FedWatch Tool are currently looking for a reduction in the Federal Funds rates of between 0.75% to 1.5% by December 2024. Short-term rates are expected to end the year at a little over 4%. Should this forecast hold, it would take the form of rate cutting at each of the FOMC's remaining meetings in September, November and December with the possibility of larger 0.5% interest rate reductions at at least one of those meetings, and possibly two in the most dovish case.

The FOMC will announce interest rates at its three remaining 2024 meetings on September 18, November 7 and December 18. The decisions will be announced at 2pm E.T. and followed 30 minutes later by a press conference with Jerome Powell. September's and December's meetings will also include an update to the Summary of Economic Projections. In addition, the FOMC typically release meeting minutes 3 weeks after each meeting. It should also be noted that the FOMC can adjust interest rates whenever it choses and has historically adjusted interest rates outside its typical schedule during times of economic stress.

It has now been broadly communicated by FOMC officials that interest rate cuts are coming and this is what fixed income markets expect. It seems likely all of the remaining FOMC meetings in 2024 will result in interest rate cuts according to fixed income futures.

The question now is how sharply rates will be cut and the level for interest rates at which the FOMC would consider policy no longer restrictive. For now, broadly, the assessment of markets is that rates may continue to fall steadily thru 2025 ending at around 3%. However, this medium term projects are subject to considerable uncertainty. Nonetheless falling short-term interest rates for the remainder of 2024 and continuing into 2025 appear likely."
"Nvidia Has Been Quite Relevant To Stocks, Which Means the Fed Can't Be",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/09/08/nvidia-has-been-quite-relevant-to-stocks-which-means-the-fed-cant-be/,2024-09-08T14:08:59Z,"Last Tuesday Nvidia shed over $279 billion in value. It was the biggest one-day paper loss for a corporation in the history of the stock market. As a CNN report put it, ""only 27 companies on the planet are worth as much as Nvidia lost in value on Tuesday.""

To which someone, somewhere will ponder how the catalyst (Nvidia) of the most recent stock-market run-up could have plunged so substantially. After all, the Federal Reserve is poised to reduce interest rates and, well, you know, equity markets are said to be led by the Fed. It's said that stocks go up when the Fed is reducing rates, and down when the Fed is increasing them.

It's a popular narrative that's contradicted by the narrative; one that ignores the obvious about markets being populated by buyers and sellers. The Fed narrative presumes a market comprised solely of buyers. How else to explain the monstrous information asymmetry that would have to exist whereby uninformed sellers routinely sell shares to more informed buyers who are buying because they uniquely know the implications of the Fed cutting rates.

It's worth adding that in 2023, when the Fed was aggressively hiking its funds rate, Nvidia shares rose 239%. As in the biggest catalyst of this portion of a long-running bull market achieved most of its gains when the Fed was doing what supposedly is inimical to rising markets. More realistically, the Fed isn't relevant to the direction of stock markets. If it were, stocks would forever be in decline.

To see why, remember always the paradoxical truth that lousy markets are the catalyst for good. Markets gain strength from periods of weakness as the bad and mediocre are relieved of a lot or a little of capital so that the good and great can attain more of it. Equity markets are a look into the future, and the future is made brighter by relentless replacement of how things are in favor of how things will be.

Nvidia looms large in this regard. Few had heard of it on November 30, 2022, the day that ChatGPT was released. Since then its domestic and global profile has soared as investors feverishly got to work redirecting capital to a future U.S. and global economy that will in many ways be a ""different century"" (hat tip: George Will) relative to what prevailed before November of 2022. That's why tens of billions found their way so quickly to Silicon Valley right as the Fed was allegedly ""tightening,"" and it's similarly why Nvidia went from an unknown to one of the world's most prominent companies in such rapid fashion.

What's important (and logical) is that the Fed had nothing to do with what transpired. While pundits imagined it was removing the proverbial ""punch bowl"" on the way to rising unemployment and falling stocks, the simplistic in thought forgot that markets bend to know one, least of all people with last names like Bernanke, Yellen and Powell.

In truth, equity markets once again attain lift from the ferocious replacement of the past, which runs counter to a Fed narrative that says the central bank cuts, and stocks just go up. If so, stocks would rise without regard to their future prospects, which means they wouldn't rise simply because market exuberance is borne of a replacement of the status quo, not its maintenance.

In other words, if the Fed could do as the narrative suggests we would never have heard of Nvidia. Except that Nvidia was the catalyst of this bull market, and may still yet be. Put another way, the Fed can't be relevant to stock-market direction precisely because Nvidia was, and may still be."
Fed Rate Cuts Coming: The Impact On Stocks And Bonds,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/09/08/fed-rate-cuts-coming-the-impact-on-stocks-and-bonds/,2024-09-08T11:10:09Z,"Following the monthly jobs report on Friday, it is almost certain that rate cuts from the Federal Reserve will begin at the September 18 meeting. While job growth was lower than expected, the U.S. economy still created 142,000 payroll jobs in August, and the unemployment rate dropped to 4.2%. Futures are pricing in about a 30% chance of a 50 (0.50%) basis point rate cut, but the job growth was enough to expect that the Fed begins with just 25 (0.25%) basis points at the September meeting.

Wednesday's consumer inflation (CPI) reading is the final critical impediment to beginning the easing cycle. The Cleveland Fed's CPI estimate for the upcoming report is 2.6%, which matches consensus estimates and is down from the 2.9% year-over-year reading for July. With the recent improved trend of inflation readings, it would take an extraordinary upside shock to inflation to derail the upcoming monetary easing.

This analysis looks back at the last nine Federal Reserve easing cycles beginning in 1974 to look at what might be learned about the implications for future stock and bond returns. The Fed does not have an excellent track record in avoiding recessions with rate cuts. 78% of the time, the economy was either already in recession or ended up in recession after monetary easing began. In the Federal Reserve's defense, the 1970s and early 1980s were a period of high inflation, which complicated their ability to lower interest rates. Despite all this, stocks have been higher one year after rate cuts commenced two-thirds of the time.

The median return on the S&P 500 in the year after Fed rate cuts begin is 10.8%, with the six-month median return at 9.1%. There were three easing cycles where the one-year forward stock return was a double-digit loss: 1981, 2001, and 2007. Interestingly, there were four easing cycles with positive double-digit one-year forward gains despite a recession: 1974, 1980, 1989, and 2019.

Most of the time, 10-year U.S. Treasury yields fell over the three and six months after the initial Fed rate cut. It might seem odd that yields ended up higher one year after the initial cut, but one should consider that U.S. recessions typically last less than a year, and those 1970s and early 1980s periods needed higher rates to fight inflation.

The most recent period of Fed easing, which avoided a recession, was 1995, so it might be instructive to look at that period briefly and what it might tell us about today's economy. The Fed began cutting rates in July 1995, which followed some stagnation in U.S. industrial production and an increase in the unemployment rate. Both those situations, whether aided by lower rates or not, ended up being temporary blips, and economic growth continued.

Today's economic cycle is complicated by the massive rebound following the shutdown of the economy during COVID. Industrial production returned to life, and unemployment fell to historically shallow levels. Industrial production has moved sideways in a choppy fashion since mid-2022, and unemployment has increased from its lows, but it remains at a low level historically.

The real (after-inflation) Federal Funds rate illustrates that the Fed's monetary policy is very restrictive. Assuming that the inflation rate continues to moderate, monetary policy becomes even more stringent if the Fed makes no change to short-term interest rates. This elevated real Fed Funds rate level argues that a 50 (0.50%) basis point cut would be reasonable at the September meeting, so it remains well within the range of possibilities. Since the Fed can ease this tight monetary policy, the ability to help the economy seems to rest within its hands, so the odds of avoiding a recession could be above what history might indicate.

Based on valuations of stocks and forward earnings estimates, markets are pricing in a high probability that the Federal Reserve can beat its historical odds and engineer a soft landing for the economy. Given recent data and the Fed's success in 1995, this looks like a reasonable assumption and should be considered the base case outcome.

However, this Goldilocks outcome is far from a sure thing. Descending into recession would likely lead to price declines for stocks and other risk assets. Owning high-quality and less economically sensitive stocks alongside technology and cyclical companies should add some cushion should economic and earnings growth falter. With bond yields back to offering a reasonable return over expected inflation, history would indicate that high-quality bonds should provide some cushion in an economic downturn."
Markets React To Less Than Stellar Jobs Data; Consumers Are Driving On Empty,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/greatspeculations/2024/09/07/markets-react-to-less-than-stellar-jobs-data-consumers-are-driving-on-empty/,2024-09-07T17:25:06Z,"The equity market appears to have succumbed to the growing list of weakening economic data. The major stock indexes fell significantly this week, including on Friday in the wake of the August jobs report.

Trader sentiment has now shifted from buying small caps to selling them (note the Russell 2000 fell nearly -6% this week). Small caps are the last to be bought in a market run-up, and the first to be sold as sentiment shifts from ""risk on"" to ""risk off."" But small caps weren't the only losers as the tech space suffered. The tech-heavy Nasdaq index lost -5.77% on the week with every one of the Magnificent 7 off for the week (-5.5% using a simple average) and now off nearly -15% from the peaks made just 30-45 days ago. Nvidia, in particular, has fallen more than -20% from its peak which was put in just nine trading days ago (August 23). As the table shows, the bloom appears to be off the rose!

Most of the incoming data appear to be showing an economy, not yet in Recession, but slowing significantly. As noted in prior blogs, such trends don't suddenly stop at neutral or reverse themselves without some exogenous event or some economic policy change.

Friday's (September 6) Nonfarm Payroll number, at +142K, undercut the consensus estimate of +165K. Still, the U3 Unemployment Rate fell by 0.1 percentage points from 4.3% to 4.2%. Without the automatic add from the Birth/Death model, that number would have been flirting with the zero line, or even negative. [Note: BLS adds about +100K jobs per month based on a long-term trend of the growth of small businesses which are not surveyed in the monthly jobs report. That trendline is insensitive to changing economic conditions.] Worse, prior months' revisions cut -86K jobs from June and July. Financial markets were forewarned by the JOLTS (Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey) and by the ADP jobs report earlier in the week. And, all week, the equity markets struggled. Through Thursday, the S&P 500 was down nearly -2.6%. Then came Friday's jobs report, and the selling began in earnest.

Wednesday's JOLTS indicated that job openings had fallen. The chart shows the ratio of job openings to the number of unemployed. Note that, excluding the Pandemic, at 1.07, this ratio is the lowest is has been since 2018, indicating that jobs have been drying up. And the downtrend doesn't look like it is going to stop anytime soon.

Fed Chair Powell has told us at various times that this ratio is important and that the Federal Open Market Committee is focused on it.

Besides being forewarned by the JOLTS report, the equity markets should have been prepared for a less than stellar jobs report as ADP's jobs numbers, reported on Wednesday, came in short at +99K, a big miss from the consensus forecast of +145K. This was the weakest ADP report since January 2021, and, as indicated earlier, the number of job openings has rapidly deteriorated. We haven yet seen a spike in the weekly Initial Unemployment Claims data, but we think that is coming.

· Employers are still hoarding labor after the 2022-2023 experience of the inability to fill open positions. But, as profits become harder to attain, such hoarding will cease.

· According to outplacement firm Challenger Gray and Christmas, layoffs surged in August to nearly +76,000 (the most for any August since the 2020 COVID episode and August 2009 before that). That number of layoffs is 33% higher than the average for August. In addition, Challenger indicated that hiring hit its slowest year to date pace going back to 2004.

· Due to the BLS' August survey period, the surge in layoffs, as noted by Challenger, doesn't appear to have been captured in BLS' jobs data. We note that the large negative revisions for June and July do indicate a weakening jobs market. Those layoffs, as noted by Challenger, will likely show up in the September jobs report.

· The sister Household Survey, from which the unemployment rates are calculated, showed up with job growth of +168K, and that was enough to lower the U3 Unemployment Rate to 4.2% from 4.3%. Digging deeper, however, we see the following:

Expectations play a large role in consumer spending. If the consumer is confident that their income will be growing, they will spend more freely. On the other hand, if income expectations are low, perhaps not. The chart below, from the University of Michigan's Consumer Sentiment Report, shows that income expectations are at the low end and have been falling for the past year; not very encouraging for GDP growth going forward. The loss of retail jobs is usually a sign of a weakening consumer.

The Atlanta Fed's GDP Nowcast for Q3 (July through September) currently stands at a 2.1% annual growth rate. Same for the St. Louis Fed's forecast. In Q2, GDP grew at a 3% clip due largely to a strong consumer. In July and August, the consumer continued to spend, taking down the savings rate to 2.9%. However, as noted above, consumer expectations for income growth are low, and with depleted savings and consumers primarily looking for bargains, we expect a significant slowdown in GDP growth in Q4. In the latest Fed Beige Book (a compendium for business views), the anecdotes implied that nine of the 12 Federal Reserve districts were experiencing much slower growth and even some contraction.

In addition, many of the world's economies, China in particular, have seen significant slowdowns in economic growth, and, as a result, U.S. exports have slowed while the U.S. consumer was still on a spending binge. The resulting negative balance of trade (Imports>Exports) is also a negative in the GDP calculation. Thus, we expect Q3's GDP (in the 1% to 2% range) to be lower than Q2's 3% rate of growth, and Q4's to be lower yet.

With inflation already on the wane, and U.S. consumers tapped out, it is a near certainty that the Fed will lower rates at next week's meeting. The only question that remains is whether it is a 25 or 50 basis point reduction (i.e., 0.25 or 0.50 percentage points) in the Fed Funds rate (currently at 5.25%-5.50%). So, 25 basis points is for sure, and the market's odds of a 50-basis point decrease is in the 35% range. Of course, incoming data could change those odds. Our opinion is that the Fed is behind the curve and should reduce by 50 basis points. But if we had to bet, our money would land on 25. The chart shows that durable goods are already in deflation. As indicated earlier, trends don't magically reverse without a reason.

The equity market ran into a bit of trouble this week (ended September 6), with the major indexes down -3% to -6%. Nvidia, the leader of the Magnificent 7 pack, fell nearly -14% for the week after delivering a great Q2 report, but apparently not good enough for the markets' heightened expectations. Anyway, it appears that the bloom is off the rose for equities, at least until the markets find a new theme to excite investors (AI is apparently now passe).

The jobs report appeared to show decently at +142K for the headline. But it was less than consensus (+165K) and prior months revisions (-86K) really spooked Wall Street. In addition, while not yet showing up in the official weekly unemployment claims data, the Challenger outplacement firm's data indicated that August's layoffs surged and that hiring slowed to a 20-year low!

While the U3 unemployment rate fell from 4.3% to 4.2% (normally good news), the U6 rate rose to 7.9% from 7.8%. The U3 rate is somewhat misleading because BLS counts part-time jobs as equal to full-time ones. The fact that full-time jobs have fallen nearly 1% from a year ago doesn't impact the BLS data because they were replaced by part-time. Many people are working part-time because full-time isn't available. In addition, multiple job holders are growing. Both of these trends are clear signs of stress in the all-important jobs market. Perhaps those are the underlying reasons for the recent downdraft in equities.

Manufacturing lost -24K jobs in August (adding credence to our view that Manufacturing is already in Recession), retail jobs were lower by -11K, and even tech jobs shrank (-7K).

While the U.S. consumer has been on a spending binge, expectations for income growth have all but disappeared. This, along with depleted savings and rising credit delinquencies lead us to believe that Q3 GDP will be much lower than Q2's 3% growth rate.

Finally, the Fed meets soon (September 17-18). There has been good progress on inflation, and, as we have discussed in past blogs, the lagged impact of disinflating (and deflating) rents will continue to push inflation down through year's end. In fact, we believe we could see some deflation in 2025. While we think the Fed is way late to the rate reduction scenario (Canada already reduced their Fed Funds equivalent rate by 75 basis points), if we were betting, we would put our money on a 25-basis point rate cut, not 50. Why? Because the year/year inflation numbers are still above 2% (Shhh - the annualized three-month numbers are now below 2%), and this Fed appears to be backward looking."

JENIN, Israeli-occupied West Bank -- Israeli forces have withdrawn from the Jenin urban refugee camp in the northern Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to Jenin's mayor. This comes after a major military raid into Palestinian towns, as the Israeli army vows to root out militant groups.

Mayor Nidal Ebeidy said the troops left a trail of destruction, bulldozing roads under which the Israeli military says Palestinians hide improvised explosives, and destroying homes and mosques where they say militants operate from.

The operation on Jenin, Tulkarem and al-Faraa urban camps is the largest since the start of the war against Hamas in Gaza almost a year ago, and has so far killed 39 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, and three Israeli police officers, according to the Israeli military.

The Israeli military said it launched the raids on Aug. 28 to root out fighters who operate within these towns to stave off an attack similar to the one on Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel, killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. The attack triggered the war in Gaza which the Gaza health ministry says has killed over 40,800 Palestinians.

""The Israeli forces have destroyed 70% of infrastructure of Jenin,"" Ebeidy told NPR. ""It encircled the hospitals and killed civilians, and destroyed our power grid. Now we are starting to rebuild Jenin one more time.""

The heart of Palestinian armed resistance

The Israeli government built the Jenin refugee camp outside Jenin city in the northern West Bank for displaced Palestinians after the 1948 war, when Israel was created. It's home to about 24,000 residents, according to the United Nations.

Like most refugee camps across the West Bank, Jenin's began as a collection of temporary housing for Palestinians to shelter in, but over time, residents built concrete buildings, schools and shops, turning it into an urban town.

Israeli troops have raided the Jenin refugee camp many times since the beginning of the war in Gaza. Once bustling with residents in markets and schools, its roads are now piles of rubble from Israeli military bulldozers, and mosques and homes are blown up, with people's belongings strewn everywhere.

For decades Jenin has been a stronghold for many militants who say they are fighting the Israeli occupation.

One of those men is 30-year-old Tareq Abu Mohammed, who is part of the militant group Islamic Jihad. When NPR met him in July, before the current fighting, he was standing guard on the side of a street outside a supermarket with another fighter. Both were carrying an automatic weapon.

Nearby was the Damaj neighborhood. It's normally where the fighters can be found, but on the day of NPR's visit it was eerily quiet. A drone faintly hummed overhead. Someone had spray-painted the words ""The Alley of Death"" in Arabic on the walls of buildings. The fighters normally sleep here during the day in preparation for potential Israeli military night raids.

Jenin was a flashpoint even before the Hamas attack from Gaza on Oct. 7.

It was the site of several battles during the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s known as the Second Intifada, and while the Palestinian Authority is meant to be policing the camps, it's really the fighters who control things around here.

In July 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was launching a new crackdown on militants from these camps.

""If Jenin will return to terrorism, then we will return to Jenin,"" Netanyahu said.

Since the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, the Israeli military has stepped up its incursions into the West Bank's refugee camps.

Israel says they are breeding grounds for new militants.

A fighter's purpose

After agreeing to an interview with NPR, Abu Mohammed sat on a stack of soda cans in a grocery store, cradling his gun.

He said he was in and out of Israeli prisons for about five years.

After Oct. 7, he got a call from Israeli security to turn himself in. Instead he picked up his weapon.

""Whoever sees the injustice we go through in those prisons, comes out and continues fighting,"" Abu Mohammed said.

He described getting little food in prison and prisoners being beaten and humiliated by Israeli forces.

Abu Mohammed said there was no use trying to wipe out the militants.

""Kill one of us, a thousand will pop up, our morale is high,"" he said.

Abu Mohammed said he was ready to die for the sake of his land, but it's not what he actually wishes he was doing with his life.

A farmer by trade, he said he's always wanted a wife, children and a job, but there was hopelessness under occupation.

""We all want to live,"" he said. ""We are fighting so we can live, not just for the sake of dying.""

Youth with a death wish

On the outskirts of the West Bank's largest city, Ramallah, is another urban refugee camp called Qalandiya. The Israeli military has raided Qalandiya almost nightly since the war in Gaza began.

Ahmad Aslan, 24, lived in Qalandiya until his death on July 24. His family told NPR that on that day, the Israeli military entered their town and soldiers started breaking into homes, searching them. Aslan's parents said Israeli soldiers surrounded the camp, and he was stuck in his uncle's house with his cousins. They ran to the roof to look down, and that's when, they said, Ahmad was shot.

The Israeli military told NPR the raid was to demolish the home of a man who had killed two Israelis at a gas station in the West Bank.

It said that during the raid, soldiers opened fire at people gathered on rooftops to throw rocks and Molotov cocktails at them.

A day after his death, Aslan's cousin released a video Aslan sent him days earlier. In it, Aslan shyly introduces himself as ""the martyr Ahmad Aslan"" and says he wishes to die fighting the Israeli occupation. He points to an empty grave in the Qalandiya cemetery.

""God willing, I want my grave to be here,"" he says. ""Here is Yasser, and here is Ahmad Aslan's.""

Yasser was his best friend, whose family says also died in an Israeli military raid a few months earlier.

A week later, the Aslan family was still receiving mourners paying their condolences. His mother, Amina Aslan, wore all black and maintained a brave face. She said he would always talk about hoping to die fighting the occupation, a topic that would make her mad. She pulled out a text message exchange they had a few days before he died.

""I told him: I swear if you keep talking like this, I will stop speaking to you!"" she read out loud. ""Go die! I'll stop speaking to you!""

Aslan is one of a rising number of young men in the West Bank with such a death wish, according to Palestinians in the camp.

The war in Gaza, and Israel's expanding settlements in the West Bank, have made the prospect of a Palestinian state ever more distant.

Unemployment is high, and with no future in sight, hopes are even lower.

Like Aslan, many young men say that their only choice is to fight the Israeli occupation.

Some take up arms and join militant groups, others throw rocks at Israeli soldiers during raids.

Aslan's mother said that every time there was an Israeli military incursion, her son would rush to join the youths on the streets.

In Aslan's bedroom, his father, Nidal, pointed to items laid out neatly on his son's bunk bed -- a baseball cap, cigarette lighters, a piece of clothing blotted with blood.

He said these are all mementos his son collected and kept from his friends who were killed in Israeli raids. He said his son's ultimate wish was to join his friends in heaven.

""Ahmed used to say, 'sure I have friends, but those who have gone are dear to me,' "" said Nidal Aslan."
