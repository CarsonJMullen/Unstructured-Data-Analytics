Azerbaijan's human-rights record is under fire as it prepares to host UN climate talks,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5145637/azerbaijan-human-rights-climate-change-cop29,2024-10-08T21:28:09Z,"Human rights activists and lawmakers in the United States are calling for Azerbaijan to end alleged abuses of civil society groups and ethnic Armenians ahead of a global climate change summit the country will host in November.

A new report from Human Rights Watch and Freedom Now says Azerbaijan is carrying out an ""escalating crackdown"" on government critics and activists. That includes the arrest this spring of human-rights advocate Anar Mammadli, who co-founded a group to work on issues related to climate justice.

The report was published days after dozens of U.S. lawmakers urged Secretary of State Antony Blinken to push for the release of political prisoners and hostages in Azerbaijan, a major oil and gas producer on the Caspian Sea that borders Russia, Iran and Armenia. The lawmakers said Azerbaijan carried out an ethnic cleansing last year in Nagorno-Karabakh, an Armenian-majority enclave. And they pointed to a State Department report that found ""significant human rights issues"" in the country, including credible reports of arbitrary detentions and unlawful or arbitrary killings.

U.S. lawmakers told Blinken that the upcoming COP29 climate negotiations in Azerbaijan offer ""a pivotal platform"" to promote energy security in the region and to help countries like Armenia cut their dependence on Russia for natural gas. The criticism of Azerbaijan also comes against the backdrop of growing concern globally that grassroots efforts to limit and adapt to climate change are being met with state pushback and human rights abuses.

""When civic space is actively shut down, the voices of those most affected by the climate crisis are at risk of being excluded from the negotiations,"" Myrto Tilianaki, a senior advocate for the environment and human rights at Human Rights Watch, said at a press conference Tuesday. ""And that is a major problem, because if their lived experiences and solutions aren't heard, the policies that come out of these talks might not fully reflect their needs or protect their rights.""

A spokesperson for Azerbaijan's Embassy in Washington wasn't immediately available for comment.

Responding to the earlier allegations from U.S. lawmakers, the embassy said Azerbaijan is a victim of an ""orchestrated disinformation campaign.""

The selection of Azerbaijan to host this year's climate talks shows the country is ""a responsible and credible member of the international community,"" the embassy said in a statement. It added that ""human rights have nothing to do with permissiveness to engage in illegal activities.""

The report from Human Rights Watch and Freedom Now says recent arrests of activists and media figures in Azerbaijan were primarily linked to laws restricting nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). The arrests were politically motivated, the report says, and ""follow well-established, abusive methods the government has used for many years to curtail freedom of speech and freedom of association in the country.""

In most of the cases documented in the report, people who worked for or were involved with unregistered NGOs and independent media outlets were charged with smuggling money into Azerbaijan. Some of those people were also charged with crimes such as illegal entrepreneurship, forgery and tax evasion, according to the report. In other cases, people were charged with extremism, drug possession, counterfeiting and treason.

The circumstances and timing of most of those arrests ""strongly suggest that the criminal charges were merely a pretext intended to punish and put an end to activists' legitimate work,"" according to Human Rights Watch and Freedom Now.

Azerbaijan was picked to host this year's United Nations climate talks after Russia blocked bids from countries in the European Union, which has supported Ukraine in its war with Moscow.

At last year's climate conference in the United Arab Emirates, countries agreed to move away from fossil fuels, the main driver of human-caused global warming. However, Azerbaijan has suggested the world can meet its climate targets while continuing to produce fossil fuels.

Oil and gas pays for a large share of Azerbaijan's budget, and the country is poised to increase gas production by a third over the next decade, according to an analysis by Global Witness, an environmental and human rights group.

""I have always said that having oil and gas deposits is not our fault. It's a gift from God,"" Ilham Aliyev, president of Azerbaijan, said at a conference earlier this year. ""We must not be judged by that. We must be judged based on how we use these reserves for the development of the country, to reduce poverty and unemployment, and on what our targets are with respect to the green agenda.""

One of the cases highlighted by Human Rights Watch and Freedom Now involves an economist named Gubad Ibadoghlu who was arrested on charges related to the production of counterfeit currency and extremism. Ibadoghlu has argued that average citizens in Azerbaijan don't benefit from the country's oil and gas reserves because revenues are mismanaged. And he recently examined plans for greater energy cooperation between Azerbaijan and the European Union, questioning how much gas Azerbaijan could send to Europe. If he's convicted, the report says Ibadoghlu faces 17 years in prison."
Americans are using AI at fairly high rates. What does this mean for the economy?,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/planet-money/2024/10/07/g-s1-26429/americans-using-ai-fairly-high-rates-what-does-this-mean-for-economy,2024-10-08T10:33:21Z,"Before conducting a recent survey of Americans to figure out how much they're using generative AI, Harvard University economist David Deming says he was solidly in the ""AI skeptic"" camp. That is, he was skeptical that the explosion of generative AI would offer sizable benefits for the U.S. economy anytime soon. Now, however, he says he's more optimistic.

""I was very surprised at the numbers in our survey,"" Deming says. ""And it sort of made me think that AI is gonna be a bigger deal than I would've thought.""

The study, Deming says, was motivated by questions over whether and how much Americans are using generative artificial intelligence. Doing what economists tend to do, he and his colleagues, Alexander Bick and Adam Blandin, wanted to get some good data.

They modeled their survey after the Current Population Survey (CPS), which is sponsored by the U.S. Census Bureau and the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. Conducted monthly, the CPS is sort of the gold standard for surveys. It's how we know things like the unemployment rate and the state of the labor market.

In short, the survey that Deming, Bick and Blandin conducted is high-quality. It has a large sample size. It's nationally representative. And they even included some of the same questions that the CPS asks, so they could cross-reference their survey with the CPS and make sure their numbers were good. They conducted their survey twice, in June and August 2024.

Deming says he was shocked by the results. He and his colleagues found that almost 40% of Americans, ages 18 to 64, have used generative AI. And a sizable percentage seems to use it regularly. In their August survey, the economists found that more than 24% of American workers had used it ""at least once in the week prior to being surveyed, and nearly one in nine used it every workday.""

Even more surprising, Deming says, usage of AI seems to be pretty much across the board. He expected that younger and more-educated Americans would be the biggest users. They confirmed that's the case. ""But we even found that 22% of blue-collar workers say they use AI, and usage rates were above 20% in every major occupation category except personal services, where it was like 15%,"" he says.

This rapid rate of adoption, the authors point out, is much faster than the speed at which Americans adopted personal computers and the internet. That may not be very surprising though, considering that personal computers cost thousands of dollars in the 1980s and 1990s and you had to get physical hardware, hook it up, figure out how to use it, etc. Even with the internet, people had to buy modems, get subscriptions, figure out how to ""surf the web"" and so on. Generative AI is more plug and play, often free or has a low-monthly subscription cost, and has a user interface that is familiar to anyone who has ever used Google.

In a recent two-part series on The Indicator, Darian Woods and I debated whether AI is overrated. Given the tremendous uncertainty about the impact that AI will have on the economy -- as well as our reluctance to make predictions that might get us laughed at in a few years -- we decided to obscure our personal feelings on the matter. We flipped an AI-generated coin. I got ""AI is overrated"" and wrote an episode and a newsletter making that argumentative case.

In the course of my research, I discovered a study conducted by the Census Bureau this year that found that only about 5% of American businesses said they had used AI in the previous couple of weeks. I used this as evidence that use of generative AI was pretty pathetic, especially considering all the hype around it.

How does Deming square his results with that finding?

For one, Deming says, he and his colleagues found that actually Americans report they're using AI more during their personal time at home than at work.

Hmmm. OK. Putting my ""AI is overrated"" hat back on, this makes me think that much of AI use is for pleasure rather than for productive work purposes -- which would suggest that AI's impact on the economy will be limited.

The sort of economic dream for AI would be that it would rescue the U.S. economy from its long period of slow productivity growth. Productivity growth -- meaning workers being able to produce more in less time -- is the magic sauce of rising living standards. And recent technologies have been pretty disappointing on that front.

I mean, look at the smartphone. If I told you back in 2006, the year before the iPhone was released, that we'd soon all have supercomputers in our pockets, able to search the internet, give us precise directions to anywhere, send emails to and do video calls with co-workers and clients, order basically any product or service, translate languages and on and on -- you might think we'd see an explosion in productivity. But smartphones seem to be more a tool for pleasure and distraction than an incredibly impactful work tool. We haven't seen a huge boost in productivity growth since its mass adoption well over a decade ago.

Deming, however, stresses that people are using generative AI for work. He says their survey shows ""about 1 in 4 people used it at least once in the last week at work"" (versus ""about 1 in 3"" who used it in their off time). When it comes to how people use AI to help their work, respondents indicated that writing, interpreting and administrative support were the most helpful (although a significant share also said they were using it for other tasks, including coding and support when dealing with customers and co-workers).

Squaring his study with the one from the Census Bureau, Deming says he thinks there's a ""big gap between a company's formal policy on AI use and workers. I think quite a lot of the use is under the radar, like you've gotta write an email to your boss and you just use it to write the email more quickly and you just use ChatGPT to do it. But you don't tell anyone."" Deming says many of his students use generative AI this way.

We reached out to Massachusetts Institute of Technology economist Daron Acemoglu -- whom, these days, you might call the AI skeptic in chief -- about Deming and his colleagues' study. Does the fact that they find that a large percentage of Americans are using generative AI change his perspective at all?

""My concern with their numbers is that it does not distinguish fundamentally productive uses of generative AI from occasional/frivolous uses,"" Acemoglu said in an email. ""If you are curious about what ChatGPT would say to introduce one of your guests and use it to get a sense of that, you are a user, but this is not fundamentally integrated into the NPR production process. Worse, if you asked me whether I'm using generative AI, and if I'm being honest, I will have to say yes, because when I do searches, now I see generative AI-generated output. But this has zero impact on me. The productivity improvements would require fundamental integration and reorganization of production processes, together with complementary investments in organizational capacity and worker skills -- not gimmicky, frivolous uses. We know ChatGPT has about 200 million unique monthly users, but the question is how many of them are using it in a way that will lead to significant productivity improvements/cost reductions. I don't really know the answer to that question, and I don't think we find the answer to that question from this paper.""

To try to predict how much AI will boost productivity growth, Deming and his colleagues did some rough calculations. They looked at five randomized studies that analyzed how much use of generative AI increases productivity in various work settings. They picked the productivity-boost number in the middle of those studies, which is about 25%. They then multiplied that, Deming says, by ""our estimate of the number of work hours that are currently being assisted by generative AI"" (which, they calculate, is somewhere between 0.5% and 3.5% of all work hours in the U.S.).

They ended up estimating that generative AI will result in an ""increase in labor productivity of between 0.125 and 0.875 percentage points at current levels of usage."" That may not sound like very much. But, Deming says, consider that productivity growth over the last couple of decades has ""been about one and a half percent per year. So if you take that 1.5% and you add this, that's actually a pretty big increase.""

Interestingly, Acemoglu has also done some rough calculations of the potential impact of generative AI on the economy in the near future. And despite using a different method to calculate the potential productivity boost from AI, his estimates are actually pretty similar to this recent work from Deming and colleagues.

Yet, Acemoglu and Deming put different spins on the results. Acemoglu seems to be reacting more to all the media and industry hype around generative AI -- and, he's like, we're not witnessing an economic revolution by any means. Deming looks at the potential productivity increase and emphasizes more that it looks like generative AI could make a meaningful impact on the U.S. economy.

""Is it gonna lead to 7% productivity growth? No, probably not,"" Deming says. ""Not the way it's currently being used, but it could add a little bit, and every little bit counts. Like that's millions and millions of dollars of extra GDP growth and rising living standards. That really counts.""

Deming and his colleagues have plans to continue conducting their survey in the future. It's worth noting that they conducted their last survey before Apple released an iPhone that has ChatGPT integrated into it.

Pretty soon, he says, ""because AI is gonna be embedded in so many things, like the iPhone, it's gonna be hard to even ask people, ""Do you use AI?"""
It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich. Sylvia Jarrus for NPR hide caption

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."
Stunning photos of a vast e-waste dumping ground  --  and those who make a living off it,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/10/05/g-s1-6411/electronics-public-health-waste-ghana-phones-computers,2024-10-05T17:35:53Z,"The now-demolished Agbogbloshie Scrapyard in Accra, Ghana, once received 250,000 tons of electronic waste each year, making it the world's largest electronic waste dump. Muntaka Chasant hide caption

When he was just 18 years old, Emmanuel Akatire traveled about 500 miles from his home in Zorko, Ghana, to Accra, the nation's capital, to find the only work he could -- sifting through vast piles of discarded electronics to find valuable scrap metal. A week's worth of painstaking, often dangerous work, earns him the equivalent of about 60 U.S. dollars.

""I started doing scrap work around 2021 -- after I lost both my parents -- to provide for the rest of my family,"" he told Muntaka Chasant, a photojournalist in Ghana. ""There's no electricity in my community, no development there,"" he said. So he came to Accra, which has become a major dumping ground for the globe's used electronics.

For years, a site called Agbogbloshie in Accra was the world's largest e-waste dump, getting 250,000 tons of discarded phones, computers and other used electronics each year. Many Western media outlets depicted the site as a public health and environmental tragedy, rife with toxic chemicals that leach into the water and poison the air. While that's undoubtedly true, it's not the full story, according to a new collaborative photojournalism project.

The project, called E-Waste in Ghana: Tracing Transboundary Flows, which won this year's Fondation Carmingac photojournalism award, aims to capture both the positive and negative aspects of e-waste.

""The world cannot throw all its garbage here, it has truly negative consequences on the people,"" says Anas Aremeyaw Anas, an investigative journalist in Ghana who co-led the project. ""But there are positive aspects of sending us e-waste,"" he says, as it's sparked a dynamic, informal recycling economy in the country that, while often dangerous, can also help lift people like Emmanuel Akatire out of poverty.

Globally, e-waste is an enormous problem. In 2022, humans discarded about 62 million tons of used electronics, enough to fill a line of trucks that spans the equator. But there's opportunity too, as those trucks contain over $91 billion of valuable metals, the U.N. estimates, though people like Akatire who do the dangerous recycling work reap the smallest share of those potential profits.

E-waste falls into two broad buckets: functional and non-functional. The line between them can be fuzzy, as what's still usable or repairable to one person may not be to another, but the distinction is important. International laws prohibit trafficking of non-functional e-waste containing toxic substances, but the United Nations sees trading functional e-waste as beneficial, as it can lengthen the lifespan of a product.

The project found that exporters often fail to separate functional from non-functional e-waste. ""If you have a container full of TV screens, how on earth are you going to verify each and every one of them to make sure that they are functioning,"" says photojournalist Bénédicte Kurzen, a co-author of the project. As a result, both kinds of e-waste get stuffed into container ships that make their way to low- and middle-income countries like Ghana.

Formally, Ghana prohibits the import of many forms of hazardous e-waste material. But the team found that a well-placed bribe can get port officials to look the other way. As a result, informal e-waste sites are growing across Ghana's coast. There, both functional and non-functional e-waste get dumped into vast piles that are encroaching on residential areas. Thousands of ""pickers"" come to these sites, picking through the rubbish to separate items that might be repaired from waste that could contain valuable minerals.

Many of the pickers are climate migrants from an area of Ghana known as the ""Upper East,"" says project co-author Chasant, where warming temperatures are upending traditional farming practices. ""This area has the highest unemployment rate among young people,"" he says. They come to e-waste sites to earn money during the dry season, Chasant says, which they bring back to the Upper East. ""There's a whole generation of young people that are building their society from e-waste work.""

It's fraught, precarious work. To separate valuable minerals, like copper wire or iron, from useless plastic, pickers often burn the trash, producing noxious fumes. Burns, cuts and other injuries are common. E-waste workers -- many of whom are children, the team found -- are at risk of exposure to over 1,000 harmful chemicals, according to the World Health Organization, including lead, mercury and brominated flame retardants, which are linked to higher rates of diseases like cancer and diabetes.

Bernard Akanwee Atubawuna, a 21-year-old picker from Upper East, died while doing scrap work, says Chasant. His cause of death is unknown, but ""Akanwee was a sickle-cell carrier and should never have been anywhere near fires/picking. But his parents said it was the only way he supported them. He sent his sister to learn a trade. He was also helping the parents to build a house back in the Upper East -- all from picking.""

The harms extend beyond the dumps themselves. ""There are many communities that have run to a halt as a result of the devastating effects of the poisonous gases that are inhaled,"" says Anas. Heavy metals seep into the soil and water too, which can have profound health effects on local communities. ""When people start burning, the poisonous fumes lead to people relocating.""

A burgeoning recycling and repair industry has risen up alongside those harms. The team documented informal marketplaces, where vendors sell scores of busted cell phones to buyers looking to repair circuit boards or extract their precious metals. On Zongo Lane in Accra, the reporters say, hundreds of small, independent shops sell used or repaired equipment, ranging from televisions to computers.

""In Africa, people still have this thing of repairing is important. Don't throw it away. You can still do things about it,"" says Kurzen. In Western countries, people view these objects as much more disposable, she says, which is helping fuel the growth of e-waste worldwide.

The most valuable minerals extracted from Ghana's e-waste often don't stay in Ghana. Many of the most valuable items get cherry picked and sent to more advanced smelters in Europe or Asia, the team found. ""People are dismantling these items in toxic environments, and then the few piles that contain incredibly valuable minerals are going to be re-exported,"" says Kurzen.

She and her colleagues hope that the project prompts people to re-examine their relationship to the electronics in their lives. The few years we spend with a new phone represents just a blip in the story of the materials that power it, Kurzen says. ""Those materials are traveling worldwide,"" she says, ""These [devices] we hold in our hands come at the expense of somebody, somewhere in the world. Nothing comes for free."""

The Sahm Rule With The Eponymous Economist

How much would you do this job for? And other indicators"
The U.S. saw stunningly strong growth in jobs last month. Here's what to know,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140039/labor-market-jobs-economy-interest-rates,2024-10-04T17:19:53Z,"U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs in September -- more than forecasters had expected. Gains for July and August were also revised upward. Anna Rose Layden/Getty Images/Getty Images hide caption

As far as economic data goes, it was a bit of a stunner.

Economists had expected U.S. employers to have added about 150,000 jobs in September. Instead, they created more than a quarter-million jobs last month, while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, according to a report Friday from the Labor Department.

Here are five things to know about Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report.

In total, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs in September. Restaurants, retailers and construction companies all added jobs at a healthy pace.

In addition, employment gains for July and August were revised upwards by a total of 72,000 jobs. That means that, on average, employers have added 186,000 jobs in each of the last three months.

While that's a slowdown from the first three months of the year, when employers added an average of 267,000 jobs a month, it's still a solid pace.

A separate report earlier this week also showed the number of job openings increased slightly in August to 8 million.

But not all industries are enjoying a boom. Manufacturing has been in a slump for most of the last two years. Factories cut 7,000 jobs in September, although factory employment is still higher than it was just before the pandemic, by 137,000 jobs. Most of September's job cuts were in the auto industry.

A survey of factory managers released this week by the Institute for Supply Management shows manufacturers are still struggling with high interest rates and uncertainty about the upcoming presidential election.

By contrast, another ISM survey shows continued growth in the much-larger services side of the economy -- things like restaurants and car repair.

In order to keep adding jobs, employers need workers. Fortunately, the U.S. labor force continues to grow.

Friday's report shows 150,000 people joined or re-joined the workforce last month. Much of this growth is driven by immigration. The foreign-born workforce has grown rapidly over the last year, adding 1.4 million workers, while the native-born workforce shrank by nearly 600,000 workers.

Were it not for immigrant workers, job growth might well have stalled. The decline of the native-born workforce is primarily the result of baby boomers retiring. By contrast, the share of people in their prime working years (25 to 54) is near an all-time high.

Average wages in September were up 4% from a year ago. That's likely more than enough to outpace rising prices, giving workers a real boost in their purchasing power.

Inflation data for September won't be released until next week, but in recent months, prices have been climbing at a modest pace -- 2.5% for the 12 months ending in August. In fact, wage gains have exceeded price hikes for fifteen months and September's increase probably extended that trend.

The Federal Reserve began cutting interest rates last month with an aggressive half-a-percentage-point move, signaling a turning point in its years-long battle against inflation.

But Fed chairman Jerome Powell says he and his colleagues may move more cautiously in the future, cutting rates by a quarter point at a time.

""This is not a committee that feels like it's in a hurry,"" Powell said Monday.

Friday's surprisingly strong jobs report is likely to reinforce that patient approach. According to CME's FedWatch tool, odds of a quarter-point rate cut at the next Fed meeting rose to nearly 95% after the jobs report was released, from 68% the day before.

Fed policymakers will get one more monthly jobs report before their next scheduled meeting in early November."
Opinion | Striking dock workers just set an example for all working folks,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dock-workers-strike-sent-powerful-message-bosses-workers-rcna173849,2024-10-05T11:58:58Z,"Dockworkers strike on a picket line outside of the Port of Houston Authority in Texas on Oct. 1.Brandon Bell / Getty Images

On Tuesday, dockworkers went on strike, shutting down ports across the East Coast and Gulf Coast to demand higher wages and a guarantee that automation won't be used to throw many of them out of work. It was a massive demonstration of the power of working people to grind the gears of the economy to a halt by simply refusing to show up.

The bosses caved in record time. Both sides agreed to a tentative deal Thursday. The dockworkers will return to work in exchange for a 62% pay increase over the next six years. That's a very good thing.

What's alarming is that even as the workers were being demonized by right-wing media outlets like The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, many liberals were fretting that the economic chaos resulting from foreign goods not coming into American ports would cost Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris the election. Even some otherwise left-of-center journalists were criticizing the workers for having the audacity to strike or even calling on President Joe Biden to force them back to work.

Naysayers had argued that the workers were greedy. As they saw it, dockworkers already made more than enough money. Others argued that by blocking automation, the workers were standing in the way of progress. Many observers said that collective bargaining is all well and good within reasonable limits, but shutting down this much of the flow of goods coming into the country was too much of an economic disruption to be allowed.

All of those arguments missed the mark by a mile. The only structural power the working class has in a capitalist system is the power to disrupt the economy by withdrawing its labor. That's the entire point of union organizing.

In this case, the union members stuck to their guns and won. Their victory is a victory for everyone who has to sell their working hours to a boss to make a living.

There were breathless headlines about dockworkers who make ""six-figure salaries,"" but those were about the top earners. As Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pointed out in his statement of solidarity with the striking workers, the average income for these workers is $60,000 a year, with ""many East Coast port workers mak[ing] as little as $20 an hour -- the same wage that a fast food worker in California currently makes."" And loading and unloading cargo ships is demanding work, often involving very long hours. The idea that these workers are overentitled clashes jarringly with these basic realities.

There's a much bigger problem, though, with the idea that striking dockworkers didn't deserve support because they already made good wages. That argument assumes that labor activity is just a way of procuring charity for workers who are poor and desperate enough to need it. That's exactly the wrong way to think about it. The labor movement exists to give the working-class majority of a society a say in what goes on at the workplaces where they spend half their waking hours and some input into how the profits created by their hard work are divided up. It imposes some small measure of democracy on the economy. The more that happens, the more everyone who works for a living benefits.

Every dollar that doesn't reach the pockets of workers pads the profits of already wildly profitable companies. The ocean carriers have made record profits in the last few years: $400 billion since 2020. Meanwhile, the dockworkers whose labor does so much to produce those profits are actually making 12% less than they were two decades ago, when adjusted for inflation. Why should the bosses hoard the benefits of the industry's success? If some dockworkers make more money than you do at your job, then why should your conclusion be that the dockworkers are greedy and not that you should organize with your co-workers for a better deal?

It's all too easy to think of corporate CEOs and shareholders raking in money as the inevitable order of things and working people trying to get a bigger piece of the pie as an imposition. Similarly, we just take it for granted that advances in automation will be used to throw some workers into unemployment while the ones lucky enough to keep their jobs have to work as hard as ever as they see their employers' profits skyrocket.

But that's not the only way things could work. Imagine that these companies were collectively owned by the workers themselves. In that scenario, labor-saving technology could actually be used to save labor for everyone. Workers could all work shorter hours for the same income, spread the work that still needs to be done by humans more thinly among themselves and give themselves more time to spend with their loved ones.

In the world we live in, though, ownership and labor are separated, so bosses decide how automation will be implemented. This is a problem that's going to impact every corner of the economy as technology advances, and any workers who want to avoid being left in the cold at the end of the process need to be ready to follow the dockworkers' lead and draw a line in the sand.

And people who profess to be workers' allies need to take their heads out of the sand.

Lee Fang, a heterodox left-wing journalist I'd expect to be sympathetic to organized workers, assailed the dockworkers on the grounds that Biden has been a pro-labor president and the strike had the potential to ""cause crippling inflation only 1 month out from the election."" He said this ""might take the cake"" as an extreme example of ""self defeats of organized labor.""

Dylan Matthews of Vox went so far as to call for Biden to invoke Taft-Hartley, a notorious piece of union-busting legislation passed in the 1940s, lest the dockworkers' strike ""cause inflation to come roaring back weeks before an election."" Matthews said ""you can support bargaining"" without tolerating the ""sabotage"" of the economy that would come from shutting down traffic at East Coast ports.

But what incentive are employers supposed to have to give concessions if workers can't back up their bargaining demands with a credible threat to walk off the job? That's the only way workers have ever been able to build real power.

As it happened, the bosses caved before the supply chain disruptions could cause inflation. Even if things hadn't worked out this way, though, it's disturbing that Matthews was willing to throw striking workers under the bus for the ""greater good."" If Biden had taken Matthews' advice, the ""pro-labor"" president using a union-busting law to shut down a major strike would have had demoralizing ripple effects throughout the rest of the organized working class.

Even if all you care about is Democrats winning elections, screwing over dockworkers would still have been a bad idea. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is already being supported by a higher percentage of union households than any other Republican candidate in the last 40 years. A Democratic president invoking Taft-Hartley to shut down a high-profile strike would likely only make things worse.

As Chris Isidore and Vanessa Yurkevich point out at CNN, if the union had continued to work under a contract extension, thus delaying any strike until after the presidential election, then they ""would have lost bargaining leverage"" by losing the chance to shut down the ports before the ""pre-holiday shipping season"" really got going. In telling the workers to throw away their best chance to win this massive pay raise to make sure Harris won, Fang and Matthews were essentially telling them not to take action themselves but to trust politicians to look out for their interests. But workers can't exert much influence on the political process if they don't start by building power for themselves where they work.

It's true that in many ways, Biden has been more pro-labor than recent presidents. But his record is more mixed than Fang suggests. He came into office promising to pass the PRO Act, which would make it easier for workers to organize unions, but it hasn't passed and never seemed to have been a high priority for his administration. And two years ago, in a situation much like this one, Biden invoked the Railway Labor Act to prevent a major rail strike. It's good that this time around he did the right thing -- he told reporters that he didn't ""believe in Taft-Hartley"" -- but these blotches on his record show the limits of trusting politicians to be benevolent toward workers.

While Republicans are certainly worse on labor issues, the sad fact is that the working class has relatively limited influence in both parties. There's no way to change that more basic reality without building a bigger and more militant labor movement, one that's not afraid to flex its muscles at times that might be inconvenient for others.

And if you work for a living, then that's exactly what you should want to happen."
Stephanie Ruhle: By all measures we have a strong economy. So why don't Americans feel that way?,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/job-report-inflation-economy-biden-rcna174092,2024-10-04T20:53:06Z,"The Biden administration woke up to some good news on Friday. The U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, blowing past the 150,000 expected. Not only did September's numbers beat economists' expectations, but data from previous months were also revised upward and the unemployment rate fell from 4.2% in August to 4.1%.

This is good news. By almost all measures, we've got a strong economy, except for one thing that matters an awful lot: how Americans feel about it. It's a reason why Donald Trump continues to poll better among likely voters on handling the economy.

That feeling is largely frustration that prices are still too high. I'm not talking about the pace of inflation -- just the fact that everything seems to cost more.

Now, the administration and the Harris campaign point to all the recent positive economic news, but they don't always connect the dots to one reason behind those prices: the rise in wages.

Yes, price increases can be due to ""greedflation."" Corporations have held wages low for years while raising prices and pocketing big profits. Many businesses could increase wages and benefits without higher prices. That's why many politicians, including Vice President Kamala Harris, want to investigate and go after those engaging in price gouging.

However, a lot of workers -- especially lower-wage earners -- have gotten a raise in recent years. And when wages go up, prices likely do as well. We want lower-wage earners to be able to support their families, but if you're paying people who work at fast-food joints or pizzerias $20 an hour, then you're not likely going to get $1 menu items anymore, and you're not going to get a pizza that costs less than $20.

Here's an example: My son works at a deli and takes home $20 an hour for making sandwiches. When my mother rolls in to pick him up from work, she can't understand why the sandwiches are $22.

But it's not just about ""greedflation"" and price gouging. Employers are paying people more and it's going to impact all kinds of companies. And if employers pay their workers more, especially small business owners, it has to come from somewhere, and often that means raising prices for consumers.

Let's not forget, this increase in wages is also good news. Wage growth has been rising fastest for the lowest-wage workers. That's a good thing, even if it means we might have to pay a little more for fast food, pizza and sandwiches."
"Opinion | Who will win? Election forecasters think it's Harris, but they've been wrong before",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-election-forecasts-predictions-rcna173277,2024-10-02T10:48:06Z,"Models looking at everything from polls to economic conditions show a narrow Harris win.

Can science predict the future? The great science fiction author Isaac Asimov wrote a series of books in which a scientist figures out a way to do just that.

""It was the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations,"" Asimov wrote in one of the books in his Foundation series. ""The individual human being is unpredictable, but the reactions of human mobs ... could be treated statistically.""

It's a great concept for a book series -- and a well-reviewed streaming TV show -- but in the real world, it falls flat.

The subject has come up again as we are now just a month out from a hotly contested election that could determine everything from the future of abortion rights to the strength of American democratic institutions. It would be comforting to hear from an expert who can read the tea leaves and tell us who will win.

Demand is so high that multiple models are competing for dominance, and two of the biggest forecasters -- historian Allan Lichtman and close poll reader Nate Silver -- got into an online feud over the weekend over how to read the ""13 keys"" that Lichtman uses to make his predictions. (Lichtman says they predict a Kamala Harris win, but Silver argues they actually favor Donald Trump.)

""Allan let's just say the little tricks you've played with the Keys in the past will come back to haunt you! The Keys shall be respected,"" posted Silver, in what sounded like something the villain in a children's movie shouts shortly before an army of elves overtakes the castle.

If you're not sure about the 13 keys, you could look instead at the Misery Index, a crude measure developed by an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson that combines the unemployment rate and the inflation rate, which will tell you the numbers are looking good for Harris. Or you can check out the more sophisticated Time for Change model, which zeroes in on the popularity of the current president, the state of the economy and the number of terms the incumbent party has been in the White House. That also predicts a narrow Harris win.

Or maybe, like Silver, you favor polls. In that case, you can look at 538's proprietary mix of polls, economic and demographic data to see that Harris is projected to win 57 out of 100 times (Silver is no longer with 538). If you're willing to pay, you can see Silver's own forecast, which is based on his new model. Or you can just look at the state-by-state polls yourself and obsessively play with the maps on 270 to Win while muttering about crucial Waukesha County.

Or perhaps you like the newfangled prediction markets, which ask bettors to put their money where their mouth is. PredictIt has a bet on a Harris win at 56 cents, with Trump as the underdog at 47 cents, while VirtualTout blends PredictIt data with some fancy math to come up with a forecast for a ""strong Democratic victory.""

The good news for these forecasters is that if Harris wins, they'll all get to claim that their models were accurate. And if Trump wins, they can say that, after all, their models showed only a high probability of a Harris win, or they'll switch to talking about the popular vote.

The problem with all of these models, however, is that they attempt to make iron laws out of the scrap metal of past elections. We've had only 59 presidential elections since the Constitution went into effect -- even fewer if you consider only those since the expansion of voting rights, the advent of TV news and the development of sophisticated voter targeting in the 20th century. Statistically speaking, that's just not a lot of data.

More recently, you can throw in the complications the Electoral College has caused since 2000 by diverging twice from the national popular vote, the increasingly intense partisanship and the closely divided elections, and it's basically impossible to make definitive predictions. Would your favored political model have predicted an Al Gore or George W. Bush win in 2000? Did it predict Trump or Joe Biden winning by tens of thousands of votes in a handful of swing states?

If your model assumes how voters will respond to a president running for re-election, how does it factor in the president's dropping out and endorsing his vice president just months before the election? Or a former president's running for a nonconsecutive second term? What about a candidate who was impeached for trying to overturn the results of the last election?

Most models can be useful to a point. They can give us the general sense of the political landscape or enough information to start make contingency plans for after the election. If Harris wins, maybe the models will make at least some voters less open to bogus arguments that the election was stolen. (I'm not holding my breath on that one.) And some can tell us how well a generic Democratic or Republican candidate might have done in a particular environment, which can help the parties review their strategies.

But ultimately, we aren't voting for a generic candidate. We have to choose between two specific people, with their own strengths and weaknesses. And sometimes the polls, the economic models and the betting markets can't measure that.

In Asimov's series, the scientist's predictions of the future are accurate for centuries until, through random chance, a man is born with a mutation that allows him to psychically manipulate other people's emotions, creating fear and devotion in order to rise to power. That proposition -- that predictions of the future ultimately cannot account for the unknown or the unexpected -- is worth keeping in mind as we head into the November election, especially given that we have a candidate on the ballot who's adept at creating fear and devotion.

In the end, election forecasts are not bad at telling us how the future will look, as long as it continues to look like the past."
"Opinion | What Trump's vision of ""one rough hour"" for police really means",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-purge-police-rough-violent-day-rcna173295,2024-10-01T10:34:42Z,"In the 2013 dystopian thriller ""The Purge,"" America observes a tradition wherein, once a year for a designated 12-hour period, all crime is permissible -- up to and including murder. During the purge, society is rocked by spectacular violence, which is said to have a cathartic effect: It dramatically reduces crime and unemployment. ""The Purge"" provides audiences with a warning about the horrifying consequences of selective observation of morals and a world ruled by a ""might makes right"" ethos. But at a campaign rally in Pennsylvania on Sunday, former President Donald Trump effectively floated the idea as a good thing. Except in his spinoff version, the twist is that it's only the cops who get to do what they want.

As he often has in the past, Trump complained at the rally that police are ""not allowed to do their job"" because of political pressure and that crime is rampant in President Joe Biden's America as a result. (It is not.) And that's when he proposed his ""Purge""-esque solution: If police were allowed ""one real rough, nasty"" and ""violent day,"" he said, crime would be eliminated ""immediately."" He was taken enough by the proposition that he returned to it later, saying, ""One rough hour -- and I mean real rough -- the word will get out and it will end immediately, you know? It will end immediately.""

A Trump campaign official told Politico afterward that he was ""clearly just floating it in jest."" And Steven Cheung, the Trump campaign's communications director, told Politico that Trump has ""always been the law and order president and he continues to reiterate the importance of enforcing existing laws.""

Let's unpack a few things here. The Trump campaign's ""in jest"" excuse should be dismissed. As I've written before, for the better part of a decade Trump has used a comic tone and ""I'm just kidding"" caveats to float trial balloons for his most extreme ideas.

Even though Trump obviously wouldn't have the authority as president to permit the police to indulge in a day of extreme violence, that he's articulating the idea in public at all is still significant -- and corrosive. It signals an attitude toward police misconduct that helps to set the Republican agenda -- at federal and state levels -- on legislation related to police reform.

It could also affect the day-to-day culture of policing by emboldening police officers to act more aggressively when interacting with citizens. And it could more generally encourage Trump's supporters to consider vigilantism and political violence as a way to address social problems. The latter is not a far-fetched, abstract concern, either, but a real, already-existing social phenomenon that could definitely get worse. In no context is it appropriate for a presidential candidate -- much less a former or sitting president -- to ""joke"" about law enforcement brutalizing the public, especially in a country plagued by police violence.

Cheung's attempt to frame Trump's authoritarian remarks as a reflection of his commitment to ""law and order"" is preposterous. Trump is suggesting that police should be able to operate outside the constraints of the law to achieve the social goal of reducing crime; in other words, suspending regular law to achieve order. And the worldview underpinning Trump's preferred social order is, of course, reactionary -- it's about protecting the powerful and dominating those who challenge them.

Trump's vision of ""one rough hour"" echoes his rhetoric about being ""dictator for one day"" to crack down on illegal immigration and drill for oil wherever he wants. In both scenarios Trump invokes the threat of a crisis (surging crime or migration across the border) to legitimize the idea of extraordinary power (unconstrained executive power or police brutality) to achieve an end.

Trump tries to frame this as compatible with democracy and the rule of law by framing the exercise of that extraordinary power as temporary. This is, of course, a familiar playbook for autocratic leaders, who argue that crises require exceptions (ostensibly temporarily) to the rules to tackle them. But somehow the crises -- and the special rules to solve them -- seem to extend indefinitely. The reality is that rules are rules only because everyone follows them. Once you argue that you alone need an exception to the rule to govern, then you're in effect arguing that you don't believe in rules.

If Trump wins the White House again, would he be able to pursue a special police ""purge""? Not through any conventional laws or institutions. But everything he's said, especially since 2020, has made it clear that he's interested in trying, and the courts and half of Congress seem willing to let him."
Researchers say poverty and unemployment are up in Lahaina after last year's wildfires,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hawaii-maui-wildfires-unemployment-poverty-ce07492d00bd845a546cb8ce1becd37b,2024-10-08T18:04:19Z,"HONOLULU (AP) -- Unemployment and poverty are up and incomes are down among Maui wildfire survivors more than a year after a deadly blaze leveled historic Lahaina, a report published Tuesday found.

The poverty rate among survey respondents more than doubled since the August 2023 fires, the University of Hawaii Economic Research Organization, or UHERO, said. Incomes dropped by more than half for almost 20% of those who answered questions, the report said.

""These are quite staggering findings,"" said Daniela Bond-Smith, a research economist at UHERO and one of the report's co-authors.

The report is based on survey responses from 402 people who lived, worked or owned businesses in West Maui and Kula at the time of the wildfires. Respondents were generally representative of the 12,000 residents and 6,000 people who commuted to these areas before the fires, researchers said. There was a higher share of low-income individuals among participants but not to a degree that would overturn the report's conclusions, Bond-Smith said.

Researchers plan to survey people in this demographic monthly for the next two years.

The results found 29% of fire-affected households now live in poverty. That's more than twice the percentage before the fires and three times higher than the Maui County average.

Fewer survivors are working and those who have jobs are working fewer hours. Only 3.5% said they were working more hours than before the fires while the unemployment rate jumped from 2.3% to 14.2%.

The shift is particularly pronounced in the tourism industry, Maui's biggest employer. Researchers said fewer than half of those who had full-time jobs in tourism still do. More than 20% are now unemployed, retired or not looking for work.

One factor, said Trey Gordner, UHERO data scientist and report co-author, is that the number of travelers to Maui continued to be ""very much below"" pre-fire levels.

On housing, nine out of ten respondents lost their homes. In the aftermath, the survey found survivors were paying more rent for smaller dwellings. They also had less income coming in to pay for it.

A looming challenge: one in three respondents who are now living outside West Maui want to move back next year. Yet only 700 new temporary housing units are being built with funds from the state, county and nonprofit organizations.

""We wanted to draw that out and emphasize that there's a real mismatch,"" Gordner said.

Maui Mayor Richard Bissen has proposed legislation that would add some 2,200 units to West Maui's housing supply by forcing the conversion of some short-term vacation rentals to long-term rentals, but the measure is still under consideration.

To date, official data on fire survivors was limited to those who lost their homes or was folded into broader statistics for all of Maui County.

Gordner said it was important to also study those who worked and owned businesses in fire-stricken communities to understand the true extent of the disaster and to identify gaps in government and nonprofit assistance.

The survey was offered in six languages: English, Spanish, Tagalog, Ilocano, Tongan and Vietnamese. Government agencies and nonprofit organizations helped recruit participants. Each respondent received at $20 gift card for the first survey and a $10 gift card for each follow up monthly survey."
Saudi Arabia executes Filipino convicted of murder despite Philippine presidential appeal,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/saudi-arabia-philippines-filipino-executed-7c4c3d676659fb0fd3e9774997c17957,2024-10-08T08:05:42Z,"MANILA, Philippines (AP) -- Saudi Arabia has put to death a Filipino citizen convicted of murder despite years of efforts by the Philippines to prevent the execution, including a presidential appeal, officials said Monday.

Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos Jr. and other officials did not provide details, including the identity of the Filipino and the nature of the case, citing a family request for privacy.

A Philippine official with knowledge of the case, however, said the Filipino was arrested by Saudi Arabian authorities in 2020 after being accused of the killing. The death penalty was handed down with finality last year and the execution was carried out on Saturday, the official said.

The official spoke on condition of anonymity because of a lack of authority to discuss the details of the execution publicly.

Asked by reporters for comment, Marcos said the execution was ""very unfortunate"" and that his administration would provide help to the executed person's family.

""We appealed to the better nature, I guess, of our friends in Saudi Arabia, perhaps, to have another look and they did,"" Marcos said. ""Unfortunately, the law there is very strict and, apparently, the conviction has stood and one of ours has been taken away.""

The Department of Foreign Affairs in Manila said the Philippine government provided legal help ""and exhausted all possible remedies, including a presidential letter of appeal"" to try to stop the execution, but that the victim's family had refused to accept ""blood money,"" a financial settlement to secure forgiveness.

Saudi Arabia has drawn criticism from human rights groups for its methods of capital punishment, including beheadings and mass executions. In the past, Saudi Arabian authorities publicly pinned the body and severed head of executed people on poles as a warning to others.

At least 86 Filipinos, including 63 males and 23 females, are facing the death penalty worldwide, many for murder and illegal drug-related offenses, according to Philippine officials.

Millions of Filipinos work in countries around the world to e scape poverty and unemployment at home and to provide for their families.

The large amount of money they send home has supported the Philippines' consumption-driven economy for decades, but the largescale deployment of Filipino workers has had social costs, including broken families, human trafficking and abuse by employers, especially of housemaids in the Middle East."
Mozambique's presidential election: Here's what to know,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-elections-president-nyusi-insurgency-climate-explainer-35d66b57f691671c343185dc5c493dd7,2024-10-08T04:13:05Z,"MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Mozambicans are expected to turn out in large numbers on Wednesday for an election that will choose a successor to President Filipe Nyusi after his two terms.

Close to 17 million voters in the southern African nation of 31 million people are registered to vote for the next president along with 250 members of parliament and provincial assemblies.

While the ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique, or Frelimo, is widely expected to retain power, at least four candidates have been campaigning to bring change to a country which faces a yearslong jihadist insurgency in its north and whose long Indian Ocean coastline is vulnerable to extreme climate conditions like flooding.

Over 1.3 million people have been forced to flee their homes due to the insurgency, while millions more have faced severe food shortages due to drought.

The local elections held in Mozambique a year ago were marred by allegations of vote-rigging and fraud, sparking violent protests in the capital, Maputo, and surrounding areas. This time, concerns have been muted.

Here's what to know about Wednesday's vote:

The ruling Frelimo party, which has been in power since independence from Portugal in 1975, has fielded David Chapo as its presidential candidate. The 47-year-old Chapo is a former governor of the southern province of Inhambane, a strong driver of the country's tourism economy.

Chapo is expected to face the most competition from 50-year-old Venacio Mondlane, a banker and forestry engineer who runs as an independent candidate under the slogan ""Save Mozambique, this country's ours"" and has drawn large crowds.

Mondlane is backed by the Optimistic Party for the Development of Mozambique, or Podemos, set up by dissidents from the ruling party. He ran as a mayoral candidate in local elections last year, and his supporters alleged that he won but was robbed.

The Democratic Movement of Mozambique has fielded Lutero Simango. His party was created in 2008, breaking away from the rebel group-turned-opposition party Mozambique National Resistance, or Renamo. Simango's party resonates with youth because of its policies on inequality and jobs.

Renamo is represented by Ossufo Momade, who became the party's head after the death of the charismatic Afonso Dhlakama, a former rebel leader who died in 2018.

Mozambique has been fighting an Islamic State-affiliated group that has launched attacks on communities in the northern province of Cabo Delgado since 2017, including beheadings.

Around 600,000 of the 1.3 million people who fled have since returned home, many to shattered communities where houses, markets, churches, schools and health facilities have been destroyed, the United Nations said earlier this year.

The candidates have promised to address development issues exacerbated by the insurgency, including the halting of a crucial gas project by French energy company TotalEnergies in northern Mozambique as a result of the extremist rebel insurgency there.

Mozambique also faces high levels of unemployment and hunger, exacerbated by El Nino-induced severe drought. According to the U.N. World Food Program, 1.3 million people face severe food shortages.

The ruling Frelimo party has been tainted by corruption scandals, including the so-called ""tuna bond"" scandal in which former finance minister Manuel Chang was jailed earlier this year for taking payoffs to arrange secret loan guarantees for government-controlled fishing companies.

The loans were plundered, and Mozambique ended up with $2 billion in ""hidden debt,"" spurring a financial crisis as the International Monetary Fund halted financial support.

There is just one day of voting and counting starts immediately, with partial results announced as they trickle in.

"Corte Suprema de EEUU reanuda con casos de armas fantasma, pena de muerte y derechos transgéneros",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/general-news-4504aea5fa1ae7f6e798ce67c24fa1cf,2024-10-07T19:57:26Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- La Corte Suprema se sentó de nuevo en el banquillo el lunes, lista para escuchar casos sobre armas fantasma, una sentencia de muerte y los derechos de las personas transgénero.

Sentado frente a las imponentes columnas de mármol de la sala, el presidente de la Corte Suprema, John Roberts, anunció el fin formal del mandato anterior del tribunal, cuando una serie de casos importantes incluyeron una resolución que otorgaba amplia inmunidad al expresidente Donald Trump.

A continuación, dio inicio al nuevo mandato. La agenda no está tan cargada, pero el tribunal de mayoría conservadora podría tener que intervenir en disputas electorales después de la votación de noviembre.

A continuación, los magistrados conocieron su primer caso, relativo a las solicitudes de ayuda por desempleo presentadas en Alabama durante la pandemia.

El inicio del mandato se produce tras un paréntesis de verano relativamente ajetreado para el tribunal. Entre las órdenes que emitieron sobre apelaciones de urgencia se incluía la negativa a restablecer el plan de préstamos estudiantiles del presidente Joe Biden y la aprobación parcial de una ley de Arizona que exigía una prueba de ciudadanía para votar.

El nuevo mandato se abre en un contexto de escasa confianza pública en la Corte Suprema y de continuo debate sobre si su código ético, recientemente adoptado, debe contar con un mecanismo de ejecución.

A continuación se exponen algunos de los casos que se presentarán:

Los jueces escucharán un caso el martes sobre regulaciones para armas fantasma, armas fabricadas privadamente que son difíciles de rastrear para la policía porque no tienen números de serie.

El número de estas armas de fuego encontradas en escenas de crímenes se ha disparado en los últimos años, pasando de menos de 4.000 en 2018 a casi 20.000 recuperadas por las fuerzas del orden en 2021, según datos del Departamento de Justicia.

Las cifras han disminuido en múltiples ciudades desde que el gobierno de Biden comenzó a exigir la verificación de antecedentes y de la edad para los kits de armas fantasma que se pueden comprar en línea.

Pero los fabricantes y los grupos de defensa de los derechos de las armas sostienen que el gobierno se extralimitó y que la norma debería anularse.

En las décadas transcurridas desde que Richard Glossip fue condenado a muerte por un plan de asesinato a sueldo en 1997, el caso se ha convertido en uno de los pocos en que los fiscales reconocen haber cometido errores.

El fiscal general republicano de Oklahoma se ha unido a Glossip para intentar anular su condena por asesinato y su pena de muerte.

A pesar de esas dudas, un tribunal de apelaciones de Oklahoma ha confirmado la condena de Glossip, y la junta de indultos y libertad condicional del estado se ha bloqueado en una votación para concederle clemencia.

El tribunal escuchará los argumentos de su caso el miércoles.

Tal vez el caso más seguido de la Corte en lo que va de año sea la lucha por los derechos de la comunidad transgénero.

El caso sobre las prohibiciones estatales de la atención a la afirmación del género se presenta en un momento en que los estados liderados por los republicanos promulgan una serie de restricciones, como la participación en deportes escolares, el uso de los baños y los espectáculos de drags.

El gobierno y los estados liderados por los demócratas han ampliado las protecciones para las personas transgénero, aunque la Corte Suprema ha prohibido por separado que el gobierno aplique una nueva normativa federal que pretende proteger a los estudiantes transgénero.

Los magistrados sopesarán una ley de Tennessee que restringe los inhibidores de pubertad y la terapia hormonal para los menores transgénero. El caso aún no tiene fecha de audiencia, pero es probable que se discuta en diciembre."
Gaza está en ruinas tras un año de ofensiva israelí. La reconstrucción podría tomar décadas,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-domestic-news-b79a673b1fc3b067d91af0455a4ad182,2024-10-07T18:24:31Z,"Hay montañas de escombros donde antes había bloques de apartamentos y charcos de agua contaminada con aguas residuales que propagan enfermedades. Las calles de las ciudades se han convertido en cañones de tierra y, en muchos lugares, el aire está impregnado del hedor de cadáveres no recuperados.

La ofensiva israelí contra Hamás, una de las más mortíferas y destructivas en la historia reciente, ha matado a más de 41.000 personas, un poco más de la mitad de ellas mujeres y niños, según los funcionarios de salud locales. Sin un final a la vista para la guerra, y sin un plan para el día después, es imposible decir cuándo -- o hasta si -- algo será reconstruido.

Incluso después de que cesen los combates, cientos de miles de personas podrían quedar atrapadas y vivir en campamentos de tiendas de campaña durante años. Los expertos dicen que la reconstrucción podría tomar décadas.

""Esta guerra es destrucción y miseria. Haría que las piedras clamaran"", dijo Shifaa Hejjo, un ama de casa de 60 años, quien vive en una tienda de campaña instalada en el terreno donde antes estuvo su casa. ""Quienquiera que vea Gaza ... lo hará llorar"".

Israel culpa a Hamás por la destrucción. El ataque de ese grupo palestino contra Israel el 7 de octubredel año pasado -- en el que murieron unas 1.200 personas y unas 250 fueron tomadas como rehenes -- provocó la guerra. Israel dice que Hamás incrustó gran parte de su infraestructura militar, incluidos cientos de kilómetros (millas) de túneles, en áreas densamente pobladas donde se libraron algunas de las batallas más duras.

Los combates dejaron aproximadamente una cuarta parte de todas las estructuras en Gaza destruidas o gravemente dañadas, según una evaluación de la ONU en septiembre con base en videos satelitales. Dijo que alrededor del 66% de las estructuras, incluidas más de 227.000 unidades de vivienda, habían sufrido al menos algún daño.

Si hay un alto al fuego, alrededor de la mitad de las familias ""no tendrán a dónde regresar"", dijo Alison Ely, coordinadora en Gaza del Shelter Cluster, una coalición internacional de proveedores de ayuda liderada por el Consejo Noruego para los Refugiados.

Casi tantos edificios han sido destruidos o dañados en Gaza como en toda Ucrania después de sus primeros dos años de guerra con Rusia, según Corey Scher y Jamon Van Den Hoek, investigadores con sede en Estados Unidos que utilizan radares satelitales para documentar la devastación de las guerras.

Para poner eso en perspectiva: Gaza tiene menos de la mitad del tamaño de Kiev, la capital de Ucrania.

La cantidad de destrucción solo en el centro y sur de Gaza, dijo Scher, es aproximadamente equivalente a lo que se perdió en la ciudad de primera línea de Bajmut, escenario de una de las batallas más mortíferas en la guerra de Ucrania y donde las fuerzas rusas destruyeron casi todos los edificios a su paso para obligar a las tropas ucranianas a retirarse. La destrucción en el norte de Gaza es aún peor, agregó.

El sistema de agua y saneamiento de Gaza ha colapsado. Más del 80% de sus instalaciones sanitarias -- y un porcentaje mayor de sus carreteras -- están dañadas o destruidas.

""No puedo pensar en ningún paralelo, en términos de la severidad de los daños, para un enclave, un país o un pueblo"", manifestó Scher.

A finales de enero, el Banco Mundial estimó que los daños ascendían a 18.500 millones de dólares: casi la producción económica combinada de Cisjordania y Gaza en 2022. Eso fue antes de algunas operaciones terrestres israelíes intensamente destructivas, incluso en la ciudad sureña fronteriza de Rafah.

En enero, cuando las fuerzas terrestres israelíes avanzaron hacia la ciudad de Jan Yunis, en el sur, Shifaa Hejjo y su familia huyeron de su casa de cuatro pisos con solo la ropa que vestían.

Pasaron meses en varios campamentos de tiendas de campaña antes de que ella decidiera regresar. Y lo que vio la hizo llorar.

Todo su vecindario había sido destruido: su antigua casa y los caminos que conducían a ella estaban hundidos en un mar de escombros.

""No la reconocí"", dijo. ""No sabía dónde estaban las casas de la gente"".

Alrededor del 90% de los 2,3 millones de habitantes de Gaza han sido desplazados por la guerra, a menudo varias veces, según estimaciones de la ONU. Cientos de miles se han apiñado en campamentos de tiendas de campaña en expansión cerca de la costa sin electricidad, agua corriente ni baños. El hambre está extendida.

Hejjo vivió en una tienda de campaña en el patio de un hospital. Antes de eso, estuvo en Muwasi, el principal campamento de tiendas de campaña en el sur de Gaza.

""Olía mal"", reportó. ""Había enfermedades que se propagaban"".

Agregó que su esposo, quien sufría una enfermedad hepática, se sintió destrozado cuando escuchó que su casa había sido destruida y murió poco después.

Ella fue una de las primeras en regresar después de que las fuerzas israelíes se retiraran en abril. Sus vecinos se mantuvieron alejados, temerosos de encontrar cuerpos o bombas sin explotar.

Pero para ella, ese todavía era su hogar.

""Es mejor vivir en mi casa, donde viví durante 37 años, aunque esté destruida"", dijo.

Hejjo y sus hijos cavaron entre los escombros con palas y con las manos, ladrillo por ladrillo, para rescatar todo lo que se pudiera reutilizar. Usaron ropa rasgada para alimentar el fuego de la cocina.

Las ratas se habían colado y enjambres de mosquitos revoloteaban sobre las ruinas. Había vidrios rotos por todas partes. Montaron una tienda de campaña fortificada con láminas de metal corrugado y algunos ladrillos rescatados de su casa destruida. Una ligera llovizna mojó sus ropas mientras dormían.

Las agencias de la ONU dicen que el desempleo se ha disparado a alrededor del 80%, en comparación con casi el 50% antes de la guerra y que casi toda la población vive en la pobreza. Incluso a quienes tienen medios les resultaría casi imposible importar materiales de construcción debido a las restricciones israelíes, los combates en curso y el colapso de la ley y el orden.

El primer obstáculo para cualquier reconstrucción significativa son los escombros: montañas de ellos.

Donde antes había casas, tiendas y edificios de oficinas, ahora hay enormes montones de escombros con restos humanos, sustancias peligrosas y municiones sin explotar.

La ONU estima que la guerra ha dejado unas 40 millones de toneladas de escombros en Gaza, suficientes para llenar el Central Park de Nueva York a una profundidad de ocho metros (unos 25 pies). Podría tomar hasta 15 años y casi 650 millones de dólares limpiarlo todo, dijo.

También está la cuestión de dónde deshacerse de ellos: la ONU calcula que se necesitarían unos cinco kilómetros cuadrados (unas dos millas cuadradas) de terreno, que será difícil de conseguir en el territorio pequeño y densamente poblado.

No sólo se destruyeron viviendas, sino también infraestructura crítica.

La ONU estima que casi el 70% de las plantas de agua y saneamiento de Gaza han sido destruidas o dañadas. Eso incluye las cinco instalaciones de tratamiento de aguas residuales del territorio, además de plantas de desalinización, estaciones de bombeo de aguas residuales, pozos y embalses.

Los empleados que antes gestionaban los sistemas municipales de agua y de residuos han sido desplazados y algunos han muerto. Y la escasez de combustible ha dificultado el mantenimiento de instalaciones que siguen intactas.

La organización benéfica internacional Oxfam dijo que solicitó un permiso para traer unidades de desalinización y tuberías para reparar la infraestructura hídrica en diciembre. Israel tardó tres meses en aprobar el envío, que aún no entra en Gaza, agregó Oxfam.

La destrucción de las redes de alcantarillado ha dejado las calles inundadas de agua pútrida, lo que acelera la propagación de enfermedades.

No ha habido energía central en Gaza desde los primeros días de la guerra, cuando su única planta eléctrica se vio obligada a cerrar por falta de combustible, y más de la mitad de la red eléctrica del territorio ha sido destruida, según el Banco Mundial.

Los países árabes ricos, como Arabia Saudí y Emiratos Árabes Unidos, han dicho que están dispuestos a contribuir a la reconstrucción de Gaza sólo como parte de un acuerdo de posguerra que cree una ruta hacia un estado palestino.

Benjamin Netanyahu, el primer ministro israelí, ha descartado esa posibilidad y ha dicho que no permitirá que Hamás o incluso la Autoridad Palestina, apoyada por Occidente, gobiernen Gaza. Ha informado que Israel mantendrá un control de seguridad ilimitado y delegará los asuntos civiles a los palestinos locales. Pero hasta donde se sabe, nadie se ha ofrecido como voluntario y Hamás ha amenazado con matar a cualquiera que ayude a la ocupación.

La reconstrucción de Gaza también requeriría la importación de cantidades masivas de materiales de construcción y equipo pesado, algo que es poco probable que Israel permita mientras exista la posibilidad de que Hamás reconstruya su infraestructura bélica. En cualquier caso, Gaza sólo tiene un pequeño número de cruces con capacidad limitada.

El organismo militar israelí que coordina los asuntos civiles en Gaza dice que no restringe la entrada de suministros civiles y permite los llamados artículos de doble uso que también podrían utilizarse con fines militares. Israel autorizó la entrada de algunos materiales de construcción antes de la guerra bajo lo que se conocía como el Mecanismo de Reconstrucción de Gaza, pero estaban sujeto a fuertes restricciones y retrasos.

La coalición Shelter Cluster estima que se necesitarían 40 años para reconstruir todas las casas destruidas en Gaza bajo esas condiciones.

Por ahora, los proveedores de asistencia tienen dificultades para traer suficientes tiendas de campaña básicas debido al número limitado de camiones que entran en Gaza y a las dificultades para entregar la ayuda. Los esfuerzos para traer viviendas temporales más sólidas todavía están en las primeras etapas, y nadie ha intentado traer materiales de construcción, según Ely.

En septiembre, Shelter Cluster estimó que 900.000 personas todavía necesitaban tiendas de campaña, ropa de cama y otros artículos para prepararse para los inviernos típicamente fríos y lluviosos de la región.

Mozambique headed for crucial elections amid jihadist insurgency and drought-induced hunger,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mozambique-elections-insurgency-drought-cabo-delgado-96a9301e0c1f0333e2d959fae2f7af12,2024-10-07T07:23:04Z,"MAPUTO, Mozambique (AP) -- Mozambicans will vote this week for a new president who many hope will bring peace to an oil- and gas-rich northern province that has been ravaged by a jihadist insurgency for nearly seven years.

Close to 17 million voters will vote for the next president, alongside 250 members of parliament and provincial assemblies, on Wednesday. The current president, Filipe Nyusi, is ineligible to stand again after two terms of office.

During the six week campaign period, which ended Sunday, the frontrunners promised that violence in the north of the country will be their main priority, although none has laid out a plan to end it.

Mozambique has been fighting an Islamic State-affiliated group that has launched attacks on communities in the province of Cabo Delgado since 2017, including beheadings and other killings.

Some 1.3 million people were forced to flee their homes. Around 600,000 people have since returned home, many to shattered communities where houses, markets, churches, schools and health facilities have been destroyed, the United Nations refugee agency said earlier this year.

The candidates rounded off their campaigns on Sunday in the northern and central provinces, which are regarded as the highest-voting constituencies. They promised to address development issues exacerbated by the insurgency.

Daniel Chapo, the presidential candidate of Nyusi's ruling Front for the Liberation of Mozambique (Frelimo), has been telling rallies that peace will allow Cabo Delgado to rebuild infrastructure.

""The first objective of governance is to work to end terrorism using all available means to return peace. Peace is the condition for development,"" said Chapo at a rally last week in Pemba, the provincial capital of Cabo Delgado.

Frelimo, which has ruled the country since independence in 1975, is widely expected to win again.

Lutero Simango, the candidate of the Democratic Movement of Mozambique, spent most of his time campaigning in the central and northern regions, and made promises to remedy a lack of medicines in public hospitals, high unemployment and abject poverty.

Venacio Mondlane, who is running for president as an independent, has also promised to deal with the violence in the region.

""From the moment my government is in place, I can assure you that kidnappings happening in the country, including terrorism in Cabo Delgado, will be wiped out in one year,"" Mondlane said drawing wild cheers from his supporters.

Corruption and poverty have also been major campaign issues as the country grapples with high levels of unemployment and hunger that has been exacerbated by El Nino-induced severe drought.

According to the United Nations World Food Program, 1.3 million people in Mozambique are facing severe food shortages as a result of the drought.

The ruling Frelimo party has also been tainted by corruption scandals, including the so-called ""tuna bond"" scandal, which saw politicians jailed for taking payoffs to arrange secret loan guarantees for government-controlled fishing companies.

The loans were plundered, and Mozambique ended up with $2 billion in ""hidden debt,"" spurring a financial crisis as the International Monetary Fund halted financial support to the country.

The Southern African Development Community, a regional bloc of southern African nations, has sent a delegation of 52 election observers to the country. The observer mission on Friday called for the impartiality of the country's electoral bodies during the polls.

Local elections held in Mozambique last year were marred by wide-ranging allegations of vote-rigging and electoral fraud, sparking violent protests, after Frelimo won 64 of 65 municipalities. A consortium of election observers reported widespread ballot stuffing, voter intimidation and falsification of results in favor of Frelimo.

""The political parties already have their bases in the electorate and during the campaign we did not see anything different in relation to the previous elections. We would need something drastic to happen for Frelimo to lose these elections,"" said political analyst Dercia Alfazema.

Borges Nhamire, a researcher at the Institute for Security Studies, said the eventual winner will inherit a country facing many problems.

""The president to be elected will find a very difficult situation because he is in transition during a period of war, and every transition that takes place during a period of war is very difficult,"" said Nhamire."
Gaza is in ruins after Israel's yearlong offensive. Rebuilding may take decades,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-anniversary-palestinians-gaza-destruction-6b41ad9f64887228e90793705dd379a7,2024-10-07T04:49:05Z,"There are hills of rubble where apartment blocks stood, and pools of sewage-tainted water spreading disease. City streets have been churned into dirt canyons and, in many places, the air is filled with the stench of unrecovered corpses.

Israel's yearlong offensive against Hamas, one of the deadliest and most destructive in recent history, has killed more than 41,000 people, a little over half of them women and children, according to local health officials. With no end in sight to the war and no plan for the day after, it is impossible to say when - or even if - anything will be rebuilt.

Even after the fighting stops, hundreds of thousands of people could be stuck living in squalid tent camps for years. Experts say reconstruction could take decades.

""This war is destruction and misery. It would make the stones cry out,"" said Shifaa Hejjo, a 60-year-old housewife living in a tent pitched on land where her home once stood. ""Whoever sees Gaza ... It will make them cry.""

Israel blames the destruction on Hamas. Its Oct. 7 attack on Israel -- in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage -- ignited the war. Israel says Hamas embedded much of its military infrastructure, including hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, in densely populated areas where some of the heaviest battles were fought.

The fighting left roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza destroyed or severely damaged, according to a U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage.

If there's a cease-fire, around half of all families ""have nowhere to go back to,"" said Alison Ely, a Gaza-based coordinator with the Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council.

Almost as many buildings have been destroyed or damaged in Gaza as in all of Ukraine after its first two years of war with Russia, according to Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek, U.S.-based researchers who use satellite radar to document the wars' devastation.

To put that into perspective: Gaza is less than half the size of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.

The amount of destruction in central and southern Gaza alone, Scher said, is roughly equivalent to what was lost in the front-line town of Bakhmut, the scene of one of the deadliest battles in the Ukraine war and where Russian forces destroyed nearly every building in their path to force Ukrainian troops to withdraw. The destruction in northern Gaza is even worse, he said.

Gaza's water and sanitation system has collapsed. More than 80% of its health facilities -- and even more of its roads -- are damaged or destroyed.

""I can't think of any parallel, in terms of the severity of damage, for an enclave or a country or a people,"" Scher said.

At the end of January, the World Bank estimated $18.5 billion of damage -- nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022. That was before some intensely destructive Israeli ground operations, including in the southern border city of Rafah.

When Israeli ground forces pushed into the southern city of Khan Younis in January, Shifaa Hejjo and her family fled their four-story home with only the clothes they were wearing.

They spent months in various tent camps before she decided to return - and the sight brought her to tears.

Her entire neighborhood had been destroyed, her former home and the roads leading to it lost in a sea of rubble.

""I didn't recognize it,"" she said. ""I couldn't tell where people's homes were.""

Around 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced by the war, often multiple times, according to U.N. estimates. Hundreds of thousands have crowded into sprawling tent camps near the coast with no electricity, running water or toilets. Hunger is widespread.

Hejjo lived in a tent in the courtyard of a hospital. Before that, she was in Muwasi, the main tent camp in southern Gaza.

""It smelled bad,"" she said. ""There were diseases spreading.""

She said her husband, who was suffering from liver disease, was broken-hearted when he heard their home had been destroyed and he died shortly thereafter.

She was among the first to return after Israeli forces withdrew in April. Her neighbors stayed away, fearful they would find bodies or unexploded bombs.

But for her it was still home.

""It is better to live in my home, where I lived for 37 years, even though it is destroyed,"" she said.

Hejjo and her children dug through the rubble with shovels and their bare hands, going brick by brick and saving whatever could be reused. Torn clothes were used to feed cooking fires.

Rats had crept in, and swarms of mosquitoes hovered over the ruins. There was broken glass everywhere. They set up a tent fortified by corrugated metal sheeting and some bricks salvaged from her destroyed home. A light drizzle wet their clothes as they slept.

U.N. agencies say unemployment has soared to around 80% -- up from nearly 50% before the war -- and that almost the entire population is living in poverty. Even those with means would find it nearly impossible to import construction materials because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order.

The first obstacle to any significant rebuilding is the rubble - mountains of it.

Where houses, shops and office buildings once stood, there are now giant drifts of rubble laced with human remains, hazardous substances and unexploded munitions.

The U.N. estimates the war has left some 40 million tons of debris and rubble in Gaza, enough to fill New York's Central Park to a depth of eight meters (about 25 feet). It could take up to 15 years and nearly $650 million to clear it all away, it said.

There's also the question of where to dispose of it: The U.N. estimates about five square kilometers (about two square miles) of land would be needed, which will be hard to come by in the small and densely populated territory.

It isn't just homes that were destroyed, but also critical infrastructure.

The U.N. estimates nearly 70% of Gaza's water and sanitation plants have been destroyed or damaged. That includes all five of the territory's wastewater treatment facilities, plus desalination plants, sewage pumping stations, wells and reservoirs.

The employees who once managed municipal water and waste systems have been displaced, and some killed. And fuel shortages have made it difficult to keep operating facilities that are still intact.

The international charity Oxfam said it applied in December for a permit to bring in desalination units, and pipes to repair water infrastructure. It took three months for Israel to approve the shipment, but it still has not entered Gaza, Oxfam said.

The destruction of sewage networks has left streets flooded with putrid water, hastening the spread of disease.

There has been no central power in Gaza since the opening days of the war, when its sole power plant was forced to shut down for lack of fuel, and more than half of the territory's electrical grid has been destroyed, according to the World Bank.

Wealthy Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they are only willing to contribute to Gaza's reconstruction as part of a postwar settlement that creates a path to a Palestinian state.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled that out, saying he won't allow Hamas or even the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza. He has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control and delegate civilian affairs to local Palestinians. But none are known to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened to kill anyone who aids the occupation.

Rebuilding Gaza would also require the import of massive amounts of construction supplies and heavy equipment, which Israel is unlikely to allow as long as there's a potential for Hamas to rebuild its militant infrastructure. In any case, Gaza has only a small number of crossings with limited capacity.

The Israeli military body that coordinates civilian affairs in Gaza says it does not restrict the entry of civilian supplies and allows so-called dual-use items that could also be used for military purposes. Israel allowed some construction materials in before the war under what was known as the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism, but it was subject to heavy restrictions and delays.

The Shelter Cluster estimates that it would take 40 years to rebuild all of Gaza's destroyed homes under that setup.

For now, aid providers are struggling just to bring in enough basic tents because of the limited number of trucks going into Gaza and the challenges of delivering aid. Efforts to bring in more robust temporary housing are still in the early stages, and no one has even tried to bring in construction materials, according to Ely.

In September, the Shelter Cluster estimated 900,000 people were still in need of tents, bedding and other items to prepare for the region's typically cold and rainy winters."
"Biden talks election, economy and Middle East in surprise news briefing",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-conference-hamas-israel-kamala-harris-lebanon-hezbollah-jd-vance-0093866898d9f9067ff0676672cba9d8,2024-10-04T20:48:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 1,080 days as president, Joe Biden on Friday decided to pop in and take questions in the White House briefing room for the first time, striding in with a grin after a strong monthly jobs report and the temporary settlement of a strike by ports workers.

The president has been less available than his recent predecessors to questions from White House press corps, making his surprise appearance welcome to the gathered reporters who waited as his press secretary's daily briefing was moved up 15 minutes, then delayed for nearly one hour.

The president stepped through the press room's blue door in a dark gray suit and red tie and proceeded to make news in response to questions about comments on the 2024 presidential election, the latest jobs numbers and the escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The 81-year old stepped aside from the Democratic nomination this summer, backing Vice President Kamala Harris instead. He acknowledged doubts about whether the November election would be peaceful, given comments by former President Donald Trump that the results could be rigged.

""I'm confident it will be free and fair. I don't know whether it will be peaceful,"" Biden said. ""The things that Trump has said, and the the things that he said last time when he didn't like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous.""

Biden has tried to rebut a political movement that has at times openly trafficked in conspiracy theories, with the latest revolving around the government reporting Friday that employers added 254,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%.

""Another fake jobs report out from Biden-Harris government today,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., posted on social media. ""But all the fake numbers in the world aren't going to fool people dealing with the Biden-Harris.""

The jobs reports are legitimate and have capped a solid run for the U.S. economy. Growth has stayed solid even as the inflation rate has dropped from a four-decade high in 2022 to an annual rate of 2.5%.

Consumer confidence has been weak relative to overall economic growth, a sign that many people still don't feel the strength seen in the latest jobs and inflation numbers. But Biden stressed that he was operating on valid data despite unfounded claims of falsification by supporters of Trump's Make America Great Again movement.

""If you notice, anything the MAGA Republicans don't like they call 'fake,'"" Biden said. ""The job numbers are what the job numbers are. They're real. They're sincere.""

The president also highlighted the deal reached Thursday to suspend a strike by 45,000 dockworkers on East and Gulf coast ports until Jan. 15, creating time to try to hash out a new contract.

Still, challenges remain for Biden as his final months as president involve the risk of a wider war in the Middle East.

Since Hamas attacked Israel nearly a year ago, Israel has retaliated by bombarding the Gaza region in ways that have raised human rights concerns, as well as killing Hezbollah leaders and launching airstrikes in Lebanon. On Tuesday, Iran fired at least 180 missiles into Israel and there are concerns about additional retaliation that could cause the conflict to deepen.

When asked, Biden clarified his comments from a day earlier about Israel possibly striking Iranian oil facilities, which caused the price of the commodity to jump on the prospect of supplies being squeezed.

""Look, the Israelis have not concluded what they're going to do in terms of a strike,"" Biden said Friday. ""That's under discussion. I think if I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.""

The president emphasized that he and Harris are ""singing from the same song sheet"" on foreign and domestic policy, calling her a ""major player in everything we've done.""

As Biden began to leave the room, he was asked if he would reconsider his decision to exit the race. Biden cocked his head and smiled."
Tunisia votes Sunday in its third presidential election since the Arab Spring,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-presidential-election-kais-saied-9cb6593c3154b0e9a32131d1afe6d118,2024-10-04T05:34:16Z,"TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) -- With his major opponents imprisoned or left off the ballot, Tunisian President Kais Saied faces few obstacles to winning reelection on Sunday, five years after riding anti-establishment backlash to a first term.

The North African country's Oct. 6 presidential election is its third since protests led to the 2011 ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali -- the first autocrat toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings that also overthrew leaders in Egypt, Libya and Yemen.

International observers praised the previous two contests as meeting democratic norms. However, a raft of arrests and actions taken by a Saied-appointed election authority have raised questions about whether this year's race is free and fair. And opposition parties have called for a boycott.

Not long ago, Tunisia was hailed as the Arab Spring's only success story. As coups, counter-revolutions and civil wars convulsed the region, the North African nation enshrined a new democratic constitution and saw its leading civil society groups win the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering political compromise.

But its new leaders were unable to buoy its struggling economy and were plagued by political infighting and episodes of violence and terrorism.

Amid that backdrop, Saied, then 61 and a political outsider, won his first term in 2019. He advanced to a runoff promising to usher in a ""New Tunisia"" and hand more power to young people and local governments.

This year's election will offer a window into popular opinion about the trajectory that Tunisia's fading democracy has taken since Saied took office.

Saied's supporters appear to have remained loyal to him and his promise to transform Tunisia. But he isn't affiliated with any political party, and it's unclear just how deep his support runs among Tunisians.

It's the first presidential race since Saied upended the country's politics in July 2021, declaring a state of emergency, sacking his prime minister, suspending the parliament and rewriting Tunisia's constitution consolidating his own power.

Those actions outraged pro-democracy groups and leading opposition parties, who called them a coup. Yet despite anger from career politicians, voters approved Saied's new constitution the following year in a low-turnout referendum.

Authorities subsequently began arresting Saied's critics including journalists, lawyers, politicians and civil society figures, charging them with endangering state security and violating a controversial anti-fake news law that observers argue stifles dissent.

Fewer voters turned out to participate in parliamentary and local elections in 2022 and 2023 amid economic woes and widespread political apathy.

Many wanted to challenge Saied, but few were able to.

Seventeen potential candidates filed paperwork to run and Tunisia's election authority approved only three: Saied, Zouhair Maghzaoui and Ayachi Zammel.

Maghzaoui is a veteran politician who has campaigned against Saied's economic program and recent political arrests. Still, he is loathed by opposition parties for backing Saied's constitution and earlier moves to consolidate power.

Zammel is a businessman supported by politicians not boycotting the race. During the campaign, he has been sentenced to prison time in four voter fraud cases related to signatures his team gathered to qualify for the ballot.

Others had hoped to run but were prevented. The election authority, known as ISIE, last month dismissed a court ruling ordering it to reinstate three additional challengers.

With many arrested, detained or convicted on charges related to their political activities, Tunisia's most well-known opposition figures are also not participating.

That includes the 83-year-old leader of Tunisia's most well organized political party Ennahda, which rose to power after the Arab Spring. Rached Ghannouchi, the Islamist party's co-founder and Tunisia's former house speaker, has been imprisoned since last year after criticizing Saied.

The crackdown also includes one of Ghannouchi's most vocal detractors: Abir Moussi, a right-wing lawmaker known for railing against Islamists and speaking nostalgically for pre-Arab Spring Tunisia. The 49-year-old president of the Free Destourian Party also was imprisoned last year after criticizing Saied.

Other less known politicians who announced plans to run have also since been jailed or sentenced on similar charges.

Opposition groups have called to boycott the race. The National Salvation Front -- a coalition of secular and Islamist parties including Ennahda -- has denounced the process as a sham and questioned the election's legitimacy.

The country's economy continues to face major challenges. Despite Saied's promises to chart a new course for Tunisia, unemployment has steadily increased to one of the region's highest at 16%, with young Tunisians hit particularly hard.

Growth has been slow since the COVID-19 pandemic and Tunisia has remained reliant on multilateral lenders such as the World Bank and the European Union. Today, Tunisia owes them more than $9 billion. Apart from agricultural reform, Saied's overarching economic strategy is unclear.

Negotiations have long been stalled over a $1.9 billion bailout package offered by the International Monetary Fund in 2022. Saied has been unwilling to accept its conditions, which include restructuring indebted state-owned companies and cutting public wages. Some of the IMF's stipulations -- including lifting subsidies for electricity, flour and fuel -- would likely be unpopular among Tunisians who rely on their low costs.

Economic analysts say that foreign and local investors are reluctant to invest in Tunisia due to continued political risks and an absence of reassurances.

The dire economic straits have had a two-pronged effect on one of Tunisia's key political issues: migration. From 2019 to 2023, an increasing number of Tunisians attempted to migrate to Europe without authorization. Meanwhile, Saied's administration has taken a harsh approach against migrants arriving from sub-Saharan Africa, many who have found themselves stuck in Tunisia while trying to reach Europe.

Saied energized his supporters in early 2023 by accusing migrants of violence and crime and portraying them as part of a plot to change the country's demography. The anti-migrant rhetoric prompted extreme violence against migrants and a crackdown from authorities. Last year, security forces targeted migrant communities from the coast to the capital with a series of arrests, deportation to the desert and the demolition of tent camps in Tunis and coastal towns.

Bodies continue to wash ashore on Tunisia's coastline as boats carrying Tunisians and migrants from sub-Saharan Africa manage only to make it a few nautical miles before sinking.

Tunisia has maintained ties with its traditional Western allies but also forged new partnerships under Saied.

Much like many populist leaders who've taken power worldwide, Saied emphasizes sovereignty and freeing Tunisia from what he calls ""foreign diktats."" He has insisted that Tunisia won't become a ""border guard"" for Europe, which has sought agreements with him to better police the Mediterranean.

Tunisia and Iran lifted visa requirements and in May announced plans to boost trade ties. It has also accepted millions in loans as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative to build hospitals, stadiums and ports.

Yet European countries remain Tunisia's top trade partners and their leaders have maintained productive ties with Saied, hailing agreements to manage migration as a ""model"" for the region.

Saied has spoken ardently in support of Palestinians as war has swept the Middle East and opposes moves made to normalize diplomatic ties with Israel."
Jobs report is likely to show another month of modest but steady hiring gains,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jobs-hiring-federal-reserve-inflation-unemployment-economy-87447d5187b37bb0f5cf996e25bad808,2024-10-04T04:06:40Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. labor market is still reliably cranking out jobs each month, enough to give Americans the confidence and paychecks to keep spending and sustaining the economy. Yet the pace of hiring has lost momentum over the past several months, evidence that employers have become more cautious.

September likely brought more of the same. The Labor Department is expected to report Friday that employers added a decent but hardly spectacular 140,000 jobs last month, roughly matching August's 142,000 gain, according to forecasters surveyed by the data firm FactSet.

""We'll get modest employment gains, not all that great, but enough to keep the economy moving forward,'' said Brian Bethune, an economist at Boston College.

The economy's resilience has come as a relief. Economists had expected that the Federal Reserve's aggressive campaign to subdue inflation -- it jacked up interest rates 11 times in 2022 and 2023 -- would cause a recession. It didn't. The economy kept growing even in the face of ever-higher borrowing costs for consumers and businesses.

Last month, the Fed began cutting rates, in part to try to bolster the slowing job market. And, as Bethune noted, the once unlikely prospect of a ""soft landing'' -- in which high interest rates help vanquish inflation without triggering a recession -- ""is already secure.''

The economy is weighing heavily on voters as the Nov. 5 presidential election nears. Many Americans are unimpressed by the job market's durability and are still frustrated by high prices, which remain on average 19% above where they were in February 2021. That was when inflation began surging as the economy rebounded with unexpected speed and strength from the pandemic recession, causing severe shortages of goods and labor.

Across the economy, most indicators look solid. The U.S. economy, the world's largest, grew at a vigorous 3% annual pace from April through June, boosted by consumer spending and business investment. A forecasting tool from the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta points to slower but still healthy 2.5% annual growth in the just-ended July-September quarter.

On Thursday, the Institute for Supply Management, an association of purchasing managers, reported that America's services businesses grew for a third straight month in September and at an unexpectedly fast pace. The economy's service sector is closely watched because it represents more than 70% of U.S. jobs.

Last month, the nation's households increased their spending at retailers. And even with hiring having slowed, Americans are enjoying extraordinary job security. Layoffs are near a record low as a percentage of employment. The number of people filing for unemployment benefits also remains near historically low levels.

Companies seem generally reluctant to let workers go even though they are also hesitant to expand their payrolls. That unusual dynamic may stem from many employers having been caught flat-footed and short of staff after the economy began roaring back from the pandemic recession.

Employers added an average of just 116,000 jobs a month from June through August, including a dismal 89,000 in July. That marked the weakest three months of hiring since mid-2020. Hiring has plummeted from a record average of 604,000 a month in 2021 at the end of COVID recession and 377,000 in 2022.

Posted job openings, too, have declined steadily, to 8 million in August, after having peaked at 12.2 million in March 2022.

Workers have noticed the chillier environment for jobseekers. Far fewer feel confident enough to leave their jobs to seek a better position. The Labor Department reported this week that the number of Americans who are quitting their jobs fell to its lowest level since August 2020, when the economy was still reeling from COVID.

Job-hopping isn't as lucrative as it had been, either. Last month, those who changed jobs were earning 6.6% more than they had earned a year earlier -- a 1.9 percentage point premium over the 4.7% median pay gain of those who stayed put. The job-hopping premium used to be far higher -- a peak of 8.8 percentage points in April 2022, according to Liv Wang, lead data scientist at ADP Research.

Two and a half years of high interest rates, it seems, have taken a toll on the job market. But relief might be coming.

The Fed last month slashed its benchmark interest rate by a hefty half-percentage point -- its first and biggest rate cut since the 2020 recession. The central bank said it was encouraged by progress in its fight against inflation. Consumer prices were up 2.5% from a year earlier in August, barely above the Fed's 2% inflation target and down dramatically from a year-over-year peak of 9.1% in June 2022.

Friday's jobs report may bring more good news on inflation. Diane Swonk, chief economist at the tax and consulting firm KPMG, said she expects that average hourly wages rose 0.2% last month, down from a 0.4% increase in August. That would translate, she says, into a 3.7% gain from a year earlier. That's close to the 3.5% that many economists regard as consistent with the Fed's inflation target. Such a drop would ease pressure on employers to pass along the cost of higher wages by raising their prices and thereby feeding inflation.

The Fed's focus shifted to supporting the job market as hiring slowed this summer and unemployment rose, even while remaining relatively low. The central bank has signaled that it expects to cut its key rate twice more this year -- likely by modest quarter-points -- and four additional times in 2025.

The expectation of lower borrowing costs could encourage employers to pick up the pace of hiring.

""They see light at the end of the tunnel of this monetary tightening that's been going on a couple of years,'' Bethune said."
Palestinians in West Bank risk crossing Israel's separation barrier to flee failing economy,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jobs-palestinians-israel-barrier-economy-west-bank-2971f01fd6fd878399911cef00bfa087,2024-10-02T04:13:51Z,"YATTA, West Bank (AP) -- At dawn in mid-May, Sayyed Ayyed and dozens of other unemployed Palestinian men gathered at the foot of the towering wall of concrete and barbed wire dividing the occupied West Bank from Israel.

A smuggler was there with a ladder and ropes. Each man handed over the equivalent of $100. Ayyed waited his turn as others clambered over.

The 30-year-old father of two young daughters hadn't found work for a year. Debts were mounting. Rent had to be paid. On the Israeli side, there was the lure of work on a construction site. He just had to get over the wall.

""When we reach the point where you see that your children do not have food,"" he said, ""the barrier of fear is broken.""

A year of war in Gaza has reverberated across the West Bank, where the World Bank warns the economy is at risk of collapse because of Israeli restrictions barring Palestinian laborers from entering the country for work, and the biggest wave of violence in decades.

Unemployment has skyrocketed, reaching 30% from around 12% before the war. The past year, some 300,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, many of whom worked in Israel, have lost their jobs, the Palestinian Economy Ministry says. Over the first quarter of 2024, the territory's economy contracted by 25%, according to the World Bank.

Desperate for jobs, some Palestinians are resorting to smuggling themselves at great personal risk through the guarded barrier and into Israel.

When they find them, Israeli security forces arrest them -- or at times open fire. There are no official figures from Palestinian authorities about workers killed or injured by Israeli gunfire trying to cross the barrier. The Associated Press spoke to families of three Palestinians who said their relatives were killed trying to sneak across.

""These people are being shot at trying to go to work,"" said Assaf Adiv, director of MAAN, a worker's association that focuses on Palestinian labor rights.

Before the war, some 150,000 Palestinians from the West Bank were crossing legally every day into Israel to work, mainly in construction, manufacturing and agriculture.

After Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israeli authorities barred entry to most Palestinians, saying it was necessary for security. Tens of thousands of Palestinians became jobless overnight.

Eyad al-Najjar, a 47-year-old laborer from a village near the West Bank town of Yatta, slipped into Israel through a barbed-wire section of the barrier in July, earning the equivalent of $650 for a week's work, his family said.

Then his son got married. The wedding set the family back $8,000. So al-Najjar tried his luck again.

He approached a hole in the barrier Aug. 26, three days after the wedding. Israeli troops spotted al-Najjar and opened fire, killing him with a shot to the head, his relatives said.

""His children will have to work to close this debt in the future,"" relative Jawadat al-Najjar said. ""No one helps in these difficult days.""

The Israeli military told the AP it couldn't comment on the shooting without specific coordinates of where relatives said it happened.

""The IDF forces work to prevent illegal infiltrations and to maintain the security of the barrier and the safety of residents,"" it said in a statement. ""The forces conduct proactive ambushes along the barrier, arresting infiltrators and infiltrator smugglers and operate both overtly and covertly to protect the barrier area.""

Labor rights experts say infiltrations happen daily, often involving dozens of Palestinians at a time.

Many Palestinians found their livelihoods gutted by the restrictions. Some sold possessions. On West Bank roadsides, children hawk tissues, bottled water and air fresheners. Some men have tried their hand at selling sandwiches at makeshift street stalls.

It isn't just the cutoff from jobs in Israel. The military also tightened its grip in the West Bank, implementing a network of new military checkpoints that have hampered the movement of commerce and workers.

Vehicles can wait for hours as soldiers inspect everyone, unlike before the war, when many were waved through. Other roads are shut off completely. In one case, the army closed a road linking 12 villages to the southern town of Dura, said local activist Badawi Jawaed. Many workers couldn't reach their jobs and were laid off, he said.

Violence has surged, with increased Israeli raids targeting armed groups. More than 700 West Bank Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, the Palestinian Health Ministry says. Many were shot dead in armed clashes, others for throwing stones at troops. But some appear to have posed no apparent threat.

In Israel, Palestinians can earn double or triple a West Bank salary. Standing in their way is Israel's barrier, running some 700 kilometers (400 miles) long and peaking at 7-meters (23-feet) tall.

Many climb over with ladders and ropes. Others hide in trucks that pass through checkpoints. Some slip through holes in fencing, workers and experts said.

Ayyed once worked for an Israeli construction company that paid 7,000 shekels ($1,850) monthly. Cut off from the job since the war began, he searched for work in his home city of Jenin, in the northern West Bank.

Ayyed said he tried grocery stores and restaurants, but no one was hiring.

To get by, he borrowed money from friends, racking up around $1,600 in debt. He cut back on water and electricity. By spring, he had no one left to borrow from and a $500 monthly rent bill to pay.

So he decided to risk it.

As he scaled the wall, the ladder slipped. Ayyed fell to the ground on the West Bank side, breaking his leg. He limped home penniless.

Palestinian smugglers or middlemen linked to gangs on both sides of the barrier arrange the crossings. They provide ladders and rope, as well as vehicles on the Israeli side to whisk workers away from the patrolled barrier.

They charge 300 to 1,000 shekels ($79 to $260), said Arafat Amro, a Palestinian labor rights expert.

Once through, work isn't hard to find, due to a labor shortage across Israel, mostly in construction and agriculture, Palestinian workers and Amro said.

To evade Israeli authorities, Palestinian workers are ""sleeping in the fields, they sleep in the farms, they sleep under the trees, at the construction sites,"" Amro said.

Raouf Adra, a laborer from Yatta, said he found two week's work on a construction site in the southern Israeli town of Dimona that would have paid 350 shekels ($65) daily. After climbing the barrier and reaching the site, he was told he was forbidden to leave after his shifts, to prevent discovery.

The next day, Israeli police stormed the site, arresting Adra and several other Palestinians. The Israeli site manager was nowhere to be seen.

""He ran away,"" Adra said.

Adra was handed a 40-day prison sentence and fined 1,500 shekels ($390). Once released, he was transported back to the West Bank and banned from entering Israel for three years.

Unable to walk after his fall in May, Ayyed said he had to sell the gold his family gave his wife as a wedding present and then his car.

""I know people who sold their furniture,"" he said.

Four months later, his broken leg is almost completely healed.

Asked if he would try again, he replied: ""If the situation remains the same, I will consider it."""
Speaker Johnson lays out agenda for Republicans as they fight to hold House majority,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/house-republican-agenda-speaker-johnson-fb0d90c029b5ba595d3ef58b887794b5,2024-10-01T23:34:48Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaker Mike Johnson laid out on Tuesday a policy agenda should Republicans take the majority next year that extends the tax cuts approved when Donald Trump was president, reduces the size of the federal workforce and gives parents more choice on where they can send their children to school.

Johnson emphasized five main policy points during a speech at the New York Stock Exchange. He talked of extending and building on the Trump tax cuts, confronting China, boosting oil and gas production, expanding school choice and cutting the size and scope of the federal government.

""The survival of the American dream depends upon our victory,"" Johnson said.

The speaker and House Republicans are fighting this election season to hold their narrow House majority, with just a handful of seats to spare. Republicans are hopeful that a Trump victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the election will help propel them to majorities in the House and Senate, which would give them unified control of Washington for the first time since 2018 and the ability to enact a sweeping legislative agenda.

Against the campaign backdrop, Johnson provided a bleak view of the economy under President Joe Biden, though the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, inflation is on the decline and the unemployment rate is still low by historical standards. He spoke to an audience of Wall Street investors, traders and others who have witnessed stock markets reach record highs in recent days.

But Johnson said that as he has traveled the country, he's meeting business owners on the verge of collapse because of high inflation, high taxes and over-regulation. And he said he's met moms and dads who have resorted to donating plasma and setting up crowdfunding pages so that they didn't lose their homes.

""Our incredible people are hanging on right now in spite of so many unprecedented challenges, but many can't afford to do it much longer,"" Johnson said.

The first policy priority he outlined was enhanced tax breaks, citing specifically immediate expensing for research and development costs. He also cited the need for a ""strong"" child tax credit, though he did not provide specific numbers. He said the Republican tax policies would ""respect the dignity of work, and it doesn't pay people more for staying out of the workforce.""

Trump has laid out a series of tax cuts on the campaign trail, such as extending the expiring provisions of his 2017 overhaul, and not taxing tips and Social Security. Outside experts say the tax cuts proposed by Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris would cause the debt to rise even faster the pace under current law.

Doing more to confront China and rolling back environmental regulations are a common denominator for Republicans that Johnson embraced in his speech. On education, he said millions of Americans have the opportunity to send their children to a school that best fits their need, and ""Republicans want to expand that choice so that every American has that opportunity.""

Johnson also emphasized cutting the debt by cutting the size of the federal government, saying ""we're going to reduce the size of the federal workforce and root out a long list of non-essential jobs through the federal bureaucracy.""

""It's hard to roll back the entrenched bureaucracy and face the system that has produced the decline. It's a difficult task, but it's a task that can be achieved,"" Johnson said."
US job openings rise to 8 million as labor market remains sturdy,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/job-openings-economy-unemployment-inflation-federal-reserve-4f4122a0601c7622a53de1625d63f51f,2024-10-01T14:16:35Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- U.S. job openings rose unexpectedly in August as the American labor market continued to show resilience.

The Labor Department reported Tuesday that employers posted 8 million vacancies in August, up from 7.7 million in July. Economists had expected openings to be virtually unchanged.

Layoffs fell in August. But the number of Americans quitting their jobs -- a sign of confidence in the labor market -- slid in August.

Job openings have come down steadily since peaking at 12.2 million in March 2022, but they remain above where they stood before the coronavirus pandemic hit the American economy in early 2020. When the economy roared back with unexpected strength from COVID-19 lockdowns, companies scrambled to find enough workers to keep up with customer orders.

The overheating economy caused an outburst of inflation, and the Federal Reserve responded by raising its benchmark interest rate 11 times in 2022 and 2023. Inflation has come down -- from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022 to 2.5% in August.

The economy proved surprisingly resilient in the face of the Fed hikes, averting a widely forecast recession. But the job market has gradually lost momentum. Hiring averaged just 116,000 net new jobs a month from June through August -- the weakest three-month average since mid-2020.

When the Labor Department releases its jobs report for September on Friday, it is expected to show that employers added 143,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate remained at a low 4.2%, according to a survey of forecasters by the data firm FactSet.

The Fed, satisfied with the progress against inflation and worried about the cooling job market, last month cut its benchmark rate by a hefty half percentage point, the central bank's first and biggest rate cut since March 2020."
"Asian markets mixed, Japanese stocks rally from Monday's slump",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stock-markets-rates-japan-fed-6b846be540b1ede94c2a2cb8410e6f15,2024-10-01T06:02:38Z,"HONG KONG (AP) -- Asian shares were mixed on Tuesday, with Japan's Nikkei 225 index regaining some of its sharp losses from a day earlier.

A quarterly ""tankan"" survey by the Bank of Japan showed business confidence among large manufacturers remained steady at 13, indicating an improved outlook for business conditions. A positive number indicates that more companies maintain an optimistic outlook on business conditions than those who feel pessimistic.

The survey is closely monitored for clues about the impact of the Bank of Japan's interest rate decisions, especially after the central bank ended negative rates in March and raised its short-term rate to 0.25% in July.

Japan also reported that its unemployment rate for August fell to 2.5% from 2.7% in July, in line with market expectations.

Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 rallied 1.5% in early Tuesday to 38,476.33, as the yen weakened. The dollar is trading at 144.00 yen, up from 143.62 yen.

On Monday, the Nikkei tumbled nearly 5% as markets reacted to the selection of Shigeru Ishiba to be Japan's next prime minister. Ishiba was due to take office Tuesday following the resignation of Prime Minister Fumio Kishida.

Ishiba, an expert on defense and on domestic economic issues, was seen as a less favorable choice than some of his rivals in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party, partly because he has voiced support for raising interest rates. That caused the Japanese yen to briefly jump in value against the dollar, which would hurt profits of large export manufacturers.

Australia's S&P/ASX 200 dipped nearly 0.7% to 8,214.80 after the data showed that retail sales in August rose 3.1% from the same period last year, which is above expectation.

Markets in China and South Korea were shut for holidays. Mainland Chinese markets, which had their best day since 2008 on Monday, will remain closed until Oct. 7 for the National Day break.

On Monday, the S&P 500 climbed 0.4% to reached an all-time high at 5,762.48 and clinched its fifth straight winning month and fourth straight winning quarter. The Dow Jones Industrial Average added less than 0.1% to 42,330.15. The Nasdaq composite rose 0.4% to 18,189.17.

Wall Street has catapulted to records on hopes the slowing U.S. economy can keep growing while the Federal Reserve cuts interest rates to offer it more juice. A big test will arrive Friday, when the U.S. government offers its latest monthly update on the job market.

An overriding worry on Wall Street is whether the economy may already be heading for a recession. Even though the Fed cut rates earlier this month and has indicated more relief is on the way, U.S. employers have already begun paring back on their hiring. Before this month, the Fed had kept interest rates at a two-decade high in hopes of slowing the economy enough to stamp out high inflation.

In the bond market, U.S. Treasury yields rose after investors took comments from Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a hint that coming cuts to interest rates may be more traditional sized.

The Fed began its rate cuts with a larger-than-usual reduction of half a percentage point, and many traders expect the next meeting in November could yield a similar sized reduction. Fed policy makers already had indicated they were planning two more cuts this year of the traditional size of a quarter of a percentage point.

But Powell said again on Monday that rate cuts are not something the Fed needs to work quickly on. After his comments, traders were betting on just a 35% probability the Fed will cut rates by another half a percentage point in November. That's down from a 53% chance seen the day before, according to data from CME Group.

The yield on the 10-year Treasury rose to 3.78% from 3.75% late Friday.

In other dealings Tuesday, benchmark U.S. crude oil added 10 cents to $68.27 per barrel. Brent crude, the international standard, rose 15 cents at $71.85 per barrel."
Leaders depart UN facing prospect of a wider Mideast war  --  but with a blueprint for a better future,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/un-leaders-mideast-war-multilateralism-inequality-netanyahu-a6396f79d45a67b44c97f8ece2eec619,2024-10-01T01:25:29Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- They gathered at the United Nations surrounded by unsettling warnings of an escalating conflict that could engulf the Middle East and further shatter international relations that are based on ""multilateralism"" -- nations working together and sharing power. A week later, world leaders headed home with the prospect of a broader war intensifying and global divisions front and center, not only in the Mideast but elsewhere.

There was no expectation of major breakthroughs in the public and private meetings at the annual U.N. General Assembly meeting of presidents, premiers and other leaders. There rarely is. But this year was especially grim, with no end in sight to the three major conflicts in Gaza, Ukraine and Sudan, and Israeli military action in Lebanon escalating.

U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres' warning that multilateralism needs to be brought back ""from the brink"" added to the gloom, along with speech after speech decrying failures to tackle climate change and address growing inequalities between rich and poor nations, and warning of artificial intelligence with no guardrails and the potential of killer weapons with no human control.

General Assembly President Philémon Yang concluded the weeklong, high-level meeting Monday afternoon, calling it ""particularly tumultuous"" and pointing to the ""violent conflicts"" that are raging.

""This is, unfortunately, not an exhaustive list of the crises and conflicts affecting member states of the United Nations,"" he lamented.

There was no disagreement that multilateralism is broken, that this founding principle of the United Nations - established in 1945 on the ashes of World War II -- needs urgent resuscitation to deal with the challenges the world faces today.

One example: During the very hour on Friday when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told the General Assembly that his country genuinely wants peace -- a goal stressed by virtually every leader -- Israeli warplanes were bombing areas around Beirut in a lethal barrage.

In the last few days, Yang said, the world has seen ""an extremely dramatic escalation"" between Israel and Hezbollah in Lebanon that risks war in the entire Middle East. ""As we speak, peace in the Middle East is hanging delicately on a shoestring,"" he warned..

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric said this year's meeting of leaders - with its marquee speeches known in U.N.-speak as the ""general debate"" - took place at ""a very serious and a very intense time.""

""The world doesn't stop for the general debate,"" he told reporters Monday. ""So we were focused very much on what member states said, but we continue to be very much focused on what is going on in the world outside of this building.""

There was one positive development welcomed by Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and many leaders: The adoption of a ""Pact for the Future"" at a summit just before world leaders began their addresses to the General Assembly. The 42-page blueprint aims to bring the 193 U.N. member nations together to meet today's challenges, from climate change and artificial intelligence to escalating conflicts and increasing inequality and poverty.

It challenges leaders of countries large and small, rich and poor, to turn promises into actions. Whether that happens remains to be seen. Yang, the assembly president, said his office has already instituted ""an awareness-raising campaign"" to spur implementation.

In an illustration of the blend of woe and weary hope that percolated through the gathering, Burundi's foreign minister, Albert Shingiro, on Monday decried an international community where ""most of us act like we were alone in the world, like others didn't exist or didn't count.""

Still, he said, the consensus on the Pact for the Future ""shows that multilateralism is not dead and buried.""

From the vantage points where leaders of smaller or less powerful nations sit, the U.N. can't change the world without changing itself. Founded with 51 member countries, it now has 193, and many feel included only to a point.

""We must ensure that global institutions give developing countries, especially small, vulnerable ones like my own, seats at the tables of decision-making,"" said Barbados' prime minister, Mia Mottley. ""The anger and mistrust of our citizens in institutions, in leaders and in multilateralism and its processes which exclude, while yielding much talk and little action, is very real.""

Nobel peace laureate Muhammad Yunus, head of Bangladesh's interim government, said ""time demands new attitudes, new values, new compacts, across communities and countries.""

""I believe, the world needs to engage on a shared vision of 'three zeroes' that we can materialize together, targeting zero poverty, zero unemployment, and, zero net carbon emissions -- where a young person anywhere in the world will have opportunities to grow, not as a job seeker but as entrepreneur,"" he told the assembly.

During the global gathering, the assembly heard from 190 countries - all but Brunei, Myanmar and Afghanistan. The speakers included 71 heads of state, 42 heads of government, six vice-presidents and crown princes, eight deputy prime ministers, 53 ministers, three vice-ministers and seven heads of delegations. Usually, the U.N. Security Council holds one meeting during the high-level week, but this year the council met about a half-dozen times because of the global conflicts and crises.

For all the alarm, leaders here are politicians, and many made a point of appealing at least somewhat to optimism. Perhaps none stressed it as much as U.S. President Joe Biden, making his last speech at the annual meeting after more than a half-century in public life.

He noted that humanity has brought to a close some of the seemingly intractable threats, conflicts and injustices that beset the world when he was elected as a senator in 1972, from the Cold War to apartheid in South Africa.

3 Top Stocks To Buy Now After The Fed Rate Cut,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/best-stocks-to-buy-now-after-fed-rate-cut/,2024-10-08T21:13:42Z,"The Federal Reserve committee inaugurated the much-anticipated interest rate cut cycle in mid-September, slashing half-a-percentage point off its benchmark rates without waiting to hit its actual 2% inflation target. The objective of the bigger-than-expected rate cut was to avert a recession, when a weaker-than-expected July jobs report officially triggered the Sahm Rule-a historical recession indicator that has a consistent 100% (well, almost) accuracy rate for every recession since the early 1970s. This gives rise to a few questions like:

The Federal Reserve launched its interest rate cut cycle on September 18, by aggressively slashing 50 basis points off benchmark rates, lowering the federal funds rate to a range of 4.75% to 5%. The federal funds rate represents the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans to fulfill their reserve requirements. Banks are mandated by law to hold a reserve equal to a specific percentage of their deposits, referred to as the reserve requirement to ensure that bank is capable of meeting sudden withdrawals.

This is the first rate cut in four years since the Fed's emergency response to pandemic shutdowns in March 2020. Another half-percentage point reduction before this year-end is likely in the cards with an additional percentage-point cut anticipated in 2025.

The Fed raised interest rates from March 2022 to July 2023, to ease inflation that surged to the highest levels in more than four decades. In June 2022, inflation in the U.S. reached a whopping 9.1%, as prices and demand soared amid pandemic-disrupted supply constraints and unprecedented government stimulus programs that pumped about $5 trillion into the economy. When inflation shoots up, the Fed Reserve typically steps in to cool the inflation by raising interest rates and making borrowing more expensive. This brings down spending and demand thereby inflation.

The corollary to rising interest rates is an increase in borrowing costs for businesses as well, which in turn triggers cost-cutting, slowdown in expansion initiatives, layoffs and lesser new hires. This leads to an increase in the unemployment rate, which was 4.1% in September, up from 3.8% in the same month last year. A rise in unemployment rate alongside a slowdown in hiring has renewed recession concerns.

With the half-a-percentage cut, the Fed is hoping for a soft landing, a scenario in which the economy slows sufficiently to reduce inflation without entering a recession. The Fed's mandate is to restore price stability, while trying not to increase unemployment, even as its 2% inflation target appears within reach. Experts opine that a soft landing is plausible but far from guaranteed.

The current inflation rate is 2.5%, the lowest since February 2021, and lower than the long-term average of 3.28%. The fact that the Fed did not wait until the 2% inflation target was hit clearly shows where its priorities lie now-to avoid a recession.

Historically accurate and reliable recession indicators like the Sahm Rule are now facing skepticism because the pandemic has disrupted normal business activity and complicated forecasting efforts. The Sahm Rule, named after former Fed economist Claudia Sahm, states that a recession may happen when the three-month moving average of the national unemployment rate rises by 0.50 percentage points or more when compared to its low during the previous 12 months. The Sahm Rule has maintained an impressive accuracy rate of nearly 100% for every recession since the early 1970s. The only exception occurred in November 1976, when the rule was triggered without a corresponding or subsequent recession.

The Sahm Rule reading was 0.53% for July when the unemployment rate hit 4.3%. However, the rule's inventor Sahm herself rebutted the surge of catastrophic narratives, stating that ""I am not concerned that, at this moment, we are in a recession."" in an interview with Fortune. However, she also added later ""I think the recession odds, given what we're seeing in the labor market, are increasing."" While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell was slightly dismissive of the Sahm Rule as more of a ""statistical regularity"" than an ""economic rule."" Sahm believes the rule shouldn't be dismissed as it's been very accurate over time and noted that ""recessions can build slowly, and then come quickly.""

Meanwhile, the unemployment rate dipped from 4.3% in July to 4.2% in August and 4.1% in September showing improvements ahead of the upcoming elections in November. In September, the U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs exceeding estimates for 150,000 new jobs. The upbeat September jobs report should silence concerns about an impending disaster at least for now.

Nevertheless, unemployment rates will be a key data point to watch going forward. Any material rise in unemployment and fall in hiring may likely hit consumer spending, which has thus far been resilient because of strong wage gains. It is natural for people to cut back on spending when facing unemployment or the threat of losing a job.

High interest rates incentivize the consumer to save money, while lower interest rates tend to influence the consumer to borrow, spend and invest. Consumer spending is the main driver of the U.S. economy, accounting for more than two-thirds of U.S. economic activity.

Fed rate cuts are expected to be most impactful for credit cards that have variable interest rates. The previous Fed rate hike cycle has pushed the variable interest rates on credit cards close to all-time highs of above 21% currently, from around 14.6% in March 2022 when the rate hikes began. As the rate cut cycle unfolds, credit card rates will likely ease below 20%, offering some degree of relief for borrowers.

Mortgage rates for both 15-year and 30-year fixed loans are typically linked to Treasury yields and the overall economy, are likely to decrease slightly but are unlikely to return to the lows seen in the last decade. Currently, the average rate for a 30-year fixed mortgage hovers around 6.2%. Experts predict these rates will remain between 6% and 6.5%, with the possibility of dipping below 6%. However, elevated home prices may still deter potential home buyers.

Auto loans are fixed with the average rate on a five-year new car loan being 6.8% in the second quarter, sharply higher than the 4% levels at the beginning of rate hikes. While the easing of rates may encourage car buyers who have pushed-out on purchases, the limiting factor could still be higher vehicle prices and lack of incentives for buyers.

The fixed nature of Federal student loan rates also means that a rate cut may have no impact on these borrowers, because these interest rates don't change over the loan term.

Savings rates have benefitted from the rate hike cycle. A high-yield savings account (HYSA) offers nearly 5% interest, while top interest rates from certificate of deposit (CD) instruments range from 4.00% to 5%. While these interest rates could decline, the opportunity still exists to secure a HYSA or CD before rates drop further.

A research study by Hartford Funds shows that 7 of the 11 Fed rate cutting periods from 1980 to 2024 were accompanied by recessions. While recession is not a desirable condition, how does it impact the stock market? Here are some interesting observations.

An analysis by Hartford Funds of 22 Fed rate-cutting cycles since 1928 revealed that the S&P 500 benchmark index on average outperformed government bonds and corporate bonds in the 12 months after the Fed started cutting interest rates. The average 12-month real return (after adjusting for inflation) from the date of first rate cut for U.S. stocks (represented by the S&P 500 index) has been 11% vs. 5% returns for government bonds and 6% returns for corporate bonds and 2% returns for cash.

The average returns of the stock market in the 22 rate cut cycles is even more impressive considering that in 16 out of 22 cycles the U.S. economy was already in a recession when the rate cuts were initiated or entered a recession within a 12 month period.

During the non-recessionary, rate-cut cycles the stock market returned a solid 17% on average (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut) vs. 2% for government bonds, 4% for corporate bonds and 3% for cash. In the event of a recessionary, rate-cut period, the stock market still returned a positive 8% on average vs. 7% for government and corporate bonds and 2 % for cash (in the 12-month period after the first rate cut.)

While these stock market returns seem solid, investors should remember that this is an average value for 22 rate cut cycles. The stock market suffered heavy losses too during recessionary periods. In 6 out of 22 rate cut cycles, stock market returns fluctuated widely between a negative 10% to negative 45%.

After the much touted ""great rotation"" into small-cap stocks, the focus is shifting to mid-cap stocks, because investors may be looking at a situation where small-caps may still be risky and large caps still too expensive. Until the Fed achieves the targeted soft landing, recession worries will continue to linger at the backdrop. Besides, the longer-for-higher interest rates have also triggered concerns about a slower-than-anticipated Fed rate easing cycle.

With stronger fundamentals (higher profitability and solid balance sheet) vs. small-caps and attractive valuations vs. large-caps, mid-caps seem better positioned to benefit from the present Fed rate cuts. Yet another solid reason for the pivot to mid-caps is the historical outperformance of mid-caps vs. large caps and small caps in the first 3 and 12 months subsequent to the first Fed rate cut. According to Goldman Sachs, the S&P 400 mid-cap index has been an outperformer since 1984 vs. the S&P 500 (large-caps) and Russell 2000 (small-caps) in the 3 and 12 months following the first Fed first rate cut. Presently, Goldman Sachs projects a 13% return for the S&P 400 index over the next 12 months.

Elf Beauty qualifies as a high growth beauty company, having grown sales and market share for 22 straight quarters, and averaging at least 20% sales growth per quarter. Over the past five years, Elf has expanded its top one/two positions from across eight segments in the color cosmetics category to 18 segments, which now account for over 80% of its Elf cosmetics sales. The company's ""Holy Grail"" approach centers on creating value versions of prestige products to align with consumer preferences. For reference, the average price point for Elf is about $6.50 vs. around $9.50 for legacy mass cosmetics brands and more than $20 for prestige brands. Elf's recent Bronzing Drops is comparable to a prestige product in the market at a third of the price. This strategy has helped solidify Elf's outperformance in the cosmetics category.

Solid market share gains: Elf Beauty's color cosmetics business continues to be a category outperformer. A 26% growth across track channels in the first quarter vs. a 1% decline for the category, has helped ELF grow its cosmetics market share to 12.3% presently. This represents a more than 2x increase from 5.7% market share in the same quarter three years ago. ELF expects to double its cosmetics market share again in a few years.

Shelf-space gains with Walmart, top share with Target, Opportunities at groceries, drug stores: With Target, a long-standing customer, Elf Cosmetics is the number one brand for six quarters in a row with its share rising from 13% to 21%. A 50% shelf space gain from 8 feet to 12 feet at Walmart is commendable, but still underpenetrated vs. legacy brands that have a 16 feet to 20 feet shelf space. The opportunities for expansion are attractive at Target, Walmart and Alta, alongside growth at grocery and drug stores, where ELF currently has a much smaller footprint.

Maximizing Brand Performance with Retail Partners: Elf proactively refreshes up to 20% of its retail assortment annually, leveraging insights from its digital business and beauty squad loyalty programs. This strategy has doubled its average sales per SKU over the past five years, making it a highly productive brand in terms of dollar sales per foot basis with retailers.

Growing Skincare business: Elf Beauty hopes to replicate the success in its cosmetics business across its skincare segment. For the latest first quarter, Elf SKIN grew 45% in track channels, vs. category growth of 1.4%. Elf SKIN has roughly 2% market share as of the first quarter vs. 14% share for the leading skin care brand. ELF's Naturium acquisition from last year should also help unlock growth in the skin category.

International expansion opportunities: International sales accounted for 16% of ELF's total first-quarter sales, up from 13% a year ago, but is still underpenetrated vs. global peers that have a 70% exposure to international sales. International expansion represents a key growth runway for ELF.

Upbeat Guidance: ELF recently raised guidance for fiscal 2025 (ending on March 31, 2025), now expecting adjusted EPS of $3.36 to $3.41, on sales of $1.28 billion to $1.30 billion, from prior expectations of $3.20 to $3.25 EPS on sales of $1.23 billion to $1.25 billion. The revised guidance compares more favorably with year-ago EPS of $3.18 on revenues of $1.02 billion.

ELF Stock Sell-off presents opportunity: Despite these positive developments, ELF stock trades way off its 52-week intra-day high of $221.83 reached in early March. After a couple of attempts in late June and mid July to recapture the highs of the year, the stock has fallen sharply amid concerns regarding the sustainability of its growth rates above 20%. However, it still has a Strong Buy rating from 16 Wall Street analysts.

Medpace is a full-service clinical contract research organization providing Phase I-IV clinical development services for the biotechnology, pharmaceutical and medical device industries. Medpace calls itself as a CRO trusted by biotechs with a focus on small to mid-sized biopharma customers that represented more than 95% of its 2023 revenues. With an estimated 5% market share in the small and mid-sized biopharma space, Medpace sees an estimated core addressable biopharma CRO market of $28 billion.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profit: Top line has grown at a nearly 22% CAGR from $704.6 million in 2018 to $1.89 billion in 2023, while net income has grown four-fold from $73.2 million or $1.97/share in 2018 to $282.8 million or $8.88 per share in 2023.

Attractive Free Cash Flow characteristics: Medpace has attractive free cash flow (FCF) characteristics with FCF growing from $138.7 million in 2018 to $396.7 million in 2023. Ebitda-FCF conversion has remained above 100% since 2019.

Upbeat outlook: For 2024, revenue is expected to be between $2.125 billion and $2.175 billion, representing year-on-year growth of 12.7% to 15.3%. Net income is expected to be $361 million to $383 million or $11.24 per share to $11.93 per share and Ebitda to be $430.0 million to $460.0 million.

Concerns over cancellation appear baked into stock price now: While announcing second-quarter earnings results, the company cited some order cancellations that brought its book-to-bill ratio to 1.04 for the quarter vs. prior expectations for 1.2. Medpace also cautioned that the book-to-bill numbers could be flat to slightly higher sequentially in the third quarter. Some analysts downgraded the stock to a Hold/Neutral rating in late September citing weaker bookings growth coupled with cancellations as one of the reasons.

Are the concerns overrated? In the earnings call, Medpace said it does not see a prolonged pullback, or does not view the cancellations as a pattern that's going to continue. Besides, a book-to-bill of 1.04 for one quarter is not earth shattering, because it is still above 1, implying strong demand. Medpace sees the third quarter book-to-bill to be at 1.04 or slightly higher and in the first quarter the number was at 1.2. Also, Backlog as of June 30, 2024 was a solid $2.9 billion, up 13.7% year-on-year, and Medpace expects to convert about $1.585 billion of this backlog to revenue over the next twelve months. Medpace even raised its profit guidance for 2024 to show that it continues to anticipate industry-leading organic revenue growth and profitability despite the challenges in backlog growth. The backlog concerns appear to be priced into the MEDP stock that is already trading well below its mid-July highs of $459.77.

Upcoming catalyst: A key catalyst for the Medpace stock is the upcoming third-quarter earnings report, slated for release on October 21, after market close. Overall the MEDP stock has a moderate buy rating from analysts.

Skechers, dubbed as the comfort footwear giant, is a Fortune 500 company that makes lifestyle and performance footwear, apparel and accessories for men, women and children. International sales represented more than 60% of its 2023 top line. The comfort footwear maker operates via wholesale and direct-to-consumer (DTC) business segments, with wholesale representing 56% of sales in 2023, and the rest coming from DTC.

Record second-quarter sales: Despite currency and supply chain headwinds, regulatory obstacles in India, and a lackluster 6/18 holiday in China, Skechers delivered record second-quarter sales of $2.16 billion, up 7.2% year over year driven by continued strength in its international DTC business and significant improvement in its domestic wholesale business.

Solid growth trends in revenue, profits: Skechers has grown sales from $5.2 billion in 2019 to $8 billion in 2023, and earnings per share from $2.25 to $3.49. Fiscal 2024 outlook is even better with sales expected between $8.88 billion and $8.98 billion and EPS expected to be $4.08 to $4.18.

Expanding margins: Skechers sells at affordable price points, yet gross margins have remained above 47% since 2019 exceeding 50% in 2023, while operating margins have been mostly in the mid-to-high single digits, with the exception of a drop to 2.9% in 2020. The margin story gets even better in the first half of 2024, with gross margins at 53.7% and operating margin at 11.5%.

One shoe does not fit all but Skechers fits all into one shoe: Considerable thought goes into the design of Skechers footwear to meet the needs of every walk of life. Under a partnership with John Deere, Skechers recently launched a footwear line for agricultural professionals, construction workers, and outdoor enthusiasts. Made of waterproof materials, the footwear line has interesting features like composite toe protection, nano carbon safety and Poron XRD metatarsal protection-Poron XRD being a flexible, lightweight, breathing foam, which hardens when impacted and forms a protective shell around the foot, absorbing up to 90% of the impact energy. Skechers has also integrated its slip-resistant and electrical hazard-rated technologies into the new offering.

Reasonably attractive valuation: Skechers stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings multiple (P/E) of 16.2x based on $4.08 eps guidance for 2024 (at the low end of the range). This is lower than its own five-year historical average of 21.2x. If the multiple re-rates to a conservative 19x (at the midpoint of the multiple range), it would still represent about 17% upside from current price levels. The footwear maker's expectations to achieve $10 billion in sales by 2026, also implies 13% upside potential from current stock levels, upon applying the current forward price-to-sales (P/S) multiple of 1.13x. The stock may have 13%-17% upside potential from current levels.

The U.S. economy is currently not in a recession. The Fed rate easing cycle may likely achieve a soft landing of the economy, although there are no guarantees and historical evidence points otherwise, at least most of the time. Monthly Jobs data will continue to be a critical watch point. Even as recession fears linger, mid-cap stocks could be a preferred investment over large-cap or small-cap stocks, as mid-caps are at the confluence of reasonable valuations and stronger fundamentals. The mid-cap stocks highlighted in the article enjoy profitable growth with upbeat future prospects."
Walgreens Is The Latest Employer To Embrace Student Loan Benefits,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mariagraciasantillanalinares/2024/10/08/walgreens-is-the-latest-employer-to-embrace-student-loan-benefits/,2024-10-08T18:18:19Z,"Plus, another 'September surge' in the job market, managers are willing to pay higher starting salaries for in-office personnel and how Marianne Markowitz climbed the financial corporate ladder.

Did you know that employers can match your student loan payments with contributions into your 401(k)? Thanks to Secure Act 2.0, which took effect January 1, employers can now offer extra retirement savings to young workers making student loan payments, even if the employee is not contributing to their retirement account on their own.

On Thursday, Walgreens became the latest large employer to embrace this benefit, offering it to the company's more than 300,000 employees. This means that Walgreens will match up to 4% of eligible pay for workers who are paying down student loans, even if they have not contributed directly to their 401(k) themselves.

Employees who've worked at Walgreens for one year and have completed 1,000 hours of work are eligible.

The program has been lauded as a win for young workers who have to choose between saving for retirement or paying off debt. At Walgreens, roughly 30% of the company's employees are facing financial debt from higher education, according to the company, including more than half of its pharmacists. On average, pharmacists have $170,000 of student debt, according to the American Association of Colleges of Pharmacy, making it one of the professions with the highest debt.

While other major employers--including Verizon, Kevin Hart-owned Hart House, Chipotle and Abbott Laboratories (a medical devices and healthcare company)--are offering the same benefit, its adoption has been slow, according to Bloomberg. The hesitance is largely due to employer's compliance and logistics concerns in its implementation, even after the IRS issued additional guidance in August.

As the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness plan moves through the courts, student loan 401(k) matching could be a major help to the 42.8 million Americans paying off student loan debt. But the key question remains: Just how many employers will implement it?

In other news, another hurricane is scheduled to make landfall in the south this week. To all of those in the path of Hurricane Milton, please listen to local officials and I hope you stay safe.

Happy reading, and hope you have a lovely week!

Practical insights and advice from Forbes staff and contributors to help you succeed in your job, accelerate your career and lead smarter

A career financial expert, Marianne Markowitz is the founding CEO of First Women's Bank, a Chicago-based bank focused on serving women. Fresh off the heels of announcing the launch of the FWB Collective, a resource hub for women to launch their own businesses, I spoke with the First Women's Bank CEO to speak about her career in finance and focus on banking for women, working with small businesses, and what she learned working in both the private and public sectors. Our conversation has been edited for length and clarity.

Before starting First Women's Bank, you had some impressive stints as a risk and treasury manager in the private sector before heading up the Small Business Association. What did you find was the biggest pain point in the transition from private to public employers?

You know, it's interesting because I expected there to be more pain points than I actually experienced. Up until that point, the Small Business Administration (SBA) was the smallest organization I'd ever worked for--even Barack Obama's presidential campaign was larger. So as a federal agency, you were able to actually shape that agency, which was really interesting as an entrepreneurial-focused group. So I didn't experience that many pain points. Now, if I'd joined a much larger agency that would have been different! But the SBA is a unique agency in how it mirrors the private sector more because most of its partners are in the private sector, and works with over 4,000 banks.

Oh interesting! What's your advice to someone who may be considering a similar move, jumping into working with federal or government agencies?

There's a lot of doors into the public sector, so it's likely there is one that fits most people's backgrounds. I would say if you're inclined to serve at all, then it's a fit for you. It's all about service, and it's an amazing way to build a career. It's hard to explain, and you can't understand the scale of your impact when you're in the public sector (almost like you can't explain what it's like having a baby until you do!). You get to touch and impact so many lives with the work you do, it's an amazing place to build a future.

Between starting First Women's Bank and working in banking, you've had the experience of both being a founder but also climbing the corporate ladder. What is one thing you learned during that time that really helped you reach the C-Suite both as a CFO at the Obama presidential campaign and now as the founding CEO?

The next step is not only the one that is right above you. Sometimes I think we only see our careers linearly. But often moving side to side and gaining other experience will prepare you to move up, and it may not be the immediate channel that you see right ahead of you.

The other thing is sometimes, our work doesn't give us the opportunity or positions that we're ready for. Sometimes, it doesn't give us the opportunity to lead, or that's not part of your particular job at the time. So look outside your day job and find opportunities. We don't make the time to do that early enough in our career. Go find a nonprofit, get on a board, because when I look at a résumé I look at all of that. Where is the leadership in this résumé? It may not be in your position, but it happened because you did something that was really important to your job that aligned with your values outside of work.

Also, show up to the employee resource groups!

That's a good point -- leadership doesn't have to be in your job description to become a leader. What is one unique thing you look for in not only new hires, but women who come to the bank looking for funding or loans?

As women, we can often have disruptions in our career. We've got live events that we're balancing with that, and those disruptions can make for zig-zags in our résumés. That's something we really understand at First Women's Bank, and we give a lot of credit to the portability of experience and how we underwrite someone's ability to lead a business. It's something we really acknowledge, even if their career doesn't play out in a linear fashion. That's one way we really acknowledge and show up for women.

News from the world of work

September's jobs report smashed analyst expectations as 254,000 new jobs were added to the economy, according to the Labor Department, over 100,000 more than expected. The unemployment rate also dipped, falling to 4.1% from 4.2% in August. Revisions for June and July jobs reports also saw an increase of 72,000 jobs added over the summer.

Markets Project Smaller 2024 Interest Rate Cuts On Better Jobs News,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/08/markets-project-smaller-2024-interest-rate-cuts-on-better-jobs-news/,2024-10-08T17:17:05Z,"With recent, stronger jobs data, markets expect the remaining anticipated interest rate cuts of 2024 to be 0.25% moves. That's down from expectations that both November and December Federal Open Market Committee meetings could see 0.5% cuts. Fixed income market expectations are tracked by the CME FedWatch Tool.

There was concern that the U.S. unemployment situation could weaken further. However, the Employment Situation Report for September showed clear improvement. Unemployment fell slightly for the second consecutive month to 4.1% and nonfarm payrolls rose 254,000. That's over 200,000 jobs added for the first time since May.

Now, the FOMC will see another jobs report on November 1 before its next meeting on November 6-7 and that data could change things. Inflation numbers will matter too. Nonetheless, for now, U.S. unemployment data is more positive than generally anticipated and inflation continues to trend lower.

This matters because if unemployment were to rise significantly, then the FOMC may be prompted to cut rates quite rapidly. That would be to try and reduce the risk of a recession. On the most recent data, a steep rise in unemployment is not happening.

Of course, inflation appears to be returning to the FOMC's 2% annual target, so that creates some momentum for less restrictive monetary policy. However, if the jobs market continues to appear robust, then there's perhaps a little less urgency for interest rate cuts.

The remaining scheduled FOMC interest rate decisions of 2024 are on November 7 and December 18. Currently, fixed income markets expect both to result in 0.25% interest rate cuts. That would leave short term interest rates at 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of 2024 or 0.5% lower than current levels. The risk of a slightly larger or smaller interest rate move is balanced, but currently further 0.5% cuts in 2024 are viewed as unlikely just as is the scenario of the FOMC choosing to hold rates steady at either meeting.

In two recent speeches, policymakers have signaled confidence in monetary policy and advocated for a more gradual approach to interest rate cuts.

New York Fed President John Williams said that: ""The current stance of monetary policy is really well positioned to both hopefully keep maintaining the strength that we have in the economy and the labour market, but also continuing to see that inflation comes back to 2 per cent,"" in an interview with the Financial Times on October 7.

St Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, said: ""My baseline outlook is for continued economic expansion over the next several quarters, supported by a gradual easing of monetary policy and accommodative financial conditions."" At a speech in New York on October 7.

There is still more key economic data to come before the FOMC's next scheduled meeting on November 6-7. Primarily, that's the jobs report for October and inflation reports for September.

So far, the jobs markets appears to be performing better than expected since the FOMC last met, and inflation continues to trend lower. If that economic outlook continues, then it appears likely the FOMC will cut interest rates at its two remaining meetings of 2024, but only by 0.25% at each, rather than the previously estimated 0.5%."
How CFOs Are Preparing For The Future Amid Election Uncertainty,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cfo/2024/10/08/how-cfos-are-preparing-for-the-future-amid-election-uncertainty/,2024-10-08T16:05:40Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget.

CFOs are taking on bigger leadership roles and more responsibility throughout the business world. A new IDC InfoBrief study commissioned by Billtrust that focuses on the order-to-cash area of business shows one area in which CFOs are leading: AI adoption.

The study surveyed several top leaders in businesses, which included some CFOs. Nearly nine in 10 respondents said CFOs are becoming more critical to their organizations because of the economic downturn and financial uncertainty, and almost as many said that digital transformation across the OTC process is critical to the survival of their businesses. More CFOs agreed that digital transformation is needed, and more are optimistic about generative AI's potential to bring some of that transformation. Two-thirds of CFOs said generative AI will have a large impact on their organization, as opposed to 59% of all people surveyed. And 44% of CFOs said generative AI will help them do their jobs faster, 9% more than the 35% of all surveyed positions.

These results show that it's time to let CFOs lead on generative AI. They've researched the possibilities and know what it can do. And as a virtue of their position and expertise, they know the financial and strategic options their companies should take to weather the current uncertainty. Companies that want to see the financial part of their business become more effective and efficient should give the CFO the respect the position is now commanding. A bonus: Other studies have shown that CFOs who are able to lead on company strategy tend to significantly outperform their peers.

Deloitte conducts a quarterly CFO survey and found in its latest results that 58% think next month's election will be at least very consequential to their organizations. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global and U.S. leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what this means for CFO planning in Q4 and beyond. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are still open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

The upbeat job data also turned the stock market upwards on Friday, but markets came crashing down Monday afternoon as crude oil prices and government bond yields rose to multiweek highs. Monday was the anniversary of the current Israel and Hamas war in the Middle East, which has recently escalated to include Lebanon and Iran, and has sent defense stocks and oil prices up. The rise in bond yields has been somewhat unexpected, though some analysts have predicted it's in response to increasing oil prices, while others have predicted it's responding to the dwindling likelihood of another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month.

According to CME FedWatch, 88.2% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.8% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Last week, organized labor seemingly notched another victory as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike. On Thursday, the U.S. Maritime Alliance offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port workers wanted a 77% wage increase and a ban on many kinds of automation. There are no proposals made public from USMX on automation, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for the time being.

Meanwhile, Boeing is back at the bargaining table with members of the International Association of Machinists union, though local news station KOMO reported negotiations appear to be at a standstill. More than 30,000 members of the union that work in the aerospace giant's factories have been off the job going on four weeks. In a note reported on by Quartz, analysts at Oxford Economics wrote the Boeing strike could impact GDP growth in Q4, similar to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene -- which caused a wide swath of devastation in the Carolinas and Florida.

The roller coaster ride for Nvidia stock continues, with the company surging to become the world's second most valuable, surpassing Microsoft, on Monday. At the close of markets on Monday, Nvidia was worth $3.132 trillion. Nvidia's stock and market capitalization has seen dramatic rises and falls in the last month and a half. After its most recent earnings report at the end of August -- in which the AI processor company delivered record earnings and smashed expectations -- its stock price tumbled because it didn't project as much growth in the next quarter as some might have wanted to see. But since then, relatively small events have caused Nvidia's stock to spike. At a Goldman Sachs conference in mid-September, CEO Jensen Huang said demand for Nvidia's soon-to-come Blackwell processors was ""so great,"" leading the stock value to pop 8%. And another leap in value came last week when Huang said on a CNBC interview that demand for the new chip was ""insane."" Monday's rally came courtesy of Super Micro Computer's announcement that sales for its liquid cooling products alongside Nvidia's GPUs were strong. This seems to be proof that the AI effect is still strong on markets. The sell off in August looked like investors were stepping back until they saw that Nvidia was worth the share price. But their behavior since then -- buying up the stock whenever there is any potentially positive news -- shows they are still overly eager about the technology's possibilities.

Deloitte's quarterly CFO survey showed that most people in the position view November's election as consequential to their organizations. Even if there weren't an election featuring two candidates with wildly differing policy ideas, there are a host of significant geopolitical and economic issues CFOs need to deal with. I talked to Steve Gallucci, global leader of Deloitte's CFO program, about what that might mean. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

Considering the state of U.S. politics, geopolitics and the economy, was there anything surprising about how CFOs responded to the survey?

Gallucci: There were some things that we pulled from the data that were interesting. For example, while CFOs are still very risk averse -- less than 15% said that this was a good time to take risk -- a lot of them were actually upbeat quarter-on-quarter around the capital markets. This data was collected before the rate cut, but there was a strong expectation [of one], and all signals indicated that rates will continue to trend downward in the next four quarters. That was a pivot over the last seven or eight quarters, as rates were rising, the capital markets were very inactive. When capital markets are inactive, there's less capital spending, there's less M&A.

More than half -- 58% -- said the election will be at least very consequential for their businesses. How does that impact how CFOs run their businesses and planning?

On the day-to-day running of the business, that particular stat has not shifted. In the longer term, a lot of scenario planning is happening. When you step back and think about where we might be from a policy perspective in six months to a year, it could look different from a tariff perspective. It could look different from a labor perspective.

CFOs more broadly have built into their psyche, [and] they approach their roles with an expectation that there will be shocks to the system that come from all angles: geopolitical shocks, certainly elections. [About] 45% of the world's GDP is electing a new leader this year. CFOs have built in an attribute of being agile and able to pivot. If you trace that back, you're going to go to the pandemic. That shock threw everybody for a loop. We haven't had a world pandemic in a hundred years, per se. [Consider] how that impacted business and supply chains, particularly things like semiconductors and computer chips, and being able to get that type of product. When you lob on top of that some of the geopolitical conflicts that we've been dealing with the last couple of years, all have contributed to a much more dynamic type of environment that chief financial officers across all industries and sectors have had to manage.

Do you think most CFOs have been expecting this wildly changing stock market, and are considering that when they're looking ahead?

Without question. They're looking at a whole host of factors in terms of making decisions around capital spending, M&A, new projects. [There is] a lot of variability in all those areas -- the economy, geopolitics, consumer spending -- which gets back to some of the data that we're taking in around being less risk averse, less bullish, et cetera. You put all these factors in a basket and then you have to make business decisions.

Let's take interest rates, for example. As the Fed was on a plan to raise interest rates to fight inflation, there was a lot of unpredictability: When is it going to peak? When is it going to top out? What we have right now is a little more clarity in terms of it's on the way down. They've stated that they want to get to somewhere around two point half percent and the FOMC rate. That gives a little more certainty towards CFOs in that particular area of the private markets. They can start to plan around that. Once you have clarity in a particular area and a sense that things have less unpredictability, you'll start to see some more actions on the part of corporates and CFOs, specifically, around things like M&A and capital spending.

Some of these big question marks will be figured out six months from now. We will have another president. That person will be in office and their economic policies could be stabilizing. How do you see CFOs responding to a similar survey then?

If you look historically post-election, there's a little more certainty in terms of where things will go in the near to medium term. It's hard to handicap what all that will look like. We'll continue to be in a descending rate capital market. With that, you'll see all indications are a much more robust capital market in the way of M&A and bond issues and whatnot.

History would tell you that there could be some type of bounce and there could be more optimism. There could be another geopolitical conflict that could send the markets into a tizzy. We're dealing with things like natural disasters throughout the globe, and that has an impact. I have to hedge with what we know and we don't know.

How Immigration Can Become A Strategic Solution For U.S. Housing Needs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2024/10/08/how-immigration-can-become-a-strategic-solution-for-us-housing-needs/,2024-10-08T13:11:57Z,"As the United States grapples with housing shortages, the influx of migrants and homelessness, the need for innovative, scalable, and humane solutions has never been more urgent. Traditional housing approaches prioritizing permanent solutions, often miss the mark. Whether it is young people seeking to buy their first home, individuals moving to new cities, immigrants who have just landed, migrants shuttled to a new state, or unsheltered homeless people in California, a flexible and forward-thinking housing model is essential. And Immigration may be able to contribute to such a solution.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have made housing a key issue in the current presidential race. Vice President Harris promises to ""cut the red tape that stops housing construction, take on corporate landlords hiking rental prices, work with builders and developers to construct 3 million new homes and rentals, and help first-time homebuyers with $25,000 down payment assistance."" On the other hand, President Trump focuses on deregulation, proposing the opening of federal land for housing development and reducing regulatory hurdles to speed up construction. He opposes rent controls and aims to preserve single-family zoning, framing it as protecting suburban communities.

While these proposals target housing shortages through construction and regulatory reform, neither candidate has sufficiently focused on a critical opportunity: using immigration policy to address U.S. housing needs.

When Congress passed the Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 (RIA) to reform the EB-5 investor immigration program, it created three priority areas for EB-5 funding: high unemployment areas, infrastructure, and rural development. The EB-5 program enables foreign investors to obtain U.S. residency by investing in job-creating projects. Historically, the program has been used for commercial developments, luxury housing, and large-scale projects. However, expanding the EB-5 program to include affordable housing projects could significantly benefit U.S. cities facing severe housing shortages. By directing foreign capital into affordable housing developments, investor immigration could become a key component in solving the U.S. housing crisis. What is proposed here is to add housing to the EB-5 program as a fourth priority. This expansion would encourage foreign investors to channel their investments into developments in cities with the most pressing housing needs, such as affordable apartments in urban centers or temporary housing for new migrants in need of immediate shelter.

To further enhance the program, the U.S. could introduce an Expression of Interest (EOI) system for selecting such EB-5 investors. Such a system is currently in use in Canada, for example, to avoid long backlogs in processing of applications. The system would allow the government to pre-select investors based on factors such as their language proficiency, integration potential, ties to the U.S., and the urgency of housing needs in specific areas. By prioritizing high-quality investors who align with U.S. housing goals, the government can ensure that projects are completed efficiently and in a timely manner. This approach adds flexibility, allowing the U.S. to target investors who are not only financially capable but also committed to contributing to the communities they are entering while preventing frustrating backlogs.

Apart from helping young people looking to buy their first homes and people moving across the country to locate a house they can afford, expanding the EB-5 program for housing, together with some innovative programs we will mention shortly, would also help ensure that migrants and refugees arriving in the U.S. have access to adequate living conditions as they settle into new communities. This approach could reduce the pressure on cities and states already struggling with limited housing availability and strained public resources.

As migrants and refugees continue to arrive in the U.S., the availability of immediate, safe housing is critical to their successful integration. Cities that experience sudden surges in migrant populations often face a severe shortage of affordable housing, leaving many new arrivals without a place to live. Traditional housing models, focused on permanent homes, can take years to develop, and temporary shelters are often overcrowded and unsafe.

A more flexible housing model is needed to address these immediate needs. The U.S. could adopt innovative solutions like those used by Dignity Moves, a California-based nonprofit that provides interim housing for homeless individuals. Dignity Moves constructs affordable, dignified prefabricated units on vacant or underutilized land, providing private, lockable spaces for individuals in need of temporary shelter. This approach could be adapted to house migrants and refugees, offering them a safe place to live while they go through the immigration process and work towards more permanent housing.

To make these solutions work, public-private partnerships will be essential. Local governments, private investors, and nonprofits must work together to ensure that new housing is built quickly and affordably. As already mentioned, the EB-5 program can serve as a key funding mechanism by incentivizing foreign investors to contribute to affordable housing projects in exchange for U.S. residency. Local governments can further support these efforts by offering tax incentives, zoning benefits, and streamlined permitting processes to developers focused on affordable housing. Additionally, philanthropic organizations and corporate social responsibility initiatives can play a role by providing grants and operational support to nonprofits working on innovative housing solutions.

The U.S. housing crisis demands bold and innovative solutions that go beyond traditional construction and regulation reforms. By integrating immigration programs like EB-5 with innovative housing development programs like those mentioned and incorporating an Expression of Interest system to select the most suitable investors, the U.S. can address both the immediate housing needs of migrants and refugees and the broader national shortage of affordable housing while avoiding long immigration backlogs. This could be a game-changing approach to solving the problem involving creative partnerships between governments, private investors, and nonprofits -- all working together to ensure that everyone, from young couples buying their first home, to newly arrived migrants, to homeless people, has a place to call home."
"Markets Are ""On Fire"" Since September Jobs Report. Will They Continue?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2024/10/07/markets-are-on-fire-since-september-jobs-report-will-they-continue/,2024-10-07T20:24:49Z,"On September 6 the jobs report came in weak at 142,000 new jobs. This report was well below expectations, unemployment rose from 4.1% to 4.2% and markets plummeted on the news. Economists proclaimed the beginning of the end with major stock indices falling 2% to 3%. The Vix index, indicating volatility and market nervousness, rose sharply. The outlook among many was bleak and, irrespective of Fed interest cuts on the horizon, many economic ""experts"" began voicing concerns of a recession. Those comments were overblown. The US economy is nowhere near a recession. At least now.

By contrast, on October 4 a new jobs report came out that was red ""hot"". Jobs increased by 254,000, soundly beating expectations, and major market indices soared by 1% to 2%. Since the September 6 dip, major indices have been soaring. The S&P 500 has increased 6.45%, while others such as the QQQ (+8.76%) and the Russell 1000 Growth (+8.43%) have done much better. Leading the pack has been the Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR) which came in at 12.99%. (Note: Past performance is no guarantee or guide to future performance).

This performance has continued the strong year-to-date (YTD) results. The table below shows that, thus far, this has been a banner year. YTD the S&P 500 is +21.86%, with the Russell 1000 Growth (IWF) +24.10% and the Nasdaq QQQ +19.51%. The Entrepreneur 30 Total Return Index (ER30TR) is continuing its strong year from 2023 (57.41%) with a current YTD performance in 2024 of 38% (Note: past performance is no guide to future performance).

What should investors take from these results? In retrospect, the strong negative response from the September, 6, 2024 negative jobs report was an overreaction on the downside. The economic situation for the US was not nearly as bleak as market pundits expressed. To be fair, neither is the strong jobs report on September 6, 2024 as good as many deem it to be. Many of the 245,000 jobs created in the month of September are from government, social services and healthcare. More importantly, the US workforce is old. Very, very old. 75m baby boomers will be at or past retirement age by the year 2030. As many as 25 to 30m working baby boomers, 1/3 of whom now work past retirement age, (well up from 20 years ago) will be retiring within the next 5-10 years. Further, online estimates suggest 300,000 jobs are being outsourced overseas each year. My data from a Capital IQ search of top public IT firms, suggests it is much, much higher. The US is losing high wage IT jobs to places based primarily in India and Eastern Europe. We are losing low wage bookkeeping and call center jobs to places based primarily in Philippines and Vietnam. Many low wage jobs in the US are also being picked up by illegal immigrants working for cash dollars.

Are these labor issues major concerns for the US economy in the next 5-10 years? Absolutely. The US labor force currently only produces approximately 1m new jobs per year. Losing 5 million jobs over the next year, under normal circumstances would be devastating, let alone, 20m to 30m jobs. The US labor force is currently creating non productive jobs in government and social services. As a country, we may soon find ourselves with less than 1/2 of our adults in the labor market. This means fewer Americans will need to perform the heavy lifting to support the rest of us.

Fortunately, purely by coincidence, AI may save the day. The productive capabilities of AI means that we as a population will need fewer workers to provide the same level of productivity as before. Smart robots will enter the workplace and provide more efficient delivery mechanisms than humans. In an environment with a growing population this displacement of humans would be a problem. The US has the opposite issue. The productive capabilities of AI and robotics will be a game changer for many industries, particularly in IT, Healthcare, Communication Services and Consumer Discretionary. We will also see innovative nuclear energy solutions to power our data centers. These innovative, disruptive, entrepreneurial solutions have the ability to arrive just as our aging population needs it most.

Will AI and robotics benefit all companies? Absolutely not. Just as companies such as Nvidia, Applovin and Arista Networks (among others) have begun reaping benefits associated with AI, their competitors have suffered. A declining labor force does not necessarily imply a dip in the stock market.

We believe that the next few years will continue to widen the gap between winners and losers. The stakes have never been higher. Brick and mortar, bureaucratic stores such as Walmart, Target and Home Depot and Telecommunication companies such as AT&T continue to lose hundreds of thousands of jobs, other entrepreneurial companies will grow their ventures and reap strong rewards. Major change to our labor force is guaranteed within the next 5-10 years. But all is not lost. Far from it. We simply need visionaries at the top to help us lead the way.

Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Please refer to the below disclosures:"

ctober is here, and the sprint to the end of the year is fraught with distractions, disasters and disengagement that will be challenging for anyone managing workplaces and teams. A tight, polarizing election has workers unsettled and anxious -- and could drive more conflict in the office. An escalating crisis in the Middle East brings increasing tensions over geopolitical issues, uncertainty about planning ahead and more concerns for employees with family in the region.

Add the devastation of a massive hurricane across the Southeast, and it's been an unparalleled season of disruption for many leaders and workplaces. Hurricane Helene has disrupted operations at a quartz mine in western North Carolina, washing out roads and cutting power to an area critical to semiconductor manufacturing. Some employers across the region are working hard to help workers struggling without power, water or even homes -- while others in Tennessee face inquiries from the state Bureau of Investigation over allegations that they ignored warnings about Helene and required employees to report to work, leading to deaths and missing workers. Asheville, which had prospered with an influx of remote workers, entrepreneurs and new business owners, now faces an unprecedented challenge to rebuild.

Amid all the chaos is the human cost -- and a humanitarian crisis. Disaster relief is inherently hard to execute well, and the people leading it will need support. If you want to help, my colleague Kelly Phillips Erb has a rundown over what you need to know about tax deductible donations and where to donate. Read on for more in today's newsletter about how Amazon's RTO push remains in the headlines, Friday's blockbuster jobs report and an interview with Handshake's chief talent engagement officer about AI and jobs.

September job growth shattered economists' predictions, as U.S. employers added 254,000 jobs last month, according to nonfarm payrolls data released Friday by the Labor Department. It was the biggest month for jobs growth since March, sprinting past average economist estimates of 150,000 and prompting the unemployment rate to dip to 4.1%, compared to projections of 4.2%, where it stood in August. Investors cheered the news with big stock gains Friday.

Striking dockworkers and port employers reached a tentative agreement Thursday, ending a strike that began earlier in the week and lifting concerns over the potential impact to the U.S. economy. The tentative agreement includes a 62% wage increase over six years, according to the Wall Street Journal, and will temporarily relieve Democrats fearful of the strike's impact on the November election. The big issue still up for negotiation? Automation, as workers remain concerned about the potential for layoffs and fewer jobs for humans in the future.

The fallout over Amazon's decision to require full-time office work has remained in the headlines even several weeks after the tech giant made the announcement. Dell has since mandated that salespeople come back to the office five days a week, while McKinsey is also reportedly asking staff to be onsite more often. Will the trend continue? Contributor Ann Kowal Smith sees Amazon's move as the ""canary in the coal mine for a dangerous problem,"" noting ""the relationship between employers and employees has become one based on power, not mutual respect and collaboration."" Meanwhile, contributor Ryan Anderson suggests the continued disappointment leaders feel in one-size-fits-all hybrid policies could mean a different approach would be better for workplace flexibility.

The most sweeping attempt so far to regulate artificial intelligence, a California bill that could have set a precedent for other laws, was vetoed by Governor Gavin Newsom last week. ""I do not believe this is the best approach to protecting the public,"" Newsom said, according to the New York Times. If the California bill had been signed into law, writes Forbes contributor Owen Tedford, it would have predominantly focused on improving AI safety, with businesses that create large AI models required to perform safety tests and publicly disclose how they'd prevent the models from being manipulated. Tedford examines what could come next, suggesting the bill could be changed and reintroduced in future sessions.

Forbes caught up with Valerie Capers Workman, chief talent engagement officer at student careers platform Handshake, about how AI is shifting jobs as we know them, a recent book she published and addressing the gender divide in AI. Excerpts from our conversation have been edited for length and clarity.

How is AI changing jobs?

I'm going to use my son as an example. He entered school in 2018-2019, he was going to be a data scientist. Data science was the career: You're going to get a job the second you hit junior year, you're going to be flooded with internships and you're going to be employed. Enter A.I. The ability of A.I. to take on so much of the preliminary data science work [means] you need to be a masters or PhD in data science to skip over what A.I. can do. [He realized] 'I need to go back to school.' He is now applying to universities for artificial intelligence master's degrees. He loves having the skill set, but A.I. enables more companies to do what he was doing.

What message did you want to share in your book?

The most important concept that I was raising is that the requirement to be superhuman; the requirements of EQ are more important in the age of AI than all the pundits are saying. My point is, yes, you can get an entry level job, but you're not moving up without the EQ, without the combination of AI plus liberal arts skills, the critical thinking skills, you're going to stay right there. The ability to move and progress in your career? You're going to have to do both.

[""AI skills""] are the ability to ask great questions and understand whether or not you've got a great answer and then utilize that answer to do the work you're doing. The ability to ask great questions? That requires critical thinking skills, language skills, reading comprehension skills, historical context, ethical understanding and understanding of biases. Generative AI is what is going to differentiate the general workforce from the executive workforce track, if you will. I think it was a COO from BlackRock who said [they want] to hire finance or tech employees who have liberal arts or history majors? That's what I'm talking about.

If you're hiring, how do you assess that AI skill?

If I'm interviewing someone on my team, I'd ask them: 'I have this issue. Give me an AI prompt that will help me. Give me a prompt that you would use to help me finish this project for me in five days.'

Are you pulling on the right threads to understand what types of questions you need to ask? If I find someone who knows how to frame a question, I can train you how to do that better. I can't train you how to think.

Do companies have a responsibility to retrain their people who work in fields where jobs will be replaced, such as customer service?

That's a great societal question.

What is the responsibility of the employer to reskill its current workforce if a set of roles can now be done by AI? I like to put it this way: The companies that understand how to repurpose their workforce for the higher order skills that need to be done by humans -- that can't be done by A.I. -- are the companies that are going to win.

We're hearing more about how women are not developing the AI skills at the same pace and could get left behind. What can be done to help with this?

In higher education, they need to have required courses, period. Just required. It cannot be optional because women are not taking the AI courses at the same rate as their male counterparts. It can't be optional. ... The societal issues that caused them to run away from a phrase like prompt engineering go all the way back to when they were in third grade. So, required courses.

Same thing with employers. Training should not be optional. ... You're going to leave people behind who don't think that certain courses apply to them. AI courses apply to everyone. They should be mandatory. You can solve a lot of societal anomalies and inequities just by making the playing field even for everyone without having people required to opt in.

Last week's jobs report was a big one, prompting a stock market rally and causing the odds of another interest rate cut in the coming months to fall.

176,000: How many more jobs than expected the U.S. nonfarm labor force grew by from July to September, according to the Labor Department. September's 254,000 nonfarm payroll additions, the highest total in six months, were 104,000 more than economist forecasts, while the government upwardly revised July and August's payroll growth by 55,000 and 17,000, respectively.

83.8%: Prime-age labor force participation, or people working or looking for work, is near multi-decade highs

""The labor market isn't on the brink of collapse and still has the potential to deliver surprises, however its ability to sustain momentum without further support from the Federal Reserve is not guaranteed."" -- Cory Stahle, economist for Indeed Hiring Lab, in a statement

It's a very good time for unions right now. Last week, organized labor likely notched another victory, as 45,000 members of the International Longshoremen's Association returned to work, reopening 36 East Coast and Gulf of Mexico ports after a three-day strike.

Union members started striking at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, after their contract with ocean carriers and port operators represented by the U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX) expired. The strike essentially shut down all cargo ports on the eastern side of the U.S., potentially roiling the economy and supply chains for everything from groceries to automobiles. Union members wanted a 77% wage increase over six years, as well as an agreement to ban automation in places where it could be used to replace workers. To end the strike for now, USMX offered a 62% wage increase over six years and extended the current union contract until January 15, 2025, to allow for further negotiation.

The contract extension means that the nation's ports will remain open for Q4 -- which includes the presidential election and the all-important holiday shopping season. But the new contract isn't even fully negotiated yet, so it's hard to say whether port workers will ultimately support it. Port automation hasn't been resolved, and as Forbes senior contributor Jack Kelly notes, it's a huge issue for the union. The cranes used to remove containers from cargo ships and move them to wherever they need to go next can be automated, meaning fewer people are needed to do the work. Union members are essentially negotiating for their job security -- at least for now.

But cargo ships are getting bigger, global trade is increasing, and there is more demand for imports and exports. Proponents of automation say that it could make ports more efficient, which could help them handle higher volumes. Some ports in Europe and China, as well as a couple on the West Coast, are already automated. The California ports that use automation increased their employment numbers and wage hours after the machinery went in.

These numbers -- and what truly makes a port efficient -- will likely to be discussed at length as the union and USMX return to the bargaining table. It's unknown if the port workers will be willing to compromise on this point. Jim Kruse from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute told Marketplace he has seen forecasts of seaport trade volume doubling by 2050, meaning ports really should be striving toward more efficiency. But if there are no port workers, all of the automation in the world won't be helpful.

Thousands of companies worldwide use Atlassian's collaboration tools -- including Jira, Confluence, Trello and Loom -- to work together and manage projects. I talked to Atlassian President Anu Bharadwaj about how the company uses its culture and experience to best serve enterprise technology needs. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Last month, the U.S. added 254,000 jobs, a huge increase over economists' estimates of 150,000, according to government data released on Friday. The unemployment rate dropped to 4.1%, an improvement of a tenth of a point over August. This level of job growth didn't just happen in September. The government revised its summertime job growth figures, adding 55,000 more jobs to July's total -- reaching 144,000 jobs -- and 17,000 more jobs to August, for a total of 159,000.

With the upbeat job data, the stock market turned upwards, too. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 both rose close to a percentage point on Friday, while the Nasdaq was up 1.2%. ""The economy continues to show incredible resilience,"" Bolvin Wealth Management Group President Gina Bolvin said in comments emailed to Forbes.

While the jobs data and stock bounces are all good for the economy, economists say they're negatively impacting the chances for another big interest rate cut when the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee meets early next month. According to CME FedWatch, 88.5% of economists now believe interest rates will be cut by a quarter percent, with the remaining 11.5% not expecting a rate cut at all. Forbes' Derek Saul talked with Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago President Austan Goolsbee, an alternate member of the Open Market Committee, about what he'll be paying attention to as the Fed closes out the year. The unemployment rate going forward is important, he said. ""After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?""

Spirit Airlines stock dropped more than 30% on Friday after reports that the budget carrier may be exploring bankruptcy following a failed merger with JetBlue Airways. It was the deepest plunge of the airline's stock since January, when the Justice Department blocked the proposed $3.8 billion acquisition on antitrust grounds, sending prices down more than 50%. Spirit has been working toward improving its financial position this year, executing a restructuring plan that involves changing routes, deferring new aircraft deliveries, cutting 32 routes, and adding new premium tiers for passenger service and experience. Spirit Airlines CEO Ted Christie has said in the last two earnings reports that the company was discussing options with its bondholders for bills due soon. In the last earnings report, CFO Fred Cromer said updates would be provided ""when appropriate."" According to the Wall Street Journal, people familiar with the matter said any bankruptcy filing is not imminent, and recent talks have focused on reaching an agreement to support a Chapter 11 filing.

In today's business world, studies found most women are not at the levels where decisions are being made. Just 9% of CEOs at the largest U.S. companies are women, but there are few women in the other C-suite roles that can be seen as stepping stones to the top spot, according to a new analysis by executive search firm Russell Reynolds. Looking at the top 100 companies on the S&P, there are 74% fewer female executives on leadership teams than there are in the current U.S. population. Looking at the position-by-position breakdown, 46% of CMOs are women, the closest to the half of the population women represent. There are the most female CHROs -- 72% -- and the fewest CEOs and COOs -- 8%. Forbes senior contributor Kim Elsesser writes other recent studies show that the professional bias against women starts early. A recent study by McKinsey and LeanIn found that women represent 59% of all bachelor's degree recipients, but only represent 48% of entry-level corporate roles. For every 100 men promoted to manager, only 81 women get the same career advancement. Another study that interviewed 57 women CEOs found that two-thirds of them weren't aware the CEO role was in their grasp until someone else suggested it.

Thousands of companies across the globe use Atlassian's collaboration tools -- which include Jira, Confluence, Trello and Loom -- to work together and manage projects. I talked to President Anu Bharadwaj about how Atlassian serves companies' tech and AI needs, the culture at the 22-year-old company -- which is still founder-led, and its growth prospects.

This interview has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here.

How do you figure out which problems Atlassian should be solving next with AI, and how do you go forward doing it?

Bharadwaj: We are a company of product builders. Our philosophy is: Create the things that you want to use yourself. A lot of our product heritage has been we build products for ourselves and then figure out [if] this is interesting for other people, and how can we make it more generalized and applicable in different industries and contexts?

Or we go off and acquire a product. Loom is a great example of a company we acquired last year that we used heavily inside Atlassian. We are a 12,000-person company distributed across 13 countries. [At] the beginning of the pandemic, we made the decision to go fully distributed. We said to employees, we will not ask you to come into an office for any number of days a week, but we will set some guidelines around how many working hours overlap you have with your team. When we compose a team of people on the West Coast and East Coast, that's okay. But if you take people on the East Coast, West Coast, Australia and Singapore, it becomes a problem because there are not enough working hours overlap. A lot of the tools that we use are really our own tools for collaboration and for teamwork. And one of the tools we heavily relied on was Loom, which really helped, creating video snippets that would help disseminate information so that people can then consume it at their own pace. We decided to buy the tool ourselves and integrate it with our product suite because it really helped with asynchronous communication and distributed teamwork.

Scott Farquhar, one of the founders of Atlassian, recently stepped down from the co-CEO spot. While this may not signify a huge transition for the company, since cofounder Mike Cannon-Brookes is assuming the sole CEO role, what does it mean symbolically for Atlassian?

I have been at Atlassian for 10 years, and the big reason for me staying this long has been Scott. Scott's a personal friend and has been a great supporter and champion. Personally, I feel bittersweet about it. I feel very happy for him that he is now going on to the next phase of life. He has the energy and the bandwidth to focus on some of the things that he has started, like Pledge1%. He has a number of well-defined philosophical philanthropy projects that he's rallied the company around.

Operationally day-to-day, it's not that much of a change for us because he's been very thoughtful about this transition. He has set up the requisite systems and leaders. I personally have been doing a lot more on the go-to-market, which Scott used to run.

Mike, our CEO, [and Farquhar] have been co-founders and co-CEOs for 20-plus years, which is very unusual in software. Mike staying on as the founder CEO means that even symbolically for Atlassian, it's really not that much of a step change, because we continue to be founder-led. We continue to have the 20-year context continue.

One of the staggering things about Atlassian is we have a lot of tenured people in the company. We have a Slack channel called Old Timers, which seems to keep growing each day. It's mostly people who have 10-plus years, and I recently joined. Because we have a lot of tenured people, the culture, the ethos of the company, beliefs, values, they all tend to be strong. We are lucky that we have that cohort of people where this continues to be a defining way of how we run the company.

In Atlassian's most recent earnings report, some investors reacted negatively to slower growth prospects than they were hoping. Where do you see Atlassian's growth going? What is your vision for the next six months?

It's interesting because I've been here since we were $100 million in revenue. We are about $4.5 billion dollars in revenue, and we've been a growth company throughout. We are committed to a 20% CAGR over multiple years. [A] 20% CAGR on a $4.5 billion base is substantial, and it's quite rare for a company of our scale. I continue to be excited and grateful that we have a business where the opportunities are so big that we can confidently talk about 20% CAGR over multiple years.

Why do we think that that is the case? Because we operate in three fundamental markets where I think the opportunity is going to grow, because more and more people are poised to be creators. Thanks to gen AI and redefining of the software development lifecycle, more people can do what only technical people used to be able to do before. That's a good thing for Atlassian because we serve the full cycle, not just the coding part of a developer's life. That means more software gets created and more opportunity to grow in that business.

Our second business is the IT service market, which is fundamentally service request handling. This is a market that stands to greatly benefit from the AI wave. Even outside of the AI wave, this is a market that continues to grow at a very healthy clip. We just put out the numbers for each of our business lines for the first time back in April. Service management has been our fastest growing business, close to $500 million. We are priced super competitively, and we are just getting started. That's really at the early phases of the market capture, and that's several billion dollars that is open opportunity for us to go after.

The last market is for knowledge workers. We can democratize that with an open philosophy of saying companies can use any number of tools for knowledge management applications they require, but we want to be the backbone that connects all of those things in one single place through a connected data platform, and offers customers the choice to use multiple tools, but have a single knowledge backbone across their organization such that they can make the maximum use of their own data and deliver the most insights based on what their own employees are doing. That is definitely the largest market we are addressing, and has the most promise, and we are also the earliest in that market.

Booming artificial intelligence company OpenAI announced a massive funding round last week.

$6.6 billion: Size of the newest round, which was led by Thrive Capital and saw participation from SoftBank, Nvidia and Tiger Global, according to the Wall Street Journal

Business leaders need to be decisive, but that's easier said than done. Here are some ways that top entrepreneurs can make big -- and tough -- decisions in five minutes.

It's officially Q4, and many executives are looking to the future: finishing 2024 strong and starting 2025 off right. Here are four priorities to focus on to bring this year to a successful close.

Presidential candidates are busy racking up endorsements and promoting them to try to sway undecided voters. Former President Donald Trump touted a big endorsement last week on social media, but that person quickly contradicted it, saying they had not endorsed any candidate. Who is it?"
What To Expect From September's CPI Inflation Report,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/07/what-to-expect-from-septembers-cpi-inflation-report/,2024-10-07T16:20:48Z,"Consumer Price Index inflation data to be released on October 10 is expected to provide some support for the Federal Open Market Committee cutting rates in November. However, unemployment data may ultimately matter more for the FOMC's decision making.

All inflation metrics are down over the past 12 months according to the Atlanta Fed's Dashboard that measures a range of inflation metrics. Specifically, headline annual CPI inflation is 2.5% to August 2024 and core CPI, which removes swings in food and energy prices is 3.2%.

Although these figures do not hit the FOMC's 2% inflation goal, inflation is running at a much lower rate than for much of the 2021-2023 period. As a result the FOMC made the first interest rate cut of this cycle in September, recognizing that monetary policy no longer needed to be as restrictive with significant progress on inflation.

Inflation nowcasts from the Cleveland Fed call for reassuring inflation data. They expect 0.1% monthly inflation for headline CPI for September and 0.3% monthly core inflation. Should these forecasts hold, they would provide further reassurance for the FOMC that inflation is now under control. However, some minor concerns remain.

Firstly, shelter costs, which make up a large portion of CPI inflation continue to rise at a relatively fast 5.2% annual rate as of August 2024. Reaching the FOMC's 2% target may require shelter costs to cool from these levels. Secondly, the FOMC continues to monitor for unexpected shocks that could cause inflation to resume. For example, the dockworkers' strike ending with a substantial pay increase recently is the sort of thing the FOMC will be monitoring, to make sure wage-lead inflation doesn't resume.

Inflation was among the more closely watch economic indicators in recent years, given the surge in prices. Now, the FOMC is paying closer attention to the other component of its dual mandate - maintaining full employment. Typically, when the FOMC raises rates abruptly, increases in unemployment result. We've seen that to some degree this cycle with unemployment now at 4.1% for September compared to 3.8% in September 2023. However, so far the increase in unemployment has been sufficiently gradual, so far, to ease fears of a potential recession. Still, jobs data is likely to get more attention than inflation data should inflation continue to ease back towards 2%.

The FOMC next sets interest rates on November 7. Therefore, the October 10 figures will be the last CPI release before that meeting. However, there will be a Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index release on October 31, which may offer further insight on U.S. inflation trends.

It is expected that the FOMC elects to cut interest rates by 0.25% according to the CME FedWatch Tool, with some chance that rates are held steady. Previously, markets anticipated a material chance of a larger 0.5% cut. However, that probability has faded with unexpectedly robust jobs data for September, with the economy adding a higher than expected 254,000 jobs. Should inflation continue to cool, so it is likely that the FOMC continues to cut rates. However, the pace of loosening monetary policy may be more informed by jobs data than inflation figures."

Today marks one year since Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, leading Israel to retaliate and catalyzing the war in Gaza. Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians.

Despite calls for a ceasefire from the U.S. and allies, the Middle East is on the precipice of a broader war as tensions escalate between Israel and Iran. About 31% of Americans believe Israel's military operations in Gaza are going too far, a slight increase from last December, according to a new Pew Research Center poll.

Meanwhile, the share of Americans who believe Israel is doing enough or should be doing more has fallen in the last 10 months.

The U.S. added far more jobs than expected in September, and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%. The Labor Department data delivered good news for investors on edge after July and August saw far weaker labor market expansion than expected.

MORE: Leading stock indexes saw gains Friday on the heels of the jobs report: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 0.8%, the S&P 500 climbed as much as 0.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq bounced as much as 1.2%. But labor market resilience dampened hopes for a second aggressive interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month.

Tencent Holdings is considering acquiring Ubisoft Entertainment with the Guillemot family, which founded the French video game publisher, sending Ubisoft's stock soaring Friday after it falling to a decade-low in late September. Rumors about a takeover of Ubisoft, behind video games like Assassin's Creed and Just Dance, have swirled for years, and private equity firms like Blackstone and KKR & Co. have previously considered buying out the company.

Compare price/earnings to a growth rate and you get PEG, the classic formula for measuring the price tag of a growth stock. But PEG has deep flaws. The superior Super PEG measures how much you pay now to get a certain level of earning power down the road, and then compares that to what you pay to get future earning power from the S&P 500 index.

The ultra-swank Yellowstone Club, located on a remote patch of Montana wilderness, is one of the world's most exclusive clubs: Those who want to be admitted must buy land, a home or a condo, which will set you back $10 million, even for the least expensive undeveloped plot. The club has fewer than 900 homeowners, worth more than a combined $290 billion, including Melinda French Gates and hedge fund tycoon Bill Ackman.

The Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people has been published every year since 1982, and out of the total 1,739 featured, just 11 have made the list every year. They include Warren Buffett, worth $145.5 billion; Charles Koch, worth $67.5 billion; and Nike's Phil Knight, with a net worth of $36.5 billion.

Alphabet's self-driving car venture Waymo, the only commercial robotaxi service in the U.S., signed a ""multiyear"" agreement with Hyundai Motor to add electric Ioniq 5 hatchbacks to its Waymo One fleet starting next year. Currently, its U.S. fleet includes at least 1,000 electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs, and reducing costs is critical for Waymo to reach profitability, as it is quickly expanding its service area.

At a recruitment event for his fledgling AI company xAI, billionaire Elon Musk pitched the firm as the anti-OpenAI, calling the ChatGPT maker ""closed"" and profit-obsessed. Musk cofounded OpenAI with Sam Altman, but he has since left and sued the company twice, accusing OpenAI of abandoning its mission to build artificial intelligence to benefit humanity.

Out of office and back on the campaign trail, former President Donald Trump earned an estimated $218 million in operating income last year, roughly double what he made during his final year in the White House. Trump's golf portfolio now generates huge profits, with his golf-connected properties generating $74 million more in operating income last year than they did in 2020.

Perpetua Resources is set to resurrect a shuttered Idaho mine that will once again supply the Pentagon with vital weapons-grade antimony, bust a Chinese monopoly, and underwrite the rehabilitation of 20 miles of backcountry salmon streams. The surge in the price of gold since the pandemic is also propelling Perpetua, which expects to produce an average 300,000 ounces of gold per year at an average all-in cost of $650/oz and eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual profits.

Shares of Spirit Airlines fell 26% Friday after reports indicated the low-cost airline was exploring bankruptcy. In January, a federal judge blocked a $3.8 billion merger between Spirit and JetBlue, ruling it would eliminate the airline industry's popular discounted flight options and drive up prices.

If you need to renew your passport, now is the time: The average wait time is the shortest it's been in decades. The State Department said Thursday that the average processing time for passports has dropped to four to six weeks, which is a third as long as it took in 2021 during the pandemic backlog.

TOPLINE Over the last several months, joint state and federal task forces have raided more than 100 vape and smoke shops, hemp product manufacturers and distributors in North Carolina, alleging that they are selling marijuana disguised as hemp.

The 2018 Farm Bill allows the production of hemp and all its derivatives so long as it contains 0.3% of THC or less. In 2022, hemp-derived cannabinoid product sales hit $28 billion overall, while legal marijuana products generated $26 billion in sales during that same period, according to cannabis data firm Whitney Economics.

But hemp farmers, Whitney Economics estimates, have lost about $3.1 billion in annual sales due to the state bans and legal confusion that has followed.

Despite what the Farm Bill states, there is plenty of debate about whether hemp-derived THC products are legal under federal law. That's because hemp-derived cannabinoids -- including delta-9 THC and delta-8 THC (a less potent compound that is affectionately called ""weed lite"" or ""decaf kush"") -- are legal under the Farm Bill if those compounds are found naturally in the plant.

Yet most intoxicating hemp products on the market are made by converting hemp-derived CBD isolate into delta-9 THC or delta-8 THC using a chemical process.

North Carolina's crusade against hemp is not the only front in this war on drugs. Late last month, California Governor Gavin Newsom banned hemp-derived THC through an emergency order. Newsom said that the move was to prevent the sale of intoxicating hemp products to children.

But California also views hemp products as a threat to its struggling $5 billion legal marijuana market.

WHY IT MATTERS ""What's going on in the hemp industry right now shows how complicated and nuanced the legalization of cannabis can be,"" says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. ""Even though marijuana and hemp are variations of the same plant -- Cannabis sativa L -- marijuana is still illegal at the federal level while hemp is legal.""

It's important not only to save for retirement but also to plan for the non-financial aspects. For instance, if you enjoy what you are doing or the social aspect of your job, consider working part-time to transition to full retirement. Take the time to build social connections outside of work, join community groups and develop hobbies. And don't wait until you retire to start traveling: Go when you can, because no one's health is guaranteed.

SAP BrandVoice: How To Create A Strategy To Reduce Youth Unemployment,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/sap/2024/10/07/how-to-create-a-strategy-to-reduce-youth-unemployment/,2024-10-07T11:28:18Z,"The global education goal, part of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), remains significantly off track. Various reports, including from UNESCO and UN news, highlight the concerning trend that unless drastic changes occur the world will not meet its commitments to ensure inclusive and equitable quality education by 2030.

The world today is grappling with a polycrisis - a complex set of interconnected global challenges that impact economies, industries, and job markets simultaneously. From climate change and geopolitical tensions to technological disruptions and economic instability, these crises are reshaping the landscape of work, especially for young people. While youth unemployment remains high, employers worldwide are also struggling to fill critical roles, highlighting a significant skills gap.

According to the International Labour Organization (ILO), global youth unemployment was 13% in 2023, with many young people facing limited prospects for stable and decent work. On the flip side, the World Economic Forum (WEF) found that 44% of businesses report difficulties in finding talent with the right skills to fill jobs. This contrast reflects a deepening mismatch between the supply of young job seekers and the demand for skilled talent, which, if left unaddressed, will exacerbate both unemployment and the talent shortage.

To tackle this challenge, we must take a comprehensive, systems-based approach, focusing on five interconnected elements: economy, education, employability, equality, and the ecosystem. Together, these factors can help close the skills gap, reduce youth unemployment, and create pathways to decent work for all.

Economic growth remains a critical driver of job creation, but the quality and inclusivity of that growth matter. In many parts of the world, jobless growth has become a pressing concern, as economies expand without generating enough formal employment opportunities for young people. Youth unemployment continues to rise even in nations with positive GDP growth, indicating that inclusive economic policies and investment in key sectors are lacking (ILO, 2024).

Moreover, the alignment between economic growth and investment in education is critical. The Global Education Monitoring Report 2023 highlights that national budgets for education often fall short of the recommended 4%-6% of GDP that UNESCO advocates. Without adequate financial support, education systems cannot provide the skills and competencies needed to prepare young people for modern job markets, leaving many young workers without the necessary tools to succeed.

Education systems need to evolve to meet the changing demands of the workforce. The OECD - OCDE emphasizes the importance of embedding skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values into education systems to ensure that young people are prepared for lifelong learning. In particular, stackable credentials - modular qualifications that allow learners to build expertise over time - are becoming an essential component of successful education-to-employment transitions.

For more information on how SAP is helping the world run better and improving people's lives all year round, visit sap.com/csr

Despite the need for adaptable learning pathways, many education systems remain rigid and slow to adopt these models. However, countries that have embraced flexible learning, such as Germany with its robust vocational education and training (VET) programs, have been able to reduce youth unemployment significantly. The integration of industry-specialized learning and competency-based education is critical for preparing young people to thrive in an evolving workforce, particularly in sectors like technology and sustainability.

One of the most significant barriers to reducing youth unemployment is the skills mismatch - the gap between what young people learn and what employers need. The World Economic Forum's Future of Jobs Report 2023 projects that 50% of employees will need reskilling by 2025 due to rapid technological advancements. Yet, traditional education systems are often not aligned with industry needs, leaving many young workers without the skills required for high-growth sectors.

Governments and businesses must collaborate to ensure that training programs are directly linked to market demand. Public-private partnerships, such as apprenticeship programs and industry-led training initiatives, can play a pivotal role in closing the skills gap. For example, in Switzerland, where education and training are tightly integrated with the labor market, youth unemployment is among the lowest in the world. Building a system that continually adapts to changing workforce needs is essential for improving youth employability.

Recent trends show that many young people increasingly prefer entrepreneurship over traditional employment, driven by the desire for independence and the ability to create change. A 2019 study by Deloitte found that 76% of millennials view entrepreneurship as a key vehicle for driving social impact. However, research highlights the need for robust support systems to help these young entrepreneurs succeed.

The 2021 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor emphasizes that access to entrepreneurial education, mentorship, and skill development is critical for youth to thrive in their ventures.

Any strategy to reduce youth unemployment must prioritize equality, ensuring that opportunities are equally accessible to all young people, regardless of their background, gender, or location. Despite advances in education, women and marginalized communities continue to face barriers to entry in high-growth industries, particularly in STEM fields. According to UNESCO, only 35% of STEM graduates are women, highlighting the gender gap in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.

Programs that specifically target underrepresented groups - such as mentorships and women-in-tech initiatives - can help diversify the talent pipeline. Furthermore, companies that emphasize inclusive hiring practices, gender parity, and equity in leadership are not only contributing to social justice but also benefiting from a more innovative and dynamic workforce. The data is clear: promoting diversity is a strategic advantage in the modern economy.

A thriving job market requires more than just a functioning economy and well-prepared workers - it needs a cohesive ecosystem where governments, businesses, educational institutions, and civil society work together efficiently. The OECD underscores the importance of synergy across the value chain, ensuring that all stakeholders are aligned toward the goal of reducing unemployment and fostering decent work.

Successful models of ecosystem collaboration, like those seen in Singapore, offer valuable lessons for other nations. In these countries, the government plays a central role in orchestrating cooperation between educational institutions and industries to ensure that young people are being trained in fields that are projected to grow. Such synergies foster an environment where young people can transition smoothly from education to employment and where employers can easily find the talent they need.

As respective leaders, SAP and UNICEF join forces to create innovative solutions to global skilling and workforce challenges with an aim to help young people transition to earning. Together, we're generating inclusive opportunities for underserved young people worldwide, preparing them for decent work with the skills that employers need.

We expanded our partnership in 2022, with a three-year investment focused on impacting youth in Kenya, Nigeria, and South Africa through a new program that supports learning to earning pathways in growing digital and green economies. The program helps equip youth with the essential skills they need to flourish - wherever they may see their future. Further, it builds on UNICEF's Generation Unlimited (GenU) signature program, Youth Agency Marketplace (YOMA), a platform developed by young Africans to tackle labor market challenges and increase youth agency across the globe.

By the end of the first year, SAP and UNICEF's GenU reached more than 600,000 youth, granting them access to foundational and digital skills opportunities that help young people unlock opportunities in the changing global economy.

One of the learn to earn pathways on YOMA is the SAP Educate to Employ initiative designed by SAP to help equip beneficiaries with essential competencies for the digital economy. The free initiative, implemented by the local non-profit UMUZI, focuses on developing skills, knowledge, attitudes, and values to help prepare candidates for employment.

It also aims to assist employers in accessing diverse and certified talent, thereby accelerating digital transformation in each country through a skilled talent pipeline. More than 1,000 learners completed one or more foundational skills courses, while 165 learners completed over 400 hours of critical skills development training and achieved an SAP certification for technology consultant beginners. Additionally, 100 learners have completed their intermediate training on the SAP Learning site and are preparing for SAP-certified associate exams.

This multistakeholder approach underscores the power of partnership in addressing complex social challenges. By pooling expertise and resources, SAP, UNICEF's GenU, and UMUZI are collectively ensuring that youth not only gain relevant skills but also access meaningful pathways to employment. These partnerships exemplify the collaborative frameworks needed to drive sustainable impact on a global scale. As digital and green economies continue to reshape the future of work, partnerships that unite private, public, and civil society actors will remain crucial in ensuring that marginalized youth are not left behind.

The polycrisis we face today demands multidimensional solutions that address both the supply and demand sides of the labor market. By focusing on the interconnected elements of economy, education, employability, equality, and ecosystem, we can create a comprehensive strategy to reduce youth unemployment and foster decent work for all.

Policymakers, business leaders, and educators must come together to close the skills gap, promote inclusive growth, and build resilient labor markets. The challenges are great, but so are the opportunities. With coordinated effort and sustained investment, we can build a future where young people have the skills, opportunities, and support they need to thrive in the global economy."
Beyond Sustainability: Guayakí's Regenerative Approach To Business,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/christophermarquis/2024/10/07/beyond-sustainability-guayaks-regenerative-approach-to-business/,2024-10-07T11:18:00Z,"In an era where sustainability has become a buzzword, beverage company Guayakí Yerba Mate stands out with its innovative ""Market-Driven Regeneration™"" model, demonstrating that with the right approach, market forces can indeed be harnessed to drive meaningful change for the environment and societies. Unlike traditional approaches to sustainability, which focus on avoiding harm and maintaining socio-ecological systems, regeneration actively works to improve health and biodiversity, often starting by aligning agricultural and business practices with nature's inherent cycles.

Founded in 1996, this yerba mate company has been at the forefront of regenerative business practices for nearly three decades. Yerba mate, a traditional South American plant known for its stimulating properties, is harvested from the leaves of the holly family. Guayakí produces a variety of yerba mate-based drinks, including canned energy beverages, loose leaf yerba mate, and sparkling blends, all of which offer customers a new alternative to traditional caffeinated drinks.

I recently spoke with Ben Mand, CEO of Guayakí, about the company's work and how companies can integrate regenerative practices into their core business strategy, the challenges of scaling such a model, and the evolving consumer landscape for sustainable products.

At the heart of Guayakí's model is a commitment to shade-grown, regenerative organic farming practices that preserve biodiversity in the Atlantic Forest region of South America. These farming techniques foster biodiversity by using native plant cover and engaging in organic farming methods that nourish the soil rather than deplete it.

But as we discuss, their approach extends far beyond agriculture, encompassing fair trade practices, community development, and a holistic view of their entire supply chain. Their ""Fair for Life"" certification ensures that every worker along the supply chain -- from the indigenous communities harvesting the mate to the factory workers -- receives a living wage, with additional premiums paid above market prices to promote fair compensation. Guayakí has long-term, trusted relationships with these communities, ensuring that they are empowered and that their traditional knowledge is respected and integrated into the company's operations. Their Market-Driven Regeneration model, as Mand puts it, ""makes a connection between demand for our products and the positive outcomes we can create.""

Read more below for details from Ben on how Guayakí's regenerative model is not just about producing a sustainable product, but about fostering a system where business success directly translates to environmental restoration and community empowerment.

Marquis: Would you mind saying a little bit both about the company, its core products, its mission, and then also about yourself?

Mand: Guayakí is a very purpose-driven business. In today's world, which is so digital and often divided, Guayakí stands out because it's rooted in connection and community. Yerba mate, especially when shared in a gourd, has been enjoyed for generations in South America. There's a ceremony and ritual in packing a gourd and passing it around, which fosters a sense of connection.

From a business perspective, Guayakí is about regeneration -- about rebuilding and making sure we leave every connection stronger. What has become popular in the U.S. is the ready-to-drink yerba mate products -- whether it's a can or a glass bottle. We brew yerba mate and then add mint, fruit juice, or other flavors. Consumers love the benefits, especially the natural caffeine boost, which is great in the morning or early afternoon.

Yerba mate comes from the holly family, not the tea plant, but it's often mistaken for tea because it contains caffeine and is brewed in a similar way. We harvest, dry, and mill the yerba mate, then brew beverages with it or sell it as loose leaf. It has the polyphenols and minerals you'd find in tea, the caffeine of coffee, and the theobromine you'd typically find in chocolate, which gives you a bit of euphoria.

As for me, I'm originally from Wisconsin, and I'm a first-generation college student. I didn't grow up with much, which taught me to be resourceful. I'm an optimist with a can-do attitude, and I think that has served me well. Over the course of my life, I've had to do a little bit of everything, and I enjoy that. Business wise, I grew up in Consumer Packaged Goods (CPGs) at General Mills, where I learned the fundamentals of running a business. I worked on mature businesses, but my approach was always to find ways to make products better while still delivering sales and profit growth.

After General Mills, I moved into smaller, purpose-driven businesses. Instead of figuring out how to improve products that reached 30-50% of consumers, my focus became scaling products that reach just 2% of households and trying to get that number to 10%, 20%, or 30%, all while strengthening the impact these businesses have.

At Plum Organics, a company focused on early childhood nutrition the mission was clear: to improve the quality of ingredients in baby and toddler food. We worked with experts to craft a supply chain that delivered better, less processed inputs into those products.

Harmless Harvest was similar in that it was a beverage company, very purpose-driven, and Fair for Life certified, just like Guayakí. Three months after joining Harmless Harvest, I transitioned the company from plain organic to regenerative organic. It was a big endeavor, considering the company wasn't very profitable at the time, but I knew it was the right decision. We found ways to improve efficiency and the P&L while still moving toward regenerative organic practices.

There are a lot of parallels between that experience and what I'm doing now at Guayakí. I've been drinking yerba mate for years, and I've always had my eye on the brand. So, when Guayakí came calling, looking for a new CEO, I was thrilled. It's a brand that resonates with me, and I believe it has a ton of potential. The question now is, how do we do even more?

Marquis: I'd love to talk now about the Market-Driven Regeneration model. What do you mean by regeneration? And how does Guayakí think about it, particularly in relation to yerba mate?

Mand: Market-Driven Regeneration really starts at the source. It's the ethos of our business and begins where we grow yerba mate, which comes from Brazil, Paraguay, and Argentina. That's where we have our long-standing relationships with local communities. We work with them not just on growing, but also on harvesting and purchasing the yerba mate.

Our focus is on shade-grown, regenerative organic farming. From a farming standpoint, it's all about biodiversity. We're not talking about fields like what you might see in California with almond trees or olives. Yerba mate typically grows in a forest environment, so there's shade cover provided by native plants. That's a key part of what we do -- growing yerba mate in its natural environment under native plants to maintain biodiversity. We're certified regenerative and fair trade, which ensures that everyone involved is paid a livable wage. We also pay a premium above market prices.

The idea is that it's an entire ecosystem -- whether you're thinking about indigenous communities, the environment, the factory we run, or the partners we work with. It's about creating mutual success. Our goal isn't to succeed at the expense of our partners; it's to make sure everyone involved is better off through the work we do together.

Marquis: Can you say a little bit about how you think about your regeneration model beyond just the agricultural aspect, for example how you sell in the United States, engage with the communities that your farmers are in?

Mand: One of the things I find really special about Guayakí, and working with yerba mate, is the long-standing relationships we've built with the communities we partner with, including many Indigenous communities. For example, we've been working with the Aché Kue Tuvy people since 2002. We have other relationships that range from 10 to 20 years, and there are some communities I've visited that we just started working with six months ago. What's amazing about these partnerships is that they're not just based on long-term contracts or transactions. They're about real relationships.

For instance, with the Aché Kue Tuvy community, we've not only been harvesting yerba mate with them, but also helping them plant seedlings, expand their tree cover, and increase their acreage over the years. That's just one piece of the puzzle, though. We're also working with them on processing. We've built a small factory where they can dry and package the yerba mate before sending it to our larger factory for further processing. This brings value-added activities into their community, creating more jobs and opportunities for local people.

The really exciting part is that the World Bank is now involved in funding a project to expand this factory. When it's completed, they'll be able to do even more of the processing themselves. This long-term partnership, with us investing over time and partnering closely with them, is instrumental in helping the community develop trade skills and build value-added capabilities. Now, they'll have a factory manager, teams of workers, engineers, payroll staff -- all the activities needed to run something they fully own and control.

Marquis: How does yerba mate move downstream in your supply chain? Could you describe the production process that results in the products consumers can buy, especially from a regenerative standpoint.

Mand: In Brazil, we have our own factory. From a Fair for Life standpoint, we can only have a small percentage of our workforce as temporary employees. This was the same approach at Harmless Harvest, where I worked before. The idea is that you want to employ people year-round, not just seasonally. So, employment practices as a Fair for Life organization dictate how we run the factory.

Right now, we have times of the year where our workforce is underutilized, which creates inefficiency. When I stepped into the role, I took a fresh look at our supply chain to figure out how we could improve efficiency, both financially and environmentally. One big question was how to reduce miles and maximize the density of products in containers to cut down on costs and environmental impact.

At the moment, we process our loose leaf yerba mate and the bags in the U.S. We ship dense bales of aged yerba mate from Brazil to the U.S., where we pack it and send it out. But now, we're looking at centralizing that process in one location, rather than shipping the product all over the U.S. This would streamline everything and make our operations more efficient.

The liquid is a bit different. We don't produce the liquid in Brazil -- we make a yerba mate brew here in the U.S. Right now, we're also exploring how to make that more efficient. For example, we do a light concentrate of the brew, but we could take out even more water so we're shipping mostly the solids. It's similar to how juice concentrates are shipped and rehydrated later.

Efficiency is a big focus for us, not just in terms of labor and how we partner with communities, but also in streamlining the entire supply chain. It's about reducing miles, increasing container efficiency, and thinking about how we can make smarter logistical choices. That's really where we're putting a lot of effort right now.

Marquis: Why define Market-Driven Regeneration as your own model? Why not just say you're Fair for Life and Regenerative Organic certified?

Mand: The term ""Market-Driven"" highlights that we're a for-profit business, not a nonprofit. We believe we can build a successful brand in financial terms while also living into our purpose and mission. The terminology helps people understand that consumers play a key role in this. They have the power to make choices that are better for them, better for people, and better for the planet.

For us, it's about making amazing products that meet people's needs while doing the right thing. When you create demand for a product that does good, you can have a positive impact. It's something I've noticed in board conversations, especially with our Regeneration Committee. The founders are always talking about how we can buy more yerba mate. It's not just about growing the business -- it's about paying a premium, reinvesting in the community, and driving more positive impact. That's what Market-Driven Regeneration means: making a connection between demand for our products and the positive outcomes we can create.

Marquis: What have you done to help other companies understand or adopt this model?

Mand: I can't speak to every conversation the team has had, but having this defined model has given us a way to talk about it consistently. It's a powerful concept, and we wanted to position ourselves as leaders in the regenerative movement.

At Harmless Harvest, we didn't use the term ""Market-Driven Regeneration,"" but we had a similar approach. We focused on making great products that consumers wanted to buy, which naturally pulled them toward products sourced in a fair, humane way. We worked with farmers using regenerative organic practices that were better for the environment, helped sequester carbon, and supported communities. The concept is the same; we just didn't have the exact language at the time. But it's important for people to start understanding this idea more clearly now.

Marquis: Are there other companies you're looking to in this space from which you can learn about regenerative practices?

Mand: I was recently at an offsite retreat with One Step Closer, which brings together thought leaders from both technology and small, burgeoning companies -- some larger, some smaller. Dr. Bronner's and Numi were part of it, and there were lots of great brands in the cohort. It's a great opportunity to learn from one another, whether you're doing $500,000 in sales or $500 million. Everyone is working toward similar goals, but we're all doing things a bit differently.

When it comes to regenerative farming, for example, the approach varies depending on where you are. Farming in South America is very different from farming in Thailand or California, where almonds or cashews are grown. Each region presents its own set of challenges and best practices, and sharing those is invaluable. Sometimes, it's about understanding how to apply these practices elsewhere or sharing data on things like soil health and yields. At Harmless Harvest and now at Guayakí, we collect data on things like shade-grown versus sun-grown yields, so we can compare and understand the differences, whether it's coconuts, yerba mate, or cashews.

Marquis: Could you explain why having the Regenerative Organic certification is important for you? What have you learned from the certification process, considering you were already implementing regenerative practices?

Mand: A big part of my role at Guayakí is to future-proof the organization. I want to ensure that even if the leadership team changes, the company still lives up to its original mission and purpose. One way to do that is through certifications. They keep us honest and ensure we're adhering to our principles.

Certifications also offer learning opportunities. We go through annual audits, which allow us to see where we're excelling and where we need to improve. You want to perform well and lead the industry, but you also don't want any blind spots. If audits uncover any gaps, we figure out what we've learned and what changes we need to make.

It all ties back to Market Driven Regeneration. Consumers are realizing they can't wait for governments or other organizations to solve these problems -- they can make responsible choices themselves.

Certifications like Fair for Life and Regenerative Organic help give them that quick reassurance.

Marquis: Could you share some examples, either from your time at Guayakí or at Harmless Harvest, where the certification process revealed something you needed to change?

Mand: We've definitely had a range of learnings across organizations. It's important to remember that certifications don't just involve one person -- they span the entire organization. At Guayakí, for instance, it touches everything from our facilities in South America to our finance, accounting, and commercial teams. Everyone is part of the process, and it becomes a learning experience for the entire company.

One example is when we started thinking about the partners we use for in-store displays. Do they have the right codes of conduct? Are they using the right materials? What's the end-of-life impact of those materials? It wasn't just about our factory but about every aspect of our supply chain. Once you start going through these audits, it helps everyone see where they can make different choices. Even something as small as a cleaning service becomes an area where you can apply more sustainable practices. That's one way these certifications push us to think more holistically.

Marquis: Could you talk a little about Guayakí's consumer profile and how you're planning to expand it? It seems like a passionate but possibly niche group -- how do you plan to grow?

Mand: Our core consumer tends to be younger, ranging from college to young adulthood. Yerba mate often becomes their preferred energy boost as they start to move away from coffee or other forms of caffeine. The discovery of yerba mate typically happens in college, when they're cramming for exams and need something to help them power through.

But it doesn't stop there. Our consumers are young, full of life, and love outdoor activities, music, and being with friends. They also care deeply about the environment and social responsibility. They want to align with brands that reflect those values. So, our sweet spot is really that Gen Z and millennial crowd who value responsible products.

Marquis: How are you working to communicate sustainability and regeneration to consumers and have that be an important part of the story of yerba mate as consumers are adopting it?

Mand: We started on the West Coast, but we've been expanding nationwide over the past few years. There's a natural desire to make a positive impact, and our challenge is to help people recognize that they can make a difference with their purchasing decisions.

That said, it's a tricky balance. Consumers aren't always looking for a purpose-driven message in their social media or marketing -- they want to be entertained or educated in other ways. So, it's important to stay true to the fundamentals of building a brand. You need to understand who your consumer is, what they need, and how your product meets that need.

There are moments where it makes sense to bring the purpose-driven message to the forefront, like during Earth Week or the holidays when people are focused on giving back. I believe that doing good should be baked into everything we do, and then we can sprinkle in those moments where we celebrate it. You don't want it to come across as self-promotional, even if it's authentic. It needs to be shared in a way that feels natural and not forced.

Marquis: How do you approach different distribution channels, like Natural Foods Markets or big chains like Target?

Mand: The distribution piece is really important. Big companies like Coke and Pepsi dominate the shelf space because they have the resources to secure that real estate. This means consumers often don't have the opportunity to choose different products because retailers aren't allocating space for them or helping with education.

Retailers do have opportunities, like end caps and merchandising events, to feature smaller brands, but these brands usually don't have the big budgets that multinationals do. Still, if we want to change consumer behavior and encourage the purchase of environmentally and socially responsible products, retailers need to step up. To even be on their shelves, you must meet certain criteria, so consumers trust that products in these stores are aligned with their values. Plus, natural retailers often have programs that highlight and educate consumers on responsible products.

Interestingly, Target does a great job with in-store experiences. People often talk about ""Tar-Jay"" because it offers more than just shopping -- it creates a theater-like environment. They used to have a program called Made to Matter, which was Target's way of showcasing brands with a purpose. Unfortunately, when times get tough and budgets get cut, programs like this are often the first to go.

On the other hand, traditional grocery stores face different challenges. Their businesses rely heavily on labor, and with low unemployment, it's hard for them to even stock shelves, let alone focus on the next level of consumer education. These environments are also harder for responsible brands because they have to hit certain sales velocities quickly to stay on the shelves. They need time to build momentum, but the system doesn't always allow for that.

Marquis: Finally, understanding how all of this is connected in the company, can you explain how the governance and ownership of the company are structured to align with this mission? And as someone coming in after 28 years of founder-led leadership, how have you adjusted to your role?

Mand: From a governance perspective, we have all the structures you'd expect from a social purpose corporation, such as bylaws and annual reporting requirements. But what I think is important, and maybe what you're getting at, is how our governance supports our mission beyond just the financials.

One thing I really love is that we have a separate Regeneration Committee, much like a Compensation Committee, that meets regularly. One change I made is to ensure the entire leadership team attends these meetings. We can only be successful if everyone understands our goals and is accountable for driving results. This has been a shift for the organization, but it's important to get the cadence right.

In the Regeneration Committee, we don't talk about business results -- we spend three hours focusing solely on strategy, initiatives, and setting priorities for the next 12 months. Afterward, we report back to the board, but the Regeneration Committee allows us to go deep into our regenerative efforts.

In my first six months, I've spent a lot of time with the founders to understand the company's history, their goals, and their vision. My role is to future-proof the business, to make sure it's on a trajectory where it can live out the principles the founders established. I see myself as the bridge between their vision and the realities of running a successful, profitable business. Financial success is what allows us to keep fueling our purpose."
September CPI Will Impact Fed Policy And Market Expectations,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/10/06/september-cpi-will-impact-fed-policy-and-market-expectations/,2024-10-06T21:38:58Z,"The September U.S. Consumer Price Index tops this week's economic reports. With year-on-year total and core CPI inflation rates still above the Federal Reserve's 2% target, traders and investors will be watching for signs that give the Fed license to cut rates on November 7. The potential that inflation rates are too high presents downside risks to equity markets and commodity prices because elevated inflation rates could keep the Fed from cutting interest rates next month.

This week's September CPI report will be critical for Fed interest rate policy expectations because labor market and inflation data are the Fed's main policy concerns. With the potential to shape Fed policies, which are front and center for financial markets, the CPI report has the potential to impact financial markets from equities and bonds to industrial commodities and the dollar.

Year-on-year total CPI inflation slowed in August to the lowest year-on-year pace since February 2021. Total CPI decelerated to 2.5% from 2.9%, although year-on-year core CPI was unchanged at a relatively high 3.2%. Both total and core year-on-year CPI rates are still elevated and above the Fed's 2% target.

Inflation has been easing slowly, but base effects threaten to keep year-on-year total CPI and core CPI above the Fed's 2% target until the first half of 2025. Nevertheless, year-on-year CPI inflation rates appear likely to have made more progress toward 2% in September, and Prestige Economics is forecasting year-on-year CPI to be 2.4%, with core CPI at 3.1%.

As the Fed carefully weighs the importance of labor market and inflation data, this week's CPI report will be more critical for Fed policy expectations in the wake of last week's Employment Situation Report -- informally called the jobs report by economists and analysts. September payrolls and unemployment data were much stronger than expected with strong payroll gains of 254,000, upward revisions to payrolls of 72,000, and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%.

Following the release of the strong September jobs report, the potential for a 0.5% Fed rate cut on November 7 fell to zero in the CME FedWatch Tool on October 6, while the potential for a 0.25% interest rate cut rose to 97.4% and the chance that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged rose to 2.6%.

Just one week prior, on September 27, the CME FedWatch Tool reflected the chance of a 0.5% Fed interest rate cut on November 7 at 53.3%. Meanwhile, the chance of a 0.25% interest rate cut was 46.7%, and the chance of no changes in interest rate policies was zero. The change in the CME FedWatch Tool expectations reflects just how important the strong September jobs report was for shifting Fed policy expectations.

The CME FedWatch Tool reflects that there is no urgency to cut interest rates due to the strength of the labor market. However, if inflation eases in September, the Fed will have more wiggle room to cut interest rates next month.

If the September CPI report does not show a further easing of year-on-year consumer inflation, expectations that the Fed will leave interest rates unchanged on November 7 will likely rise. These dynamics would likely support the dollar but potentially hold mixed to negative implications for equities, bond prices, and industrial commodity prices.

However, if the September CPI report shows an easing of year-on-year inflationary pressures from August, the potential for a 0.5% rate cut would likely increase, weighing on the greenback but supporting equities, bond prices, and industrial commodity prices.

What do you expect for the September CPI inflation report?"
Robust Job Gains Remove Recession Fears,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bill_stone/2024/10/06/robust-job-gains-remove-recession-fears/,2024-10-06T11:06:04Z,"The September jobs report on Friday put to rest any fears that the labor market might be on a path to cool enough to endanger U.S. economic growth. On the contrary, the report was so broadly strong as to give rise to worries that the Federal Reserve might pause further cuts and reignited wage growth might be a looming danger.

Employment grew by 254,000 nonfarm jobs, which was well above expectations, and the upwardly revised 159,000 in August. The household survey data was also robust at a gain of 430,000 jobs, with the research series, which mirrors the payroll report criteria, soaring by a whopping 666,000.

The unemployment rate was reported at 4.1% but was close to 4.0% at 4.05%, down from 4.2%.

Wages crept up to 4.0% year-over-year, above the expectations of 3.8%, which reinforces the strength of the labor demand but might raise questions about renewed inflation pressures. The only blemish on the jobs report was the average workweek hours falling to 34.2, a four-year low also seen in July and January.

The high-frequency initial and continuing filings for unemployment benefits confirm that the cooling trend in the labor market has stabilized, with both measures off their respective peaks.

Before the recent decline, the unemployment rate had risen enough off the lows to trigger the Sahm Rule, which has an unblemished track record of forecasting recession. However, there are several reasons to believe that the Sahm Rule might be overstating the risk of recession during this cycle.

Monitoring the prime-age, 25 to 54 years old, employment-to-population ratio should help signal when concern about the rising unemployment rate is warranted. The rising prime-age employment-to-population ratio is further evidence that the labor market does not yet pose an imminent threat to the health of the economy.

Stocks had another positive week, with the S&P 500 near all-time highs by Friday's market close. The Magnificent 7, consisting of Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META), Amazon.com (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), NVIDIA (NVDA), Alphabet (GOOGL), and Tesla (TSLA), moved higher as well.

Looking below the surface, the more economically sensitive cyclical stocks outperformed defensive stocks, which are less impacted by the economy. The lower probability of recession after the healthy jobs report is reflected in the better performance of economically sensitive companies.

The crucial economic reports before the next Federal Reserve meeting on November 7 include Thursday's consumer inflation (CPI) and another monthly jobs report. Consensus estimates expect September CPI to slow to 2.3% year-over-year from 2.5%. The Cleveland Fed's CPI supports this view and should leave the door open to a 25 basis point cut at the November meeting.

Futures pricing reacted to the strong jobs report by slashing the expected pace of 2024 rate cuts. A short-term interest rate cut of 25 (0.25%) basis points at the November and December Fed meetings is implied. In response to the slower expected pace of rate cuts, the 2-year and 10-year Treasury yields rose to 3.92% and 3.97%, respectively.

Friday's job report increases the probability that the Federal Reserve can engineer a soft landing with the U.S. economy remaining remarkably resilient. The Atlanta Fed's estimate of third-quarter GDP is at 2.5%, according to their last update on October 1. As the fears of recession recede and have been reflected in all-time high stock prices, earnings will likely need to be the next catalyst for higher prices. Third-quarter earnings season kicks off at the end of the week as if on cue."
5 Questions For The Fed's Austan Goolsbee -- Including: Did They Move Fast Enough On Inflation?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dereksaul/2024/10/05/5-questions-for-the-feds-austan-goolsbee-including-did-they-move-fast-enough-on-inflation/,2024-10-05T12:09:41Z,"It's an unusually tense time at the Federal Reserve as Democrats and Republicans -- including former President Donald Trump -- target the central bank as it starts cutting rates in its most significant monetary policy in decades. Forbes spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, an alternate member on the highly watched Federal Open Market Committee and a former chair of the Council of Economic Advisers for President Obama, about how ""super serious"" central bankers feel about becoming a political football ahead of the election, how the Fed is adjusting to easing inflation and growing recession angst, and what he'd change about the ""behind the curve"" policy leading to the worst inflation crisis in the U.S. since the early 1980s.

Forbes: Have there been any discussions at Federal Open Market Committee meetings about pressure from both sides of the political aisle to act in a certain way heading into the election? Context: The FOMC is the U.S. central bank panel that votes on the target federal funds rate, which heavily influences interest rates on loans across the country, impacting inflation, economic growth and unemployment. The Fed is under heightened scrutiny after rolling out the first interest rate cuts since early 2020 last month. The reaction function refers to how a central bank responds to one event, like lowering rates when inflation rises.

When you become a sworn member of the Federal Reserve, you're out of the election business. Everybody takes that super seriously. The things that determine our decisions are: What are the economic conditions and what are the forecasts. What would we need to see to stop raising? What would we need to see to hold? What do we need to see for stuff to come down? We've been laying out the criteria, and now we're just seeing come to pass the stuff that we've been forecasting, and so the reaction function is pretty well established.

Forbes: What are the data points in the labor market that you are paying the closest attention to meeting to meeting? Context: We interviewed Goolsbee two days before the September jobs report surprisingly revealed the strongest job growth since March, decelerating bets on continued aggression from the Fed on lowering rates and throwing another wrench into the central bank shift as borrowing costs look less likely to tumble.

Goolsbee: The unemployment rate, but everybody knows that. A little bit less, the payroll, job employment numbers. There was a time when, if you had asked me ""what's the single most important number?"" I probably would have said that, but not now, with the uncertainty about immigration and the uncertainty about these [revisions to jobs data].

This has been such a strange, unprecedented moment of new firm creation and self employment and different work arrangements. I think that's why we're having such major revisions on these [data points]. All of those things make me put a little bit less weight [on monthly nonfarm payrolls] since there's more of a question mark around [them]. All the measures that we tend to look at as economists to track the labor market - the ratio of vacancies to the number of unemployed, the employment-to-population ratio of prime age workforce, the quit rate, hiring rate, all of those things, plus the the new unemployment claims - I feel like they're all kind of saying the same thing.

The rate of change is all in the direction of cooling. And if you look in the past, it's quite rare that you see cooling labor markets that just settle into full employment. Usually, when things start to go bad, they keep getting worse. And so that's our challenge now: After an ahistorical business cycle, and an ahistorical recovery, are we back to something like normal conditions and we're going to stop here, or are we going to blow through full employment, things are going to get worse and it's going to look like a more like a normal business cycle?

Forbes: Let's imagine we have that crystal ball and we're able to look forward to the end of next year. We officially stick the landing, core PCE runs right in that sweet spot of about 2%, and the federal funds rate falls to right around the median forecast around 3%. What risks for the second half of the decade are you most worried about? Context: Core PCE is the Fed's favored inflation metric as it tracks how much Americans spend monthly on goods and services outside of more volatile food and energy categories. Projections shared at the FOMC's latest meeting indicate officials have a median forecast of 3.4% at the end of 2025.

Goolsbee: It's productivity growth.

For productivity growth, the [data] matters the most over the long run, and in the short run, it's one of the most noisy [data points] there is. So that's why it's kind of hard to take that into account in the meeting-to-meeting monetary policy decisions. We saw wild swings in that over Covid...but in the last year-and-a-half, that growth rate of productivity has been averaging well higher than the trend before Covid.

Is that a sign that technology has changed, or is it AI? Is it something else? Is it hybrid work? Is it the business dynamism that we've had all these startups? Because if the productivity growth rate is going to be higher, even if not permanent [but] for the medium term, then the second half of the decade we're going to have a bunch of discussions like the second half of the 1990s, where there was an extended increase in the productivity growth rate. The implications for the economy are that you can grow faster and have more job growth without inflation in a world like that.

And income, wages are going to go up. Nobody needs to be nervous about wages going up at fast rates, because productivity growth will justify it. To me, that's an overwhelmingly important factor that we're going to have to think about in this second half.

Forbes: You're allowed to time travel back to mid-to-late 2021, right before inflation skyrocketed, and you can change one policy within relative reason. What do you choose? Context: After a decade of sub-3% inflation, prices began rising rapidly in 2021, and consumer price index inflation peaked in June 2022 at a 41-year high of 9.1%. The Fed didn't raise rates, the most common response to inflation, until March 2022, and raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to a two-decade high of over 5% in a 16-month span.

Goolsbee: I think looking back, if you had one thing to change, if you could know that the supply shocks were not going to be transitory in the three or four months sense, you would have started moving earlier.

You would not have been raising with this kind of rapidity that the Fed engaged in, 500 basis points in one year. That's about as fast as it's ever gone up. You would have started earlier but also realistically, I think it's worth considering how much lower you think inflation would be if they had done that. If you could have a crystal ball and have perfect timing and recognize it's not going to be a temporary supply shock lasting three months, it's going to be a temporary supply shock lasting two years, how much less would inflation be?

There were a lot of countries that tried both monetary and fiscal policy a lot of different ways, and, for the most part, they basically had the same inflation experience. It is instructive that there are limits to what the Fed could have done. But if I had one thing to do over - I wasn't on the FOMC at that time - but looking back, they were behind the curve, slow to move.

Forbes: I know you're a big fan of ""The Simpsons"" - what do you think Mr. Burns would want the FOMC to do now? What's the conversation like at Moe's tavern when CNBC comes on after the last FOMC meeting? Context: Goolsbee often references ""The Simpsons,"" the animated comedy which features curmudgeonly nuclear power tycoon Mr. Charles Burns and the pub ""Moe's Tavern,"" where Homer Simpson and his more working class drinking buddies congregate.

Goolsbee: Mr. Burns has, in various episodes, lots of cash, lots of equity and/or lots of bonds. So does he want high rates or low rates? I would like to think Mr. Burns, just out of his own pure self-interest, wants whatever is good for the economy. Financial stability seems like it is the order of the day for him. At Moe's Tavern, there's one of the episodes where they're showing old presidential debates, and Kennedy's like, 'I'd like to express my fondness for Duff beer,' and Richard Nixon's like, 'I would also like to express my fondness for that particular beer,' and it cuts Moe's Tavern. And they're like, 'That guy never drank a Duff in his life!' And I fear that Moe's Tavern, they would not be super enamored of the FOMC, but they should be. We're not the bad guys. We're the Guardians of the Galaxy.

[Goolsbee revised his Burns response in an email: ""Burns is a notorious gold bug that's still complaining that the Coinage Act got rid of the ha'penny in 1857. He's had it out for the Fed since we tipped off authorities in season 9 that he was the one who stole the 1 Trillion dollar bill after WWII.""]"
Broke And Unemployed? Here Are 5 Steps To Financial Recovery,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/truetamplin/2024/10/04/what-if-youre-broke-and-unemployed-5-steps-to-financial-recovery/,2024-10-04T18:13:03Z,"Being broke and unemployed is undoubtedly one of the most stressful financial situations one can face, with the pressure to make ends meet -- buying food, paying rent, or keeping the lights on -- seemingly impossible. Nonetheless, there are steps you can take to regain control. This article offers practical strategies to help reduce expenses, access assistance, and quickly generate income. By taking swift action, you can ease financial pressure and work toward long-term stability. Even in difficult times, small, focused efforts can make a significant difference in securing your financial future.

Before making decisions about managing your finances, you must first fully understand where you stand. Knowing the extent of your resources and liabilities will provide a clearer picture of what needs to be done.

Gather a complete list of all available resources, such as any cash you have on hand, money in checking and savings accounts, or funds held in PayPal or other payment services. You should also consider any assets that you could potentially liquidate, such as unused electronics, jewelry, or other valuables.

This step serves as your financial baseline, a way to determine how much you have to work with. While the number may seem small, it's crucial to have clarity on the exact amount of money you can draw from in the short term.

The next step is to examine where your money is going. Categorize your expenses into essential and non-essential groups. Essentials are things like rent, utilities, food, and transportation. Non-essentials may include streaming services, dining out, entertainment, or other discretionary purchases.

A detailed breakdown of your spending will enable you to construct a minimal budget centered around survival. This is the initial stage of identifying areas where you can cut back.

Based on your expenses, you'll need to estimate how much money is required to cover your essential costs over the next one to three months. This timeframe provides a short-term view, allowing you to focus on immediate survival while planning for longer-term recovery.

Write down exactly how much you need for basic living expenses and subtract this from your current assets to understand any pressing shortfall.

This is one of the most critical steps in managing a financial crisis. In some cases, it might mean making difficult decisions about what to cut, but reducing expenses as quickly as possible is necessary to stretch your available resources.

Cancel or pause your streaming services, gym memberships, or other subscriptions. Even though these services may provide comfort or routine, they are not important for survival.

You should also refrain from dining out, going to the movies, or shopping. By cutting out all non-essential expenditures, you can redirect the money saved toward critical living costs.

Many service providers, from utilities to ISPs, are willing to offer flexible payment plans or temporary reductions for individuals facing financial hardship. Contact these companies directly and explain your situation.

Landlords may also be willing to negotiate, particularly if you're at risk of eviction. Depending on your location, there may be legal protections against eviction for those who are unemployed. Negotiating can buy you time, reduce your financial burden, and prevent essential services from being cut off.

If you are carrying debt, reach out to creditors to explore options for deferring payments, reducing interest rates, or restructuring your debt. Some creditors offer hardship programs designed for individuals going through periods of unemployment or financial crisis.

If deferring payments isn't an option, focus on making minimum payments to avoid additional late fees or damage to your credit score. Although debt can be stressful, your basic needs, such as housing and food, should take precedence over aggressive debt repayment during this time.

There are a variety of emergency assistance programs available, designed to help you cover essential costs like food, housing, and utilities when you cannot do so on your own.

Several government programs offer financial assistance to those who are unemployed and struggling. Unemployment insurance provides temporary income to eligible individuals who lost their jobs through no fault of their own, and can be applied for through your state's Department of Labor.

The Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program helps low-income individuals and families purchase groceries, while Temporary Assistance for Needy Families provides cash assistance for basic living expenses. For healthcare, Medicaid offers free or low-cost coverage to qualifying individuals based on income. Research what programs you qualify for and apply as soon as possible. These programs can provide the financial lifeline you need to get through the toughest months of unemployment.

In addition to government assistance, many charitable organizations provide food, housing assistance, and other resources to those in need. Local food banks can provide groceries, allowing you to cut food costs from your budget while still ensuring you and your family are fed.

Non-profit organizations often offer rental assistance, emergency housing, and utility support. Religious organizations may also provide financial aid or community support. These resources are usually available at little to no cost and can offer significant relief.

Even with reduced expenses and assistance programs, there may still be a gap between your needs and available resources. You can earn money quickly through these temporary measures:

Look around your home for items you no longer need or use that can be sold, such as electronics, furniture, appliances, or even clothing. Use platforms like eBay, Craigslist, or Facebook Marketplace to post these items for sale.

While this isn't a long-term solution, it can provide the funds needed to cover a bill or buy groceries. Even small sales can add up and provide some breathing room in your budget.

If selling items isn't enough, you might consider short-term borrowing. You can ask friends or family to lend you cash, but be sure to communicate clearly about repayment terms to avoid straining personal relationships.

You may also consider taking out a personal loan from a credit union. However, be cautious with payday loans or other high-interest borrowing options, as these can trap you in a cycle of debt that's difficult to escape.

The gig economy offers numerous opportunities to earn an income without the need for long-term commitment. Apps like Uber, Lyft, DoorDash, TaskRabbit, and Upwork allow you to take on freelance work, driving, or small tasks that can bring in money quickly.

Many of these jobs offer flexibility, allowing you to work as much or as little as you need. While gig work may not provide the stability of a full-time job, it can be a useful short-term strategy to cover your essential expenses during this period.

After stabilizing your immediate financial situation, the next step is to focus on building a strong foundation for long-term financial health. This involves not only finding a sustainable income but also creating a financial safety net and developing better financial habits. By addressing these three critical areas, you'll be better prepared to weather future financial challenges and steadily build wealth.

Securing stable employment is a crucial part of moving forward financially. Be strategic and persistent in your job hunt. Reach out to former colleagues, connect with industry groups, and engage on professional platforms like LinkedIn. Remember to tailor your resume for specific roles and focus on sectors that align with your goals.

You may also use this period of unemployment as an opportunity to reassess your career path and identify ways to enhance your job prospects. Instead of rushing to accept any available job, think about how you can increase your skills and qualifications to align with industries that offer better job security and growth potential.

After you've landed a stable job, your next priority is building a financial safety net. This will protect you from future emergencies and give you peace of mind knowing you have a buffer to fall back on in times of crisis.

Establish an emergency fund and aim to save three to six months' worth of living expenses to cover unforeseen situations like job loss, medical emergencies, or major car repairs. Building this fund may take a while, but even small, regular contributions can grow significantly over time. Automate your savings to ensure consistency, with a portion of each paycheck regularly transferred into a separate savings account.

If you incurred debt during unemployment, managing and reducing it is key to improving your financial standing. Prioritize paying off high-interest debt first, such as credit cards, as these can quickly spiral if left unchecked. Once your debts are under control, your available income can be directed toward savings and investments, allowing you to focus on long-term financial growth.

This will ensure you don't fall into financial crisis again. For example, budgeting is the foundation of good financial management. There are several tools and apps that simplify the budgeting process and allow you to track your spending more efficiently.

Aside from short-term budgeting, think about the bigger financial picture. Set concrete goals such as saving for retirement, buying a home, building a business, or investing for future growth. For instance, if your employer offers a retirement plan, contribute as much as possible, particularly if they provide matching contributions. You may also consider investing in low-risk, diversified options like index funds or ETFs.

Even modest, consistent investments can benefit from compound interest, significantly increasing your wealth in the long run. Or if you have an entrepreneurial spirit, there are ways to start a business with zero capital. Whatever you decide, remember that your investment strategy should align with your goals and risk tolerance to ensure that you're building a secure financial future.

The struggle of unemployment and financial hardship can be overwhelming. However, by making timely interventions to cut expenses, access emergency resources, and generate quick cash, you can alleviate some of the pressure and maintain control over your financial situation. Remember to remain proactive and seek help when needed. Financial recovery is possible, and by taking it one step at a time, you can move toward a brighter future."
September Jobs Report Obliterates Experts' Projections,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/eliamdur/2024/10/04/september-jobs-report-obliterates-experts-projections/,2024-10-04T18:01:30Z,"The American job market continues to forge ahead under a head of steam, forcing even the most cautious prognosticators to ask if it's really that good. Well, truth is, it's better than that.

Once again, the Bureau of Labor Statistics' monthly Jobs Report astonished economists and market observers by revealing that 254,000 jobs were created last month, blowing away predictions of 140,000, while the unemployment rate ticked down from 4.2% to 4.1%. For the 45 consecutive month, the job market outperformed expectations, continued the most robust expansion in history, and even defied possible disruptions usually associated with election year jitters and shenanigans. In short, the American job market is a beautiful thing.

And as usual, it's not limited to the veneer of jobs created and unemployment rate. A look under the hood shows us the following:

While all this is going on, wages continued rising and are now 4.0% above the level 12 month ago. This is not the only good news for the wage earner. At the same time, inflation has cooled to a very manageable 2.5%. The typical worker, then, is up 1.5% over inflation, although that's little consolation after a trip to the supermarket. In other words, had it not been for the rock-solid job market we've come to rely upon, this would be a different conversation.

In sum, the current job market is a sturdy structure, not susceptible to erosion or collapse. In large part, that's due to to smart initiatives like the American Relief Act, the CHIPS and Science Act, smart fiscal policy on the Fed's part, continued enrollment growth in the Affordable Care Act, and - intangible but undeniable - overall confidence on everyone's part."
"With Robust Hiring In September, Here's What Lies Ahead For Job Seekers In October And November",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jackkelly/2024/10/04/with-robust-hiring-in-september-heres-what-lies-ahead-for-job-seekers-in-october-and-november/,2024-10-04T16:28:16Z,"The job market in September showed remarkable strength as the United States economy added 254,000 new jobs last month, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported on Friday.

Hiring lived up to the hype of the ""September surge,"" as the government data outpaced the Dow Jones consensus forecast of 150,000. Employment continued to rise in sectors such as food services and drinking establishments, healthcare, government, social assistance and construction, while unemployment fell to 4.1%.

August's total was adjusted upward by 17,000, while July experienced a significant increase of 55,000, bringing the overall monthly growth to 144,000.

Adding to the positive momentum, the Federal Reserve is anticipated to implement another interest rate reduction on November 7, following an initial cut on September 18.

Market projections suggest a 0.25% decrease in interest rates, bringing them to a range of 4.5% to 4.75%. However, there's a possibility of a more substantial 0.5% cut, contingent on the economic data released in the upcoming weeks.

Looking ahead, this buoyant hiring mood could continue into the coming months, potentially leading to further job growth. Although, challenges remain for job seekers, as competition for positions may intensify.

As October and early November roll in, job hunters find themselves in a prime window of opportunity, with many companies generally eager to fill positions before the holiday season commences.

Historically, this period often sees an uptick in hiring activity as businesses look to maximize their remaining budgets before year-end. The fall hiring season typically parallels the busy recruitment cycle of January and February, which are peak months for interviews as staff return from vacations, according to Indeed.

However, candidates must act swiftly, as this productive phase is fleeting, with a slowdown expected to take hold around Thanksgiving.

Moreover, the current economic climate has introduced some uncertainty to this hiring pattern. Job growth has been slowing overall, with the economy adding fewer monthly jobs compared to the previous years.

The average monthly gain over the past 12 months is 203,000, down from 251,000 in 2023, 377,000 in 2022 and 604,000 in 2021, according to BLS.

Job seekers should approach this period with realistic and flexible expectations, as well as a well-prepared strategy -- such as networking -- to maximize their chances of success. With fewer job openings, competition may be fiercer.

Certain sectors may still see increased hiring activity. Industries directly affected by the holiday season, such as retail and hospitality, often ramp up seasonal hiring during this period.

Amazon announced on Wednesday its plans to hire 250,000 full-time, part-time and seasonal roles across its customer fulfillment and transportation operations in the U.S."
China's 30% Stock Rally Has An Economic Problem,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williampesek/2024/10/04/chinas-30-stock-rally-has-an-economic-problem/,2024-10-04T15:42:59Z,"The bulls charging through Shanghai are beginning to look over their shoulders.

Gaining on them is economic reality that has many wondering if the more than 30% surge in equities from a September low is overdone. The problem is an underlying economy facing intensifying headwinds. And one failing to keep pace with the sudden surge in investor optimism toward China.

This stock rally follows an extraordinary barrage of moves to cut interest rates, slash mortgage rates, relax rules for homebuyers in major cities and lower the amount of cash banks must keep in reserve.

Chinese leader Xi Jinping is hinting at bigger steps to come to boost national growth.

These maneuvers changed the subject from China's deflation-generating property crisis, high youth unemployment and weak consumer demand.

Not for long, though, as Chinese data suggest more trouble ahead. In August, industrial industry profits plunged 17.8% from a year earlier, the sharpest contraction so far in 2024. Other data on retail sales and fixed asset investment add to worries Asia's biggest economy is slowing anew.

So much so that some economists think Xi's Communist Party should issue about 10 trillion yuan ($1.4 trillion) in special debt to lift confidence via infrastructure projects. Count Jia Kang, head of private think tank China Academy of New Supply-Side Economics, among them.

""As these projects get underway, they will create jobs, increase income for citizens, and unlock consumption potential,"" says Jia, the former head of a research institute linked to the Ministry of Finance, told Chinese publication The Paper.

In other words, what Team Xi has done to date isn't gaining the traction economists hoped. One problem is that China is doing more to throw money at the forces generating deflation than implementing policies to reverse them.

Hence concerns that the stock surge is racing ahead of concrete efforts to raise China's economic game. Or even to meet this year's 5% growth target in credible ways.

It's a reminder that China needs to treat the underlying causes of its economic slump, not just the symptoms. It was those causes that had Chinese shares plunging two weeks ago. That selloff reflected concerns the economy is stumbling.

Yet even as the bulls charge again, those concerns remain real.

In an op-ed for news organization Project Syndicate, Chinese economist Yu Yongding argues ""it's fair to say that China's 'economic miracle' of maintaining an average annual growth rate of 10% is over. Still, I believe that with wise macroeconomic policy, market-oriented reforms, and a genuine commitment to opening up its economy, the economy should be able to maintain a solid growth rate of 5-6% for the foreseeable future.""

Yu was on the Chinese central bank's monetary committee. Now, he's on the frontlines of another epochal debate.

""Chinese economists have debated for years whether policymakers should adopt more expansionary fiscal and monetary policies to stimulate GDP growth, or focus instead on structural reforms aimed at eliminating overcapacity,"" Yu argues. ""But given this year's lackluster economic performance, their views are increasingly aligned. In fact, one could even say that all Chinese economists now advocate expansionary measures.""

Even more important, though, are steps to end the property crisis once and for all. Lessons from Japan abound. In the 1990s, Tokyo acted glacially to get bad loans off banks' balance sheets, paving the way for 25 years of deflation.

Japan comparisons only go so far with China. But the slow pace of stabilizing a property sector pivotal to gross domestic product has helped no one in China. It's the biggest cause of Chinese deflation.

Xi's inner circle has been slow to get bad assets off property developers' balance sheets. It's lacked urgency to address China's fast-aging population and catalyze a bigger, more disruptive startup boom. It's been too slow for comfort to build social safety nets to encourage households to save less and spend more.

Harry Murphy Cruise, an economist at Moody's Analytics, can't help but think back to a market mini-crash that happened nine years ago. Recent data suggest Chinese officials aren't recalling the lessons from Tokyo's lost decade.

""Outside of the pandemic, this is the lowest it has been since the 2015 stock market crash,"" Cruise says. ""With the domestic economy struggling, deflation fears are elevated.""

The 2015 crash still traumatizes Xi's party. In a three-week period, from July to August 2015, Chinese shares plunged 30%. At the time, China Inc. circled the wagons. Xi's party pumped tidal waves of state funds into markets, scrapped all initial public offerings, suspended trading in thousands of companies and let mainlanders pledge homes as collateral to buy shares.

Yet then, as now, Beijing did more to address symptoms than the underlying causes. The more the bulls catch on, the more Chinese stocks may be vulnerable to a big correction."
Job Market Strong in September - Will It Slow Fed Rate Cuts?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/harryholzer/2024/10/04/job-market-strong-in-septemberwill-it-slow-fed-rate-cuts/,2024-10-04T14:34:24Z,"The jobs report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics for September was considerably stronger than expected.

Economists had been predicting payroll growth of 140-150,000 jobs; instead, payrolls rose by 254,000. The estimates for July and August were revised up substantially; the average for the last 3 months is now 185,000, which is considerably higher than earlier estimates. The strongest growth was in eating and drinking places, where employment rose by a very robust 69,000 jobs.

Wage growth has also been more robust than in previous months. Combining August and September, monthly wages have risen by about 5% (on an annualized basis). And, from the household survey, the employment rate out of the population grew by .2 percentage points (60.0 to 60.2%), while the unemployment rate fell - especially among high school dropouts and Hispanic workers.

It would probably be a mistake to read too much into this, or any other report, that covers just a single month. The monthly employment statistics tend to bounce around, and 3-6 month averages present a more informative picture. Also, other measures like the job vacancy rate (which held steady at 4.8 percent in August), suggest a steadier labor market. And another reading in the coming weeks on productivity will also be important - since the relative strong productivity growth (above 2 percent) over the past year and a half suggest we can live with wage growth of 4 percent or higher.

Still, the large bump in payrolls in September, combined with upward revisions for July and August as well as more robust wage growth, suggest that the job market weakness we had detected in the late spring and summer months might have been a bit overstated, or perhaps a more temporary lull than we thought. The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark interest rate by a half percentage point earlier this month, indicating its concern about a slowing economy. The current data might cause it to slow down further rate reductions a bit, until we get a clearer picture of where the job market is really heading."
Strong September Jobs Report Reduces Recession Fears,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonschenker/2024/10/04/strong-september-jobs-report-reduces-recession-fears/,2024-10-04T14:03:49Z,"The September jobs report was stronger than expected and is likely to assuage recession risks and fears, driving up hopes for ""soft landing"" or ""no landing"" economic scenarios. This report is likely to reduce the chances that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by 0.5% on November 7, but the recent trend of slowing payrolls is still supportive of a 0.25% rate cut. An uncertain presidential election outcome could still push the Fed to cut rates by 0.5%.

The Employment Situation report, known to economists and analysts as the jobs report, was strong for September. It showed a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1%, strong net payroll gains of 254,000, and strong upward revisions to payrolls by 72,000 for the previous two months. This was a much stronger report than economists and analysts had been forecasting, and it reduces the perceived downside risks to the U.S. labor market and economy.

While the jobs report supports the claim that the U.S. labor market is relatively solid, other recent data also reinforce this notion. After all, initial and continuing jobless claims are very low. Continuing claims are at 1.826 million, which is only around 1.1 percent of the labor force. Initial Jobless Claims are also very low, at just 225,000.

Strong Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey data showed that there were over 8 million open jobs in August 2024. While this is around 4.2 million fewer open jobs than the U.S. historic high in March 2022 of 12.2 million, 8 million is still around 1 million more open jobs than before the COVID pandemic. With over 6 million more open jobs than people collecting unemployment, it is difficult to expect very large net payroll losses across multiple months anytime soon.

The Fed has a dual mandate to support full employment and keep inflation rates low and stable. The September jobs report, August JOLTS data, and recent weekly jobless claims reflect full employment in the U.S. labor market, but consumer prices are not yet low and stable - or at least not yet at the Fed's 2% inflation target. The combination of above-target inflation and a solid labor market could incentivize the Fed to cut interest rates by only 0.25% rather than 0.5% in its next policy decision on November 7.

Of course, we don't yet have September inflation data, and there is also a U.S. election to contend with before the next Fed meeting.

The September CPI and PCE reports will be critical for the November 7 Fed decision. Year-on-year inflation rates are likely to have made more progress toward 2% in September, and Prestige Economics is forecasting year-on-year September total CPI to be 2.4%, with core CPI at 3.1%. However, it may be the November election outcome - or uncertainty about that outcome by November 7 - that could push the Fed to cut rates by 0.5%

A strong September employment report with payrolls well above August levels and a drop in the unemployment rate to 4.1% is a signal that the Fed can take its time with rate cuts, which is likely to support the greenback and bond yields. Additionally, this solid report could still have positive impacts on equities, oil prices, and industrial metals prices because it assuages concerns about recession."
Is It A Goldilocks Economy?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jjkinahan/2024/10/04/is-it-a-goldilocks-economy/,2024-10-04T13:06:32Z,"Temporary Strike Resolution Offers Short-Term Relief For Impacted Industries

Stocks were relatively quiet on Thursday as markets awaited this morning's employment situation report. The S&P 500 fell 0.2% while the Nasdaq Composite was flat. Small cap stocks were the biggest movers for the day, falling over 0.5% and the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 0.4%.

This morning, the Labor Department released the latest employment report. Forecasts were calling for 147 thousand new jobs and an unchanged unemployment rate of 4.2%. The actual numbers were 254 thousand new jobs while the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%. We also saw upward revisions for both July and August, suggesting the economy continues to show strength. We'll get the latest Consumer Price Index late next week and a chance to see if prices are continuing on their trajectory of moderating. Thus far though, the net effect of recent data implies an economy continuing on target for a soft landing. However, there is one potential caveat to that, oil.

On Thursday, oil was up over 5% as the world awaits Israel's response to Iran's missile attack earlier in the week. For the week, crude oil prices are up nearly 10% and that is something with the potential to upset the progress made vis-a-vis inflation. If there is one commodity that has the potential to jumpstart inflation, it is oil. Therefore, in addition to both the humanitarian and geopolitical repercussions, there is the potential for economic upheaval as well. The 200-day moving average for crude oil is right around $75 and that is a level I'll be watching. A close above that could be bullish for those who are long but bearish for inflation.

The other big story on Thursday was the temporary end to the strike at ports along the East Coast. Employers offered workers a pay increase of 62% spread out over six years. The International Longshoremen's Association and port operators said this agreement will last until late January as the two sides work on a long-term deal. One of the main sticking points in the negotiations is automation and how that will impact jobs. Seeing as how the strike lasted just three days, any economic impact was likely muted. However, this is an issue we may hear about again come early next year. In the meantime, we're seeing some of the companies that could have been negatively impacted by a prolonged strike trading higher in premarket activity. Shares of Walmart are up 0.5% along with Target, which is trading higher by nearly 1%.

For today, I'm keeping an eye on how the jobs data report is spun and oil. The market's initial reaction to the jobs number has been bullish. Index futures jumped when the report was released. Heading into this morning's report, sentiment was largely in the camp that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates by a quarter point when they meet in November. Expectations for that quarter point cut were relatively unchanged after the employment number was released. One other thing I'll be watching today is the VIX. Last Friday, volatility increased right near the end of the day. I believe that was largely due to the situation in the Middle East and investor concern about the potential for increased hostilities over the weekend. Given the state of affairs as of Friday morning, I would not be surprised if we saw a similar situation today. As always, I would stick with your investing plans and long-term objectives."

One open question was the impact of Hurricane Francine on jobs, but ""Our analysis suggests that Hurricane Francine had no discernible effect on national payroll employment, hours, and earnings from the establishment survey, or the national unemployment rate from the household survey.""

As important as these releases are in normal times, they take on extra significance in the lead up to an election. In fact, experts claim that the economy is particularly important to voters this year. It has consequently been a running theme for both parties, with Democrats focusing on low unemployment and robust growth and Republicans on the recent spike in inflation.

What's curious about this campaign is the fact that the Democrats are having to scramble to defend themselves. You'd think that theirs was the high ground given that:

Meanwhile, though it is true that inflation accelerated temporarily, there is little question that this was related to factors outside of the US and has calmed down considerably.

Despite this, however, voters have a very dim -- and flawed -- view of the state of the economy:

""Nearly everything Americans believe about the economy is wrong, according to a recent Harris-Guardian poll...The poll, conducted earlier this month, found that perceptions of the U.S. economy are often at odds with reality. For instance, most Americans (55 percent) think the economy is shrinking, with about the same share saying we're in a recession.""

Unfortunately for the Democrats, perceptions are more important than reality in situations like this.

There are three more key indicator announcements before the November 5th election:

If any of these is out of line with what we have been experiencing of late, it could have an impact on voters.

That said, economists do not expect any significant deviation from our current low unemployment, solid GDP growth, and moderating inflation. Even if the dockworkers' strike (now resolved) and recent flooding were to raise prices, the October 10 CPI announcement only covers September. It simply wouldn't show up yet.

What this suggests is that the releases will include very little new information and both parties will simply recycle their earlier talking points. If the outcome is going to be affected by the state of the economy, it is going to be because one party did a better job of spinning than the other. And while there is evidence that Kamala Harris' economic message may be gaining ground on Donald Trump's, a lot can happen in a month.

Everyone will be watching these numbers closely."
MEDIOCRE JOB GROWTH REPORTS BELIE MAJOR PROBLEMS AHEAD FOR US ECONOMY,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joelshulman/2024/10/03/mediocre-job-growth-reports-belie-major-problems-ahead-for-us-economy/,2024-10-04T01:40:11Z,"The September job report (10/4 @8:30am) is expected to show 150,000 new (non farm) jobs and an unchanged 4.2% unemployment rate. These numbers are not overwhelming, but neither are they disastrous. Importantly, anything close (or even weaker) will be sufficient for the Federal Reserve to proceed with continued interest rate cuts. This is key to further market advancement.

But the jobs reports, thus far, in 2024 are not signaling the massive problems on the horizon. As a population, we are an old country and getting older. Moreover, we are not creating jobs like we used to and have resorted to outsourcing many jobs that we could keep ""in house"". Further, we have lately resorted to a propensity to create ""non productive"" jobs to maintain employment. For example, over the past 5 years, the United States created 350,000 MORE jobs in government, social services and healthcare than overall total jobs created.

It should come as no surprise that the US has long since lost its competitive edge in manufacturing. However, our job growth is now dependent on aging baby boomers with many refusing to retire. This may be due to economic necessity or desire to keep active, but eventually, the issue becomes moot. Sooner or later they leave the workforce. Many individuals will no longer contribute wealth to our society and will become an added burden to limited support and services.

Surprisingly, in a close election year, marked by animus from one political party to the next, the economic news has taken a back seat to other issues deemed more worrisome. It shouldn't. Current economic issues, the direction of job growth and the inevitable, irreversible decline in the US workforce, should take center stage. The next four years will be critical to the economic direction of the US economy. In the absence of a visionary change in direction, economic retooling, incentives and policy changes, our overall economy is headed for a vicious downward cycle.

There are some key fundamental demographics which are not going away. Ever. The US has an aging workforce with 75m baby boomers. Notably, by the year 2030 the number of Americans who are 65+ will exceed 20%, almost doubling the level in the year 2000. Each year, more than 4m Americans are eligible to retire. This will continue for the foreseeable future and have a profound impact on the size of the civilian labor force, the employed population ratio, and the unemployment rate. To place these numbers in perspective, one needs to understand that in the past 5 years, only 3m new jobs were created. There are currently 40m+ Americans who are 65-75 and in the next 6 years another 25m will join them. Approximately 1/3 of them work (up for 1/4 10 years ago). This implies that within the next 5 to 10 years, the US can expect 20m+ retirements. Given the current level of 161m employed Americans, on a civilian non institutional population base rate of 268m, the employed population ratio could plummet from 60% to 50%. In other words, in only 5 to 10 years, the US could be in a situation in which 1/2 the civilian non institutional population (above 16, non military, not in jail or nursing home) would not be working.

Compounding the problem is that the US has added to taken a leadership role in outsourcing talent -- notably to Eastern Europe and India for technical IT support and Philippines and Viet Nam for bookkeeping and accounting support. Millions of jobs, both high and low wage jobs are being sent overseas.

Meanwhile, the job growth in the US has come from 3 key areas: HealthCare, Government, Social Assistance. In fact, over the past 20 years, 2/3 of the new jobs from these areas and in the past 5 years, more than 3.5m jobs were created in government, health care and social services than overall jobs!

Given the aging population, the trend in healthcare will clearly continue. Moreover, the demand for social services will likely also continue to rise as additional illegal immigrants enter the country.

Is there a solution to avoid this impending doom? Possibly, but we would need immediate corrective actions. Unfortunately, job growth, and in particular, long-term job creation has not received the attention that it requires. Minor tweaks are being made to extend retirement age among some workers from 65 to 67, but this does not address the larger issue that will happen within 5 to 10 years.

Policies need to be implemented to create economic incentives for companies to keep jobs in America and bring other jobs back home. Along these lines, tough policies regarding minimum wages need to be considered in the context of not forcing employers to shut down, move or outsource talent. America also needs to grow it's educated work force, especially among young people. Simple solutions, such as keeping foreign college students in our country longer, might go a long way to helping resolve this developing crisis.

Finally, the US cannot continue to create jobs primarily in government, social services and health care. Jobs that help reduce global balance of payment deficits are required for long term economic growth. This cannot happen with governmental or social service jobs. As part of this action, governmental policy regarding the increased cost of millions of illegal aliens entering our cities needs to be addressed.

The forthcoming jobs reports for the next few months will likely continue without major surprise. But it is just a matter of time before baby boomer retirements kick in. At that point, it will become clearer that the US has major problems ahead. Hopefully, our future policy makers will make these issues a top priority. The growth of our economy and the future for our children depend on it."
From Layoffs To Love Lost: Why Job Loss Can Lead To Divorce And How To Avoid It,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/elizabethpearson/2024/10/03/from-layoffs-to-love-lost-why-job-loss-can-lead-to-divorce-and-how-to-avoid-it/,2024-10-03T22:09:06Z,"You've likely seen the headlines about looming job cuts, which are leading to 70% of US workers to proactively prepare for the potential layoffs, according to a recent survey. And while it's obvious that losing your job can be stressful, what you may not realize is that job loss is ranked as one of life's most challenging experiences, so much so that some studies report losing a job can be more stressful than getting a divorce or even receiving a long-term illness diagnosis.

Beyond the financial impact of getting laid off, it can take a serious toll on emotional health, self-worth, and even personal relationships. For those who've experienced a recent layoff, it'll come as no surprise that it can affect your relationship -- what is less talked about is that job loss is linked to increased rates of divorce. This correlation is complex to say the least and involves a mix of financial, emotional, and identity-related factors that create strain on a relationship, often in ways that may act as a knock-out blow to your marriage, partnership, or romantic relationship.

For women, who juggle multiple responsibilities and face societal expectations around being a source of nurturing-stability, the impact of job loss can be feel even more intense. The last thing you want to after you've lost your job is to lose your support system too, so let's break down why it feels so apocalyptic when you get axed and what you can do to safeguard your marriage, or partnership, in the wake of its wrath.

While experiencing the end of a marriage is incredibly difficult, studies have shown that individuals tend to eventually return to their previous level of well-being after such event. If you really think about it, divorce often provides some level of closure, allowing those involved to eventually heal and move on. However, the emotional and psychological impact of losing your job may linger inevitability, and can feel even more overwhelming if you're in a specialized field or had a high-level role, which on average have fewer opportunities and take significantly longer to replace.

The uncertainty around job loss is what makes it so hard for couples to deal with. It can create a prolonged period of feeling ""stuckness,"" with no clear end in sight. So, unlike a breakup or divorce, where you may regain a sense of autonomy and direction, the helplessness that can come from searching for a new job creates an ongoing sense of instability. It's that uncertainty which causes tension and could lead to the employed partner resenting the unemployed partner for not contributing financially -- which could trigger feelings of worthlessness or failure, adding further strain on the relationship.

Set Realistic Expectations Together: Sit down with your partner to discuss a plan. Setting realistic expectations around the job search timeline, budget adjustments, and how to support each other can alleviate the anxiety of uncertainty. Aligning your expectations will help you both navigate this period without placing undue pressure on your relationship.

One of the most obvious effects of losing a job is the financial strain that comes with it, and the loss of one income can lead to an immediate sense of imbalance. When bills pile up and expenses outweigh income, a scarcity mindset can lead to arguments, resentment, and fear. Then, once that financial foundation begins to crack, it's easy for both partners to start blaming one another and when that happens, you're no longer trying to solve the problem as a team, but rather turning on one another and intensifying the tension and panic.

It may be no surprise then that debt and financial stress are of the most cited reasons for divorce, with research finding that 54% of people believe them to be valid to consider divorce -- and job loss can amplify it tenfold. The pressure to ""make ends meet"" can quickly turn into tension and conflict, with both partners feeling unsupported or misunderstood.

Create a New Financial Plan Together: Review your finances and create a new budget that reflects your current reality. Openly discussing finances can help prevent misunderstandings and resentment. This also allows you both to find ways to cut costs and avoid debt, reducing financial stress and strengthening your bond. If you have a financial advisor/planner, it's a great idea to get with them and get a true understanding on if there's any immediate need to panic, or if you have some time before you need avoid Amazon and Target like the plague.

A job is much more than a paycheck -- it often provides a sense of identity, self-worth, and purpose. For many, career success is closely tied to feelings of confidence, respect, and stability. When you lose your job, you may feel like you've lost an essential part of yourself. This is especially true in our society which places such a high value on productivity and professional achievement.

For women, whose identities are often interwoven with various roles -- professional, caregiver, partner -- job loss can feel like a personal failure, even if the circumstances were beyond their control. The loss of a job can trigger deep emotional responses, including shame, anxiety, and depression, all of which can negatively affect relationships. Some signs you might be struggling include becoming withdrawn, irritable, or overly dependent on your partner for validation. The resulting emotional strain can create distance, making it harder for your partner to connect with you. Over time, the disconnect can widen, leading to feelings of isolation and dissatisfaction for both partners.

Reconnect with Your Identity Outside of Work: To preserve your sense of self-worth, invest time in activities that bring you joy and fulfillment outside of your career. Whether it's taking up a hobby, volunteering, or spending time with friends, these pursuits can help you maintain a sense of identity and purpose, reducing the emotional toll of job loss.

Communicate Openly with Your Partner: Share your feelings about the job loss with your partner, including any fears or insecurities you have. Being vulnerable can foster empathy and understanding, helping to maintain emotional intimacy and ensuring your partner knows how to support you.

While losing your job can feel like a crisis, certain factors can help alleviate the stress and mitigate the risk of damaging your relationship. Understanding what might help can be the key to surviving this challenging period together.

Support from Family and Friends: Having a strong support network can make a significant difference and leaning on them can help reduce the pressure on your relationship by not relying solely on your partner for comfort.

Living in an Area with High Unemployment: This may sound counterintuitive, but if unemployment is high in your area, it can normalize your experience and reduce feelings of shame or inadequacy. The shared experience can help you feel less isolated and reassure both you and your partner that the situation is not a reflection of your abilities or worth.

Having an Extroverted Personality: Extroverted individuals tend to reach out for help and support more readily, which can be a crucial asset when dealing with job loss. If you're naturally inclined to seek out social connections, it can help you stay positive and motivated. For those who are more introverted, making an intentional effort to connect with others can provide similar benefits.

The loss of a job is undoubtedly a significant stressor, but it doesn't have to lead to the end of your relationship. By being proactive, communicating openly, and making decisions together, you and your partner can navigate this difficult time as a team. Remember, your worth is not determined by your employment status, and your relationship can thrive even in the face of financial or emotional challenges."
Highest-Paying Jobs Without A Degree In 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/education/student-resources/highest-paying-jobs-without-a-degree/,2024-10-03T17:38:28Z,"Wages for jobs that don't require a degree vary by location and demographics.

You don't have to graduate from college to get a job that pays well. While wages often rise based on educational attainment, workers can find many high-paying jobs that don't require a degree -- and some of those careers report six-figure median salaries.

It might seem like every high school grad heads to college these days, but the data shows that this isn't true. Nearly half of college-aged young adults aren't in school, and they find job opportunities in diverse industries such as the skilled trades, healthcare, tourism and more.

How much can you earn without a degree? And does completing some college change your job prospects, even if you don't graduate? Forbes Advisor digs into the numbers to find the highest-paying jobs without a degree--and the outlook for workers who opt out of college.

Did you know that more than half of Americans don't hold a college degree? That's according to 2022 educational attainment data from the U.S. Census Bureau. In fact, a high school diploma is the most common level of educational attainment, with 28% of adults falling into this category.

Similarly, most jobs don't require a college degree. But who are these workers without college degrees?

A majority of jobs in the U.S. don't require a college degree--and that should hold true in the future. According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) projections, 60% of new jobs created in the 2020s will be in fields that don't require a degree.

A majority of high school graduates head to college. In October 2023, 61.4% of recent high school grads attended an in-person or online college. However, a substantial number of young adults are not currently enrolled in school.

Recent high school graduates not enrolled in college in October 2023 were more than twice as likely to be in the labor force as graduates enrolled in college (71.7% versus 32.4%).

Not surprisingly, high school grads who decide not to attend college report a higher rate of employment than college students. However, the percentage of part-time college students who work is nearly as high as those not enrolled in college, with 68.9% in the workforce. High school dropouts report a significantly lower employment rate, with just 43.7% in the workforce.

The employment rate of 25- to 34-year-olds with a high school diploma but no college experience was 74% as of 2023, as reported by the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).

When it comes to careers that don't require a degree, many workers benefit from some post-high school education. And employment data reflect that: adults who attend some college but don't earn a four-year degree have a higher employment rate.

In 2023, the median annual wage for workers with a high school diploma or the equivalent was $45,040 as of 2023.

Adults with a high school diploma who didn't attend college and those with some college but no degree earn a similar median pay. However, adults with a postsecondary credential such as a certificate or diploma earn slightly more, with a median pay of $47,740.

How many students drop out of college? A significant number of first-year college students leave without finishing their programs. College dropout statistics reveal the many reasons people choose to leave college.

Nearly one in four college students drops out, and that number has remained fairly consistent since 2017. Retention rates have risen since 2006-07, when 29% of first-time undergrads did not return for their second year.

College graduation rates typically measure the number of graduates over a six year period. Looking back at 2017, nearly three in ten students left school without a degree. Many of those students entered the workforce looking for jobs that don't require a degree.

How many adults fall into the category of ""some college, no credential""? The number might be higher than you think. Nearly 42 million Americans have taken college classes but left without finishing a degree, diploma or certificate.

As the college enrollment rate grows, so does the population of adults who leave college without a degree. According to the National Student Clearinghouse Research Center (NSCRC), the number of SCNC adults has grown in nearly every state, ballooning from 36 million in 2019 to nearly 42 million in 2024.

What stops college students from finishing their programs? The cost of college poses a major barrier for many students. Close to half of those who left college before graduation day point to finances as a driving reason.

Another significant share questioned whether college was the best path for their future. Careers that do not require a degree offer another way for these adults to enter the workforce.

You don't need a master's degree to earn a six-figure salary. In fact, several careers with six-figure median salaries don't require a degree at all.

What are the highest-paying jobs without a degree? The list includes some that you might guess, like a commercial airline pilot, and others that might surprise you, like a ship engineer.

Careers that don't require a degree may still entail specialized training. Some require postsecondary training, while many come with on-the-job training.

These are the 20 best-paying jobs without a degree according to the BLS.

You can work in some of the fastest-growing careers without a degree. The BLS projects a 2.8% average growth rate for all jobs in the U.S. over the 2022-32 decade; these 10 occupations will benefit from much faster employment growth according to BLS projections.

Some of these high-demand jobs without a degree may demand a certificate or diploma, and while you don't need a bachelor's degree, some require an associate degree.

How much does educational attainment matter in different parts of the country? When comparing rural vs. urban education statistics, the data indicates a lower educational attainment rate for rural areas, and yet these workers without a degree benefit from better rural jobs than their urban counterparts.

In rural areas, 34% of adults hold a high school diploma as their highest level of education, compared with 23% for urban areas. Similarly, while 37% of urban adults hold a bachelor's or higher, that number falls to 25% in rural areas.

Georgetown University's Center on Education and the Workforce defines a ""good job"" as one that pays enough to achieve economic self-sufficiency, which is at least $43,000 a year for workers ages 25 to 44 and $55,000 for workers ages 45 to 64 (in 2022 dollars), with a median annual wage of around $82,000.

Jobs in urban areas often pay higher salaries than those in rural areas. However, that pattern does not hold for high school dropouts and those with a high school diploma who hold good-paying jobs. For those jobs, rural workers earn more than their urban counterparts, according to data from the Center of Education and the Workforce.

As of 2022, 45% of rural adults with less than a high school diploma were not in the labor force, as compared to 36% of urban adults with the same education level.

While rural adults who hold good jobs fare well in the workforce, nearly half of high school dropouts in rural areas do not work. That's 9% higher than their counterparts in cities.

When looking at well-paying jobs, researchers discovered that rural workers without a degree are more likely to hold these good jobs than urban workers with the same education level. In rural areas, 26% of adults with a high school diploma hold a good job, compared to 15% in urban areas.

Are there differences in job posting requirements by state? Some states report more jobs that don't require a degree, while others have fewer opportunities. However, a growing number of states are eliminating degree requirements for public sector jobs, reflecting a wider shift in the labor market.

While many public sector jobs require a college degree, states across the country have eliminated degree requirements in an effort to promote skills-based hiring. When comparing job posting requirements by state, the National Conference of State Legislators (NCSL) reported that at least 18 states have recently eliminated the degree requirement for most government jobs.

Those states include Maryland, California, Pennsylvania, Virginia and New Jersey. Many other states are considering changing job requirements through executive or legislative action.

More jobs require a college degree in Washington, D.C., home to the federal government, than other areas. In these locations, a lower share of jobs do not require a degree.

Which states have the most jobs that don't require a college degree or postsecondary training? Southern states like Louisiana and Arkansas make the list, along with Nevada, home to a multi-billion dollar tourism industry that provides many careers without a degree.

In 2023, the median high school diploma weekly earnings reached $899. But breaking down those workers by age, race and gender offers a more nuanced picture. For example, the average salary by age for high school graduates almost doubles for the lowest-paid and highest-paid age groups.

As high school graduates gain experience, their earning potential grows, with a peak in the top-earning years of 45 to 64. When looking at earnings by age, high school graduates also see a major jump when shifting from the 18 to 24 age range to 25 to 34 years old.

When comparing educational attainment by race, Asian Americans report the highest high school graduation rate, with 99% of Asian Americans graduating from high school. Hispanic Americans reported the lowest high school graduation rate, with 88% finishing high school.

Gender affects earning potential, and that's true for adults without a college degree. In fact, women who drop out of high school or graduate without going to college make around 20% less than men with the same education.

Men report a higher rate of labor force participation than women at all education levels, but the gap is larger for those at the lower education levels. While there's a 7.3% gap between men and women with a bachelor's or higher, that gap grows to 19.1% for high school graduates and 23.8% for high school dropouts.

For both high school dropouts and high school graduates, white women earn higher median salaries compared to other racial groups. Black and Hispanic women earn the lowest median salaries. The gap isn't large--white women with a high school diploma earn $57 more per week than Hispanic women with the same education--but it adds up.

Degree-seeking Americans benefit from many paths to reach their goals. The growing number of online programs can lower barriers to college attendance, as can the many colleges with high acceptance rates. Scholarships, grants and other forms of financial aid can make college more affordable, as can comparing schools based on total cost.

But college is not the only path to a successful career. Three in five new jobs created in the 2020s will not require a degree, and many of these careers offer strong job growth and high earning potential.

Our research on the highest-paying jobs without a degree indicates that the top 20 jobs by salary all report median annual wages of $75,000 or higher. That's significantly higher than the median annual wage for all occupations, which reached $48,060 in May 2023, according to BLS data. By seeking out careers in these higher-paying fields, adults without a degree can thrive."
How Financial Advisors Can Help Women In Business,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/investing/financial-advisor/how-financial-advisors-can-help-women-in-business/,2024-10-03T17:38:23Z,"Content from Forbes Advisor Brand Group is presented as part of a paid partnership with our advertisers.

Women in business often face unique financial challenges that complicate their professional and personal finances. Persistent gender pay gaps, disparities in access to business funding, longer life expectancies and higher healthcare costs are just a few factors that can make financial planning more complex.

Navigating all these challenges can require a comprehensive approach to financial management, including tailored investing, early retirement planning, expert tax advice and robust contingency strategies for whatever life may throw at you. With women's labor force participation reaching new highs and a projected $30 trillion wealth transfer to women by the decade's end, it has never been more important to have a strong financial plan in place.

Financial advisors can offer valuable support and guidance in this process, providing personalized strategies to help you maximize your financial potential. Here are some key areas where working with a financial advisor can be particularly beneficial for women in business.

Success in the business world can often come with increased wealth and the opportunity to invest your hard-earned money. Sixty-seven percent of women are actively investing outside of their retirement accounts, a notable increase from previous years, according to survey data from Fidelity.

However, a few common barriers still keep some women from participating in the investment market. Only 33% of women report feeling confident about investing, and 69% wish they had started earlier.

Financial advisors can help demystify the investment process and provide tailored advice based on your specific financial objectives. This might include:

Beyond just guidance, studies show advisors can significantly improve investment outcomes. An analysis from Vanguard found that investors who worked with advisors saw an average net return 3% higher than those who didn't. Working with an experienced professional can give you a sense of confidence and peace of mind, knowing that your investment strategy is being guided by expert insights.

Planning for retirement and managing an estate can be particularly complex for women due to longer life expectancies, lifetime healthcare expenses that are a third higher than those of men and any potential lost earning opportunities due to career breaks.

Financial advisors can work with you to create a personalized retirement plan that includes diverse income streams such as 401(k)s, IRAs, Social Security benefits, pensions and personal savings. They can also assist with:

Estate planning can be equally important as it determines what happens to your assets after you die. Some advisors can help you:

Career transitions are becoming increasingly common due to several factors, including longer working lives, job market uncertainty and rapid technological advancements. A study by McKinsey predicts up to 12 million occupational shifts by 2030, with women being 1.5 times more likely than men to require job transitions.

Whether you're switching industries, getting a promotion or re-entering the workforce, career transitions usually involve significant financial changes that call for careful planning. Financial advisors can help navigate these changes by providing guidance on:

As you progress in your career, your income and tax situation may become more complex. Working with a financial advisor can help you navigate the ever-changing tax laws and find ways to minimize your overall tax burden. Some areas where advisors can provide helpful insights include:

Consider seeking advice from a qualified financial advisor specializing in tax planning, such as a Chartered Financial Analyst (CFA) or Certified Financial Planner (CFP®). Companies like Datalign provide access to an extensive network of vetted advisors and can recommend a suitable advisor who can help you navigate complex tax laws and make informed decisions about your financial future.

Starting a business can involve many crucial financial decisions, from choosing the right structure and managing cash flow to securing funding -- where financial missteps can be costly.

Financial advisors can work with you to:

Searching for the right financial advisor can detract from essential day-to-day operations. Datalign's online platform can simplify this process with its personal questionnaire and AI-matching algorithm to quickly connect you with a vetted financial advisor suited to your specific needs.

Student Loan Help For Those Impacted By Hurricane Helene,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertfarrington/2024/10/03/student-loan-help-for-those-impacted-by-hurricane-helene/,2024-10-03T10:35:08Z,"With the federal student loan on-ramp over as of September 30, 2024, now is an awful time to be struggling with bills. The 12-month on-ramp period protected borrowers from the worst consequences of missed payments and defaulted loans, including potential damage to borrower's credit scores.

With this short-term fix for borrowers in the rearview mirror, this means those with late payments may soon see their credit scores drop and face other ramifications like wage garnishment and seizures of tax refunds.

Borrowers impacted by Hurricane Helene may find some relief when it comes to their student loan payments. If you are facing hardships caused by the hurricane, including displacement, a temporary loss of income, or an injury that left you unable to work, here's what your options may be.

According to Paul Dieken, who serves as Director of Financial Aid at Pomona College, current students pursuing a degree that have been impacted by the hurricane should contact their college financial aid office to see if they can appeal their offer of financial aid. Doing so may help them qualify for additional aid based on changes to their financial situation, and the school's financial aid office will likely offer assistance when it comes to the specifics of filing an appeal.

For those people who are in repayment on federal student loans, Dieken says they should contact their loan servicer and ask if they qualify for a disaster relief administrative forbearance.

According to the U.S. Department of Education, borrowers who live in a FEMA-designated disaster area may be able to qualify for a disaster relief administrative forbearance that postpones their loan payments for up to 90 days. Interest doesn't capitalize during this type of forbearance either, which means loan balances won't grow during the 90 days required payments are paused.

There are other types of forbearance for federal student loans to consider as well, including general forbearance. Borrowers can apply for a general forbearance with their loan servicer if they are facing financial complications, a job loss or loss in income, unexpected medical expenses, or other consequences of Hurricane Helene.

This type of forbearance works for Direct Loans, Federal Family Education (FFEL) Program loans, and Perkins Loans and generally lasts for up to 12 months at a time. Students can also request an extension of their general forbearance if their situation hasn't improved. However, a cumulative limit of three years applies for all months spent in general forbearance.

According to Studentaid.gov, deferment of federal student loans is another option to consider. Deferment can be a better choice since some loans (specifically subsidized student loans) do not accrue interest during deferment, whereas interest accrues during general forbearance periods.

The U.S. Department of Education lists a range of situations when deferment could apply, and one of them is ""experiencing economic hardship."" Deferment can also be achieved during periods of unemployment.

Note that you'll have to submit documentation and proof to qualify for deferment or forbearance with federal student loans. In either scenario, you'll start the process by reaching out to your loan servicer to find out how to apply and which documents you need to subit.

People who are in repayment on a private student loan should contact their lender to find out what options are available.

""Private lenders may offer their own forbearance plans, but each lender will be different, so borrowers will need to contact them to find out what is available,"" says Dieken.

For example, private student loan lender Laurel Road offers general forbearance options for economic hardship, which could apply after a major hurricane. Laurel Road doesn't share much information on what it takes to qualify, but it does say its forbearance program can give borrowers anywhere from two to 12 months to get back on track with their student loan payments.

In any case, you have nothing to lose by calling your private student loan servicer to inquire about your options. You may be able to secure several months of paused payments to give you some time to catch up, but you won't know unless you check.

If you're losing income, you've lost your home, you're currently displaced or all of the above, having to pick back up with federal student loan payments this month could be a major hardship.

You can also look into applying for one of the other income-driven repayment plans available for federal student loans (like PAYE or ICR). These plans aren't as good as SAVE, which is currently blocked by the courts, but they can help some borrowers get a lower monthly payment each month.

For the most part, options for borrowers with federal student loans start with reaching out to their loan servicer to inquire about options. This could be federal deferment or forbearance for federal student loans or a disaster relief administrative forbearance for borrowers who live in a FEMA-designated disaster area.

Individuals with private student loans can and should reach out to their private student loan company to see what options they have, if any. While private student loans don't have as many consumer protections as federal student loans, a surprising number of providers let borrowers skip monthly payments when disaster strikes."
The October Effect: What It Is And How It Is Believed To Impact The Stock Market,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/investor-hub/article/october-effect-what-it-is-impact-stock-market/,2024-10-02T20:32:04Z,"Investors are not worried about ghosts and goblins this Halloween season. They're worried about the ""October Effect"" and the spooky effect it can have on stock prices. Intrigued? Read on to find out what the October Effect is and whether you should be preparing for a portfolio scare.

What Is The October Effect?

The October Effect is a theory that stock prices decline in October. One basis for this belief is that nine of history's 20 largest single-day percentage declines in the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) happened in the Halloween month.

Beyond that data point, however, research suggests the October Effect on stocks is superstition. Analysis by Yardeni Research indicates that since 1928, the S&P 500 has gained value in October more times than it has declined. And, averaging out October performance over the past 96 years shows a slight gain.

Although the numbers do not show stock price declines in October, there is evidence of high volatility. In an interview with Money, CFRA Research's Chief Investment Strategist Sam Stovall said October is 35% more volatile than the average over the rest of the year.

History Of Stock Market Crashes In October

Four events are largely responsible for the belief that stocks dip in October. They are the Panic of 1907, the Stock Market Crash of 1929, Black Monday in 1987 and the declines related to the 2008 Financial Crisis.

The Panic of 1907

In October 1907, while the U.S. was in recession, two speculators attempted to gain an influential level of control over the stock of a copper mining company. When the attempt failed, U.S. depositors began withdrawing funds from banks and trust companies associated with those speculators.

At the time, trust companies operated alongside banks in the financial system. These institutions held deposits and provided liquidity for stock trading but were not part of the central banking system. When Knickerbocker Trust faced a liquidity shortfall due to excessive withdrawals, the New York Clearing House initially denied support to conserve resources for member institutions. Consumer panic intensified and withdrawals increased, prompting a liquidity shortage in the stock market. J.P. Morgan and a group of bankers stepped in with $23 million to keep the NYSE open and operating.

The Stock Market Crash Of 1929

The historic crash of 1929 followed a period of economic expansion earlier in the 1920s. That expansion fostered optimism, which in turn encouraged speculation and trading on margin. Unfortunately, the good times would end. Production declines, rising unemployment, high debt and low wages set the stage for an overvalued financial market that needed a steep correction.

Stock prices began falling in early October. Investor fear rose and the market went into a tailspin near month's end. Billions of shares were traded so quickly that tickers could not keep pace. The market lost 12.8% on October 28 and another 12% on October 29. The crash was followed by the Great Depression, which lasted for a decade.

Black Monday 1987

On October 19, 1987, the DJIA fell 22.6%. It was the second-largest single-day crash in stock market history. Contributing factors included:

The week before Black Monday, the U.S. financial markets softened, which stoked international panic over the weekend. Stock markets in Asia and New Zealand crashed before trading opened in the U.S. on Monday. The DJIA then fell immediately at the opening bell. Declines snowballed, fueled in part by automated liquidations.

Most of the losses incurred on Black Monday were recouped within days, and the markets fully recovered to set new highs within two years.

2008 Financial Crisis

On October 9, 2008, the DJIA fell nearly 679 points, shedding more than 7% of its value. Six days later, the index lost 733 points, declining nearly 8%.

Earlier that year, Bear Stearns and IndyMac collapsed, the U.S. Treasury took over Freddie Mac, Lehman Brothers declared bankruptcy and the U.S. government bailed out insurance company AIG. The failures were linked to the collapse of the housing market, which had bubbled due to lax lending standards and low interest rates. The Great Recession followed. The DJIA did not set new highs again until 2013.

Key Psychological Triggers

Human psychology contributes to every stock market crash, usually to extend the severity of the losses. Two common behaviors at work are loss aversion and herd instinct.

Loss Aversion

Loss aversion is a tendency to feel losses more deeply than gains. The sting of losing 10% in your portfolio's value, for example, is usually more memorable than the buzz of gaining 10%.

Loss aversion can prompt investors to take extreme, sometimes illogical measures to protect their wealth. As stocks lose value, for example, many investors liquidate. The liquidation, however, does not prevent a loss -- it creates one. Given that every stock market crash in history has reversed, waiting for that reversal is usually the better approach. But time and time again, investors cannot resist the urge to sell their holdings because they fear greater losses.

Herd Instinct

Herd instinct is the compulsion to mimic the behaviors of the majority. It drives investors to buy growth stocks when markets are strong and sell when markets are weak. This behavior can cause individual stocks, industries or the entire market to become overvalued or undervalued. On a more granular level, following the masses often leads to buying high and selling low, which works directly against the pursuit of investment gains.

Is The October Effect Still Real In Modern Times?

Yardeni Research has addressed the October Effect with an analysis of monthly S&P 500 performance between 1928 and 2024. Key conclusions from that analysis are:

In short, the theory that stocks lose value in October is an oversimplification of financial market behavior. While major crashes have occurred in October, the more common experience is that stock prices rise throughout the month -- albeit with a tendency towards volatility.

Common Misconceptions About The October Effect

One common misconception about the October Effect is that stocks always decline in October. They do not.

It is important to recognize that any lasting market correction or volatility is usually linked to a chain of events that began months or years earlier. The Panic of 1907 had a shorter runway but also led to protective financial reforms, including the creation of the U.S. Federal Reserve System.

In the modern era, major market declines should deliver warning signs well in advance. This does not mean crashes are preventable, of course. The human tendencies of loss aversion and herd instinct alongside an increasingly interconnected and complex global financial ecosystem will always produce cycles of optimism and pessimism. Optimism OP fuels overvaluation, which inevitably creates the possibility for corrections.

October Versus Other Volatile Months

According to the Yardeni Research data, three months of the year have averaged stock market declines since 1928. They are February, May and September.

Compared to the months that averaged gains, October's performance is the lowest. March follows with an average gain of 0.60% and August shows an average gain of 0.64%.

The months with the highest historical averages are July, April and December. They show gains of 1.70%, 1.32% and 1.31%, respectively. Note that July's historic strength defies another calendar-based investing theory referred to as ""Sell in May and go away."" The phrase refers to the unfounded belief that stocks routinely underperform in the summer months.

How To Handle Stock Market Fear

Fear can push even the savviest of investors to make regrettable decisions. For that reason, it is wise to have a plan for managing emotions when the market turns sour. You can take proactive and reactive measures here. Proactively, you might rethink and reaffirm your investment strategy. And reactively, you can adopt practical habits to keep your head level.

First, decide how much risk you can handle and adjust your portfolio accordingly. For stock ideas, see our list of best stocks of 2024. If you have never experienced a big market correction, be conservative in your self-reflection. The practical reality of a 30% wealth decline is more distressing than you might expect.

Next, think through your plan for bear markets. Unless you are trading heavily, the simplest and most reliable approach is to do nothing. Stay in the market, wait for the correction to run its course and be ready for recovery gains on the other side.

Finally, plan on managing your stress level when the inevitable correction appears. You might avoid reading financial headlines and temporarily ban yourself from logging into your portfolio account, for example.

Bottom Line

Some investors believe stocks lose value in October, but the theory is not supported by data. What the data does show is the potential for higher volatility in fall's first full month. Now is a good time to verify your holdings align with your risk tolerance. After that, there's nothing more to do but stay calm and stick to your strategy.

The Great Detachment: Why Workers Are Disengaging From Their Jobs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lucianapaulise/2024/10/02/the-great-detachment-why-workers-are-disengaging-from-their-jobs/,2024-10-02T15:09:27Z,"There is a new workplace phenomenon known as ""The Great Detachment"" that is affecting today's workforce. Younger employees are experiencing increased job dissatisfaction, disengagement, and burnout, and many feel stuck in roles that do not inspire them. Despite their desire to leave, they often feel trapped due to intense competition in the job market. This rising trend is reshaping how we understand workplace engagement and the mental health of employees, particularly among Gen Z and Millennials.

The Great Detachment refers to the increasing number of younger workers who are mentally and emotionally disengaging from their jobs. Unlike the Great Resignation, where employees actively quit in search of better opportunities, those experiencing detachment feel disconnected yet constrained from leaving due to financial pressures, a competitive job market, or a lack of desirable alternatives.

Detachment is a coping mechanism that helps individuals manage stress or discomfort when they cannot change or escape a difficult situation. It involves mentally distancing oneself from emotional triggers or stressors. It can offer temporary relief.

1) Burnout and Overwork. Many employees are experiencing increased workloads and unrealistic expectations due to layoffs and company restructuring, so they feel exhausted and emotionally drained, and fearful to say NO.

2) Lack of Meaningful Work: Some workers may feel the urge to do something more meaningful and connected with their values, but they are often met with repetitive tasks or find that their contributions don't matter.

3) Economic Constraints: While many would prefer to switch roles or pursue further education, they are limited by student debt, high cost of living, or fear of unemployment.

This growing disengagement has serious consequences, both for companies and employees.

In an interview with Dr. John Scott, Head of Learning and Design of MasterClass at Work, he shared that ""For the average full-time worker, roughly a third of their weekly waking hours are spent at work. When employees feel disengaged from work, a significant part of their lives is unfulfilling and lacking meaning. Work plays a critical role in the overall well-being of people, from the relationships people form with others to their overall sense of purpose. Feeling disengaged from work, therefore has ripple effects across society overall, where people generally feel more unhappy and more isolated in their lives. When people are unhappy, when they feel unfulfilled and unmotivated, ultimately their performance at work is going to suffer, which will also inevitably impact the bottom line of the business.""

Detachment affects productivity, innovation, and overall job satisfaction. Companies with high levels of disengaged employees often suffer from low morale, higher turnover rates, and decreased output. For younger workers, the longer they stay detached, the more likely they are to experience burnout, anxiety and imposter syndrome.

Scott emphasizes the importance of remote workers engaging in authentic and meaningful conversations with someone they trust and respect. ""An employee may find such a connection through an ERG, cross-functional collaboration, or other informal socializing opportunities"".

As a coach I have seen how just talking about how they feel with someone like a coach or a peer, help them cope better. It's important for people to think about what they truly want and take small steps to get there in order to increase their motivation. It's not about resigning or looking for new jobs, but rather about considering the type of role they would like to have, the skills they want to develop, or the hobbies to which they want to dedicate more time. It is important for them to get help to focus on what can be controlled instead of being consumed by negative emotions.

Scott highlights that for leaders, ""it's crucial to establish clear expectations and goals with an employee, provide the necessary support structures, and then grant them the autonomy to execute"". Instead of reacting to disengagement with micromanagement, it's better to put people in a position where they can maximize their unique talents, which is a more effective way to engage them at work.

For organizations, learning and development opportunities are a great way to increase employee engagement. When employees feel like they are learning and developing critical skills, they will feel more confident and feel like they connect more with the company's values. Companies can also offer more support in mental health issues, like coaching opportunities at all levels, not only for executives. Another important ask is flexible work models.

The Great Detachment poses significant challenges for both employees and employers. For companies to thrive, they must address the root causes of disengagement, fostering environments that support mental health, meaningful work, and flexibility. Younger workers need to feel empowered, supported, and aligned with their roles to remain engaged. As the workforce continues to evolve, the companies that successfully navigate this trend will not only retain top talent but also create a thriving, purpose-driven workforce."
The Future Of Work: New Skills For Thriving In The AI-Driven Economy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyrubin/2024/10/02/the-future-of-work-new-skills-for-thriving-in-the-ai-driven-economy/,2024-10-02T04:16:38Z,"With insights from Shea Gopaul, John Frankel, Matt Greenfield, Kamal Mistry, Reza Safai, and Nick Bostrom

The IMF predicts that AI will affect 40% of global jobs, either through replacement or complementing human roles. Despite the potential disruption, AI is opening doors to new opportunities in STEM, healthcare, finance, entertainment, manufacturing and energy. The key challenge now is how governments, businesses, and educational institutions can collaborate to ensure that workers are prepared for this fast-evolving landscape.

Addressing the Global Skills Crisis

AI's global impact presents both opportunities and challenges, particularly in developing regions. Shea Gopaul, IOE Permanent Representative to the UN, highlights the global ""skills crisis,"" compounded by 2.6 billion people lacking internet connectivity, which exacerbates the digital divide.

Gopaul stresses that ""more action is needed."" The private sector must play a pivotal role in advancing internet connectivity, governance, and digital literacy. ""We need to foster trust and adopt a human-centric approach,"" she asserts.

Public-Private Partnerships as a Solution

Gopaul highlights the power of partnerships in addressing the skills gap. ""Apprenticeships, one of the oldest forms of collaboration, align education with current labor market needs,"" she says. Through initiatives like the Global Apprenticeship Network (GAN), businesses, governments, and institutions can reskill and upskill workers to meet evolving industry demands. ""Collaboration between the public and private sectors has never been more crucial.""

Future-Ready Skills for AI-Driven Industries

Gopaul underscores the role of multinational corporations in preparing workers for AI-driven industries through training in Generative AI and enhancing human skills like adaptability and collaboration. ""It won't be AI taking jobs; it will be people with AI skills,"" she explains. Job creation and AI skills development are paramount if we are to eliminate poverty.

Ensuring Compliance and Governance in AI-Powered Industries

AI is helping streamline tasks in industries like finance, such as risk monitoring and compliance reporting. While automation increases efficiency, human oversight remains crucial to ensure regulatory standards are upheld. Businesses must balance automation and human judgment to innovate responsibly and navigate legal and ethical challenges.

Opportunities in AI-Driven Sectors

John Frankel, founder of ff Venture Capital, highlights a shift in focus: ""The conversation has moved from being an AI startup to how any startup integrates AI processes to reduce costs and scale efficiently. The challenge for existing businesses is that new ones automatically start with AI processes -- such as ad generation, sales automation, code development, and quality assurance.""

On job loss, Frankel notes: ""The Luddite perspective that technology destroys jobs is very seductive, as the jobs lost are easier to grasp than those gained. But look where we are: tight unemployment in a deeply technological society."" He adds, ""Robotics and advanced AI applications will create jobs in areas that are harder to see, but the technology should be embraced, not rejected.""

Looking ahead, Frankel foresees major developments: ""There will be a huge increase in the deployment of technology into US manufacturing and energy sectors, creating massive efficiencies and many new jobs. The economy will be better for this.""

Innovating with AI in Immersive Storytelling

AI's impact on the entertainment industry is a clear example of how it is reshaping jobs and required skills. Volumetric video, which captures performances in 3D, is being transformed by AI to expand its applications and lower production costs. According to Kamal Mistry, ""AI enables us to capture volumetric video in more varied environments, opening up entire genres such as concerts, sports, and even training scenarios."" This shift is creating new career opportunities in content creation and interactive media.

AI-Driven Innovation: Merging Creativity with Technology

Reza Safai, filmmaker, actor, and founder of MASSIVE, highlights that creativity will remain indispensable in an AI-driven future. While AI can assist in the creative process, Safai emphasizes that pushing boundaries will still depend on human insight and innovation. ""The skills that will keep you relevant in the future aren't purely technical,"" he explains. ""It's about learning to think differently, to see possibilities where others see limitations.""

Educating Tomorrow's Workforce for AI-Driven Industries

As industries like entertainment continue to evolve with AI, preparing the workforce must start with education. Matt Greenfield, managing partner of an education-focused venture capital firm, stresses the need for educational systems to adapt. ""Schools need to figure out how to help students productively use AI in group projects. In our jobs, we will all be refining our work in iterative processes incorporating insights from multiple AI models and multiple humans.""

Greenfield emphasizes that the most critical skills for tomorrow's workforce won't just be technical but human-centered. ""The most important skills for most workers will be non-technical: the ability to ask catalytic questions, empathize, lead, solve multidisciplinary problems, and unlearn when they have been wrong.""

Next Steps: Preparing for the AI-Driven Workforce

To ensure a smooth transition into the AI-driven future of work, all stakeholders must take active roles in shaping how industries adapt and evolve. Here are actionable steps to consider:

The path to the future of work lies not just in mastering the technologies that will shape industries but in fostering the human-centered skills that will enable workers to thrive alongside AI. Creativity, empathy, critical thinking, and ethical decision-making are the qualities that will set professionals apart in the AI-augmented workforce.

As Nick Bostrom puts it, ""The future is big enough for both humans and digital minds to flourish, but we must work hard to ensure that relations between them remain friendly."" By embracing AI's advances while maintaining ethical oversight and fostering human-centered skills, we ensure that AI serves as a tool for empowerment, not disruption."
Loan-Outs Live!,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/schuylermoore/2024/10/01/loan-outs-live/,2024-10-01T23:55:57Z,"On September 30, 2024, California passed legislation enshrining the sanctity of certain loan-out companies (""loan-outs"") in the motion picture industry, which now avoids the risk for California tax and unemployment purposes of (a) qualifying loan-outs being disregarded and (b) the individuals rendering services through the loan-outs being treated as the employees of the ultimate payors. The legislation states that it is merely clarifying current law, so it is effectively retroactive. This article provides a summary of the legislation, with some critical extrapolation.

1. Definition of Loan-Out. To be respected under the legislation, loan-outs must meet all of the following tests:

a. The loan-outs must be corporations for tax purposes, including S corporations and LLCs that have elected to be taxed as corporations. There is no requirement that the loan-outs be formed or registered in California.

b. The principal activity of the loan-outs must be the rendition of services to companies that are engaged in the development or production of audio-visual works of any type (including commercials, music videos, and TV shows), referred to in this article as ""production companies."" However, companies that only distribute audio-visual works do not qualify as production companies.

c. Critically, there appears to be an unstated implied requirement that the loan-outs provide services relating to the development or production of audio-visual works, which is the standard practice in the film industry. However, the literal wording of the legislation leads to absurd results. For example, the legislation applies the ""production company"" test based on each ""employing unit,"" which includes a company and all its subsidiaries and affiliates that are operationally integrated, and the test is not based on the primary activity of the employing unit. Thus, as long as the employing unit engages in some development or production activities, that employing unit should qualify as a ""production company,"" even with respect to unrelated divisions, like a food court. To make matters worse, there is no express requirement that the loan-outs provide development or production services, so the legislation would literally permit a full-time employee in the food court of a studio to use a loan-out. This result is obviously absurd, which is why there must be an implied requirement that the loan-outs provide development or production services.

d. The services the loan-out provides to production companies must be performed by employees of the loan-out that own at least 10% of the stock of the loan-out, referred to herein as ""shareholder/employees."" What is somewhat odd about this test is that if the employees own less than 10% of the stock of the company rendering services, that company would almost certainly be respected as an independent contractor under general principles.

2. Consequences. The consequences of loan-outs being respected are as follows:

a. The companies paying the loan-outs (whether production companies or payroll companies) do not need to withhold any California income or payroll taxes.

b. The loan-outs are required to withhold California income and payroll taxes on compensation paid to their shareholder/employees, including unemployment insurance taxes. This requirement does not apply to dividends, and many S corporations pay dividends (after the payment of ""reasonable"" compensation) to minimize payroll taxes.

c. The shareholder/employees qualify for unemployment benefits.

3. Payroll Companies. In order to enforce the obligation of loan-outs to withhold California taxes on compensation paid to their employees, the legislation leans heavily on payroll companies, and requires them to file quarterly reports with the state setting out the details of payments to loan-outs commencing in 2026. Importantly, the reports must include the name, address, and social security number of the employees rendering the related services.

4. Federal Treatment. Another reason to interpret the reach of the California legislation as limited to loan-outs that provide development or production services is that the IRS has quietly acquiesced to the use of loan-outs for development and production of audio-visual works, perhaps due to the perceived unfairness of the inability of employees to deduct fees paid to managers, agents, and lawyers, while loan-outs can. However, the IRS has never permitted executives and rank and file employees to use loan-outs. One fuzzy area has been the use of loan-outs by below-the-line crew, and the new legislation may expand the use of such loan-outs, although it is not clear if the IRS will accept it."
What To Expect For Interest Rates From The November Fed Meeting,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonmoore/2024/10/01/what-to-expect-for-interest-rates-from-the-november-fed-meeting/,2024-10-01T06:52:00Z,"On November 7, the Federal Open Market Committee is expected to again lower interest rates after an initial cut on September 18. Markets currently expect a 0.25% reduction in interest rates to 4.5% to 4.75%. However, a larger 0.5% reduction is possible depending on reported economic data over the coming weeks.

The FOMC will meet November 6-7 announcing its interest rate decision at 2pm E.T. on November 7. It is slightly unusual that the decision will be announced on a Thursday rather than the typical Wednesday. This will be followed by a press conference with Fed Chair Jerome Powell at 2:30pm. Economic projections are released at every other meeting, and were last updated on September 18, so they will not be updated at the November FOMC meeting. Minutes of the meeting, offering greater color on the decision making process, are then typically scheduled to be released 3 weeks later.

The FOMC is currently appears to be dialing back restrictive monetary policy as inflation is now clearly within sight of their 2% target, and the labor market has seen broadly rising unemployment over the past 12 months, albeit from low levels.

The Personal Consumption Expenditures Price Index showed 2.2% annual inflation to August 2024, or 2.7% with food and energy price trends excluded. That's down significantly from the peak levels of 7% in summer 2022, which prompted the FOMC to raise rates aggressively. In addition, even at the best of times, the FOMC has been unable to hold inflation precisely at 2%. As such, deviations of around one percent from target are historically quite typical.

The unemployment rate is 4.2% for August 2024. That's up from around 3.5% for much of last year. Unemployment still remains at low levels by historical standards and the FOMC has expressed confidence in the job market, seeing a return to greater balance, rather than the start of ongoing weakening. Nonetheless, even relatively small rises in unemployment have often bought recessions historically.

As Powell said on September 18. ""We know that it is time to recalibrate our policy to something that is more appropriate given the progress on inflation and on employment moving to a more sustainable level. So the balance of risks are now even.""

As always the FOMC will watch incoming data closely before their next meeting. Perhaps the most significant of many reports will be two jobs reports on October 4 and November 1. Here the FOMC is generally comfortable with some cooling in the jobs market, but is looking to avoid a more abrupt rise in unemployment that could signal a recession.

For inflation, key data points will come with the Consumer Price Index for September on October 10, and the PCE inflation release also for September on October 31. The broad expectation here is that inflation should continue to trend toward 2% and won't bring cause for alarm. However, jobs data may prove more significant in shaping the FOMC's thinking. If there is a further rise in unemployment, then the FOMC may be prompted to make larger interest rate cuts to counter recession risk.

It is highly likely that short-term interest rates are cut again on November 7, according to fixed income markets. Yet, it is unclear how large the cut will be, with a 0.25% cut viewed as more likely than 0.5%. However, there's ample time for that to change. More fundamentally, markets are assessing how low interest rates will ultimately go. Currently, short-term interest rates could be around 3% by late 2025, but markets project a broad range of outcomes, implying that anything from 2% to 4% is possible."
