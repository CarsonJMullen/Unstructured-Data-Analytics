Opinion | How Israel's invasion of Lebanon could spiral into a massive regional war,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-lebanon-war-iran-hezbollah-biden-rcna173364,2024-10-04T16:30:43Z,"An expert explains why Israel's intensifying war on Hezbollah is risky for the region.

Israel moved military forces into southern Lebanese territory Monday, an invasion that marks a major new level of intensity in about a year of conflict with Hezbollah. The paramilitary organization fired rockets at Israeli positions in the Shebaa Farms the day after Oct. 7 ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people after Hamas' attacks on Israel. (That area is a disputed territory which Lebanon and Syria say belongs to Lebanon, and Israel controls and says belongs to Syria.) Hezbollah, sometimes called a state within a state, is backed by Iran and does not have widespread support in Lebanon.

Then Tuesday, Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, citing last week's assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and, this summer, the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

The Biden administration has long opposed an Israeli incursion into Lebanon. But in the past year, the administration has also been unwilling to take any meaningful steps to rein in Israel's behavior, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acting boldly to assert more dominance in the region and degrade Israel's adversaries -- with a continued disregard for civilian lives. Israeli airstrikes have struck medical facilities and already killed hundreds of civilians in Lebanon. The probability of a regional war seems to be growing by the day.

To better understand the unfolding conflict, I called Nick Blanford, a Beirut-based fellow at the Atlantic Council and the author of ""Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel.""

Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Zeeshan Aleem: What is happening right now and how do we know when to say whether this is a new war?

Nicholas Blanford: I think you have to put the developments of the last few weeks into some context. One day after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Hezbollah staged a pro forma attack against Israeli positions along the Lebanon-Israel border, and it dedicated this attack to its allies -- Hamas in Gaza. But very quickly it turned into a kind of a tit-for-tat, daily attacks. The Hezbollah guys would attack Israeli military positions along the border; the Israelis would retaliate with artillery fire airstrikes into south Lebanon. And this really continued from October almost uninterrupted.

There was a clear moment in September when Israel's patience ran out. And they escalated in a very dramatic fashion, by detonating thousands of pagers which they'd been able, apparently, to booby trap. The following day, they detonated hundreds of walkie-talkies. That was followed up by intense airstrikes across areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a presence. And those attacks have intensified over the past two weeks, climaxing on Sept. 27 with the massive airstrike on Hezbollah's underground headquarters in south Beirut, which killed the veteran Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who has led the group for 32 years. The latest development is the advance of some elite Israeli army units into southern Lebanon where they have reportedly already taken some casualties.

So I would say we are in a war but it is not yet full scale. Both sides are mainly hitting military targets, not infrastructure as well, although hundreds of civilians have been killed in Lebanon.

Could you give us a brief primer on Hezbollah? How it emerged, what it is, what it believes in and its social function in Lebanon?

Blanford: Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organization that follows the Iranian, theocratic system of rule. Hezbollah has a secretary general -- most recently the late Nasrallah -- but the true leader of Hezbollah is the spiritual leader of Iran, currently, Ali Khamenei. He's the ultimate authority and, in general, the Iranians will set the strategic agenda.

Hezbollah emerged after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to kick out the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was deployed in strength in south Lebanon. The Israelis in '82 reached all the way to Beirut and then they gradually withdrew. By 1985, they were occupying a border strip along the Lebanon-Israel border and Hezbollah became the main resistance force against that Israeli occupation. Particularly during the 1990s, Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran but also supported by neighboring Syria, was able to deal blow after blow to the Israeli occupation forces, and that culminated in May 2000 with Israel pulling out of south Lebanon.

Hezbollah refused to put down its arms after the Israelis left. They said, 'We need to keep our arms, our military force, to deter Israel from coming back into south Lebanon.' But there was also another unspoken reason, which is that Hezbollah gradually became a source of deterrence for Iran -- especially after the war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 when it expanded very quickly and acquired a great deal of weaponry from Iran, Syria and elsewhere. So, for Iran, Hezbollah has now become a major force multiplier.

Hezbollah has a slightly schizophrenic character, because it is ideologically beholden to the Islamic leadership of Iran, but of course it is a Lebanese organization. It survives or falls depending on the support it gets from the Lebanese Shia community, which is why, since the beginning, Hezbollah has invested a lot in social welfare organizations.

The Shia population of Lebanon tends to be traditionally fairly downtrodden. They live in the poorer areas of the country, traditionally neglected by central governments. And Hezbollah really stepped in with schools, with hospitals, with repairing war damaged houses, even things like helping farmers with agricultural aid. It's become an indispensable organization for the Lebanese Shia community. So they've been able to maintain that support since the early 1980s.

Other communities: the Christians and Sunnis, in particular, the Druze, to an extent, [say] 'Well, hang on a minute. We do have a national army. Why do we need a Shia militia, armed to the teeth, stronger than many armies around the world, to defend Lebanon?' So there have been growing calls for Hezbollah to disarm, and this is why Hezbollah has moved deeper into Lebanese politics, particularly over the last 19 years, since the 2005 parliamentary elections.

What are the fundamental dynamics driving how Hezbollah and Israel's government see each other, both in terms of geopolitical interests and domestic political interests?

Blanford: Ideologically, Hezbollah and Iran want to see the end of Israel, and the restitution of Palestine to the Palestinians. They have in the past assisted Palestinians during the Al Aqsa Intifada. They would help the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza fight the Israelis. But in the past, they didn't get directly involved. When they kicked the Israelis out of Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah didn't immediately rush across the border into Israel and say, ""We're going to go and liberate Jerusalem now."" There's an acknowledgment that it's up to the Palestinians to liberate themselves, but Hezbollah is definitely there to help.

When you look at it more realistically, the reason why Hezbollah is so powerful now is because the Iranians want them to be. We go back to this notion of Hezbollah forming a key role in Iran's deterrence architecture: The stronger Hezbollah becomes, the safer Iran feels.

The Institute for National Security Studies, a leading think tank in Israel, has for the past few years described Hezbollah as Israel's greatest threat, which is quite remarkable in itself, because we're not talking about a country, we're talking about an organization, albeit one that is backed by a powerful regional country.

The Israelis have watched Hezbollah grow stronger and stronger. What the Israelis are doing now is something they haven't dared to do before, and that is to really go for broke with Hezbollah. What's interesting is I think the Israelis are gambling that Hezbollah and the Iranians do not want a full-scale war with Israel right now. Why? Because if there is a full-scale war, whatever the outcome, Hezbollah will take a huge battering, as indeed we're seeing now, and there's no guarantee that Hezbollah will be able to rebuild, rearm and re-equip as quickly as it did after the 2006 war to continue serving as a deterrence for Iran. In other words, if Hezbollah gets engaged in a full-scale war now, Iran could lose its major deterrence factor in that war, and all this would be for the sake of coming to the support of Hamas in Gaza. Hamas is small fry compared to Hezbollah -- Hezbollah is much, much, much more important to Iran than Hamas. Which is why Hezbollah is still acting with a certain amount of restraint despite Israel's escalated action against it. Hezbollah still has not used its arsenal of precision-guided missiles.

It's a dangerous gamble. It could go wrong. Especially now that Israeli troops are operating on the ground in south Lebanon, Hezbollah's home turf. The current conflict could spill into a major war. We're still below that threshold moment, but if it happens, it has a potential to go regional, dragging in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Can you walk us through the different scenarios you see unfolding here?

Blanford: The least likely one is that a cease-fire comes in. The Americans and the French had an idea for a 21-day cease-fire to calm things down along the Lebanon-Israel border. Netanyahu has rejected it. So that's not going to happen..

A second scenario is that what we're seeing now continues. The Israelis haven't started hitting Lebanese infrastructure, power stations, bridges, roads, the airports, seaports; they are focusing on Hezbollah military targets by using air power and now ground forces, albeit in a limited manner. Hezbollah, by the same token, is striking back at Israeli military targets. They haven't been hitting Israeli infrastructure. Now this could go on even at this heightened rate. But under current circumstances, I suspect that Hezbollah will continue doing what it's doing -- in other words, absorb these blows that the Israelis have inflicted, and keep firing rockets into Israel.

In some respects, the Israeli ground maneuver could play right into Hezbollah's hands, as the Israelis are entering terrain that Hezbollah has had for 18 years [and Hezbollah has been able] to prepare for exactly this eventuality. When the Israelis did move into Lebanon in 2006 after two weeks of aerial bombing, they came in for a big surprise. They didn't understand Hezbollah's underground bunker networks, its ambush positions, firing positions.

You could have a similar scenario this time round, albeit on a larger scale, where the Israelis, who have a better understanding of what Hezbollah is about these days, could come in in force for what they would describe perhaps as a limited incursion to basically rubble-ize and depopulate this broad strip of south Lebanon. But they risk losing a lot of troops because they're going to be operating in Hezbollah's environment. And at the end of it, if the mission is successful, what do you do then? Do you reoccupy south Lebanon? If so, you've gone back to the situation between 1978 and 2000 and that didn't end too well for the Israelis. But if you pull back to the border, then what is to stop Hezbollah basically moving back into the border district and beginning to rebuild?

There could come a point when the Israelis say, 'We've hit all the targets from the air and our soldiers are fighting on the ground but Hezbollah is still firing rockets across the border.' And this is where perhaps a third scenario can kick in: The Israelis conclude that, well, we're going to have to escalate this even further by deploying a larger number of troops into Lebanon to expand the target set to include Lebanese infrastructure as well. It could be at that point that Hezbollah, with Iranian blessing, feels it has no choice but to launch its precision-guided systems at Israeli military and infrastructure targets. This is where the conflict could go regional.

What role does the U.S. have in all this, and what advice would you give to the Biden administration on how to prevent a full-scale regional war from breaking out?

Blanford: Yes, a regional war potentially could happen. If the Iranians assess that Hezbollah is about to get bludgeoned by Israel, they may conclude, 'We've got nothing left to lose. We're about to lose Hezbollah. Let's go large. We'll activate all our proxies across the region, and we'll give it a go and see what happens to Israel.'

I think the Biden administration is in a difficult position. President Biden is enormously frustrated with Netanyahu, partly because of the Gaza conflict going on for so long. But he has been urging Netanyahu since the get-go to not open a second front with Hezbollah. Now you could argue that a second front was open anyway, because of these simmering tit-for-tat attacks that have been going on across the Lebanon-Israel border since October. But these attacks were containable. Hezbollah has said, 'Look, this is a support front that we're doing. Once the war in Gaza ends, we're going to stop.' So the emphasis has been very much on trying to conclude a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which will then have a trickle-down effect and should stabilize the Lebanon-Israel border. But of course, we haven't had a Gaza cease-fire. The conflict continues, and now the Israelis clearly have lost patience with Hezbollah and have gone large.

There's very little that the Biden administration feels it can do, particularly when you've got a very close election coming up in just over a month now. So the Biden administration could do what it's done before, and then suspend arms shipments to Israel, but this time do it properly. Cut off all military support to Israel. That would put a lot of pressure on Netanyahu to start picking up the phone and listening when Biden calls. But I don't think they're going to do that because there'll be a political backlash in the United States, and that could affect Kamala Harris' chances against Donald Trump. I think Netanyahu is taking advantage of this and is going for it."
Suspended Cornell student faces a potential exit from U.S. after pro-Palestinian demonstration,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/cornell-suspended-student-visa-israel-protest-boeing-rcna173914,2024-10-03T21:33:28Z,"International doctoral student Momodou Taal could lose his F-1 visa after he was suspended a second time by his university over his role in a protest against companies that provide weapons to Israel.

Cornell University student Momodou Taal fears he may have to leave the U.S. following his involvement in a pro-Palestinian demonstration last month.

Taal, an international doctoral student from the United Kingdom, teaches a course called ""What Is Blackness?"" at Cornell and has been active in pro-Palestinian advocacy on campus.

But under a new -- and controversial -- university policy governing protests, Taal was one of four students suspended in April after he participated in a pro-Palestinian encampment. And two weeks ago, he joined more than 100 demonstrators at a campus career fair in protest of Boeing and L3Harris being allowed to participate. The two defense contractors have been criticized for providing weapons to Israel.

Taal admits that he joined a crowd of people who entered the career fair, but says that he left after five minutes. Some of the activists reportedly confronted Boeing representatives at the fair.

The university released a statement condemning the demonstration, writing in part:

A university official overseeing student conduct informed Taal in an email last week that he had been suspended again -- after his purported display of ""escalating, egregious behavior and a disregard for the University policies"" -- and was given a no-trespass order that bars him from campus. The official also told Taal that his F-1 student visa would be terminated, which can happen to foreign students who are suspended multiple times, and referred him to an immigration adviser.

Taal alleges that he has been targeted because he is Black and Muslim. The university's interim president, Michael Kotlikoff, has denied any targeting. In a statement Monday, Kotlikoff said that nearly 20 participants in the career fair protest had been identfied and added:

Taal has been granted two shots at appeal. The first -- to Cornell's vice president for student and campus life -- was denied. The second -- to the university provost -- is under review.

In an interview with The ReidOut Blog, Taal said his Black identity has inspired his activism.

""When I think of the best of the Black radical tradition, it always has centered movements in America and beyond,"" he said. ""Wherever they perceive injustice, I have found Black figures at the forefront. Many of the Black figures that I study, they also focus and spoke about Palestine as well in their time.""

Taal, who counts Malcolm X as one of his inspirations, said his situation is indicative of a broader crackdown on free speech on college campuses. And as he awaits word on his appeal and potentially imminent removal from the country, Taal has received an outpouring of liberal support -- including from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

Taal's destiny is in the hands of the university at this point. And an email he received from his immigration adviser last week warned him that things could move quickly if his appeal is denied.

""There is no grace period for departure from the US once your F-1 record is closed,"" the adviser wrote. ""You should leave either before the end date of your F-1 record or right away after the record is closed."""
Anti-Israel protesters pitch encampment outside Jewish Democrat's Ohio home,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-war-gaza-hamas-anniversary-ohio-greg-landsman-protest-israel-biden-c89db986dbfdb82e22205375dbec3778,2024-10-07T16:26:29Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Masked anti-Israel demonstrators escalated their harassment of a Jewish congressman on the eve of Monday's anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, pitching an encampment outside Ohio Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman 's Cincinnati residence.

Landsman said Monday that the protesters arrived outside his home early Sunday. By evening, they set up tents, cots and sleeping bags in the road and spent the night harassing him and his family members, forcing them to secure a police escort in order to enter and exit safely, the congressman said.

""On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the October 7th terror attacks, when Jews were brutally murdered and kidnapped, these people came to the home of a Jewish family at night, dressed in all black and fully masked,"" Landsman said in a statement. He said that he and his daughter would be forced to navigate the encampment in order to attend an Oct. 7 service later Monday.

The group, Midwest Direct Action 4 Pali!, shared a video of the demonstration on Instagram. The video showed masked participants in black marching down the street in front of Landsman's home. Their faces were obscured as they carried white bundles that resembled shrouded bodies and brandished banners representing the numbers in the death toll. The group remained on site Monday, Landman's office said.

""On the eve of the one year mark since the beginning of the genocide in Palestine, local activists in Cincinnati have gathered outside Congressman Greg Landsman's house to denounce his votes to conceal the death toll and continue funding mass murder in Gaza,"" the group said in its post. ""We mark in solemn vigil that we will not rest until the genocide is over and Palestine is free.""

It's not the first time Landsman and his district have been targeted since the conflict began. Just a month into the conflict, protestors placed a poster outside a building near Landsman's district office with his photo and the phrase ""This Ken supports genocide,"" alongside other inflammatory language.

In July, Landsman toured the Covedale Cemetery Complex in Cincinnati, where 176 Jewish gravestones had been toppled."
Vandals deface a mural in Italy depicting a survivor of Oct. 7 attack,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/italy-antisemitism-mural-oct7-bbdeecda5a9f98498a9c3ffbebd371fc,2024-10-07T15:43:00Z,"MILAN (AP) -- The vandalism Monday of a mural depicting a survivor of last year's Oct. 7 Hamas attacks that killed some 1,200 people in Israel is an example of rising antisemitism in Italy over the last year, according to the Antisemitism Observatory in Milan.

Incidence of antisemitism has increased to about 80 or 90 a week in the last year, from about 30 a week before, said Stefano Gatti, a researcher at the observatory. He called the increase ""overpowering.""

""While before October 7, the incidents were mostly on internet websites, now they consist of acts in the real world,'' he said. ""Antisemitism has also become more socially acceptable.""

It includes graffiti, insults, acts of intimidation and aggression that so far have not translated into cases of bodily harm. He cited one incident during which a rabbi was followed in the port city of Genoa by someone brandishing a screwdriver; and another incident when a restaurant owner casually told a pair of diners he did not realize were Jewish that Hitler was right for seeking to wipe out Europe's Jews.

""We have not seen a situation like this since 1945,"" Gatti said, citing the end of World War II and the Nazi Holocaust that killed 6 million European Jews. ""Not even in 1982,"" during Lebanon's war when Israel invaded southern Lebanon. He said local mayors and university officials have not been clear in their condemnation of such events, ""which has helped the phenomenon grow.""

The mural vandalized on Monday, ""October 7th, Escape"" by AleXsandro Palombo, depicted Vlada Patapov escaping the Hamas attack. Vandals erased the figure's head and legs from the mural near Milan's state university.

Palombo said in a statement that whoever ""decapitated"" the image ""is not fighting for the liberation of Palestine. These extremist movements that are increasingly radicalizing our society have the sole purpose of defending terrorist belief in our Western democracy.""

The artist said that images of the Hamas massacre ""have been removed from the collective memory too soon, and instead need to be circulated more until they are imprinted and become a warning against the threat of Islamist terrorism and religious fundamentalism."""
CBS host grills Ta-Nehisi Coates on anti-Israel views in new book: Looks like it came from 'an extremist',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-host-grills-ta-nehisi-coates-anti-israel-views-new-book-looks-like-came-from-an-extremist,2024-10-01T20:50:22Z,"CBS Mornings anchor Tony Dokoupil pressed author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates on whether he believed Israel had a right to exist in a Monday interview.

""CBS Mornings"" anchor Tony Dokoupil grilled author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates over whether he believed Israel had ""a right to exist"" in a tense interview on Monday.

Coates appeared on the show to preview his new book, ""The Message,"" which is a collection of new essays by the best-selling author about his travels to different parts of the world.

""In the book's longest section, Coates travels to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how easily we are misled by nationalist narratives, and the tragedy that lies in the clash between the stories we tell and the reality of life on the ground,"" the book summary says.

Dokoupil confronted Coates on this section of the book, telling him bluntly that it read like something you would find in ""the backpack of an extremist.""

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES ACROSS ISRAEL

""I have to say, when I read the book, I imagine if I took your name out of it, took away the awards, the acclaim, took the cover off the book, publishing house goes away, the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,"" Dokoupil said.

""So then I found myself wondering, why does Ta'Nehisi Coates, who I've known for a long time, read his work for a long time, very talented, smart guy, leave out so much? Why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it? Why leave out that Israel deals with terror groups that want to eliminate it? Why not detail anything of the first and the second Intifada, the café bombings, the bus bombings, the little kids blown to bits. Is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?"" the CBS anchor continued.

Coates defended the book, saying he sought to give a voice to the Palestinian people, whose views he argued were underrepresented in the American media.

""I would say the perspective that you just outlined, there is no shortage of that perspective in American media,"" Coates replied.

""I have asked repeatedly in my interviews whether there is a single network, mainstream organization, in America with a Palestinian-American bureau chief or correspondent who actually has a voice to articulate that part the world. I've been a reporter for 20 years. The reporters are those who believe more sympathetically about Israel and its right to exist don't have a problem getting their voice out. But what I saw in Palestine, what I saw on the West Bank, what I saw in Haifa in Israel, what I saw in the South Hebron Hills, those were the stories I have not heard. Those were the stories that I was most occupied with,"" he continued.

Coates also said the 260-page book was not meant to be a ""treatise on the entirety of the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis.""

Dokoupil continued to press the far-left author, claiming his book would leave readers questioning why Israel even existed.

""But if you were to read this book you would be left wondering why does any of Israel exist? What a horrific place committing horrific acts on a daily basis. So I think the question is central and key: If Israel has a right to exist. And if your answer is no, then I guess the question becomes why do the Palestinians have a right to exist? Why do 20 different Muslim countries have a right to exist?"" Dokoupil asked.

Coates rejected the question, saying that countries are established by force, not rights, and that Israel already exists.

Dokoupil said the author's book ""delegitimizes"" Israel's foundation and ""seems like an effort to topple the whole building of it.""

""What is it that so particularly offends you about the existence of a Jewish state, that is a Jewish safe place, and not any of the other states out there?"" he asked Coates.

""There's nothing that offends me about a Jewish state,"" Coates retorted. ""I am offended by the idea of states built on ethnocracy, no matter where they are.""

""Muslim included?"" Dokoupil asked.

""I would not want a state where any group of people laid down their citizenship rights based on ethnicity,"" Coates said. He explained how he personally witnessed the ""two-tier system"" in Israel, where Palestinians had less freedom and access to resources in ""occupied territories"" than Israelis.

""I'm working with the person that is guiding me, a Palestinian whose father, whose grandfather and grandmother was born in this town. And I have more freedom to walk than he does. He can't ride on certain roads. He can't get water in the same way that Israeli citizens who live less than a mile away from him can,"" Coates said.

The two continued to spar as Dokoupil suggested Coates had portrayed a one-sided view of the conflict.

""But why is that?"" the anchor pressed. ""Why is there no agency in this book for the Palestinians? They exist in your narrative merely as victims of the Israelis, as though they were not offered peace at any juncture, as though they don't have a stake in this -- "" he asked.

Coates appealed to his own ancestry and America's history with racism to defend his particular viewpoint on the conflict in Gaza.

""I have a very, very, very moral compass about this. Again, perhaps it's because of my ancestry. Either apartheid is right or it's wrong. It's really, really simple. Either what I saw was right or it's wrong,"" he explained.

""I am against a state that discriminates against people on the basis of ethnicity. I'm against that. There is nothing the Palestinians could do that would make that okay for me. My book is not based on the hyper-morality of the Palestinian people,"" he went on to say.

Coates' new book was released on Tuesday, the same day that Iran launched dozens of missiles against Israel.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said its latest barrage of missiles is in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike late last week and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned citizens to shelter in place and follow instructions from the Home Front Command as the Jewish State's Iron Dome anti-missile defense system works to intercept incoming rockets."
