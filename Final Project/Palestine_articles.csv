"Amid airstrikes and armed conflict, Lebanese musicians hit a somber note",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/10/nx-s1-5147220/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-music-middle-east-war,2024-10-10T15:37:30Z,"If you're walking down the street on any given morning in an Arab city and hear music, there's a good chance Fairuz is singing.

For many, her voice is synonymous with morning coffees and bus rides to school, and she's considered something of a national treasure in Lebanon.

Lebanon is considered one of the most important musical capitals in the Arab world. It's a cultural heart that beats like a drum and is home to some of the most iconic and far reaching musicians in the Middle East.

Still, few artists are held in higher regard than Fairuz.

Among her most famous songs is ""Li Beirut,"" which translates to ""For Beirut.""

The song is an ode to the city, to its homes, its Mediterranean coastline, its fragrance of bread and jasmine. It's also a song that recounts a painful and dark chapter in the country's history: the devastating civil war from 1975-1990.

""It's become this sort of anthem. A very somber anthem for the people,"" says Danny Hajjar, a Lebanese writer who covers music and art in the Arab world.

""It is really only ever played during times of crisis. It is now triggering for a lot of people. They cannot hear that song any more because they know that means something is wrong.""

Today, Lebanese people now face a new moment of crisis, as conflict in the Middle East spreads.

Hezbollah in Lebanon began firing rockets at Israel after the Hamas-led attacks on Israel last October, leading to Israeli-Hezbollah fighting that has intensified in recent weeks. Israel launched a ground invasion into the south of Lebanon and stepped up airstrikes. More than 1,500 Lebanese -- including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters -- have been killed since mid-September, and more than 1 million have fled their homes.

Since the escalation of the conflict in Lebanon over recent weeks, Hajjar has been in touch with Lebanese musicians in the diaspora and in the country. This is what they told him about how they are reacting to this moment.

Sandy Bou Assy is an up-and-coming Lebanese pop and R&B singer who goes by the stage name of Dee.

Dee currently lives in Dubai, but has family in Lebanon, and says the stress of watching the war unfold from afar is consuming.

""It got to a point where I didn't even know if I was able to create music anymore. It cripples your every thought, your every being,"" she said.

""People say that yes, artistry and creativity and, you know, use your pain as your muse and as a means to create, but when there are people's lives at stake, when it's your parents, your family and your country at stake, how much can you really express yourself or get yourself to write about it?""

Blu Fiefer is a Lebanese-Mexican musician and producer who gained notoriety for her song ""Sint el Ew,"" which translates in English to ""Year of 'ew'"".

The song was released in 2020 and is a recap of an incredibly difficult year in Lebanon, as the country struggled with a persistent economic crisis and a devastating explosion in the port of Beirut.

When she spoke to Hajjar earlier in October, Blu Fiefer was still in Beirut, and said the ongoing war has halted her ability to create.

""To be honest, I'm scared to get into a session and put my headphones on and not be able to hear an explosion that maybe is close to me, or put my phone on silent in case there's any news or anything that I need to be aware of,"" she said.

""We are just trying to be extremely vigilant. So the ability to disconnect and go to somewhere vulnerable and creative feels far away right now.""

Lebanese rapper HADI is gaining recognition for his pointed lyrics. His provocative style can be heard clearly in his debut album Al Sadd 8 in which he raps about resistance -- a key theme in his lyrics, he says.

""Maybe not all music is based on criticism or not all music is based on opposition. But to me, for what I listen to or what I enjoy or what I think is valuable art, it's always been a challenge of the status quo,"" he said.

HADI hails from the south of Lebanon. But with the escalation of fighting in that part of the country, he and his family have since fled to Beirut.

""I'm not really sure what I'm going through, so I'm always going in a duality of feelings,"" he says. ""It's either I'm feeling very angry or very humorous because I'm in the middle of war. I haven't processed anything yet.""

Talia Lahoud is a singer-songwriter who makes music in both English and Arabic.

She is currently in Beirut, and despite the war has managed to release a new song titled ""3alli sawtak,"" or ""Raise your voice.""

The song, says Lahoud, was originally written in solidarity with Palestians. However, given the spread of the war into Lebanon, the song's dedication has broadened.

In an Instragram announcing the song's release, she wrote: ""To Lebanon, Palestine, and every Middle Eastern country suffering from war. My song ""3alli sawtak"" is officially yours."""

Israel strikes Hezbollah in blast targeting the militant group's leader,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25272/israel-strikes-hezbollah-in-blast-targeting-leader,2024-09-28T07:58:55Z,"BEIRUT -- The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut on Friday in a series of massive explosions that targeted the leader of the militant group and leveled multiple high-rise apartment buildings.

At least six people were killed and 91 were wounded, Lebanon's health ministry said. It was the biggest blast to hit the Lebanese capital in the past year and appeared likely to push the escalating conflict closer to full-fledged war.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, including one United States official. The Israeli army declined to comment on who it was targeting. It was not immediately clear if Nasrallah was at the site, and Hezbollah did not comment on the report.

The death toll is likely to rise significantly as teams comb through the rubble of six buildings. Israel launched a series of strikes on other areas of the southern suburbs following the initial blast.

After the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly cut short a visit to the United States to return home. Hours earlier, he addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israel's intensified campaign against Hezbollah over the past two weeks would continue -- further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire.

News of the blasts came as Netanyahu was briefing reporters after his U.N. address. A military aide whispered into his ear, and Netanyahu quickly ended the briefing.

Israeli army spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the strikes targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, saying it was located underground beneath residential buildings.

The series of blasts at around nightfall reduced six apartment towers to rubble in Haret Hreik, a densely populated, predominantly Shiite district of Beirut's Dahiyeh suburbs, according to Lebanon's national news agency. A wall of billowing black and orange smoke rose into the sky as windows were rattled and houses shaken some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Beirut.

Footage showed rescue workers clambering over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters were visible, one with a car toppled into it. A stream of residents carrying their belongings were seen fleeing along a main road out of the district.

Israel provided no immediate comment about the type of bomb or how many it used, but the resulting explosion levelled an area greater than a city block. The Israeli army has in its arsenal 2,000-pound, American-made ""Bunker Buster"" guided bombs designed specifically for hitting subterranean targets.

Richard Weir, crisis and weapons researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the blasts were consistent with that class of bomb.

Israel's air forces followed with a new set of strikes early Saturday, also in the southern suburbs, shortly after warning residents of three buildings to evacuate. It said they were being used by Hezbollah to hide weapons, including anti-ship missiles.

Israel's military announced additional attacks on Beqaa in eastern Lebanon and Tyre in the south.

To a degree unseen in past conflicts, Israel spent the week pushing to eliminate Hezbollah's senior leadership. But an attempt to assassinate Nasrallah -- successful or not -- would be a major escalation. The Pentagon said the U.S. had no advance warning of the strikes.

Nasrallah has been in hiding for years, very rarely appearing in public. He regularly gives speeches, but always by video from unknown locations.

The site hit Friday evening had not been publicly known as Hezbollah's main headquarters, though it is located in the group's ""security quarters,"" a heavily guarded part of Haret Hreik where it has offices and runs several nearby hospitals.

Four hours after the strike, Hezbollah had still not issued any statement referring to it. Instead, it announced that it had launched a salvo of rockets at the Israeli city of Safed, which it said was ""in defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli violation of cities, villages and civilians.""

The Israeli military said a house and a car in Safed were hit, and officials said a 68-year-old woman sustained mild shrapnel wounds.

Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The escalated campaign has killed more than 720 people in Lebanon, including dozens of women and children, according to Health Ministry statistics. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa killed nine members of the same family, the state news agency said.

The United Nations said the fighting has displaced 211,000 people, including 85,000 now staying in public schools and other shelters. Airstrikes have forced 20 primary health care centers to shut down and disrupted access to clean water for nearly 300,000 people.

The scope of Israel's operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation.

At the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to ""continue degrading Hezbollah"" until Israel achieves its goals. His comments dampened hopes for a U.S.-backed call for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah to allow time for a diplomatic solution. Hezbollah has not responded to the proposal.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. Since then, it and the Israeli military have traded fire almost daily, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes on both sides of the border.

An Israeli security official said he expects the campaign against Hezbollah would not last for as long as the current war in Gaza, because the military's goals are much narrower.

In Gaza, Israel aims to dismantle Hamas' military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from the border -- ""not a high bar like Gaza"" in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines.

In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women -- 35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan -- from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike.

""That's Sabah, these are her clothes, my love,"" one man cried out as her body emerged.

Israel says its accelerated strikes have already inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah's weapons capabilities and its fighters. A strike Tuesday in southern Lebanon killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander, Muhammad Ali Ismail, and his deputy, Israel's military said Saturday. There was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah.

But Hezbollah boasted a large arsenal of rockets and missiles and its remaining capacities are unknown.

Hezbollah officials and their supporters remain defiant. Not long before the explosions Friday evening, thousands gathered in another part of Beirut's suburbs for the funeral of three Hezbollah members killed in earlier strikes, including the head of the group's drone unit, Mohammed Surour.

People in the giant crowd waved their fists in the air and chanted, ""We will never accept humiliation,"" as they marched marched behind the three coffins, wrapped in the group's yellow flag.

Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's top official in Beirut, said in a speech that no matter how many commanders Israel kills, the group has endless numbers of experienced fighters. He vowed that Hezbollah will keep fighting until Israel stops its offensive in Gaza.

""We will not abandon the support of Palestine, Jerusalem and oppressed Gaza,"" Fadlallah said. ""There is no place for neutrality in this battle."""
Opinion | How Israel's invasion of Lebanon could spiral into a massive regional war,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-lebanon-war-iran-hezbollah-biden-rcna173364,2024-10-04T16:30:43Z,"An expert explains why Israel's intensifying war on Hezbollah is risky for the region.

Israel moved military forces into southern Lebanese territory Monday, an invasion that marks a major new level of intensity in about a year of conflict with Hezbollah. The paramilitary organization fired rockets at Israeli positions in the Shebaa Farms the day after Oct. 7 ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people after Hamas' attacks on Israel. (That area is a disputed territory which Lebanon and Syria say belongs to Lebanon, and Israel controls and says belongs to Syria.) Hezbollah, sometimes called a state within a state, is backed by Iran and does not have widespread support in Lebanon.

Then Tuesday, Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, citing last week's assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and, this summer, the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

The Biden administration has long opposed an Israeli incursion into Lebanon. But in the past year, the administration has also been unwilling to take any meaningful steps to rein in Israel's behavior, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acting boldly to assert more dominance in the region and degrade Israel's adversaries -- with a continued disregard for civilian lives. Israeli airstrikes have struck medical facilities and already killed hundreds of civilians in Lebanon. The probability of a regional war seems to be growing by the day.

To better understand the unfolding conflict, I called Nick Blanford, a Beirut-based fellow at the Atlantic Council and the author of ""Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel.""

Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Zeeshan Aleem: What is happening right now and how do we know when to say whether this is a new war?

Nicholas Blanford: I think you have to put the developments of the last few weeks into some context. One day after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Hezbollah staged a pro forma attack against Israeli positions along the Lebanon-Israel border, and it dedicated this attack to its allies -- Hamas in Gaza. But very quickly it turned into a kind of a tit-for-tat, daily attacks. The Hezbollah guys would attack Israeli military positions along the border; the Israelis would retaliate with artillery fire airstrikes into south Lebanon. And this really continued from October almost uninterrupted.

There was a clear moment in September when Israel's patience ran out. And they escalated in a very dramatic fashion, by detonating thousands of pagers which they'd been able, apparently, to booby trap. The following day, they detonated hundreds of walkie-talkies. That was followed up by intense airstrikes across areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a presence. And those attacks have intensified over the past two weeks, climaxing on Sept. 27 with the massive airstrike on Hezbollah's underground headquarters in south Beirut, which killed the veteran Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who has led the group for 32 years. The latest development is the advance of some elite Israeli army units into southern Lebanon where they have reportedly already taken some casualties.

So I would say we are in a war but it is not yet full scale. Both sides are mainly hitting military targets, not infrastructure as well, although hundreds of civilians have been killed in Lebanon.

Could you give us a brief primer on Hezbollah? How it emerged, what it is, what it believes in and its social function in Lebanon?

Blanford: Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organization that follows the Iranian, theocratic system of rule. Hezbollah has a secretary general -- most recently the late Nasrallah -- but the true leader of Hezbollah is the spiritual leader of Iran, currently, Ali Khamenei. He's the ultimate authority and, in general, the Iranians will set the strategic agenda.

Hezbollah emerged after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to kick out the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was deployed in strength in south Lebanon. The Israelis in '82 reached all the way to Beirut and then they gradually withdrew. By 1985, they were occupying a border strip along the Lebanon-Israel border and Hezbollah became the main resistance force against that Israeli occupation. Particularly during the 1990s, Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran but also supported by neighboring Syria, was able to deal blow after blow to the Israeli occupation forces, and that culminated in May 2000 with Israel pulling out of south Lebanon.

Hezbollah refused to put down its arms after the Israelis left. They said, 'We need to keep our arms, our military force, to deter Israel from coming back into south Lebanon.' But there was also another unspoken reason, which is that Hezbollah gradually became a source of deterrence for Iran -- especially after the war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 when it expanded very quickly and acquired a great deal of weaponry from Iran, Syria and elsewhere. So, for Iran, Hezbollah has now become a major force multiplier.

Hezbollah has a slightly schizophrenic character, because it is ideologically beholden to the Islamic leadership of Iran, but of course it is a Lebanese organization. It survives or falls depending on the support it gets from the Lebanese Shia community, which is why, since the beginning, Hezbollah has invested a lot in social welfare organizations.

The Shia population of Lebanon tends to be traditionally fairly downtrodden. They live in the poorer areas of the country, traditionally neglected by central governments. And Hezbollah really stepped in with schools, with hospitals, with repairing war damaged houses, even things like helping farmers with agricultural aid. It's become an indispensable organization for the Lebanese Shia community. So they've been able to maintain that support since the early 1980s.

Other communities: the Christians and Sunnis, in particular, the Druze, to an extent, [say] 'Well, hang on a minute. We do have a national army. Why do we need a Shia militia, armed to the teeth, stronger than many armies around the world, to defend Lebanon?' So there have been growing calls for Hezbollah to disarm, and this is why Hezbollah has moved deeper into Lebanese politics, particularly over the last 19 years, since the 2005 parliamentary elections.

What are the fundamental dynamics driving how Hezbollah and Israel's government see each other, both in terms of geopolitical interests and domestic political interests?

Blanford: Ideologically, Hezbollah and Iran want to see the end of Israel, and the restitution of Palestine to the Palestinians. They have in the past assisted Palestinians during the Al Aqsa Intifada. They would help the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza fight the Israelis. But in the past, they didn't get directly involved. When they kicked the Israelis out of Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah didn't immediately rush across the border into Israel and say, ""We're going to go and liberate Jerusalem now."" There's an acknowledgment that it's up to the Palestinians to liberate themselves, but Hezbollah is definitely there to help.

When you look at it more realistically, the reason why Hezbollah is so powerful now is because the Iranians want them to be. We go back to this notion of Hezbollah forming a key role in Iran's deterrence architecture: The stronger Hezbollah becomes, the safer Iran feels.

The Institute for National Security Studies, a leading think tank in Israel, has for the past few years described Hezbollah as Israel's greatest threat, which is quite remarkable in itself, because we're not talking about a country, we're talking about an organization, albeit one that is backed by a powerful regional country.

The Israelis have watched Hezbollah grow stronger and stronger. What the Israelis are doing now is something they haven't dared to do before, and that is to really go for broke with Hezbollah. What's interesting is I think the Israelis are gambling that Hezbollah and the Iranians do not want a full-scale war with Israel right now. Why? Because if there is a full-scale war, whatever the outcome, Hezbollah will take a huge battering, as indeed we're seeing now, and there's no guarantee that Hezbollah will be able to rebuild, rearm and re-equip as quickly as it did after the 2006 war to continue serving as a deterrence for Iran. In other words, if Hezbollah gets engaged in a full-scale war now, Iran could lose its major deterrence factor in that war, and all this would be for the sake of coming to the support of Hamas in Gaza. Hamas is small fry compared to Hezbollah -- Hezbollah is much, much, much more important to Iran than Hamas. Which is why Hezbollah is still acting with a certain amount of restraint despite Israel's escalated action against it. Hezbollah still has not used its arsenal of precision-guided missiles.

It's a dangerous gamble. It could go wrong. Especially now that Israeli troops are operating on the ground in south Lebanon, Hezbollah's home turf. The current conflict could spill into a major war. We're still below that threshold moment, but if it happens, it has a potential to go regional, dragging in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Can you walk us through the different scenarios you see unfolding here?

Blanford: The least likely one is that a cease-fire comes in. The Americans and the French had an idea for a 21-day cease-fire to calm things down along the Lebanon-Israel border. Netanyahu has rejected it. So that's not going to happen..

A second scenario is that what we're seeing now continues. The Israelis haven't started hitting Lebanese infrastructure, power stations, bridges, roads, the airports, seaports; they are focusing on Hezbollah military targets by using air power and now ground forces, albeit in a limited manner. Hezbollah, by the same token, is striking back at Israeli military targets. They haven't been hitting Israeli infrastructure. Now this could go on even at this heightened rate. But under current circumstances, I suspect that Hezbollah will continue doing what it's doing -- in other words, absorb these blows that the Israelis have inflicted, and keep firing rockets into Israel.

In some respects, the Israeli ground maneuver could play right into Hezbollah's hands, as the Israelis are entering terrain that Hezbollah has had for 18 years [and Hezbollah has been able] to prepare for exactly this eventuality. When the Israelis did move into Lebanon in 2006 after two weeks of aerial bombing, they came in for a big surprise. They didn't understand Hezbollah's underground bunker networks, its ambush positions, firing positions.

You could have a similar scenario this time round, albeit on a larger scale, where the Israelis, who have a better understanding of what Hezbollah is about these days, could come in in force for what they would describe perhaps as a limited incursion to basically rubble-ize and depopulate this broad strip of south Lebanon. But they risk losing a lot of troops because they're going to be operating in Hezbollah's environment. And at the end of it, if the mission is successful, what do you do then? Do you reoccupy south Lebanon? If so, you've gone back to the situation between 1978 and 2000 and that didn't end too well for the Israelis. But if you pull back to the border, then what is to stop Hezbollah basically moving back into the border district and beginning to rebuild?

There could come a point when the Israelis say, 'We've hit all the targets from the air and our soldiers are fighting on the ground but Hezbollah is still firing rockets across the border.' And this is where perhaps a third scenario can kick in: The Israelis conclude that, well, we're going to have to escalate this even further by deploying a larger number of troops into Lebanon to expand the target set to include Lebanese infrastructure as well. It could be at that point that Hezbollah, with Iranian blessing, feels it has no choice but to launch its precision-guided systems at Israeli military and infrastructure targets. This is where the conflict could go regional.

What role does the U.S. have in all this, and what advice would you give to the Biden administration on how to prevent a full-scale regional war from breaking out?

Blanford: Yes, a regional war potentially could happen. If the Iranians assess that Hezbollah is about to get bludgeoned by Israel, they may conclude, 'We've got nothing left to lose. We're about to lose Hezbollah. Let's go large. We'll activate all our proxies across the region, and we'll give it a go and see what happens to Israel.'

I think the Biden administration is in a difficult position. President Biden is enormously frustrated with Netanyahu, partly because of the Gaza conflict going on for so long. But he has been urging Netanyahu since the get-go to not open a second front with Hezbollah. Now you could argue that a second front was open anyway, because of these simmering tit-for-tat attacks that have been going on across the Lebanon-Israel border since October. But these attacks were containable. Hezbollah has said, 'Look, this is a support front that we're doing. Once the war in Gaza ends, we're going to stop.' So the emphasis has been very much on trying to conclude a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which will then have a trickle-down effect and should stabilize the Lebanon-Israel border. But of course, we haven't had a Gaza cease-fire. The conflict continues, and now the Israelis clearly have lost patience with Hezbollah and have gone large.

There's very little that the Biden administration feels it can do, particularly when you've got a very close election coming up in just over a month now. So the Biden administration could do what it's done before, and then suspend arms shipments to Israel, but this time do it properly. Cut off all military support to Israel. That would put a lot of pressure on Netanyahu to start picking up the phone and listening when Biden calls. But I don't think they're going to do that because there'll be a political backlash in the United States, and that could affect Kamala Harris' chances against Donald Trump. I think Netanyahu is taking advantage of this and is going for it."
Suspended Cornell student faces a potential exit from U.S. after pro-Palestinian demonstration,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/cornell-suspended-student-visa-israel-protest-boeing-rcna173914,2024-10-03T21:33:28Z,"International doctoral student Momodou Taal could lose his F-1 visa after he was suspended a second time by his university over his role in a protest against companies that provide weapons to Israel.

Cornell University student Momodou Taal fears he may have to leave the U.S. following his involvement in a pro-Palestinian demonstration last month.

Taal, an international doctoral student from the United Kingdom, teaches a course called ""What Is Blackness?"" at Cornell and has been active in pro-Palestinian advocacy on campus.

But under a new -- and controversial -- university policy governing protests, Taal was one of four students suspended in April after he participated in a pro-Palestinian encampment. And two weeks ago, he joined more than 100 demonstrators at a campus career fair in protest of Boeing and L3Harris being allowed to participate. The two defense contractors have been criticized for providing weapons to Israel.

Taal admits that he joined a crowd of people who entered the career fair, but says that he left after five minutes. Some of the activists reportedly confronted Boeing representatives at the fair.

The university released a statement condemning the demonstration, writing in part:

A university official overseeing student conduct informed Taal in an email last week that he had been suspended again -- after his purported display of ""escalating, egregious behavior and a disregard for the University policies"" -- and was given a no-trespass order that bars him from campus. The official also told Taal that his F-1 student visa would be terminated, which can happen to foreign students who are suspended multiple times, and referred him to an immigration adviser.

Taal alleges that he has been targeted because he is Black and Muslim. The university's interim president, Michael Kotlikoff, has denied any targeting. In a statement Monday, Kotlikoff said that nearly 20 participants in the career fair protest had been identfied and added:

Taal has been granted two shots at appeal. The first -- to Cornell's vice president for student and campus life -- was denied. The second -- to the university provost -- is under review.

In an interview with The ReidOut Blog, Taal said his Black identity has inspired his activism.

""When I think of the best of the Black radical tradition, it always has centered movements in America and beyond,"" he said. ""Wherever they perceive injustice, I have found Black figures at the forefront. Many of the Black figures that I study, they also focus and spoke about Palestine as well in their time.""

Taal, who counts Malcolm X as one of his inspirations, said his situation is indicative of a broader crackdown on free speech on college campuses. And as he awaits word on his appeal and potentially imminent removal from the country, Taal has received an outpouring of liberal support -- including from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

Taal's destiny is in the hands of the university at this point. And an email he received from his immigration adviser last week warned him that things could move quickly if his appeal is denied.

""There is no grace period for departure from the US once your F-1 record is closed,"" the adviser wrote. ""You should leave either before the end date of your F-1 record or right away after the record is closed."""
Opinion | Israel bombed my home as a result of my journalism. This can't become our new normal.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israels-closure-al-jazeeras-ramallah-office-sends-chilling-message-rcna172845,2024-09-29T14:11:31Z,"This isn't the first time Israel has taken aim at media workers in Palestine, where it attempts to control the narrative in tandem with efforts to control territory.

On Sept. 22, Israeli forces stormed Al Jazeera's Ramallah office and shut down its operations, effectively barring one of the few remaining windows into the realities of life under occupation in the West Bank. The incident, as alarming as it is, extends far beyond the closure of a newsroom and marks an escalation in Israel's broader crackdown on press freedoms in Palestine. For those of us journalists who have reported from the ground, our work has never been just about reporting the news; it's about making visible to the world a reality that shapes every aspect of our daily lives as Palestinians.

This isn't the first time Israel has taken aim at media workers in Palestine, where it attempts to control the narrative in tandem with efforts to control territory. We've seen similar tactics since October of last year, and long before, when tens of Palestinian journalists were killed along with their family members, media offices bombed, and entire news organizations targeted. I've lost colleagues who reported side by side with me from northern Gaza, like Ismail Al Ghoul. Together Ismail and I endured months of cold and hunger, and terrifying nights during Israel's ground offensives. He and so many other dedicated colleagues were killed for speaking out, for doing their job.

I know this because I survived it. As a writer and reporter for Al Jazeera in Gaza during the war from October 2023 until last May, I experienced firsthand the dangers of reporting on the ground, and the scrutiny I was subjected to for being affiliated with Al Jazeera. The press badge on my chest, meant to ensure my safety, functioned as a target. In December 2023, my home was bombed with me and my family inside, as a direct result of my work, after I received multiple threats via phone calls and text messages from the Israeli military ordering me to stop reporting and cease writing.

My own experience in Gaza bears this out. The bombing of my home didn't just shake my personal life by burying me under the rubble for hours -- it disrupted my sense of purpose as a writer and journalist. For days, I questioned whether I could continue reporting. Knowing the cost, my family lived in constant fear every time I went on assignment, while colleagues around me grew increasingly afraid to speak out, knowing that anyone could be a target at any moment.

What we witnessed daily, from drone surveillance and press tents being bombed to the direct shooting at journalists and targeting of their vehicles as they traveled for coverage, was not just an attack on the ones trying to report, but on the very idea of journalism. It is an attack on the notion that the world has a right to know what happens in places like Gaza and the West Bank. Still, we continued to report because we knew the world needed to see what was happening, and we knew that to stop reporting would mean to surrender to the very forces that sought to silence us.

Al Jazeera has been a crucial voice documenting not only the devastation in Gaza, especially as it produces exclusive access and footage to its viewers from the ground, but also the civil unrest and protests within Israel, the political discontent in Tel Aviv, and the deadly raids on refugee camps in the West Bank. Now, with its Ramallah bureau shut down, that voice is fraying. But this is only one episode in Israel's ongoing campaign against the media in the occupied territories.

What's striking is that it comes nearly one year into Israel's war on Gaza, dimming any hope of renewed global attention as people near an anniversary of death and destruction. What concerns me most is that this is more than just about Al Jazeera. It's about the future of a young generation of journalists aspiring to speak out during times of terror and oppression. As someone who reported from right in front of Israeli tanks, I can say that journalists in Palestine are heartbreakingly treated as a threat.

Israel's efforts to silence the free press represent a tragedy that cuts deep into the ongoing struggle for liberation and peace. It's a tragedy for anyone who values the role of the press in democratic societies. When journalists are attacked, the public is denied the information necessary to truly understand reality.

When the press is silenced, it's not just a building that closes or stories that disappear. It's accountability itself that is lost. It cuts off a vital flow of information to the public. And the consequences ripple far beyond the journalists themselves. The world loses access to the ground truth -- the kind of truth that challenges ""official"" government narratives, the kind that holds the powerful to account.

By attacking journalists, whether through the bombing of their homes, as in my case, or shutting down newsrooms, as we saw in Ramallah, Israel is sending a chilling message: Telling the truth is dangerous work with a steep price.

That's why the closure of the Ramallah office isn't merely an Al Jazeera or local concern -- it's a global one. The erosion of press freedoms in Palestine reflects a disturbing trend, a concerted effort to undermine the institutions that safeguard truth and transparency. It's a pattern of slow, deliberate attempts to dismantle the free press entirely. Because if we allow press freedoms to be eroded in Palestine, what's to stop it from happening elsewhere?

In this critical moment, the world can't afford to look away. In defending journalism, we defend the truth. It's the means by which we fight against injustice. I know what happens when the press is attacked, and I fear we've reached a point where these attacks have become the norm, accepted even. The closure of the Ramallah office is an upsetting move, yes. But it's also an urgent call to action, because it won't stop with Al Jazeera."
Anti-Israel protesters pitch encampment outside Jewish Democrat's Ohio home,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-war-gaza-hamas-anniversary-ohio-greg-landsman-protest-israel-biden-c89db986dbfdb82e22205375dbec3778,2024-10-07T16:26:29Z,"COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) -- Masked anti-Israel demonstrators escalated their harassment of a Jewish congressman on the eve of Monday's anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, pitching an encampment outside Ohio Democratic Rep. Greg Landsman 's Cincinnati residence.

Landsman said Monday that the protesters arrived outside his home early Sunday. By evening, they set up tents, cots and sleeping bags in the road and spent the night harassing him and his family members, forcing them to secure a police escort in order to enter and exit safely, the congressman said.

""On the eve of the one-year anniversary of the October 7th terror attacks, when Jews were brutally murdered and kidnapped, these people came to the home of a Jewish family at night, dressed in all black and fully masked,"" Landsman said in a statement. He said that he and his daughter would be forced to navigate the encampment in order to attend an Oct. 7 service later Monday.

The group, Midwest Direct Action 4 Pali!, shared a video of the demonstration on Instagram. The video showed masked participants in black marching down the street in front of Landsman's home. Their faces were obscured as they carried white bundles that resembled shrouded bodies and brandished banners representing the numbers in the death toll. The group remained on site Monday, Landman's office said.

""On the eve of the one year mark since the beginning of the genocide in Palestine, local activists in Cincinnati have gathered outside Congressman Greg Landsman's house to denounce his votes to conceal the death toll and continue funding mass murder in Gaza,"" the group said in its post. ""We mark in solemn vigil that we will not rest until the genocide is over and Palestine is free.""

It's not the first time Landsman and his district have been targeted since the conflict began. Just a month into the conflict, protestors placed a poster outside a building near Landsman's district office with his photo and the phrase ""This Ken supports genocide,"" alongside other inflammatory language.

In July, Landsman toured the Covedale Cemetery Complex in Cincinnati, where 176 Jewish gravestones had been toppled."
Vandals deface a mural in Italy depicting a survivor of Oct. 7 attack,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/italy-antisemitism-mural-oct7-bbdeecda5a9f98498a9c3ffbebd371fc,2024-10-07T15:43:00Z,"MILAN (AP) -- The vandalism Monday of a mural depicting a survivor of last year's Oct. 7 Hamas attacks that killed some 1,200 people in Israel is an example of rising antisemitism in Italy over the last year, according to the Antisemitism Observatory in Milan.

Incidence of antisemitism has increased to about 80 or 90 a week in the last year, from about 30 a week before, said Stefano Gatti, a researcher at the observatory. He called the increase ""overpowering.""

""While before October 7, the incidents were mostly on internet websites, now they consist of acts in the real world,'' he said. ""Antisemitism has also become more socially acceptable.""

It includes graffiti, insults, acts of intimidation and aggression that so far have not translated into cases of bodily harm. He cited one incident during which a rabbi was followed in the port city of Genoa by someone brandishing a screwdriver; and another incident when a restaurant owner casually told a pair of diners he did not realize were Jewish that Hitler was right for seeking to wipe out Europe's Jews.

""We have not seen a situation like this since 1945,"" Gatti said, citing the end of World War II and the Nazi Holocaust that killed 6 million European Jews. ""Not even in 1982,"" during Lebanon's war when Israel invaded southern Lebanon. He said local mayors and university officials have not been clear in their condemnation of such events, ""which has helped the phenomenon grow.""

The mural vandalized on Monday, ""October 7th, Escape"" by AleXsandro Palombo, depicted Vlada Patapov escaping the Hamas attack. Vandals erased the figure's head and legs from the mural near Milan's state university.

Palombo said in a statement that whoever ""decapitated"" the image ""is not fighting for the liberation of Palestine. These extremist movements that are increasingly radicalizing our society have the sole purpose of defending terrorist belief in our Western democracy.""

The artist said that images of the Hamas massacre ""have been removed from the collective memory too soon, and instead need to be circulated more until they are imprinted and become a warning against the threat of Islamist terrorism and religious fundamentalism."""
The University of Hawaii is about to get hundreds of millions of dollars to do military research,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/military-and-defense-colleges-and-universities-hawaii-general-news-4474e77ff45d3429f7608368f09aed0f,2024-09-25T16:11:40Z,"The University of Hawaii is poised to renew a controversial contract to conduct research for the U.S. military worth up to $285 million over 10 years, in what administrators call a major source of federal funding for the university.

While supporters say the Applied Research Laboratory creates well-paying jobs conducting research with important civilian applications, critics say the university shouldn't be engaged in a partnership that includes work for the military, some of which is classified.

Of particular concern is the laboratory's sponsor, the U.S. Navy, which has been embroiled in controversy after back-to-back spills of jet fuel into the Pearl Harbor drinking water system, which serves some 93,000 people, in 2021.

Highlighting the fault line between university administrators and their critics, the University of Hawaii Board of Regents on Friday unanimously passed a motion effectively allowing administrators to finalize the contract, despite a resolution by the UH student senate demanding the university sever its ties to the military.

Vassilis Syrmos, UH's vice president for research and innovation, said the outcry reprises one that started when the university began its partnership with the Navy in the early 2000s.

""The catastrophic event at Red Hill brought all those feelings up again,"" he said. ""There is no way to sugar coat this thing.""

Native Hawaiian students and residents are leading the push against the Department of Defense, he said.

""It's a movement,"" Syrmos said. ""It's a Native Hawaiian renaissance against the DOD presence. It's real, and I don't think it's going away.""

Momi Bachiller, a fourth-year student of molecular cell biology and Hawaiian language, said it's disheartening to students that the administration is moving ahead with the contract renewal despite vocal opposition.

""We are stakeholders, but they don't respect us,"" said Bachiller, who also serves as a senator for the Associated Students of the University of Hawaii.

When the center was founded in 2008, the University of Hawaii became the nation's fifth U.S. Navy University-Affiliated Research Center. The other so-called UARCs are located at Johns Hopkins University, the University of Washington, Pennsylvania State University and the University of Texas at Austin.

The UARCs are meant to serve as centers for research into critical Navy and national defense technology, focusing on core competencies of university researchers. In the case of UH, they include ocean science, astronomy, optics and renewable energy. The official name of Hawaii's UARC is the Applied Research Laboratory at the University of Hawaii.

In a presentation to the Board of Regents earlier this month, Syrmos alluded to early criticisms of the center, noting that Denise Konan, then UH Manoa's Interim Chancellor, initially recommended against going forward based on campus consultations. But the Board of Regents later approved the center after learning that dozens of UH's most productive researchers supported it, Syrmos' presentation said.

The presentation also quoted UH's then-president, David McClain, who recognized the controversy but said researchers should be able to pursue their interests, even if some people didn't like it.

""Because of the inherent diversity and need for freedom of inquiry which in my view does and should characterize the academy, I tend to be biased in favor of measures to support the individual scholar no matter how popular -- or even more importantly, how unpopular -- his or her research interests,"" McClain is quoted as saying.

Nearly two decades later, the center and its Applied Research Laboratory, is a major source of funding for UH. In the past fiscal year, the Department of Defense provided about $65 million of some $615 million in so-called extramural funding the university brought in for research, Syrmos said. The research lab alone accounted for $15 million to $20 million he said.

Supporters include high-profile academics like Chip Fletcher, interim dean of UH's School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology. He cited ARL's support of diversity, equity and inclusion in written testimony to the Board of Regents supporting the contract.

""By engaging with underrepresented groups and providing opportunities for students from diverse backgrounds to participate in high-impact research, the ARL is helping to build a more inclusive and equitable academic environment,"" Fletcher wrote.

Among the Applied Research Laboratory's projects related to ocean science is the Rapid Resilient Reefs for Coastal Defense, a $27 million, five-year project conducted in partnership with the University of California San Diego/Scripps Institution of Oceanography, Florida Atlantic University and the Ohio State University.

The purpose is to create artificial reefs of fast-growing coral that mimic the biodiversity of natural reefs, said Joshua Levy, the project's technical program manager. The hope is that such reefs can protect coastal communities in a time of rising sea levels, defending not against warships but the effects of climate change, Levy said.

""These are things that affect coastal communities around the world,"" he said.

Other projects focus on information technology. On Maui, a 52-member team at the Vanguard Center of High Performance Computing is doing research into creating computers capable of complex tasks like engineering, weather forecasting and cybersecurity, says Tiare Martin, the center's director.

""The vision is to have labs across the state,"" Martin said.

Despite its economic benefits, the military has fostered animosity and mistrust in Hawaii for generations. The use of Koohalawe as a bombing target starting in World War II prompted protests in the 1970s. The herbicide Agent Orange was tested under a U.S. Army contract at the University of Hawaii's Kauai Agricultural Research Station in the 1960s. Verdant Makua Valley in West Oahu was taken over by the military for live-fire military exercises for generations, from around 1930 to early 2004; the Army's lease of Makua continues until 2029.

Against this backdrop, critics point to an overarching concern about Hawaii being a center for military research.

""You have to put it in the context of a genocidal settler colonialism,"" Bachiller, the student government senator, said in an interview.

She was one of six students senators who testified against the research contract at Friday's Board of Regents meeting.

Punia Pale, the student government treasurer, testified that UH ""deepens the wounds of colonialization and exploitation"" by using Native Hawaiian land without consent.

""These lands should be returned to the Hawaiian people, and they should not be used for research that serves the U.S. military interests - especially when such interests have historically oppressed Indigenous people around the world, currently now Palestine,"" he said.

Kawai Kupuni, another student government senator, noted that academic research should advance human knowledge, not be locked up as top secret.

""Free inquiry will never be compatible with classified research,"" she said.

Among those on the other side of the debate is former Hawaii Gov. Neil Abercombie, a current university regent who also served nine terms a U.S. representative from Hawaii. It's not uncommon for military information to be classified, Abercrombie said in an interview. That includes parts of the Pentagon budget, which he was responsible for passing as a member of the House Armed Services Committee.

But, Abercrombie said, simply because some UH research is classified doesn't mean professors are developing weapons there. Syrmos and others insist that's not happening at the laboratory.

""They kind of set positions,"" Abercrombie said of the protesters. ""And no one talks to each other about what it is and is not because that might interfere with their ideological perceptions. And I understand that.""

But to suggest university professors are surreptitiously developing weapons under a cloak of military secrecy is ""offensive to the integrity of the researchers,"" Abercrombie said.

Joining Abercombie and the other regents who unanimously supported the military contract were long-time members of the UH community. Dr. Bill Haning is an emeritus professor of psychiatry at UH's John A. Burns School of Medicine, where he's been a clinician, educator and researcher with UH since 1989. Lori Tochiki served more than a decade as associate dean for student services at UH's William S. Richardson School of Law.

Joshua Faumuina, a law student who serves as the Board of Regents' interim student regent, said he shared the concerns of critics.

But, he said, ""I would rather have that money with us than with a weapons developer.""

Leading Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury dies at 76,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/elias-khoury-lebanon-novelist-palestinian-cause-israel-1b6e79f6a17f5d9f5dbdaf809b728653,2024-09-15T12:28:34Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Lebanese novelist Elias Khoury who dedicated much of his writings to the Palestinian cause and taught at universities around the world, making him one of Lebanon's most prominent intellectuals, has died. He was 76.

Khoury, a leading voice of Arab literature, had been ill for months and admitted and discharged from hospital several times over the past year until his death early Sunday, Al-Quds Al-Arabi daily that he worked for said.

The Lebanese writer, born and raised in Beirut, was outspoken in defense of freedom of speech and harsh criticism of dictatorships in the Middle East.

In addition to his novels, Khoury wrote articles in different Arab media outlets over the past five decades making him well known throughout the Arab world.

Two days after the Israel-Hamas war broke out on Oct. 7, Khoury wrote an article in Al-Quds A-Arab daily titled ""It's Palestine."" Khoury wrote then that ""the biggest open-air prison, the besieged Ghetto of Gaza, has launched a war against Israel, occupied settlements and forced settlers to flee.""

Born in Beirut on July 12, 1948, Khoury had been known for his political stances from his support of Palestinians to his harsh criticism of Israel and what he called its ""brutal"" settling policy in Palestinian territories. He studied at the Lebanese University and later at the University of Paris, where he received a PhD in social history.

""The Catastrophe began in 1948 and it is still going on,"" he once wrote referring to Israel's settlement policies in occupied Palestinian territories. The ""nakba,"" or ""catastrophe"" is a term used by many Arabs to describe the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians when Israel was created in 1948.

Khoury was an outspoken supporter of Arab uprisings that broke out in the region starting in 2011 and toppled several governments.

""The question is not why the Arab revolts broke out,"" Khoury wrote after uprisings that toppled long-serving leaders such as Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and Tunisia's Zine El Abidine Ben Ali. ""The question is not how people tore down the wall of fear but how fear built Arab kingdoms of silence for five decades.""

Khoury, who belonged to a Greek Orthodox Christian family, took part in Lebanon's 1975-90 civil war and was wounded in one of the battles.

From 1992 until 2009, Khoury was the editor of the cultural section of Lebanon's leading An-Nahar newspaper. Until his death, he was the editor-in-chief of the Palestine Studies magazine, a bulletin issued by the Beirut-based Institute for Palestine Studies.

His first novel was published in 1975, but his second, Little Mountain, which he released in 1977 and was about Lebanon's devastating civil war was very successful.

Bab al-Shams, or Gate of the Sun, released in 2000, was about Palestinian refugees in Lebanon since 1948. A movie about the novel was made in Egypt.

His novels were translated to several languages including Hebrew.

Khoury also taught at different universities including New York University, Columbia, Princeton and Houston, as well as the University of London."
"To pumped-up Democrats, Harris was everything Biden was not in confronting Trump in debate",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-trump-harris-2024-election-biden-319079a18ea993066bea750b57f6e0fa,2024-09-11T04:48:12Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- To many Democrats, Kamala Harris was everything Joe Biden was not in confronting Donald Trump on the debate stage: forceful, fleet of foot, relentless in going after her opponent.

In a pivot from Biden's debate meltdown in June, Democrats who gathered in bars, watch parties and other venues Tuesday night found lots to cheer in her drive to rattle the Republican.

In a race for the White House that surveys say is exceptionally close, with both sides looking for an edge, it was the Democrats who came away more exuberant after the nationally televised debate.

""She prosecuted Donald Trump tonight,"" said Alina Taylor, 51, a high school special education teacher who joined hundreds of people on a football field of the historically Black Salem Baptist Church of Abington in a suburb of Philadelphia, where people watched on a 33-foot (10 meter) screen.

As for Trump, she said, ""I was appalled"" by his performance. ""People were laughing at him because he wasn't making very much sense.""

In Seattle, people gathered at Massive, a queer nightclub where scores watched the debate on a projector set up in front of the club's large disco ball. The crowd laughed and cheered when Trump branded Harris a Marxist. More cheers when the debate moderator called out Trump's false claim that some states legalize the killing of babies after birth.

""He's getting smoked,"" one said.

But in Brentwood, Tennessee, Sarah Frances Morris heard nothing at her watch party to shake her support of Trump.

""I think he beat her on the border,"" she said. ""I think he also beat her on actually having plans and letting the American people know what those are. And I think that Kamala Harris likes to mention that she has plans for things, but she doesn't actually ever elaborate on what those plans are.""

Morris conceded she was watching history being made, ""because we have our first Black woman running for president."" But, she added, ""I don't think she delivered to get her to that place she needed to be.""

Harris supporter Dushant Puri, 19, a UC Berkeley student, said the vice president took command before the first words were spoken -- when she crossed the stage to shake Trump's hand. ""I thought that was pretty significant,"" Puri said. ""It was their first interaction, and I thought Harris was asserting herself.""

At the same watch party, fellow student Angel Aldaco, 21, said that unlike Biden, Harris ""came in with a plan and was more concise.""

Aldaco was struck by one of the night's oddest moments, when Trump ""went on that rampage about eating pets."" That's when Trump endorsed a baseless conspiracy theory that immigrants were stealing and eating people's dogs ands cats. Harris was incredulous. ""That was good,"" the student said.

It's questionable how much viewers learned about what Harris would do as president or whether she won over independents or wavering Republicans. But for some Democrats, despondent if not panicked after Biden's fumbling debate performance, it was enough to see a Democratic candidate getting seriously under Trump's skin.

""He is pretty incapable when he is riled up,"" said Ikenna Amilo, an accountant at a Democratic watch party in a small concert venue in downtown Portland, Maine.

""When you poke him, he is really reactive and he doesn't show the temperament you want in a president, so I think Kamala has shown she's doing a good job.""

Democrat Natasha Salas, 63, of Highland, Indiana, saw the debate from an Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority watch party at a bistro in Markham, Illinois, and welcomed Harris' call to cool the political temperature -- even as the vice president denounced Trump at every turn.

""We all want the same things, Democrats and Republicans,"" Salas said. ""We are more alike than different. I want to see the country move forward and less divisiveness.""

Interest in the debate transcended national borders. From a shelter for migrants in Tijuana, Mexico, where dozens watched a translated version of the debates on a television, Rakan al Muhana, 40, an asylum-seeker from Gaza, became animated when the candidates discussed Israel and Palestine.

""We are running from the war,"" he said. ""We are running from the Israeli bombs. He (Trump) doesn't see us as human. My daughter, who is four months -- for him, she's a terrorist.""

Al Muhana has been on a four-month journey from Gaza to this border city, with his wife and four children. They left when both his mother and father were killed in a bombing.

Associated Press journalists Michael Rubinkam in Philadelphia; George Walker in Nashville; Robert Bukaty in Portland, Maine; Lindsey Wasson in Seattle; Godofredo Vasquez in Berkeley, California; and Gregory Bull in Tijuana, Mexico, contributed to this report."
Anti-war protesters clash with police outside Australian arms convention,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/australia-protest-arms-convention-melbourne-f320ca694600df26c032eabac97e8bb8,2024-09-11T00:10:52Z,"MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Thousands of anti-war protesters clashed with police Wednesday outside a military arms convention in downtown Melbourne.

Around 1,800 police officers have been deployed to a Melbourne convention center where the Land Forces International Land Defense Exposition will take place from Wednesday until Friday.

Witnesses reported protesters throwing rocks, horse manure and tomatoes at police horses and officers with shields and wearing riot gear. A police officer on horseback was seen striking a protester with a riding crop.

A line of police was also seen forcing protesters away from the convention center.

Roads have been closed off and morning peak hour traffic was disrupted by the protesters organized by Students for Palestine and Disrupt Wars groups. Organizers hoped up to 25,000 protesters would turn out.

""We're protesting to stand up for all those who have been killed by the type of weapons on display at the convention,"" Students for Palestine national co-convenor Jasmine Duff said in a statement.

""We are going to disrupt the convention using civil disobedience tactics passed down to us by activists in the civil rights movements and the anti-Vietnam war movement,"" she added.

Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called on protesters to show respect for police.

""People have a right to protest peacefully, but you don't say you're opposed to defense equipment by throwing things at police,"" Albanese told Seven Network television.

""They've got a job to do and our police officers should be respected at all times,"" Albanese added.

The convention organizer AMDA Foundation said in an email on Wednesday it would not be commenting on protester activity.

The biennial convention brings together arms industry figures from Australia, the United States, Asia and Europe."
A Palestinian team in Chile offers soccer with a heavy dose of protest,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/chile-palestinian-soccer-club-1bdf2593993b39bd9527b5e6987319d2,2024-09-09T04:30:43Z,"SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) -- Arms raised high. Banners denouncing the war in Gaza. Crowds united in song and wrapped in keffiyehs, the black-and-white checkered scarves that have become a badge of Palestinian identity.

It could have been any other pro-Palestinian rally erupting over the Israel-Hamas war if it weren't for the fact that these thousands of protesters were actually soccer fans at a league match in Santiago, the capital of Chile.

Although the players darting across the field had names like José and Antonio and grew up in a Spanish-speaking South American nation, their fervor for the Palestinian cause and red, white, black and green-colored jerseys underscored how Chile's storied soccer club serves as an entry point for the world's largest Palestinian community outside the Middle East to connect with an ancestral home thousands of miles away.

""It's more than just a club, it takes you into the history of the Palestinians,"" said Bryan Carrasco, captain of Chile's legendary Club Deportivo Palestino.

As the bloodiest war in the history of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict rages in the Gaza Strip, the club's electric game atmosphere, viewing parties and pre-match political stunts have increasingly tapped into a sense of collective Palestinian grief in this new era of war and displacement.

""We're united in the face of the war,"" said Diego Khamis, director of the country's Palestinian community. ""It's daily suffering.""

In a sport where authorities penalize athletes for flaunting political positions, particularly on such explosive issues as the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Club Palestino is an unabashed exception that wears its pro-Palestinian politics on its sleeve -- and on its torso, stadium seats and anywhere else it can find.

The club's brazen gestures have caused offense before. Chile's Football Federation fined the club in 2014 after the number ""1"" on the back of their shirts was shaped as a map of Palestine before Israel's creation in 1948.

But players' fierce pride in their Palestinian identity has otherwise caused little controversy in this country of 19 million, home to 500,000 ethnic Palestinians.

""It's our roots and it feels like home,"" said Jaime Barakat, a Palestino fan and shawarma vendor.

Leftist President Gabriel Boric, who called Israel a ""genocidal, murderous state"" on the campaign trail in 2021, has harshly criticized Israel's campaign in Gaza. His government recalled the Israeli ambassador and joined South Africa's case accusing Israel of genocide in the International Court of Justice -- allegations that Israel denies.

Israel has pushed back, castigating Chile for what it sees as an insufficient response to Hamas' brutal Oct. 7 attack that killed 1,200 people and led to the abduction of 250 others.

The country's small Jewish population of 16,000 is unsettled. ""Boric, who frequently speaks of peace, has imported the Middle East conflict to Chile,"" the Jewish Community of Chile said in a statement.

Chile's Palestinians say the Mideast conflict was imported decades before Boric, spurring waves of displacement that forged the surprising history of Arab immigration to this Pacific coast nation from the late 1800s as the Ottoman Empire crumbled and the Zionist movement took root.

In 1920, the League of Nations approved the British Mandate of Palestine, unleashing tensions over Britain's Balfour Declaration that promised historic Palestine as a homeland for the Jewish people. More Palestinians crossed the Atlantic and braved treks across the Andes by mule to reach far-flung Chile. That same year, Club Palestino was created by a group of Palestinian soccer enthusiasts who gathered one winter day in Chile's southern city of Osorno.

""My father told me they came here because there were more possibilities,"" said 90-year-old Juan Sabaj Dhimes in Patronato, a historically Palestinian neighborhood in the capital, with its coffee shops and hookah bars splashed in the colors of the Palestinian national flag and plastered with Palestino club crests.

Chile's Palestinian community exploded after the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation -- in which more than 700,000 Palestinians fled or were pushed from their homes in what Arabs call the Nakba, or ""catastrophe,"" and dispersed all over the world.

Chile was then an upwardly mobile nation among poorer neighbors seeking to attract migrants to populate the country. Palestinian descendants say the arid land, coastal desert and fresh figs and olives conjured an earlier generation's nostalgia for historic Palestine.

""The climate is one of the things that most captivated the Palestinians who arrived,"" said Mauricio Abu-Ghosh, former president of Chile's Palestinian Federation.

The scrappy soccer club went professional in 1947, becoming the pride of the community. Rocketing to Chile's top division and clinching five official titles, its appeal soon stretched to the Middle East, where the descendants of Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan still congregate in camps and cafes to catch Palestino matches broadcast by satellite network Al Jazeera.

The team's political message also won supporters across Chile -- a soccer-crazed country with a spirit of social activism and an ex-protest leader as president -- and beyond.

Despite of being a small soccer club, with an average of only about 2,000 spectators per game, Deportivo Palestino -- winner of five official titles and a regular fixture in continental tournaments -- is the third most followed Chilean club on Instagram, with more than 741,000 followers, only behind eternal rivals Universidad de Chile (791,000) and Colo-Colo (2.3 million).

""They tell us about the violence suffered by their people,"" said 20-year-old Chilean fan Luis Torres at Palestino's home stadium in Santiago. ""It makes me angry, sad, so we're here to bring a bit of joy.""

Joy has been harder to come by in the Palestinian diaspora since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack triggered Israel's bombardment and invasion of the Gaza Strip, which has killed over 40,000 Palestinians and spawned a humanitarian catastrophe.

Palestinians streaming out of church in Patronato on a recent Sunday said they had prayed for the safety of their families in Gaza. ""We all have cousins, siblings, grandparents who still live there,"" said Khamis.

The war has wrenched Palestino, forcing the club's training school in Gaza to shut down and disrupting programs it supports across the occupied West Bank.

But within Chile it has breathed new life into players and fans. Before kickoff, the team now rushes the pitch clad in keffiyehs, brandishing anti-war banners and taking a knee.

In May the team abandoned one little pre-match ritual of emerging on the field holding hands with child mascots. Instead, players extended their arms to the side, grasping at empty space.

It was a subtle gesture -- a tribute to the ""invisible children"" killed in Gaza, the team later explained -- that could have been lost entirely on ordinary soccer fans.

This crowd, however, went wild. ___"
CBS host grills Ta-Nehisi Coates on anti-Israel views in new book: Looks like it came from 'an extremist',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-host-grills-ta-nehisi-coates-anti-israel-views-new-book-looks-like-came-from-an-extremist,2024-10-01T20:50:22Z,"CBS Mornings anchor Tony Dokoupil pressed author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates on whether he believed Israel had a right to exist in a Monday interview.

""CBS Mornings"" anchor Tony Dokoupil grilled author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates over whether he believed Israel had ""a right to exist"" in a tense interview on Monday.

Coates appeared on the show to preview his new book, ""The Message,"" which is a collection of new essays by the best-selling author about his travels to different parts of the world.

""In the book's longest section, Coates travels to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how easily we are misled by nationalist narratives, and the tragedy that lies in the clash between the stories we tell and the reality of life on the ground,"" the book summary says.

Dokoupil confronted Coates on this section of the book, telling him bluntly that it read like something you would find in ""the backpack of an extremist.""

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES ACROSS ISRAEL

""I have to say, when I read the book, I imagine if I took your name out of it, took away the awards, the acclaim, took the cover off the book, publishing house goes away, the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,"" Dokoupil said.

""So then I found myself wondering, why does Ta'Nehisi Coates, who I've known for a long time, read his work for a long time, very talented, smart guy, leave out so much? Why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it? Why leave out that Israel deals with terror groups that want to eliminate it? Why not detail anything of the first and the second Intifada, the café bombings, the bus bombings, the little kids blown to bits. Is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?"" the CBS anchor continued.

Coates defended the book, saying he sought to give a voice to the Palestinian people, whose views he argued were underrepresented in the American media.

""I would say the perspective that you just outlined, there is no shortage of that perspective in American media,"" Coates replied.

""I have asked repeatedly in my interviews whether there is a single network, mainstream organization, in America with a Palestinian-American bureau chief or correspondent who actually has a voice to articulate that part the world. I've been a reporter for 20 years. The reporters are those who believe more sympathetically about Israel and its right to exist don't have a problem getting their voice out. But what I saw in Palestine, what I saw on the West Bank, what I saw in Haifa in Israel, what I saw in the South Hebron Hills, those were the stories I have not heard. Those were the stories that I was most occupied with,"" he continued.

Coates also said the 260-page book was not meant to be a ""treatise on the entirety of the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis.""

Dokoupil continued to press the far-left author, claiming his book would leave readers questioning why Israel even existed.

""But if you were to read this book you would be left wondering why does any of Israel exist? What a horrific place committing horrific acts on a daily basis. So I think the question is central and key: If Israel has a right to exist. And if your answer is no, then I guess the question becomes why do the Palestinians have a right to exist? Why do 20 different Muslim countries have a right to exist?"" Dokoupil asked.

Coates rejected the question, saying that countries are established by force, not rights, and that Israel already exists.

Dokoupil said the author's book ""delegitimizes"" Israel's foundation and ""seems like an effort to topple the whole building of it.""

""What is it that so particularly offends you about the existence of a Jewish state, that is a Jewish safe place, and not any of the other states out there?"" he asked Coates.

""There's nothing that offends me about a Jewish state,"" Coates retorted. ""I am offended by the idea of states built on ethnocracy, no matter where they are.""

""Muslim included?"" Dokoupil asked.

""I would not want a state where any group of people laid down their citizenship rights based on ethnicity,"" Coates said. He explained how he personally witnessed the ""two-tier system"" in Israel, where Palestinians had less freedom and access to resources in ""occupied territories"" than Israelis.

""I'm working with the person that is guiding me, a Palestinian whose father, whose grandfather and grandmother was born in this town. And I have more freedom to walk than he does. He can't ride on certain roads. He can't get water in the same way that Israeli citizens who live less than a mile away from him can,"" Coates said.

The two continued to spar as Dokoupil suggested Coates had portrayed a one-sided view of the conflict.

""But why is that?"" the anchor pressed. ""Why is there no agency in this book for the Palestinians? They exist in your narrative merely as victims of the Israelis, as though they were not offered peace at any juncture, as though they don't have a stake in this -- "" he asked.

Coates appealed to his own ancestry and America's history with racism to defend his particular viewpoint on the conflict in Gaza.

""I have a very, very, very moral compass about this. Again, perhaps it's because of my ancestry. Either apartheid is right or it's wrong. It's really, really simple. Either what I saw was right or it's wrong,"" he explained.

""I am against a state that discriminates against people on the basis of ethnicity. I'm against that. There is nothing the Palestinians could do that would make that okay for me. My book is not based on the hyper-morality of the Palestinian people,"" he went on to say.

Coates' new book was released on Tuesday, the same day that Iran launched dozens of missiles against Israel.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said its latest barrage of missiles is in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike late last week and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned citizens to shelter in place and follow instructions from the Home Front Command as the Jewish State's Iron Dome anti-missile defense system works to intercept incoming rockets."

""Real Time"" host Bill Maher took aim at rapper Macklemore over his ""F--- America"" declaration at an anti-Israel event.

The Grammy-winning artist went viral this week for his appearance at Seattle's ""Palestine Will Live Forever Festival"" which raised money for various groups, including the controversial agency known as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which Israeli officials have declared is strongly tied to Hamas, leading to the firing of nine UNRWA staffers allegedly involved in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.

Israeli officials have declared that UNRWA is strongly tied to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The U.N. itself announced in August that nine UNRWA staffers would be fired due to possible involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel.

""Straight up, say it. I'm not gonna stop you. I'm not gonna stop you,"" Macklemore said, appearing to reference chants from the crowd.

""Yeah, F--- America,"" he said, sparking cheers from the audience.

BILL MAHER: TRUMP IS 'RIGHT' ABOUT THE DANGEROUS RHETORIC AIMED AT HIM, 'BUT HE IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY!'

That didn't sit well with Maher, who addressed the rapper's declaration during his closing monologue.

""I'm sure it was a big hit with the Queers for Gaza crowd, literally advocating for a government that would imprison you or kill you for being queer from the safety and security of a country that doesn't do that,"" Maher said.

""Yes, America. The only place in the world where a White guy from the suburbs could become a millionaire rapper because here, every person, regardless of race, class or gender has the right to be talent-free,"" he added.

BILL MAHER TRASHES KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING 'FULL OF S---' ON ISRAEL, MIDDLE EAST: 'JUST SHUT UP'

In a follow-up statement on Instagram, Macklemore seemed to back down from his attack on America: ""My thoughts and feelings are not always expressed perfectly or politely."" He added, ""Sometimes I slip up and get caught in the moment. Saturday night was one of those times. I strive to always lead with love in an effort to bring people together and never to create more division.""

He concluded, ""Unfortunately, the historic event in my hometown that brought thousands of people together to raise awareness and money for the people of Palestine has become overshadowed by two words. I wish I had been in a better place with my grief and anger. But the truth is I'm not ok. I haven't been.""

Maher began his monologue by praising Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for helping Democrats be more patriotic at this year's DNC convention, but lamented their sentiment hasn't resonated with younger people.

""The protests that started off as justice for Palestine have morphed into a broader kind of America is the problem, 'We f---ed up the whole world' thing,"" Maher said.

""Guess what document allows you to chant 'Hey hey, ho ho' followed by something really stupid,"" Maher asked them before answering with the Constitution.

BILL MAHER MAKES THIS BOLD 2024 PREDICTION AFTER TRUMP-HARRIS DEBATE

After citing a study alleging four out of ten Gen Zers believe the Founding Fathers are ""better described as villains,"" Maher noted that how young some of them were including 18-year-old James Monroe, 21-year-old Alexander Hamilton and 25-year-old James Madison.

""They were the Gen Z of their day, and when they were your age, they started a country. What the f--- have you done?"" Maher asked.

""History is complicated, and Gen Z reasoning is not. They think they're pure, but they're really just simplistic. They know two things: White people did some very bad things and- no, that's it. That's all they know,"" Maher said, later adding ""The citizens of Gaza cannot assemble in protest of their own government, cannot do or say what they want or practice whatever religion they want, or have a free press, all rights guaranteed in just our First Amendment! The irony in all of this is that the world the founders birth, flawed though it may be, provides the bedrock for everything that makes life good for the very people who hate them so much.""

""It's so easy to take for granted individual liberty, a bill of rights, the rule of law, checks and balances, getting a trial by jury, the peaceful transfer of power, protecting minority rights and democracy itself, but those are the things that make our pampered, privileged, bratty lives so relatively cushy. No one starves here, even our poor people are fat,"" he continued. ""Why do millions of people every year risk their lives to come here? Because they want what we got! The founders were flawed, but they did build a place the whole world wants to break into. No one is paying a coyote to smuggle them into India or Russia. Immigrants don't see us as the problem. They see us as a solution. And there's a reason they kill themselves to get here.""

"Palestinian President Abbas slams Israel, US during UN speech as critics decry his support for terrorism",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/palestinian-president-abbas-slams-israel-us-during-un-speech-critics-decry-his-support-terrorism,2024-09-26T16:47:24Z,"JERUSALEM -- Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority, once again delivered a stridently anti-Israel speech at the U.N. on Thursday, where he also praised the anti-Israel protests across the U.S. and condemned Washington for its support of Israel.

Abbas, who presented a 12-point plan for a post-war Gaza that calls for a permanent cease-fire, accused the Jewish state of committing genocide, while calling for its expulsion from the U.N. and taking aim at the Biden Administration for vetoing Security Council resolutions on the issue, while supplying arms to the Israelis.

He charged the U.S. ""furnished Israel with the deadly weapons that it used to kill thousands of innocent civilians, children and women. And this further encouraged Israel to continue with aggression.""

Abbas started his speech by questioning Israel's legitimacy: ""We will not leave. We will not leave. We will not leave. Palestine is our homeland. It is the land of our fathers, our grandfathers. It will remain ours. And if anyone were to leave, it would be the occupying usurpers.""

EXTREMISTS RISE IN NEW PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY GOVERNMENT AS BIDEN THREATENS ISRAEL OVER GAZA WAR

""Abbas spoke for 26 minutes and did not say the word 'Hamas' once. Since the massacre of October 7, Abbas has failed to condemn Hamas for their crimes against humanity,"" Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon charged in a statement following the speech.

Yet while leaders from around the world watched his UNGA speech, some critics complain the 88-year-old's rule and domination of Palestinian politics in the West Bank (known in Israel by its biblical name of Judea and Samaria in Israel) has done little for the Palestinian cause.

Abbas was born Safed duing the British mandate period [now in Israel]). His family fled to Syria when Arab armies invaded Israel to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state.

Abbas has been accused of rewarding Palestinian terrorism via the infamous ""pay for slay"" system that supports financial stipends for convicted Palestinian terrorists and their family members.

He has also garnered a reputation over the decades as an anti-American agitator who stokes wild antisemitic conspiracy theories. Just last month, Abbas delivered a speech to the Turkish parliament, where he announced that that ""America is the plague, and the plague is America"" and ""We implement Shari'a law: victory or martyrdom.""

Asaf Romirowsky, executive director of Scholars for Peace in the Middle East (SPME), told Fox News Digital that ""Mahmoud Abbas aka Arafat's appointed successor after 20 years has done what Arafat hoped he would, that is maintain a Palestinian stasis while at the same time refusing to root out the corruption within the PA or combat terrorism. Further, as he has shown during his recent speech in the Turkish Parliament, a clear allegiance to Hamas and an endorsement of 10/7, underscoring the consistent antisemitism of his leadership.""

Romirowsky added ""With no heir apparent, Abbas's legacy, as was Arafat's, is that of self-inflicted victimology while maintaining wealth on the back of his own people in the name of the so-called Palestinian struggle.""

MORE THAN A MILLION PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARE NOW DISPLACED; WHY ARE ARAB COUNTRIES NOT OPENING THEIR DOORS?

Fox News Digital reported shortly after Hamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people in Israel on October 7, including over 30 Americans, that the Abbas' PA might compensate convicted Hamas terrorists for their role in the attack.

Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, told Fox News Digital the PA and Abbas ""duplicate all of the corruption, nepotism, and inefficiency of the Palestine Liberation Organization"" that was created by Arafat.

He said ""Abbas does not accept the basic right of the Jewish people to self-determination, and therefore he doesn't recognize the right of the state of Israel to be a nation state of the Jewish people in any borders.""

Michael, who is affiliated with the Misgav Institute continued, ""He has not educated the young generation and has not educated PA officials for peace. On the contrary, Abbas has led and enabled the indoctrination toward hatred and toward delegitimization of the state of Israel.""

In contrast to the U.S.-designated terrorist movement, Hamas, Abbas and the PA are considered to be relatively moderate, according to some Mideast observers.

In 2022, Fox News Digital reported Abbas, issued a shocking diatribe against Israel in the German capital of Berlin, where the Holocaust - the mass extermination of European Jewry - was organized, claiming that the Jewish state has carried out ""50 Holocausts.""

Abbas refused to apologize (or aid in a professional inquiry) in Berlin at the time of the Palestinian Black September massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and a German police officer during the 1972 Munich Olympics."

Gov.

Gretchen Whitmer declined to take a side in a CNN interview when asked about accusations from Rep. Rashida Tlaib against Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.

After facing backlash for refusing to defend her state's attorney general against a suggestion of religious bias, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a statement Monday condemning Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for the ""antisemitic"" allegation.

""The suggestion that Attorney General Nessel would make charging decisions based on her religion as opposed to the rule of law is antisemitic,"" Whitmer wrote in a statement shared by CNN host Jake Tapper. ""Attorney General Nessel has always conducted her work with integrity and followed the rule of law. We must all use our platform and voices to call out hateful rhetoric and racist tropes.""

Whitmer's statement comes one day after she refused to take a side in the feud between the state's Attorney General Dana Nessel and Tlaib, who accused Nessel of bringing charges against anti-Israel campus protesters at the University of Michigan because she is Jewish.

'IS THIS A JOKE?' RASHIDA TLAIB FURIOUS AT BLINKEN FOR CELEBRATING GENEVA CONVENTIONS ANNIVERSARY

Nessel, Michigan's first Jewish attorney general, charged nine university students for refusing to leave the anti-Israel encampments in May after police ordered them to vacate, the Detroit Metro Times reported. They are being charged with trespassing and resisting or obstructing a police officer, according to the outlet. Two additional people were charged with attempted ethnic intimidation and malicious destruction of personal property at a separate anti-Israel protest.

Tlaib, a 'Squad' member and vocal critic of Israel, suggested that the charges from Nessel were ""shameful"" and religiously motivated, telling the Detroit Metro Times in an interview, ""it seems that the Attorney General decided if the issue was Palestine, she was going to treat it differently, and that alone speaks volumes about possible biases within the agency she runs.""

Nessel responded on X, ""Rashida Tlaib should not use my religion to imply I cannot perform my job fairly as Attorney General. It's anti-Semitic and wrong.'""

In an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, Tapper asked Whitmer whether she agrees with Nessel, a Democrat, that Tlaib's accusation about her charging anti-Israel campus demonstrators because of her personal religious bias was rooted in antisemitism.

""Do you think Attorney General Nessel is not doing her job? Because Congresswoman Tlaib is suggesting that she shouldn't be prosecuting these individuals that Nessel says broke the law, and that she's only doing it because she's Jewish, and the protesters are not,"" Tapper asked. ""That's quite an accusation. Do you think it's true?""

""I'm not going to get in the middle of this argument that they're having,"" Whitmer replied. ""I can just say this: We do want to make sure that students are safe on our campuses, and we recognize that every person has the right to make their statement about how they feel about an issue, a right to speak out. And I'm going to use every lever of mine to ensure that both are true.""

Her hesitation to defend Nessel caught the attention of Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, who scolded the governor for failing to support her attorney general.

""@GovWhitmer, when your attorney general prosecutes people for violating the law, harassing Jews, and attacking police officers, it's in the interest of public safety.

""I know that seeing the incredible toll that this war has taken on both communities has been really, really challenging and difficult, and my heart breaks for so many.

Portland Public Schools bars teachers from 'personal or political' classroom displays amid anti-Israel clash,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/portland-public-schools-bars-teachers-from-personal-political-classroom-displays-after-anti-israel-clash,2024-09-22T17:07:01Z,"Tara Faul never paid much attention to politics. But after 2020, the homeschooling mom picked up a camera and started documenting Portland's decline.

Portland Public Schools has adopted a new rule barring teachers from displaying their personal views on a ""political or personal issue"" in the classroom.

According to The Oregonian, the new guidance was ""quietly"" adopted under an administrative directive on August 24.

""Content on classroom walls, bulletin boards or otherwise displayed in the classroom must be related to the curriculum or district sponsored pursuant to [the district's academic freedom policy],"" the rule says. ""Those spaces cannot be used for an employee's personal expression whether that is related to a political or personal issue.""

Portland Public Schools told Fox News Digital that the new rule has been in the works for a year and ""acts as a reminder to all of our student-centered mission and also reminds our staff to use District spaces for educational purposes.""

""The AD is content neutral, and we believe supports the goal of remaining focused on creating a rich educational environment for students,"" the statement said.

PORTLAND PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO FACTOR IN GENDER IDENTITY, RACE INTO SCHOOL DISCIPLINE: 'COMPLETELY BACKWARDS'

""Personal expression by employees is not in furtherance of PPS's academic purposes. Academic purposes, of course, will vary depending on the course content. Displays should be focused on student's needs and tethered to the curriculum, not on the personal views of the teacher,"" the statement continued.

The spokesperson confirmed that the new guidance does not bar teachers from displaying pro-LGBTQ or pro-Black Lives materials in the classroom.

""The rainbow flag and BLM poster are district-approved symbols of inclusion to often marginalized students. Posters advocating for specific positions on political positions are not student centered in that they are not rooted in our educational mission or curriculum,"" they said to Fox News Digital.

PORTLAND TEACHERS UNION PUBLISHES GUIDEBOOK ON 'ORGANIZING FOR PALESTINE' IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS

The new guidance comes months after teachers' unions clashed with district leaders over whether teachers had the right to engage in pro-Palestinian activism in the classroom.

Oregon Educators for Palestine, in association with the Portland Association of Teachers ""PAT,"" released a guide titled ""Know Your Rights! Teaching & Organizing for Palestine Within Portland Public Schools,"" allegedly in response to teachers being censored and facing ""discrimination and harassment"" at ""the hands of PPS District leadership.""

The handbook alleges that teachers were censored for their pro-Palestinian activism in schools, which included assigning students work ""on the topics of Settler Colonialism and Zionism.""

Portland Public Schools responded to these accusations in June, saying in a statement, ""It is our expectation that staff create these spaces by facilitating respectful, age-appropriate, and standards-based learning and contextualization of major world events such as the ongoing Israel-Hamas war or, before that, the war in Ukraine.""

""When these expectations of staff are not met - such as when a teacher engages in political advocacy while working - our process is to talk with the teacher about our expectations and direct corrections, removal, or replacement of inappropriate content,"" the statement to Fox News Digital continued.

According to The Oregonian, the new policy restricting teachers from displaying their personal views on political issues has already been put into practice.

Administrators at Grant High removed a ""Stop the Genocide"" poster from a social studies teachers' doorway earlier this month.

The school's principal reportedly said in an email the poster violated the ""PPS policy regarding political speech.""

The Portland Association of Teachers has filed a grievance with the district over the new rule.

The union alleges the guidance conflicts with ""contractual language on academic freedom, which allows teachers to introduce controversial topics that are relevant to their courses, and PAT's right to post union related materials in schools,"" according to The Oregonian."

The BBC is the largest and most 'trusted' brand in journalism. We know this, because the BBC tells us. It earns this sobriquet by dint of its past glories, and the fact that it is legally obliged to produce 'impartial' news. In return for this promise, it is paid more than $5 billion per year by the British public.

The Asserson Report, which I published earlier this month, takes a deep dive into four months of BBC news coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. We look at some 9 million words of output using a traditional litigation style analysis. In parallel, a team of data scientists (operating as the Research for Impartial media - RIMe) conducted a series of experiments using cutting-edge AI techniques. Working independently, yet collaboratively, these two disciplines found strikingly similar results, exposing the myth of BBC impartiality.

'CORROSIVELY WOKE' BBC CONTINUES TO BE PLAGUED BY RETRACTIONS, APOLOGIES RELATED TO ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

We analyzed BBC English language TV output. While some programs were neutral, the remainder were between 90% and 100% pro-Palestinian/anti-Israeli.

The BBC broke almost every rule in its own rule-book - the 'Editorial Guidelines.' They use BBC as a platform for Hamas sympathizers, and Hamas members; they report death figures they know to be wrong without adequately conveying their unreliability to audiences; they air reports from Gaza without mentioning that Hamas controls journalistic output; their own

journalists express personal opinions. Each of these is a separate breach of the BBC's own guidelines on impartiality.

While we found that BBC English was disappointingly bad, we found that BBC Arabic was significantly worse. In a 'sympathy analysis' conducted by the RIMe data scientists across global media, BBC Arabic was snuggled up with such outlets as Al Jazeera; Palestine Chronicle and Iraqi News. It must surely degrade trust in the BBC to discover that it is being used to peddle extremist views.

The BBC News machine displays a strong anti-Israel view from almost every angle we analyzed. Any pretense at impartiality seems to have been abandoned. Indeed, its lead Middle East journalist, Jeremy Bowen, recently boasted that he considers impartiality means him telling the audience what he considers to be 'the truth.' This is the precise opposite of what the Editorial Guidelines dictate.

So, how has the BBC drifted so far from its roots? There are two answers. Firstly - the BBC has been captured by an institutional bias on many issues. Journalists who insist on expressing their own opinions should be shifted to somewhere less harmful - Gardener's Question Time, comes to mind - or they should be removed altogether. This seems rarely, if ever, to happen.

Secondly, and more fundamentally, BBC management needs to get a grip on their most sacred product - news. They need to set targets; monitor output, adjust when targets are not hit; and take steps against recalcitrant journalists and editors. At present, the BBC senior management sets no KPI's; sets no goals; conducts no systematic monitoring of output and is essentially running blind. They hope their journalists will achieve impartiality, but take no effective steps to ensure they do. They have let go of the rudder, and are allowing the BBC to be blown where the winds take it. That means that a bunch of very self-opinionated journalists, many of whom display deeply malevolent views about Israel, control the output.

The Asserson Report blows the myth of impartiality out of the water. The BBC doesn't achieve impartiality and is not remotely close to achieving it. BBC management must either take back control of the ship, or the British people should demand a refund."

"The Mind's Mirror, Risk And Reward In The Age Of AI, Review Part 1",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnwerner/2024/10/10/the-minds-mirror-risk-and-reward-in-the-age-of-ai-review-part-1/,2024-10-10T21:06:15Z,"In the initial part of this book by Daniela Rus and Gregory Mone, we look at the application of AI to various powers or competencies that impact our world.

(Since the book is mainly in Rus's voice, we'll refer to her for author quotes, etc., while recognizing the joint authorship.)

So what are these enumerated powers?

First, there's speed, where Rus talks about accelerated production processes, citing examples like research on protein folding, or the writing of a novel.

Reading this, we get the idea that many of these applications are assistive technologies - that they build on what humans are already doing, and help them to do it more quickly and more efficiently. Rather than replacing human work, whether it's in medicine, retail, manufacturing or anything else, the AI is more likely to be a decision support resource.

In the 'knowledge' chapter, Rus talks about the idea of infinite libraries, and the ways that we access knowledge with AI.

On the one hand, Rus provides the example of cows, illustrating how granular data on something that we consider banal can give us surprising Insights that are novel and interesting.

She also talks about separating the noise from the signal in something like astrophysics.

""Picking out the tell-tale signal of a gravity wave is like trying to hear a faint whisper on the far side of the arena during a Taylor Swift concert,"" she writes.

Looking into how this kind of knowledge requisition might work practically, Rus suggests that some day we'll have 'subject-focused and industry-focused AI libraries' that will be handy for areas like agriculture that are already benefiting from so much of the data analysis coming out of AI engines in terms of soil use, seed engineering, crop harvesting and much more.

In the chapter on insight, Rus talks about how to explain this concept to a seven-year-old child, and suggests that a lot of insight is about uncovering hidden connections.

She cites Thomas Kuhn's The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, suggesting there are periodic paradigm shifts that disrupt the iterative improvements that we are used to making in science.

One example that she uses is the shift from geocentric to heliocentric context - when we first figured out that the earth revolves around the sun.

Our AI moment is a little like that - it changes so much about what we previously knew and thought, and how we performed and worked!

She talks about an ""AI physicist"" as a digital detective, helping us move into a new of scientific knowledge.

Further in developing this concept, Rus cites applications like sleep research where intelligent engines monitor oxygen levels, brain activity, breathing, eye movement, heart rate, and more. Versatile digital systems and small wearable monitors can replace labor-intensive on-site sleep studies, and really revolutionize this aspect of healthcare.

""Imagine if systems like this were active all the time,"" Rus writes, giving the example of 'Emerald', a high-tech invisible stethoscope that can gather and interpret this kind of granular health data.

Then we move to a chapter on creativity, which Rus refers to as ""an innate capacity to step beyond the bounds of the known and habitual patterns and to venture into the realm of the unexpected and uncharted.""

Citing 'punctuated evolution' and breakthrough ideas, Rus talks about how AI accentuates human creativity, while leaving the writer's ""creative fingerprints"" on their work.

""A great writer does not copy,"" she writes. ""A great writer is copied.""

The authors, in general, seem upbeat about the march toward progress, tempering concerns with a silver lining of opportunity:

""While we must be smart about how we use these tools and how much we rely on their suggestions, there is cause for excitement here,"" Rus writes.

In applying AI work to the concept of mastery, Rus cites a Korean program at the Gwangju Institute of Science to track granular data on badminton players and things like the movement of the shuttlecock, illustrating how capabilities can be analyzed and researched.

She cited the classic film ""The Matrix,"" in which the character Neo gets downloaded skills through a digital interface. This, she suggests, is an exaggeration of what AI can now do, but it is useful in thinking about how these tools can speed up all kinds of human mastery.

""I don't expect that AI will accelerate learning to that extent, but the tools we are developing today will expand our options for education, both as children and adults, allowing us to achieve proficiency and potentially even mastery at a faster pace and with less pain. These tools could allow more young people to benefit from the sort of personalized tutoring that has long been limited to the privileged few.""

Rus points to three key traits of AI tutors that are unique: 1. AI tutors know everything 2. They monitor face and body movements 3: they never watch the clock. In some ways, she suggests, it's all about engagement. Talking about technologies like holograms, Rus suggests that one of the key achievements of AI will be in keeping people engaged and interested in what they're being taught.

Calling mastery ""a high-level of command, understanding, and even artistry,"" Rus notes how famed mathematician Stephen Wolfram compares GPT to the telephone, acknowledging the inflection point that we are in as a society.

Lastly, Rus talks about the applications of AI to empathy. She describes various kinds of empathy 'markers' that are present in face and body movements, and talks about how they may be able to help us transcend language, to understand people in different parts of the world through vibrant real-time interpretations.

Describing, for example, Israel and Palestine, and how avatars and programs about the conflict can come to increase understanding across cultural barriers, Rus suggests AI might have a place here as well.

This ends the first section of the book, which is geared towards helping us imagine a brighter future with the technologies that are now developing in our hands. We'll come out with two more posts on this new guide to modern innovation."
Extinct Biblical Tree Resurrected From Ancient Seed Found In Cave,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2024/09/27/extinct-biblical-tree-resurrected-from-ancient-seed-found-in-cave/,2024-09-27T08:43:22Z,"A 1,000 year old seed discovered in a cave in the Judean desert has sprouted, grown and reached maturity, and appears to have medicinal qualities.

A mysterious ancient seed recovered during archaeological excavations of a cave near Jerusalem has grown into a tree that may be the source of a medicinal balm mentioned in the Bible, according to a newly published study.

The seed was discovered in a Judean Desert cave in the late 1980s, and radiocarbon analysis indicated it was approximately 1000 years old. The seed likely survived from a now-extinct population of trees that existed in the Southern Levant, a region comprising modern-day Israel, Palestine and Jordan, and is the first of its kind to be found there.

Tests suggested that the 2 cm long (slightly less than one inch; Figure 1a) seed was still viable, so the research team planted and carefully tended it. It took around 5 weeks to sprout. Now, 14 years later, the tree has reached maturity (Figure 1). Researchers named their tree ""Sheba"" to honor of the Queen, Sheba, who brought the balsam root from Arabia to King Solomon as a gift.

""Sheba"" is approximately 3 m (10 feet) tall, its bark is pale green-brown and peels in thin, papery sheets revealing a dark green, possibly photosynthetic, bark below. ""Sheba"" is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the cooler months of December-April.

""'Sheba', an unknown Commiphora species with a unique genetic fingerprint, may represent an extinct taxon once native to this region whose resin 'tsori' mentioned in Biblical texts was valuable, associated with healing but not described as fragrant,"" summarized the researchers in their study (ref).

DNA analysis revealed that ""Sheba"" is a unique species of Commiphora, which are distributed across Africa, Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula and known for their aromatic gum resins. With approximately 190 scientifically described species known, the drought-resistant Commiphora is the most species-rich genus of flowering plants in the frankincense and myrrh family, Burseraceae. Historically, these highly fragrant species provided highly prized aromatic resins that served as the basis for various fragrances, incenses and for medicinal uses.

However, GC-MS analysis has detected minimal fragrance from the leaves, bark and resin, indicating that ""Sheba"" is probably an extinct species of Commiphora that instead creates a resinous healing extract. Indeed, wounding the bark produces a small amount of clear oleoresin, that has been used to reduce inflammation in human patients. The researchers also found an oil, a type of squalene, also with antioxidant properties that may have been applied topically to lubricate and protect the skin.

Because the seed was found in a cave, it is likely that the people living in the region planted these trees, suggesting that they were aware of its medicinal qualities. Thus, the research team proposes that resin from the tree might be the mysterious ""tsori,"" a medicinal compound mentioned several times in the bible. Tsori was highly prized in the ancient world and was exported throughout the Roman Empire. Previous research suggested that in addition to its healing properties, tsori was used as a perfume and incense, for embalming, and even as an antidote to poisons.

That said, currently, it is unclear what species ""Sheba"" belongs to, because the tree has not flowered, and therefore hasn't produced the reproductive material scientists need to carry out more detailed species-level analyses. At this time, it is not clear if ""Sheba"" will ever flower.

Nonetheless, the researchers concluded that ""Sheba"" represents an extinct lineage of trees that was once widespread and common throughout the Levant but seems to have disappeared by the 9th century. Of course, this points to the important question: why did these trees go extinct?

Non-Profit Organizations With Impact,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nelldebevoise/2024/09/17/non-profit-organizations-with-impact/,2024-09-17T12:23:11Z,"I learned a lot about the Job Sphere during my time in the not-for-profit sector (though I didn't call it that at the time). Let's start with what we were doing. By the IRS's definition, as employees of 501c3 organizations, what we were doing was ""good"" for the people we served, as described in our mission statement. In reality, I saw a lot of useless efforts: some of what we did didn't meet those people's needs and, worse, some caused harm due to how we did it.

I was hired to do a needs assessment of local youth centers in Palestine that a major global funder was considering as grant recipients. The funding came with a requirement to meet a 50/50 gender mix for participants in the centers' programs within one year. There were a few brave families in this conservative community who started sending their daughters to one of the centers after having gotten over concerns of physical safety, philosophical differences, and conflicts with the students' school obligations. Still, there were usually conditions for joining, such as having to be in a girls-only program with a female facilitator or staying in the same classroom or activity as their brother. Building trust with families was a long, slow path. Clearly, the center wouldn't get to that 50/50 mix within a year unless they reduced the size of the programs to the handful of girls whose families permitted them to come with a matching number of boys. But this approach would underutilize both the centers' capacity to serve youth and the funding provided.

I relayed all this to the funder. Hoping to leverage my privilege as a White American with deep commitment to equity, I explained the center leader's commitment to equity and the need to pursue it in a more realistic time frame and format that would work in his community. A few days later, the global funder made the grant to this center and four others -- which included a requirement of equal participation by gender within 12 months at risk of rescinding funding in the second year. By demanding equal gender participation to serve their own vision rather than honoring the cultural context, this major international funder caused great harm to staff of these youth centers as well as hundreds of youths and their families, to say nothing of reinforcing the image of international development as paternalistic and inept at solving real problems.

So even in the not-for-profit sector, where the IRS is in charge of mandating that organizations do work that's intended to be good for the world, the specific choices people make about what to do and how to do it can cause harm.

Indeed, I was the example of a bad leader in some situations! I remember with great discomfort several phone calls, workshops, and staff meetings in which I barked at a youth leader, community member, or colleague. Whether they were late with a deliverable, misunderstanding my point, or refusing to try my brilliant idea, I applied some combination of withholding approval, shame, and unconstructive criticism.

Over time, I was able to recognize these errors within a matter of days or hours and apologize. Sometimes I was able to repair the relationship during that conversation and revisit the issue at hand to reach a solution that worked for everyone involved -- most importantly, the people we were trying to serve. But in other cases, my errors led to a trust deficit for days or weeks that (rightly) took me days or weeks to repair. And in that time, none of us was able to do the work we were there to do as effectively as we could have. This might've been different had I been making the Self Sphere investments necessary to stay empathetic, non-judgmental, and present in listening to the challenge presented.

I certainly don't intend to suggest that the not-for-profit sector does no good in the world; on the contrary. But I want these examples to illuminate the fact that having impact in the Job Sphere is more complex than having a job that saves lives or shapes young minds. There are plenty of ways to have great outcomes and align with your purpose in every single job on the planet."
