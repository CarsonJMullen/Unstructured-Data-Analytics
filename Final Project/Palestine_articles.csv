Opinion | How Israel's invasion of Lebanon could spiral into a massive regional war,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-lebanon-war-iran-hezbollah-biden-rcna173364,2024-10-04T16:30:43Z,"An expert explains why Israel's intensifying war on Hezbollah is risky for the region.

Israel moved military forces into southern Lebanese territory Monday, an invasion that marks a major new level of intensity in about a year of conflict with Hezbollah. The paramilitary organization fired rockets at Israeli positions in the Shebaa Farms the day after Oct. 7 ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people after Hamas' attacks on Israel. (That area is a disputed territory which Lebanon and Syria say belongs to Lebanon, and Israel controls and says belongs to Syria.) Hezbollah, sometimes called a state within a state, is backed by Iran and does not have widespread support in Lebanon.

Then Tuesday, Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, citing last week's assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and, this summer, the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

The Biden administration has long opposed an Israeli incursion into Lebanon. But in the past year, the administration has also been unwilling to take any meaningful steps to rein in Israel's behavior, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acting boldly to assert more dominance in the region and degrade Israel's adversaries -- with a continued disregard for civilian lives. Israeli airstrikes have struck medical facilities and already killed hundreds of civilians in Lebanon. The probability of a regional war seems to be growing by the day.

To better understand the unfolding conflict, I called Nick Blanford, a Beirut-based fellow at the Atlantic Council and the author of ""Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel.""

Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Zeeshan Aleem: What is happening right now and how do we know when to say whether this is a new war?

Nicholas Blanford: I think you have to put the developments of the last few weeks into some context. One day after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Hezbollah staged a pro forma attack against Israeli positions along the Lebanon-Israel border, and it dedicated this attack to its allies -- Hamas in Gaza. But very quickly it turned into a kind of a tit-for-tat, daily attacks. The Hezbollah guys would attack Israeli military positions along the border; the Israelis would retaliate with artillery fire airstrikes into south Lebanon. And this really continued from October almost uninterrupted.

There was a clear moment in September when Israel's patience ran out. And they escalated in a very dramatic fashion, by detonating thousands of pagers which they'd been able, apparently, to booby trap. The following day, they detonated hundreds of walkie-talkies. That was followed up by intense airstrikes across areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a presence. And those attacks have intensified over the past two weeks, climaxing on Sept. 27 with the massive airstrike on Hezbollah's underground headquarters in south Beirut, which killed the veteran Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who has led the group for 32 years. The latest development is the advance of some elite Israeli army units into southern Lebanon where they have reportedly already taken some casualties.

So I would say we are in a war but it is not yet full scale. Both sides are mainly hitting military targets, not infrastructure as well, although hundreds of civilians have been killed in Lebanon.

Could you give us a brief primer on Hezbollah? How it emerged, what it is, what it believes in and its social function in Lebanon?

Blanford: Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organization that follows the Iranian, theocratic system of rule. Hezbollah has a secretary general -- most recently the late Nasrallah -- but the true leader of Hezbollah is the spiritual leader of Iran, currently, Ali Khamenei. He's the ultimate authority and, in general, the Iranians will set the strategic agenda.

Hezbollah emerged after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to kick out the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was deployed in strength in south Lebanon. The Israelis in '82 reached all the way to Beirut and then they gradually withdrew. By 1985, they were occupying a border strip along the Lebanon-Israel border and Hezbollah became the main resistance force against that Israeli occupation. Particularly during the 1990s, Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran but also supported by neighboring Syria, was able to deal blow after blow to the Israeli occupation forces, and that culminated in May 2000 with Israel pulling out of south Lebanon.

Hezbollah refused to put down its arms after the Israelis left. They said, 'We need to keep our arms, our military force, to deter Israel from coming back into south Lebanon.' But there was also another unspoken reason, which is that Hezbollah gradually became a source of deterrence for Iran -- especially after the war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 when it expanded very quickly and acquired a great deal of weaponry from Iran, Syria and elsewhere. So, for Iran, Hezbollah has now become a major force multiplier.

Hezbollah has a slightly schizophrenic character, because it is ideologically beholden to the Islamic leadership of Iran, but of course it is a Lebanese organization. It survives or falls depending on the support it gets from the Lebanese Shia community, which is why, since the beginning, Hezbollah has invested a lot in social welfare organizations.

The Shia population of Lebanon tends to be traditionally fairly downtrodden. They live in the poorer areas of the country, traditionally neglected by central governments. And Hezbollah really stepped in with schools, with hospitals, with repairing war damaged houses, even things like helping farmers with agricultural aid. It's become an indispensable organization for the Lebanese Shia community. So they've been able to maintain that support since the early 1980s.

Other communities: the Christians and Sunnis, in particular, the Druze, to an extent, [say] 'Well, hang on a minute. We do have a national army. Why do we need a Shia militia, armed to the teeth, stronger than many armies around the world, to defend Lebanon?' So there have been growing calls for Hezbollah to disarm, and this is why Hezbollah has moved deeper into Lebanese politics, particularly over the last 19 years, since the 2005 parliamentary elections.

What are the fundamental dynamics driving how Hezbollah and Israel's government see each other, both in terms of geopolitical interests and domestic political interests?

Blanford: Ideologically, Hezbollah and Iran want to see the end of Israel, and the restitution of Palestine to the Palestinians. They have in the past assisted Palestinians during the Al Aqsa Intifada. They would help the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza fight the Israelis. But in the past, they didn't get directly involved. When they kicked the Israelis out of Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah didn't immediately rush across the border into Israel and say, ""We're going to go and liberate Jerusalem now."" There's an acknowledgment that it's up to the Palestinians to liberate themselves, but Hezbollah is definitely there to help.

When you look at it more realistically, the reason why Hezbollah is so powerful now is because the Iranians want them to be. We go back to this notion of Hezbollah forming a key role in Iran's deterrence architecture: The stronger Hezbollah becomes, the safer Iran feels.

The Institute for National Security Studies, a leading think tank in Israel, has for the past few years described Hezbollah as Israel's greatest threat, which is quite remarkable in itself, because we're not talking about a country, we're talking about an organization, albeit one that is backed by a powerful regional country.

The Israelis have watched Hezbollah grow stronger and stronger. What the Israelis are doing now is something they haven't dared to do before, and that is to really go for broke with Hezbollah. What's interesting is I think the Israelis are gambling that Hezbollah and the Iranians do not want a full-scale war with Israel right now. Why? Because if there is a full-scale war, whatever the outcome, Hezbollah will take a huge battering, as indeed we're seeing now, and there's no guarantee that Hezbollah will be able to rebuild, rearm and re-equip as quickly as it did after the 2006 war to continue serving as a deterrence for Iran. In other words, if Hezbollah gets engaged in a full-scale war now, Iran could lose its major deterrence factor in that war, and all this would be for the sake of coming to the support of Hamas in Gaza. Hamas is small fry compared to Hezbollah -- Hezbollah is much, much, much more important to Iran than Hamas. Which is why Hezbollah is still acting with a certain amount of restraint despite Israel's escalated action against it. Hezbollah still has not used its arsenal of precision-guided missiles.

It's a dangerous gamble. It could go wrong. Especially now that Israeli troops are operating on the ground in south Lebanon, Hezbollah's home turf. The current conflict could spill into a major war. We're still below that threshold moment, but if it happens, it has a potential to go regional, dragging in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Can you walk us through the different scenarios you see unfolding here?

Blanford: The least likely one is that a cease-fire comes in. The Americans and the French had an idea for a 21-day cease-fire to calm things down along the Lebanon-Israel border. Netanyahu has rejected it. So that's not going to happen..

A second scenario is that what we're seeing now continues. The Israelis haven't started hitting Lebanese infrastructure, power stations, bridges, roads, the airports, seaports; they are focusing on Hezbollah military targets by using air power and now ground forces, albeit in a limited manner. Hezbollah, by the same token, is striking back at Israeli military targets. They haven't been hitting Israeli infrastructure. Now this could go on even at this heightened rate. But under current circumstances, I suspect that Hezbollah will continue doing what it's doing -- in other words, absorb these blows that the Israelis have inflicted, and keep firing rockets into Israel.

In some respects, the Israeli ground maneuver could play right into Hezbollah's hands, as the Israelis are entering terrain that Hezbollah has had for 18 years [and Hezbollah has been able] to prepare for exactly this eventuality. When the Israelis did move into Lebanon in 2006 after two weeks of aerial bombing, they came in for a big surprise. They didn't understand Hezbollah's underground bunker networks, its ambush positions, firing positions.

You could have a similar scenario this time round, albeit on a larger scale, where the Israelis, who have a better understanding of what Hezbollah is about these days, could come in in force for what they would describe perhaps as a limited incursion to basically rubble-ize and depopulate this broad strip of south Lebanon. But they risk losing a lot of troops because they're going to be operating in Hezbollah's environment. And at the end of it, if the mission is successful, what do you do then? Do you reoccupy south Lebanon? If so, you've gone back to the situation between 1978 and 2000 and that didn't end too well for the Israelis. But if you pull back to the border, then what is to stop Hezbollah basically moving back into the border district and beginning to rebuild?

There could come a point when the Israelis say, 'We've hit all the targets from the air and our soldiers are fighting on the ground but Hezbollah is still firing rockets across the border.' And this is where perhaps a third scenario can kick in: The Israelis conclude that, well, we're going to have to escalate this even further by deploying a larger number of troops into Lebanon to expand the target set to include Lebanese infrastructure as well. It could be at that point that Hezbollah, with Iranian blessing, feels it has no choice but to launch its precision-guided systems at Israeli military and infrastructure targets. This is where the conflict could go regional.

What role does the U.S. have in all this, and what advice would you give to the Biden administration on how to prevent a full-scale regional war from breaking out?

Blanford: Yes, a regional war potentially could happen. If the Iranians assess that Hezbollah is about to get bludgeoned by Israel, they may conclude, 'We've got nothing left to lose. We're about to lose Hezbollah. Let's go large. We'll activate all our proxies across the region, and we'll give it a go and see what happens to Israel.'

I think the Biden administration is in a difficult position. President Biden is enormously frustrated with Netanyahu, partly because of the Gaza conflict going on for so long. But he has been urging Netanyahu since the get-go to not open a second front with Hezbollah. Now you could argue that a second front was open anyway, because of these simmering tit-for-tat attacks that have been going on across the Lebanon-Israel border since October. But these attacks were containable. Hezbollah has said, 'Look, this is a support front that we're doing. Once the war in Gaza ends, we're going to stop.' So the emphasis has been very much on trying to conclude a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which will then have a trickle-down effect and should stabilize the Lebanon-Israel border. But of course, we haven't had a Gaza cease-fire. The conflict continues, and now the Israelis clearly have lost patience with Hezbollah and have gone large.

There's very little that the Biden administration feels it can do, particularly when you've got a very close election coming up in just over a month now. So the Biden administration could do what it's done before, and then suspend arms shipments to Israel, but this time do it properly. Cut off all military support to Israel. That would put a lot of pressure on Netanyahu to start picking up the phone and listening when Biden calls. But I don't think they're going to do that because there'll be a political backlash in the United States, and that could affect Kamala Harris' chances against Donald Trump. I think Netanyahu is taking advantage of this and is going for it."
Suspended Cornell student faces a potential exit from U.S. after pro-Palestinian demonstration,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/cornell-suspended-student-visa-israel-protest-boeing-rcna173914,2024-10-03T21:33:28Z,"International doctoral student Momodou Taal could lose his F-1 visa after he was suspended a second time by his university over his role in a protest against companies that provide weapons to Israel.

Cornell University student Momodou Taal fears he may have to leave the U.S. following his involvement in a pro-Palestinian demonstration last month.

Taal, an international doctoral student from the United Kingdom, teaches a course called ""What Is Blackness?"" at Cornell and has been active in pro-Palestinian advocacy on campus.

But under a new -- and controversial -- university policy governing protests, Taal was one of four students suspended in April after he participated in a pro-Palestinian encampment. And two weeks ago, he joined more than 100 demonstrators at a campus career fair in protest of Boeing and L3Harris being allowed to participate. The two defense contractors have been criticized for providing weapons to Israel.

Taal admits that he joined a crowd of people who entered the career fair, but says that he left after five minutes. Some of the activists reportedly confronted Boeing representatives at the fair.

The university released a statement condemning the demonstration, writing in part:

A university official overseeing student conduct informed Taal in an email last week that he had been suspended again -- after his purported display of ""escalating, egregious behavior and a disregard for the University policies"" -- and was given a no-trespass order that bars him from campus. The official also told Taal that his F-1 student visa would be terminated, which can happen to foreign students who are suspended multiple times, and referred him to an immigration adviser.

Taal alleges that he has been targeted because he is Black and Muslim. The university's interim president, Michael Kotlikoff, has denied any targeting. In a statement Monday, Kotlikoff said that nearly 20 participants in the career fair protest had been identfied and added:

Taal has been granted two shots at appeal. The first -- to Cornell's vice president for student and campus life -- was denied. The second -- to the university provost -- is under review.

In an interview with The ReidOut Blog, Taal said his Black identity has inspired his activism.

""When I think of the best of the Black radical tradition, it always has centered movements in America and beyond,"" he said. ""Wherever they perceive injustice, I have found Black figures at the forefront. Many of the Black figures that I study, they also focus and spoke about Palestine as well in their time.""

Taal, who counts Malcolm X as one of his inspirations, said his situation is indicative of a broader crackdown on free speech on college campuses. And as he awaits word on his appeal and potentially imminent removal from the country, Taal has received an outpouring of liberal support -- including from Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

Taal's destiny is in the hands of the university at this point. And an email he received from his immigration adviser last week warned him that things could move quickly if his appeal is denied.

""There is no grace period for departure from the US once your F-1 record is closed,"" the adviser wrote. ""You should leave either before the end date of your F-1 record or right away after the record is closed."""
CBS host grills Ta-Nehisi Coates on anti-Israel views in new book: Looks like it came from 'an extremist',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-host-grills-ta-nehisi-coates-anti-israel-views-new-book-looks-like-came-from-an-extremist,2024-10-01T20:50:22Z,"CBS Mornings anchor Tony Dokoupil pressed author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates on whether he believed Israel had a right to exist in a Monday interview.

""CBS Mornings"" anchor Tony Dokoupil grilled author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates over whether he believed Israel had ""a right to exist"" in a tense interview on Monday.

Coates appeared on the show to preview his new book, ""The Message,"" which is a collection of new essays by the best-selling author about his travels to different parts of the world.

""In the book's longest section, Coates travels to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how easily we are misled by nationalist narratives, and the tragedy that lies in the clash between the stories we tell and the reality of life on the ground,"" the book summary says.

Dokoupil confronted Coates on this section of the book, telling him bluntly that it read like something you would find in ""the backpack of an extremist.""

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES ACROSS ISRAEL

""I have to say, when I read the book, I imagine if I took your name out of it, took away the awards, the acclaim, took the cover off the book, publishing house goes away, the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,"" Dokoupil said.

""So then I found myself wondering, why does Ta'Nehisi Coates, who I've known for a long time, read his work for a long time, very talented, smart guy, leave out so much? Why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it? Why leave out that Israel deals with terror groups that want to eliminate it? Why not detail anything of the first and the second Intifada, the café bombings, the bus bombings, the little kids blown to bits. Is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?"" the CBS anchor continued.

Coates defended the book, saying he sought to give a voice to the Palestinian people, whose views he argued were underrepresented in the American media.

""I would say the perspective that you just outlined, there is no shortage of that perspective in American media,"" Coates replied.

""I have asked repeatedly in my interviews whether there is a single network, mainstream organization, in America with a Palestinian-American bureau chief or correspondent who actually has a voice to articulate that part the world. I've been a reporter for 20 years. The reporters are those who believe more sympathetically about Israel and its right to exist don't have a problem getting their voice out. But what I saw in Palestine, what I saw on the West Bank, what I saw in Haifa in Israel, what I saw in the South Hebron Hills, those were the stories I have not heard. Those were the stories that I was most occupied with,"" he continued.

Coates also said the 260-page book was not meant to be a ""treatise on the entirety of the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis.""

Dokoupil continued to press the far-left author, claiming his book would leave readers questioning why Israel even existed.

""But if you were to read this book you would be left wondering why does any of Israel exist? What a horrific place committing horrific acts on a daily basis. So I think the question is central and key: If Israel has a right to exist. And if your answer is no, then I guess the question becomes why do the Palestinians have a right to exist? Why do 20 different Muslim countries have a right to exist?"" Dokoupil asked.

Coates rejected the question, saying that countries are established by force, not rights, and that Israel already exists.

Dokoupil said the author's book ""delegitimizes"" Israel's foundation and ""seems like an effort to topple the whole building of it.""

""What is it that so particularly offends you about the existence of a Jewish state, that is a Jewish safe place, and not any of the other states out there?"" he asked Coates.

""There's nothing that offends me about a Jewish state,"" Coates retorted. ""I am offended by the idea of states built on ethnocracy, no matter where they are.""

""Muslim included?"" Dokoupil asked.

""I would not want a state where any group of people laid down their citizenship rights based on ethnicity,"" Coates said. He explained how he personally witnessed the ""two-tier system"" in Israel, where Palestinians had less freedom and access to resources in ""occupied territories"" than Israelis.

""I'm working with the person that is guiding me, a Palestinian whose father, whose grandfather and grandmother was born in this town. And I have more freedom to walk than he does. He can't ride on certain roads. He can't get water in the same way that Israeli citizens who live less than a mile away from him can,"" Coates said.

The two continued to spar as Dokoupil suggested Coates had portrayed a one-sided view of the conflict.

""But why is that?"" the anchor pressed. ""Why is there no agency in this book for the Palestinians? They exist in your narrative merely as victims of the Israelis, as though they were not offered peace at any juncture, as though they don't have a stake in this -- "" he asked.

Coates appealed to his own ancestry and America's history with racism to defend his particular viewpoint on the conflict in Gaza.

""I have a very, very, very moral compass about this. Again, perhaps it's because of my ancestry. Either apartheid is right or it's wrong. It's really, really simple. Either what I saw was right or it's wrong,"" he explained.

""I am against a state that discriminates against people on the basis of ethnicity. I'm against that. There is nothing the Palestinians could do that would make that okay for me. My book is not based on the hyper-morality of the Palestinian people,"" he went on to say.

Coates' new book was released on Tuesday, the same day that Iran launched dozens of missiles against Israel.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said its latest barrage of missiles is in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike late last week and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) warned citizens to shelter in place and follow instructions from the Home Front Command as the Jewish State's Iron Dome anti-missile defense system works to intercept incoming rockets."
Opinion | Israel bombed my home as a result of my journalism. This can't become our new normal.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israels-closure-al-jazeeras-ramallah-office-sends-chilling-message-rcna172845,2024-09-29T14:11:31Z,"This isn't the first time Israel has taken aim at media workers in Palestine, where it attempts to control the narrative in tandem with efforts to control territory.

On Sept. 22, Israeli forces stormed Al Jazeera's Ramallah office and shut down its operations, effectively barring one of the few remaining windows into the realities of life under occupation in the West Bank. The incident, as alarming as it is, extends far beyond the closure of a newsroom and marks an escalation in Israel's broader crackdown on press freedoms in Palestine. For those of us journalists who have reported from the ground, our work has never been just about reporting the news; it's about making visible to the world a reality that shapes every aspect of our daily lives as Palestinians.

This isn't the first time Israel has taken aim at media workers in Palestine, where it attempts to control the narrative in tandem with efforts to control territory. We've seen similar tactics since October of last year, and long before, when tens of Palestinian journalists were killed along with their family members, media offices bombed, and entire news organizations targeted. I've lost colleagues who reported side by side with me from northern Gaza, like Ismail Al Ghoul. Together Ismail and I endured months of cold and hunger, and terrifying nights during Israel's ground offensives. He and so many other dedicated colleagues were killed for speaking out, for doing their job.

I know this because I survived it. As a writer and reporter for Al Jazeera in Gaza during the war from October 2023 until last May, I experienced firsthand the dangers of reporting on the ground, and the scrutiny I was subjected to for being affiliated with Al Jazeera. The press badge on my chest, meant to ensure my safety, functioned as a target. In December 2023, my home was bombed with me and my family inside, as a direct result of my work, after I received multiple threats via phone calls and text messages from the Israeli military ordering me to stop reporting and cease writing.

My own experience in Gaza bears this out. The bombing of my home didn't just shake my personal life by burying me under the rubble for hours -- it disrupted my sense of purpose as a writer and journalist. For days, I questioned whether I could continue reporting. Knowing the cost, my family lived in constant fear every time I went on assignment, while colleagues around me grew increasingly afraid to speak out, knowing that anyone could be a target at any moment.

What we witnessed daily, from drone surveillance and press tents being bombed to the direct shooting at journalists and targeting of their vehicles as they traveled for coverage, was not just an attack on the ones trying to report, but on the very idea of journalism. It is an attack on the notion that the world has a right to know what happens in places like Gaza and the West Bank. Still, we continued to report because we knew the world needed to see what was happening, and we knew that to stop reporting would mean to surrender to the very forces that sought to silence us.

Al Jazeera has been a crucial voice documenting not only the devastation in Gaza, especially as it produces exclusive access and footage to its viewers from the ground, but also the civil unrest and protests within Israel, the political discontent in Tel Aviv, and the deadly raids on refugee camps in the West Bank. Now, with its Ramallah bureau shut down, that voice is fraying. But this is only one episode in Israel's ongoing campaign against the media in the occupied territories.

What's striking is that it comes nearly one year into Israel's war on Gaza, dimming any hope of renewed global attention as people near an anniversary of death and destruction. What concerns me most is that this is more than just about Al Jazeera. It's about the future of a young generation of journalists aspiring to speak out during times of terror and oppression. As someone who reported from right in front of Israeli tanks, I can say that journalists in Palestine are heartbreakingly treated as a threat.

Israel's efforts to silence the free press represent a tragedy that cuts deep into the ongoing struggle for liberation and peace. It's a tragedy for anyone who values the role of the press in democratic societies. When journalists are attacked, the public is denied the information necessary to truly understand reality.

When the press is silenced, it's not just a building that closes or stories that disappear. It's accountability itself that is lost. It cuts off a vital flow of information to the public. And the consequences ripple far beyond the journalists themselves. The world loses access to the ground truth -- the kind of truth that challenges ""official"" government narratives, the kind that holds the powerful to account.

By attacking journalists, whether through the bombing of their homes, as in my case, or shutting down newsrooms, as we saw in Ramallah, Israel is sending a chilling message: Telling the truth is dangerous work with a steep price.

That's why the closure of the Ramallah office isn't merely an Al Jazeera or local concern -- it's a global one. The erosion of press freedoms in Palestine reflects a disturbing trend, a concerted effort to undermine the institutions that safeguard truth and transparency. It's a pattern of slow, deliberate attempts to dismantle the free press entirely. Because if we allow press freedoms to be eroded in Palestine, what's to stop it from happening elsewhere?

In this critical moment, the world can't afford to look away. In defending journalism, we defend the truth. It's the means by which we fight against injustice. I know what happens when the press is attacked, and I fear we've reached a point where these attacks have become the norm, accepted even. The closure of the Ramallah office is an upsetting move, yes. But it's also an urgent call to action, because it won't stop with Al Jazeera."
Maher rips rapper's profanity-laced tired against USA: 'Sure it was a big hit with the Queers for Gaza crowd',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/maher-rips-rappers-profanity-laced-tired-against-usa-sure-big-hit-queers-gaza-crowd,2024-09-28T14:25:00Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

""Real Time"" host Bill Maher took aim at rapper Macklemore over his ""F--- America"" declaration at an anti-Israel event.

The Grammy-winning artist went viral this week for his appearance at Seattle's ""Palestine Will Live Forever Festival"" which raised money for various groups, including the controversial agency known as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which Israeli officials have declared is strongly tied to Hamas, leading to the firing of nine UNRWA staffers allegedly involved in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.

Israeli officials have declared that UNRWA is strongly tied to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The U.N. itself announced in August that nine UNRWA staffers would be fired due to possible involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel.

""Straight up, say it. I'm not gonna stop you. I'm not gonna stop you,"" Macklemore said, appearing to reference chants from the crowd.

""Yeah, F--- America,"" he said, sparking cheers from the audience.

BILL MAHER: TRUMP IS 'RIGHT' ABOUT THE DANGEROUS RHETORIC AIMED AT HIM, 'BUT HE IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY!'

That didn't sit well with Maher, who addressed the rapper's declaration during his closing monologue.

""I'm sure it was a big hit with the Queers for Gaza crowd, literally advocating for a government that would imprison you or kill you for being queer from the safety and security of a country that doesn't do that,"" Maher said.

""Yes, America. The only place in the world where a White guy from the suburbs could become a millionaire rapper because here, every person, regardless of race, class or gender has the right to be talent-free,"" he added.

BILL MAHER TRASHES KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING 'FULL OF S---' ON ISRAEL, MIDDLE EAST: 'JUST SHUT UP'

In a follow-up statement on Instagram, Macklemore seemed to back down from his attack on America: ""My thoughts and feelings are not always expressed perfectly or politely."" He added, ""Sometimes I slip up and get caught in the moment. Saturday night was one of those times. I strive to always lead with love in an effort to bring people together and never to create more division.""

He concluded, ""Unfortunately, the historic event in my hometown that brought thousands of people together to raise awareness and money for the people of Palestine has become overshadowed by two words. I wish I had been in a better place with my grief and anger. But the truth is I'm not ok. I haven't been.""

Maher began his monologue by praising Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for helping Democrats be more patriotic at this year's DNC convention, but lamented their sentiment hasn't resonated with younger people.

""The protests that started off as justice for Palestine have morphed into a broader kind of America is the problem, 'We f---ed up the whole world' thing,"" Maher said.

""Guess what document allows you to chant 'Hey hey, ho ho' followed by something really stupid,"" Maher asked them before answering with the Constitution.

BILL MAHER MAKES THIS BOLD 2024 PREDICTION AFTER TRUMP-HARRIS DEBATE

After citing a study alleging four out of ten Gen Zers believe the Founding Fathers are ""better described as villains,"" Maher noted that how young some of them were including 18-year-old James Monroe, 21-year-old Alexander Hamilton and 25-year-old James Madison.

""They were the Gen Z of their day, and when they were your age, they started a country. What the f--- have you done?"" Maher asked.

""History is complicated, and Gen Z reasoning is not. They think they're pure, but they're really just simplistic. They know two things: White people did some very bad things and- no, that's it. That's all they know,"" Maher said, later adding ""The citizens of Gaza cannot assemble in protest of their own government, cannot do or say what they want or practice whatever religion they want, or have a free press, all rights guaranteed in just our First Amendment!

""It's so easy to take for granted individual liberty, a bill of rights, the rule of law, checks and balances, getting a trial by jury, the peaceful transfer of power, protecting minority rights and democracy itself, but those are the things that make our pampered, privileged, bratty lives so relatively cushy. No one starves here, even our poor people are fat,"" he continued. ""Why do millions of people every year risk their lives to come here? Because they want what we got! The founders were flawed, but they did build a place the whole world wants to break into. No one is paying a coyote to smuggle them into India or Russia. Immigrants don't see us as the problem. They see us as a solution. And there's a reason they kill themselves to get here.""

Israel strikes Hezbollah in blast targeting the militant group's leader,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25272/israel-strikes-hezbollah-in-blast-targeting-leader,2024-09-28T07:58:55Z,"BEIRUT -- The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut on Friday in a series of massive explosions that targeted the leader of the militant group and leveled multiple high-rise apartment buildings.

At least six people were killed and 91 were wounded, Lebanon's health ministry said. It was the biggest blast to hit the Lebanese capital in the past year and appeared likely to push the escalating conflict closer to full-fledged war.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, including one United States official. The Israeli army declined to comment on who it was targeting. It was not immediately clear if Nasrallah was at the site, and Hezbollah did not comment on the report.

The death toll is likely to rise significantly as teams comb through the rubble of six buildings. Israel launched a series of strikes on other areas of the southern suburbs following the initial blast.

After the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly cut short a visit to the United States to return home. Hours earlier, he addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israel's intensified campaign against Hezbollah over the past two weeks would continue -- further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire.

News of the blasts came as Netanyahu was briefing reporters after his U.N. address. A military aide whispered into his ear, and Netanyahu quickly ended the briefing.

Israeli army spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the strikes targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, saying it was located underground beneath residential buildings.

The series of blasts at around nightfall reduced six apartment towers to rubble in Haret Hreik, a densely populated, predominantly Shiite district of Beirut's Dahiyeh suburbs, according to Lebanon's national news agency. A wall of billowing black and orange smoke rose into the sky as windows were rattled and houses shaken some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Beirut.

Footage showed rescue workers clambering over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters were visible, one with a car toppled into it. A stream of residents carrying their belongings were seen fleeing along a main road out of the district.

Israel provided no immediate comment about the type of bomb or how many it used, but the resulting explosion levelled an area greater than a city block. The Israeli army has in its arsenal 2,000-pound, American-made ""Bunker Buster"" guided bombs designed specifically for hitting subterranean targets.

Richard Weir, crisis and weapons researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the blasts were consistent with that class of bomb.

Israel's air forces followed with a new set of strikes early Saturday, also in the southern suburbs, shortly after warning residents of three buildings to evacuate. It said they were being used by Hezbollah to hide weapons, including anti-ship missiles.

Israel's military announced additional attacks on Beqaa in eastern Lebanon and Tyre in the south.

To a degree unseen in past conflicts, Israel spent the week pushing to eliminate Hezbollah's senior leadership. But an attempt to assassinate Nasrallah -- successful or not -- would be a major escalation. The Pentagon said the U.S. had no advance warning of the strikes.

Nasrallah has been in hiding for years, very rarely appearing in public. He regularly gives speeches, but always by video from unknown locations.

The site hit Friday evening had not been publicly known as Hezbollah's main headquarters, though it is located in the group's ""security quarters,"" a heavily guarded part of Haret Hreik where it has offices and runs several nearby hospitals.

Four hours after the strike, Hezbollah had still not issued any statement referring to it. Instead, it announced that it had launched a salvo of rockets at the Israeli city of Safed, which it said was ""in defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli violation of cities, villages and civilians.""

The Israeli military said a house and a car in Safed were hit, and officials said a 68-year-old woman sustained mild shrapnel wounds.

Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The escalated campaign has killed more than 720 people in Lebanon, including dozens of women and children, according to Health Ministry statistics. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa killed nine members of the same family, the state news agency said.

The United Nations said the fighting has displaced 211,000 people, including 85,000 now staying in public schools and other shelters. Airstrikes have forced 20 primary health care centers to shut down and disrupted access to clean water for nearly 300,000 people.

The scope of Israel's operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation.

At the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to ""continue degrading Hezbollah"" until Israel achieves its goals. His comments dampened hopes for a U.S.-backed call for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah to allow time for a diplomatic solution. Hezbollah has not responded to the proposal.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. Since then, it and the Israeli military have traded fire almost daily, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes on both sides of the border.

An Israeli security official said he expects the campaign against Hezbollah would not last for as long as the current war in Gaza, because the military's goals are much narrower.

In Gaza, Israel aims to dismantle Hamas' military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from the border -- ""not a high bar like Gaza"" in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines.

In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women -- 35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan -- from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike.

""That's Sabah, these are her clothes, my love,"" one man cried out as her body emerged.

Israel says its accelerated strikes have already inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah's weapons capabilities and its fighters. A strike Tuesday in southern Lebanon killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander, Muhammad Ali Ismail, and his deputy, Israel's military said Saturday. There was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah.

But Hezbollah boasted a large arsenal of rockets and missiles and its remaining capacities are unknown.

Hezbollah officials and their supporters remain defiant. Not long before the explosions Friday evening, thousands gathered in another part of Beirut's suburbs for the funeral of three Hezbollah members killed in earlier strikes, including the head of the group's drone unit, Mohammed Surour.

People in the giant crowd waved their fists in the air and chanted, ""We will never accept humiliation,"" as they marched marched behind the three coffins, wrapped in the group's yellow flag.

Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's top official in Beirut, said in a speech that no matter how many commanders Israel kills, the group has endless numbers of experienced fighters. He vowed that Hezbollah will keep fighting until Israel stops its offensive in Gaza.

""We will not abandon the support of Palestine, Jerusalem and oppressed Gaza,"" Fadlallah said. ""There is no place for neutrality in this battle."""
Extinct Biblical Tree Resurrected From Ancient Seed Found In Cave,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/grrlscientist/2024/09/27/extinct-biblical-tree-resurrected-from-ancient-seed-found-in-cave/,2024-09-27T08:43:22Z,"A 1,000 year old seed discovered in a cave in the Judean desert has sprouted, grown and reached maturity, and appears to have medicinal qualities.

A mysterious ancient seed recovered during archaeological excavations of a cave near Jerusalem has grown into a tree that may be the source of a medicinal balm mentioned in the Bible, according to a newly published study.

The seed was discovered in a Judean Desert cave in the late 1980s, and radiocarbon analysis indicated it was approximately 1000 years old. The seed likely survived from a now-extinct population of trees that existed in the Southern Levant, a region comprising modern-day Israel, Palestine and Jordan, and is the first of its kind to be found there.

Tests suggested that the 2 cm long (slightly less than one inch; Figure 1a) seed was still viable, so the research team planted and carefully tended it. It took around 5 weeks to sprout. Now, 14 years later, the tree has reached maturity (Figure 1). Researchers named their tree ""Sheba"" to honor of the Queen, Sheba, who brought the balsam root from Arabia to King Solomon as a gift.

""Sheba"" is approximately 3 m (10 feet) tall, its bark is pale green-brown and peels in thin, papery sheets revealing a dark green, possibly photosynthetic, bark below. ""Sheba"" is deciduous, shedding its leaves during the cooler months of December-April.

""'Sheba', an unknown Commiphora species with a unique genetic fingerprint, may represent an extinct taxon once native to this region whose resin 'tsori' mentioned in Biblical texts was valuable, associated with healing but not described as fragrant,"" summarized the researchers in their study (ref).

DNA analysis revealed that ""Sheba"" is a unique species of Commiphora, which are distributed across Africa, Madagascar and the Arabian Peninsula and known for their aromatic gum resins. With approximately 190 scientifically described species known, the drought-resistant Commiphora is the most species-rich genus of flowering plants in the frankincense and myrrh family, Burseraceae. Historically, these highly fragrant species provided highly prized aromatic resins that served as the basis for various fragrances, incenses and for medicinal uses.

However, GC-MS analysis has detected minimal fragrance from the leaves, bark and resin, indicating that ""Sheba"" is probably an extinct species of Commiphora that instead creates a resinous healing extract. Indeed, wounding the bark produces a small amount of clear oleoresin, that has been used to reduce inflammation in human patients. The researchers also found an oil, a type of squalene, also with antioxidant properties that may have been applied topically to lubricate and protect the skin.

Because the seed was found in a cave, it is likely that the people living in the region planted these trees, suggesting that they were aware of its medicinal qualities. Thus, the research team proposes that resin from the tree might be the mysterious ""tsori,"" a medicinal compound mentioned several times in the bible. Tsori was highly prized in the ancient world and was exported throughout the Roman Empire. Previous research suggested that in addition to its healing properties, tsori was used as a perfume and incense, for embalming, and even as an antidote to poisons.

That said, currently, it is unclear what species ""Sheba"" belongs to, because the tree has not flowered, and therefore hasn't produced the reproductive material scientists need to carry out more detailed species-level analyses. At this time, it is not clear if ""Sheba"" will ever flower.

Nonetheless, the researchers concluded that ""Sheba"" represents an extinct lineage of trees that was once widespread and common throughout the Levant but seems to have disappeared by the 9th century. Of course, this points to the important question: why did these trees go extinct?

"Palestinian President Abbas slams Israel, US during UN speech as critics decry his support for terrorism",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/palestinian-president-abbas-slams-israel-us-during-un-speech-critics-decry-his-support-terrorism,2024-09-26T16:47:24Z,"JERUSALEM -- Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority, once again delivered a stridently anti-Israel speech at the U.N. on Thursday, where he also praised the anti-Israel protests across the U.S. and condemned Washington for its support of Israel.

Abbas, who presented a 12-point plan for a post-war Gaza that calls for a permanent cease-fire, accused the Jewish state of committing genocide, while calling for its expulsion from the U.N. and taking aim at the Biden Administration for vetoing Security Council resolutions on the issue, while supplying arms to the Israelis.

He charged the U.S. ""furnished Israel with the deadly weapons that it used to kill thousands of innocent civilians, children and women. And this further encouraged Israel to continue with aggression.""

Abbas started his speech by questioning Israel's legitimacy: ""We will not leave. We will not leave. We will not leave. Palestine is our homeland. It is the land of our fathers, our grandfathers. It will remain ours. And if anyone were to leave, it would be the occupying usurpers.""

EXTREMISTS RISE IN NEW PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY GOVERNMENT AS BIDEN THREATENS ISRAEL OVER GAZA WAR

""Abbas spoke for 26 minutes and did not say the word 'Hamas' once. Since the massacre of October 7, Abbas has failed to condemn Hamas for their crimes against humanity,"" Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon charged in a statement following the speech.

Yet while leaders from around the world watched his UNGA speech, some critics complain the 88-year-old's rule and domination of Palestinian politics in the West Bank (known in Israel by its biblical name of Judea and Samaria in Israel) has done little for the Palestinian cause.

Abbas was born Safed duing the British mandate period [now in Israel]). His family fled to Syria when Arab armies invaded Israel to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state.

Abbas has been accused of rewarding Palestinian terrorism via the infamous ""pay for slay"" system that supports financial stipends for convicted Palestinian terrorists and their family members.

He has also garnered a reputation over the decades as an anti-American agitator who stokes wild antisemitic conspiracy theories. Just last month, Abbas delivered a speech to the Turkish parliament, where he announced that that ""America is the plague, and the plague is America"" and ""We implement Shari'a law: victory or martyrdom.""

Asaf Romirowsky, executive director of Scholars for Peace in the Middle East (SPME), told Fox News Digital that ""Mahmoud Abbas aka Arafat's appointed successor after 20 years has done what Arafat hoped he would, that is maintain a Palestinian stasis while at the same time refusing to root out the corruption within the PA or combat terrorism. Further, as he has shown during his recent speech in the Turkish Parliament, a clear allegiance to Hamas and an endorsement of 10/7, underscoring the consistent antisemitism of his leadership.""

Romirowsky added ""With no heir apparent, Abbas's legacy, as was Arafat's, is that of self-inflicted victimology while maintaining wealth on the back of his own people in the name of the so-called Palestinian struggle.""

MORE THAN A MILLION PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARE NOW DISPLACED; WHY ARE ARAB COUNTRIES NOT OPENING THEIR DOORS?

Fox News Digital reported shortly after Hamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people in Israel on October 7, including over 30 Americans, that the Abbas' PA might compensate convicted Hamas terrorists for their role in the attack.

Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, told Fox News Digital the PA and Abbas ""duplicate all of the corruption, nepotism, and inefficiency of the Palestine Liberation Organization"" that was created by Arafat.

He said ""Abbas does not accept the basic right of the Jewish people to self-determination, and therefore he doesn't recognize the right of the state of Israel to be a nation state of the Jewish people in any borders.""

Michael, who is affiliated with the Misgav Institute continued, ""He has not educated the young generation and has not educated PA officials for peace. On the contrary, Abbas has led and enabled the indoctrination toward hatred and toward delegitimization of the state of Israel.""

In contrast to the U.S.-designated terrorist movement, Hamas, Abbas and the PA are considered to be relatively moderate, according to some Mideast observers.

In 2022, Fox News Digital reported Abbas, issued a shocking diatribe against Israel in the German capital of Berlin, where the Holocaust - the mass extermination of European Jewry - was organized, claiming that the Jewish state has carried out ""50 Holocausts.""

Abbas refused to apologize (or aid in a professional inquiry) in Berlin at the time of the Palestinian Black September massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and a German police officer during the 1972 Munich Olympics."

Gov. Whitmer condemns 'Squad' member's 'antisemitic' attack against Michigan's Jewish AG: 'Hateful rhetoric',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/gov-whitmer-condemns-squad-members-antisemitic-attack-against-michigans-jewish-ag-hateful-rhetoric,2024-09-23T22:14:40Z,"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declined to take a side in a CNN interview when asked about accusations from Rep. Rashida Tlaib against Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.

After facing backlash for refusing to defend her state's attorney general against a suggestion of religious bias, Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer issued a statement Monday condemning Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich., for the ""antisemitic"" allegation.

""The suggestion that Attorney General Nessel would make charging decisions based on her religion as opposed to the rule of law is antisemitic,"" Whitmer wrote in a statement shared by CNN host Jake Tapper. ""Attorney General Nessel has always conducted her work with integrity and followed the rule of law. We must all use our platform and voices to call out hateful rhetoric and racist tropes.""

Whitmer's statement comes one day after she refused to take a side in the feud between the state's Attorney General Dana Nessel and Tlaib, who accused Nessel of bringing charges against anti-Israel campus protesters at the University of Michigan because she is Jewish.

'IS THIS A JOKE?' RASHIDA TLAIB FURIOUS AT BLINKEN FOR CELEBRATING GENEVA CONVENTIONS ANNIVERSARY

Nessel, Michigan's first Jewish attorney general, charged nine university students for refusing to leave the anti-Israel encampments in May after police ordered them to vacate, the Detroit Metro Times reported. They are being charged with trespassing and resisting or obstructing a police officer, according to the outlet. Two additional people were charged with attempted ethnic intimidation and malicious destruction of personal property at a separate anti-Israel protest.

Tlaib, a 'Squad' member and vocal critic of Israel, suggested that the charges from Nessel were ""shameful"" and religiously motivated, telling the Detroit Metro Times in an interview, ""it seems that the Attorney General decided if the issue was Palestine, she was going to treat it differently, and that alone speaks volumes about possible biases within the agency she runs.""

Nessel responded on X, ""Rashida Tlaib should not use my religion to imply I cannot perform my job fairly as Attorney General. It's anti-Semitic and wrong.'""

In an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, Tapper asked Whitmer whether she agrees with Nessel, a Democrat, that Tlaib's accusation about her charging anti-Israel campus demonstrators because of her personal religious bias was rooted in antisemitism.

""Do you think Attorney General Nessel is not doing her job? Because Congresswoman Tlaib is suggesting that she shouldn't be prosecuting these individuals that Nessel says broke the law, and that she's only doing it because she's Jewish, and the protesters are not,"" Tapper asked. ""That's quite an accusation. Do you think it's true?""

""I'm not going to get in the middle of this argument that they're having,"" Whitmer replied. ""I can just say this: We do want to make sure that students are safe on our campuses, and we recognize that every person has the right to make their statement about how they feel about an issue, a right to speak out. And I'm going to use every lever of mine to ensure that both are true.""

Her hesitation to defend Nessel caught the attention of Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, who scolded the governor for failing to support her attorney general.

""@GovWhitmer, when your attorney general prosecutes people for violating the law, harassing Jews, and attacking police officers, it's in the interest of public safety.

Portland Public Schools bars teachers from 'personal or political' classroom displays amid anti-Israel clash,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/portland-public-schools-bars-teachers-from-personal-political-classroom-displays-after-anti-israel-clash,2024-09-22T17:07:01Z,"Tara Faul never paid much attention to politics. But after 2020, the homeschooling mom picked up a camera and started documenting Portland's decline.

Portland Public Schools has adopted a new rule barring teachers from displaying their personal views on a ""political or personal issue"" in the classroom.

According to The Oregonian, the new guidance was ""quietly"" adopted under an administrative directive on August 24.

""Content on classroom walls, bulletin boards or otherwise displayed in the classroom must be related to the curriculum or district sponsored pursuant to [the district's academic freedom policy],"" the rule says. ""Those spaces cannot be used for an employee's personal expression whether that is related to a political or personal issue.""

Portland Public Schools told Fox News Digital that the new rule has been in the works for a year and ""acts as a reminder to all of our student-centered mission and also reminds our staff to use District spaces for educational purposes.""

""The AD is content neutral, and we believe supports the goal of remaining focused on creating a rich educational environment for students,"" the statement said.

PORTLAND PUBLIC SCHOOLS TO FACTOR IN GENDER IDENTITY, RACE INTO SCHOOL DISCIPLINE: 'COMPLETELY BACKWARDS'

""Personal expression by employees is not in furtherance of PPS's academic purposes. Academic purposes, of course, will vary depending on the course content. Displays should be focused on student's needs and tethered to the curriculum, not on the personal views of the teacher,"" the statement continued.

The spokesperson confirmed that the new guidance does not bar teachers from displaying pro-LGBTQ or pro-Black Lives materials in the classroom.

""The rainbow flag and BLM poster are district-approved symbols of inclusion to often marginalized students. Posters advocating for specific positions on political positions are not student centered in that they are not rooted in our educational mission or curriculum,"" they said to Fox News Digital.

PORTLAND TEACHERS UNION PUBLISHES GUIDEBOOK ON 'ORGANIZING FOR PALESTINE' IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS

The new guidance comes months after teachers' unions clashed with district leaders over whether teachers had the right to engage in pro-Palestinian activism in the classroom.

Oregon Educators for Palestine, in association with the Portland Association of Teachers ""PAT,"" released a guide titled ""Know Your Rights! Teaching & Organizing for Palestine Within Portland Public Schools,"" allegedly in response to teachers being censored and facing ""discrimination and harassment"" at ""the hands of PPS District leadership.""

The handbook alleges that teachers were censored for their pro-Palestinian activism in schools, which included assigning students work ""on the topics of Settler Colonialism and Zionism.""

Portland Public Schools responded to these accusations in June, saying in a statement, ""It is our expectation that staff create these spaces by facilitating respectful, age-appropriate, and standards-based learning and contextualization of major world events such as the ongoing Israel-Hamas war or, before that, the war in Ukraine.""

""When these expectations of staff are not met - such as when a teacher engages in political advocacy while working - our process is to talk with the teacher about our expectations and direct corrections, removal, or replacement of inappropriate content,"" the statement to Fox News Digital continued.

According to The Oregonian, the new policy restricting teachers from displaying their personal views on political issues has already been put into practice.

Administrators at Grant High removed a ""Stop the Genocide"" poster from a social studies teachers' doorway earlier this month.

The school's principal reportedly said in an email the poster violated the ""PPS policy regarding political speech.""

The Portland Association of Teachers has filed a grievance with the district over the new rule.

The union alleges the guidance conflicts with ""contractual language on academic freedom, which allows teachers to introduce controversial topics that are relevant to their courses, and PAT's right to post union related materials in schools,"" according to The Oregonian."

The BBC is the largest and most 'trusted' brand in journalism. We know this, because the BBC tells us. It earns this sobriquet by dint of its past glories, and the fact that it is legally obliged to produce 'impartial' news. In return for this promise, it is paid more than $5 billion per year by the British public.

The Asserson Report, which I published earlier this month, takes a deep dive into four months of BBC news coverage of the Israel-Hamas war. We look at some 9 million words of output using a traditional litigation style analysis. In parallel, a team of data scientists (operating as the Research for Impartial media - RIMe) conducted a series of experiments using cutting-edge AI techniques. Working independently, yet collaboratively, these two disciplines found strikingly similar results, exposing the myth of BBC impartiality.

'CORROSIVELY WOKE' BBC CONTINUES TO BE PLAGUED BY RETRACTIONS, APOLOGIES RELATED TO ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

We analyzed BBC English language TV output. While some programs were neutral, the remainder were between 90% and 100% pro-Palestinian/anti-Israeli.

The BBC broke almost every rule in its own rule-book - the 'Editorial Guidelines.' They use BBC as a platform for Hamas sympathizers, and Hamas members; they report death figures they know to be wrong without adequately conveying their unreliability to audiences; they air reports from Gaza without mentioning that Hamas controls journalistic output; their own

journalists express personal opinions. Each of these is a separate breach of the BBC's own guidelines on impartiality.

While we found that BBC English was disappointingly bad, we found that BBC Arabic was significantly worse. In a 'sympathy analysis' conducted by the RIMe data scientists across global media, BBC Arabic was snuggled up with such outlets as Al Jazeera; Palestine Chronicle and Iraqi News. It must surely degrade trust in the BBC to discover that it is being used to peddle extremist views.

The BBC News machine displays a strong anti-Israel view from almost every angle we analyzed. Any pretense at impartiality seems to have been abandoned. Indeed, its lead Middle East journalist, Jeremy Bowen, recently boasted that he considers impartiality means him telling the audience what he considers to be 'the truth.' This is the precise opposite of what the Editorial Guidelines dictate.

So, how has the BBC drifted so far from its roots? There are two answers. Firstly - the BBC has been captured by an institutional bias on many issues. Journalists who insist on expressing their own opinions should be shifted to somewhere less harmful - Gardener's Question Time, comes to mind - or they should be removed altogether. This seems rarely, if ever, to happen.

Secondly, and more fundamentally, BBC management needs to get a grip on their most sacred product - news. They need to set targets; monitor output, adjust when targets are not hit; and take steps against recalcitrant journalists and editors. At present, the BBC senior management sets no KPI's; sets no goals; conducts no systematic monitoring of output and is essentially running blind. They hope their journalists will achieve impartiality, but take no effective steps to ensure they do. They have let go of the rudder, and are allowing the BBC to be blown where the winds take it. That means that a bunch of very self-opinionated journalists, many of whom display deeply malevolent views about Israel, control the output.

The Asserson Report blows the myth of impartiality out of the water. The BBC doesn't achieve impartiality and is not remotely close to achieving it. BBC management must either take back control of the ship, or the British people should demand a refund."
Non-Profit Organizations With Impact,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nelldebevoise/2024/09/17/non-profit-organizations-with-impact/,2024-09-17T12:23:11Z,"I learned a lot about the Job Sphere during my time in the not-for-profit sector (though I didn't call it that at the time). Let's start with what we were doing. By the IRS's definition, as employees of 501c3 organizations, what we were doing was ""good"" for the people we served, as described in our mission statement. In reality, I saw a lot of useless efforts: some of what we did didn't meet those people's needs and, worse, some caused harm due to how we did it.

I was hired to do a needs assessment of local youth centers in Palestine that a major global funder was considering as grant recipients. The funding came with a requirement to meet a 50/50 gender mix for participants in the centers' programs within one year. There were a few brave families in this conservative community who started sending their daughters to one of the centers after having gotten over concerns of physical safety, philosophical differences, and conflicts with the students' school obligations. Still, there were usually conditions for joining, such as having to be in a girls-only program with a female facilitator or staying in the same classroom or activity as their brother. Building trust with families was a long, slow path. Clearly, the center wouldn't get to that 50/50 mix within a year unless they reduced the size of the programs to the handful of girls whose families permitted them to come with a matching number of boys. But this approach would underutilize both the centers' capacity to serve youth and the funding provided.

I relayed all this to the funder. Hoping to leverage my privilege as a White American with deep commitment to equity, I explained the center leader's commitment to equity and the need to pursue it in a more realistic time frame and format that would work in his community. A few days later, the global funder made the grant to this center and four others -- which included a requirement of equal participation by gender within 12 months at risk of rescinding funding in the second year. By demanding equal gender participation to serve their own vision rather than honoring the cultural context, this major international funder caused great harm to staff of these youth centers as well as hundreds of youths and their families, to say nothing of reinforcing the image of international development as paternalistic and inept at solving real problems.

So even in the not-for-profit sector, where the IRS is in charge of mandating that organizations do work that's intended to be good for the world, the specific choices people make about what to do and how to do it can cause harm.

Indeed, I was the example of a bad leader in some situations! I remember with great discomfort several phone calls, workshops, and staff meetings in which I barked at a youth leader, community member, or colleague. Whether they were late with a deliverable, misunderstanding my point, or refusing to try my brilliant idea, I applied some combination of withholding approval, shame, and unconstructive criticism.

Over time, I was able to recognize these errors within a matter of days or hours and apologize. Sometimes I was able to repair the relationship during that conversation and revisit the issue at hand to reach a solution that worked for everyone involved -- most importantly, the people we were trying to serve. But in other cases, my errors led to a trust deficit for days or weeks that (rightly) took me days or weeks to repair. And in that time, none of us was able to do the work we were there to do as effectively as we could have. This might've been different had I been making the Self Sphere investments necessary to stay empathetic, non-judgmental, and present in listening to the challenge presented.

I certainly don't intend to suggest that the not-for-profit sector does no good in the world; on the contrary. But I want these examples to illuminate the fact that having impact in the Job Sphere is more complex than having a job that saves lives or shapes young minds. There are plenty of ways to have great outcomes and align with your purpose in every single job on the planet."
