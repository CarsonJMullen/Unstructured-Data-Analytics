Prospects of a deal with Israel fade away as Saudis invite Iranian foreign minister to visit,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iran-foreign-minister-saudi-arabia-deal-israel,2024-10-08T20:45:15Z,"One year ago, Saudi Arabia and Israel were supposedly on the brink of a deal to normalize relations.

That deal has seemingly evaporated as Iran's foreign minister visits the kingdom on Tuesday to discuss efforts to halt Israel's incursions into Gaza and Lebanon.

""Our dialogue continues regarding the developments in the region to prevent the shameless crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon, in continuation of the crimes in Gaza,"" Iran Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a video broadcast on state media.

He added: ""Starting today, I'll begin a trip to the region, to Riyadh and other capitals, and we will strive for a collective movement from the countries of the region... to stop the brutal attacks in Lebanon.""

The Saudis share a longtime strategic partnership with the U.S. and are the largest purchaser of its weapons. But in recent years, they've had a political rapprochement with Iran.

9/11 FAMILIES URGE TRUMP, HARRIS TO OPPOSE SAUDI DEAL UNTIL KINGDOM ADMITS INVOLVEMENT IN TERROR ATTACK

Last week, Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, reaffirmed their neutrality in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Iran has warned that if ""Israel supporters"" intervene directly, their interests in the region would be targeted. That could mean missile strikes on their oil facilities.

Iran rained some 200 missiles down on Israel last week, many of which were intercepted by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with U.S. assistance.

""The Gulf states think it's unlikely that Iran will strike their oil facilities, but the Iranians are dropping hints they might from unofficial sources. It's a tool the Iranians have against the U.S. and the global economy,"" Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to the royal court, said.

In 2019, drones attacked Saudi Arabia's key refinery at Abqaiq, briefly shutting down around 5% of the world's oil supply. Those drones originated in Iran, according to U.S. intelligence.

Prior to Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Biden administration considered a proposed deal, akin to the Abraham Accords, a major priority. This deal aimed to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, including security guarantees and cooperation on civil nuclear matters. For months, the White House had been saying the deal was nearly done.

The prospect of a deal was largely blamed as a catalyst for the Hamas attacks.

OPINION: WHY SAUDI ARABIA MATTERS MORE THAN EVER TO THE US

""I don't think we were ever really that close,"" Robert Greenway, former senior director of the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital.

""We were closest probably in the waning days of the Trump administration, but we knew that that would be a second-term issue if there was to be one, and obviously that didn't play out. I don't know that the Biden-Harris administration ever took it that terribly seriously.""

Just before the Hamas attack, a group of 20 Democratic senators made clear their opposition to the treaty, voicing concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record and that a peaceful nuclear energy program might one day be converted to a military one to produce a nuclear weapon.

And Oct. 7 changed the Saudis' calculus: they now demand a plan for a Palestinian state.

""If anyone believes there was a chance of getting the House or Senate in an election year with virtually no majority, getting anything as controversial as a security treaty, with Saudi Arabia - permission for them to enrich with our blessing and support - I don't know if anyone credibly believes that that was ever possible.""

Former deputy national security adviser Victoria Coates was optimistic that the Saudis could be brought back into the fold.

""From what I'm hearing from both sides, it's when, not if,"" she said. ""There are various reasons you might want to wait to find out what the makeup of the Congress is going to be... you're going to need supportive majorities in the Senate to get [a civil nuclear agreement] through."""
"Trump says Gaza 'could be better than Monaco,' but 'they never took advantage of it'",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-gaza-better-than-monaco-israel-hugh-hewitt-rcna174475,2024-10-08T20:25:45Z,"Trump also claimed he has been to Gaza. An aide later suggested that visiting Israel counted because ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Donald Trump said that Gaza ""could be one of the best places in the world"" -- better even, he said, ""than Monaco"" and lamented that people ""never took advantage of it.""

In an interview with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, Trump said: ""It could be better than Monaco. It has the best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything,"" referring to the Palestinian territory, which has been bombarded relentlessly by the Israeli military for the past 12 months, creating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.

""They never took advantage of it. You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place -- the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate,"" he said.

Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Jewish Democrats and denigrated Palestinians while claiming to be Israel's staunchest ally, said that Gaza was ""a rough place ... before all of the attacks and before the back-and-forth of what's happened over the last couple of years."" The Republican presidential nominee also claimed that he had visited Gaza, despite there being no record of him doing so, as president or otherwise.

Afterward, a Trump campaign official given anonymity by The New York Times said that Trump has been to Israel, stating incorrectly that ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Trump's estimation of the real estate potential of the Gaza Strip echoes that of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who said in an interview with the faculty chair of Harvard's Middle East Initiative in February that ""Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable."" Kushner also suggested that, if he were in charge, he would ""try to move people"" from Rafah, in the south of Gaza, into the Negev desert, ""so you can go in and finish the job"" of eliminating Hamas.

Trump's comments speak to how he might approach the fraught and widening tensions in the Middle East if he wins the election. They are also deeply disconnected from the realities of life in Gaza under Israel's extensive blockade and what human rights experts have called the illegal Israeli occupation of the West Bank. After Hamas assumed governance of Gaza in 2007, Israel removed its military presence and swiftly imposed an air, sea and land blockade. Israel has largely controlled who enters and leaves the Strip; severely limited the import and export of food, medical supplies, infrastructure materials and commercial goods; violently restricted access along the coast of Gaza; and cut off access to farmland. Before the current war, two-thirds of the population in Gaza was supported by food assistance.

Multiple conflicts between Hamas and Israel over the years have exacerbated those issues. Israel's current war in Gaza, launched after Hamas' attack killed 1,200 people in October 2023, has displaced more than 90% of the population in the Strip, according to the United Nations. Gaza health officials say at least 41,000 people have been killed."
Opinion | A tit-for-tat war with Israel will not turn out well for Iran,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/iran-regret-attack-israel-missiles-hezbollah-rcna174375,2024-10-08T18:37:58Z,"Last week, and for the second time this year, Iran launched a missile strike against Israel. This one, however, the military equivalent of poking a sleeping bear, is likely to provoke a fearsome Israeli response.

Iran's first direct attack in April, which targeted non-civilian areas and was telegraphed in advance, looked more like a demonstration project than a serious strike. It was Tehran's response to Israel assassinating a top Iranian general in Syria, but it appears to have been purposely narrowed to prevent a significant Israeli retaliation. Israel delivered a token response (attacking a single long-range air defense system) and, at least for a time, the threat of greater escalation diminished.

Last week's strike, a response to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah (a close ally of Iran) in a southern suburb of Beirut was qualitatively different. Iran fired missiles directly at civilian areas of Tel Aviv -- and sent millions of terrified Israelis into their safe rooms.

From a military standpoint, the Iranian attack accomplished little. While it caused some damage to targeted intelligence and military bases, there were few civilian casualties (A Palestinian man in Jericho died in the attacks, and two people were injured in Tel Aviv). More important, it barely put a dent in Israel's military capabilities.

According to Yonatan Touval, a foreign policy analyst at Mitvim, an Israeli think tank, ""Iran might have thought this was a measured strike it could get away with, and that at worst would provoke a symbolic counter-strike. But Israel perceives this differently and will likely launch a major retaliatory strike.""

As a geographically small country, deterrence has long been an essential element of Israel's strategic mindset. It has generally responded with disproportionate military force to acts of war. The response to Iran's missile attack will likely be no different. Touval said, ""Israel cannot let this pass if it is to reestablish deterrence and convey the message that it is not a sitting duck waiting to be hit at will.""

As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday, Oct. 8, ""Iran made a big mistake tonight -- and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to retaliate against our enemies.""

But there's another consideration for Israel's leaders. For years, Israel has wanted to launch a military strike on Iran to diminish or even out wipe out the country's nuclear program. Successive U.S. administrations have consistently discouraged Israel from doing so. Indeed, the attention devoted to the Iranian nuclear program -- and the signing of the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 by the Obama administration -- was motivated, in large measure, by a desire to avoid a conflict between Israel and Iran that could potentially drag in the United States.

But with last week's strike, Iran handed Israel a casus belli and legal basis for an attack, and the U.S. will be hard-pressed to stop Israel from responding. While it will be difficult for Israel to hit Iran's nuclear targets without direct U.S. involvement, one can imagine significant Israeli attacks on Iran's military and even economic infrastructure in an effort to humiliate the regime in Tehran.

So why did Iran do it?

Iran's decision-making seems to have been influenced not by military considerations but by reputational ones. Nayyera Haq noted last week in an MSNBC column that ""despite new leadership in Iran, there remains the long-standing need to appear strong in the Middle East and also on the world stage.""

To be sure, Iran was in a difficult situation, but it was one it created. For a year, Iran has supported Hezbollah as it, unprovoked, sent thousands of rockets and missiles into Northern Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. Perhaps Hezbollah and its patrons in Iran believed that Israel would not aggressively respond (yet another deadly miscalculation). But once Israel launched a major military attack, taking out Nasrallah and most of Hezbollah's leadership, and employed an audacious attack in which it blew up pagers that killed and wounded thousands of Hezbollah fighters, Iran's choices went from bad to worse.

""Doing nothing"" in response to the killing of Nasrallah would send a message that Israel could bloody its nose with no repercussions. But ""doing something"" risked unleashing another Israeli military strike. Iran chose the latter course -- and by doing so likely made a huge strategic error. Provoking a much stronger military rival is never a good idea. Iran has now opened the door to a military retaliation that will likely cause significant physical damage and could, ironically, undermine the regime in the eyes of Iranian civilians. What has Iran's expansionist foreign policy, support for terrorist networks and nuclear program brought the country other than economic devastation -- and now likely physical pain?

Iran's leaders likely believed they had no choice but to ""do something,"" but their apparent failure to fully consider how the missile strike would be viewed in Israel -- and the potential ramifications -- has put a target squarely on the country's back.

The same is true of Israel, it must be said. Any military response to last week's attack will need to be calibrated in order to prevent significant escalation. Ever since then-President Donald Trump foolishly pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, there has been no international monitoring of Iran's nuclear program. So it's impossible to know how far along Iran is in producing the fissile material necessary to construct a nuclear weapon. While it's highly unlikely that Iran is close to having a nuke that it can actually deliver, Israel may still want to tread lightly for fear of pushing Iran's leader into a desperate position.

Still, that doesn't mean Israel will sit this one out. Iran has provoked a far stronger military rival that has been itching at the chance to attack them. The consquences will be dire."
5 key takeaways from Kamala Harris' '60 Minutes' interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-key-takeaways-from-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview,2024-10-08T15:03:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.

Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, with Israel under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In her answers, Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current administration.

On Israel, Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end, though she acknowledged the Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.

""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end,"" Harris said.

Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in military aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over Netanyahu, Harris dodged the question and stayed on message, emphasizing the current administration's diplomatic efforts.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" she said.

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

Whitaker pressed, ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""

Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

On Europe, Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to the war with Russia.

""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in what that success looks like,"" she said.

In a definitive statement, Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However, she was less specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.

""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,"" Harris said. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration, noting that she supported Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed the border. Now, the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers,"" he said.

Whitaker asked, ""If that's the right answer, now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,"" she said.

However, Whitaker pushed back on the vice president, observing that in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or Harris.

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""

Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from day one, literally.""

""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,"" she said, again echoing Biden.

To fight inflation, Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6,000, give first-time homebuyers $25,000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small business.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.

""Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,"" Harris answered. ""But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""

HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND ECONOMIC PLAN

Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me, madam vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair,"" Harris asserted.

Whitaker followed up again, stating, ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.

""I disagree with you,"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

""None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy,"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that I am also a capitalist, and I know the limitations of government.""

After a discussion on foreign policy, Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her recent admission that she is a gun owner.

""I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she owns. ""And, I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.""

Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's 2020 running mate.

She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president, she remains a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago, when Biden decided to drop out of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you,"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

""It's an election, Bill,"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support."
One boy's story shows the impact of rising Israeli settler violence in the West Bank,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/the-picture-show/2024/10/08/g-s1-22630/photos-palestinian-family-impact-israeli-settler-violence-occupied-west-bank,2024-10-08T11:33:53Z,"Noor Assi, 15, sits on his bed while watched by his 5-year-old sister Jenna in the village of Qarawat Bani Hassan, Israeli-occupied West Bank, on Feb. 23. Ayman Oghanna for NPR hide caption

In a carpentry shop in the village of Qarawat Bani Hassan, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Noor Assi is at work packaging a wooden table. He tears off strips of tape, tying it to padded cardboard, before flipping the table on its side.

He says he is 15 ""and a half,"" a measurement in age split between the innocence of youth and a desire for manhood.

The war in Gaza has caused tensions to flare across the Middle East, especially in places like the West Bank. The Israeli-occupied territory is the most violent it has been in decades. United Nations figures say that almost 700 Palestinians in the area have been killed, either by Israeli forces or settlers, in the past year. Noor's father was among those fatally shot.

""My childhood is gone,"" Noor says. He was forced to grow up by a grim rite of passage.

On Dec. 2, Israeli settlers raided his village in the central West Bank and shot his father, Ahmed Assi, dead, according to the family, residents and local officials.

The Israeli military told NPR that they responded to a physical confrontation between Palestinians and Israeli citizens in Qarawat Bani Hassan with riot disposal means and live fire and that the circumstances of Assi's death were still under review.

Ahmed Assi's mother, Noor's grandmother, shows bloodied clothes and a sweatshirt with a single bullet hole in the back. Assi's 5-year-old daughter, Jenna, looks on, wearing a necklace with a picture of her dead dad.

""When my father was martyred, I started to work, I took over my father's profession, I started working and spending on the house. I was smart and managed things, meaning I became responsible for the house,"" Noor says.

Noor dropped out of school, working full time in the family's carpentry warehouse, sometimes for 13 hours a day, to provide for his five siblings.

""I am responsible for them now. I take care of them and whatever they want, I get them. I don't let them want for anything.""

Noor looks young, is shy and has a boyish haircut -- long on top, a fade on the sides and back. He maintains his look with regular visits to the village barbershop.

In the Middle East, the barbershop is not just a place to cut your hair. It's also a place to socialize, hang out and talk about everything from family to sports and politics. Not long after Noor gets his trim, the village's mayor, Ibrahim Assi, enters. He is a distant relative of Noor's. It's a small community and family ties are strong. A poster of Noor's deceased father is plastered outside.

The mayor explains that Qarawat Bani Hassan is surrounded by an ever-expanding network of Israeli settlements and outposts. About 500,000 Israeli settlers live in the occupied West Bank, according to the United Nations. The settlements they live in are deemed illegal by the international community. Israeli politicians like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, have promoted their expansion, and they're growing through a web of smaller outposts.

The mayor says that violence from the settlers is terrorizing the Palestinians who live here.

""The West Bank is currently living in a nightmare, a nightmare that has lost its security and safety due to the violence of the Ministry of Settlers, who are -- on a daily basis -- assaulting, killing and harassing and stealing. They are committing real crimes against citizens and farmers that are present on their own land,"" the mayor says.

On Dec. 2, he says, settlers entered the village, damaging property, burning cars, wounding one man and shooting Noor's father dead. His lifeless body was found hours later in an olive grove on the outskirts of Qarawat Bani Hassan.

Noor may maintain his teenage haircut. But he has the hardened hands of an older working man, no longer hanging out with friends, devoting himself, instead, to work, faith and family.

At home, he helps out with the household chores, learning to cook from his mother. He sometimes feels pangs of envy for other teenagers.

""I do get jealous, I sometimes feel like playing, like them, but it doesn't work. I have a family to take care of,"" Noor says.

On Friday, the holiest day of the week in Islam, Noor prays at the village mosque before his weekly ritual of visiting his father's grave, draped in a Palestinian flag.

Prayer is important to Noor, from morning to night. Fighting back tears, he says the Islamic funeral prayer for his father on the porch outside his home.

""O God, forgive him and have mercy on him, and heal him, and pardon him, and grant him an honorable reception.""

Noor says that each night, after prayer, he speaks to his father.

""I tell him what is happening, what we are doing, and who is coming over, for example,"" he says. ""Last time, he came to me in a dream and told me, 'Take care of your family and your brothers.' """
"Opinion | Biden pledged to restore order as president. In the Middle East, he's failing.",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-iran-war-biden-hezbollah-election-rcna174262,2024-10-08T10:47:49Z,"The president's poor leadership has brought us closer to a regional war that could cause enormous suffering and hurt his own party.

One of Joe Biden's promises in his 2020 presidential campaign was that he would restore strong U.S. leadership abroad and rein in the chaos that Donald Trump had unleashed in the international order.

But if you take a look at the Middle East right now, Biden hasn't done a very good job of fulfilling that pledge.

Under Biden's watch, the Middle East is growing less stable. In the past few weeks, Israel has begun a new war with its invasion of Lebanon, against the public wishes of the Biden administration. Iran has fired around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, the second time it has ever launched such a direct assault on Israel from its own land. Israel has since promised it will retaliate against Iran -- and that if the tit-for-tat continues for an additional round, strikes on Iran's nuclear sites are on the table. Meanwhile Israel's war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks continues to rage with no end in sight. As a result of the instability, the price of oil is rising, and attacks on oil production in the region could cause it to surge more.

In other words, the Middle East is slowly inching toward breaking out into a full-scale regional war that could shake up the global economy, create a gigantic crisis in U.S. foreign policy and result in the deaths of countless civilians.

This is not good news for the Democrats as Election Day approaches: Just the rumblings of an imminent crisis or potentially surging gas prices could hurt the electoral appeal of Democrats, who are already suffering from their association with inflation.

The growing specter of wide-scale war in the Middle East is not some kind of approaching weather event or natural disaster. It is the product of choices. And our president has made some terrible ones that helped us get to this point. After Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, it was inevitable that Israel was going to retaliate. What was not inevitable was that the Biden administration would give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a far-right leader with neocolonial extremists in his Cabinet, carte blanche to retaliate against the entire population of the Gaza Strip however he wished to.

The Biden administration has appeared to use leaks and statements to suggest that it believes Netanyahu has gone too far in his brutality toward the civilians of Gaza, but in practice it has greenlighted all of Israel's actions. The Biden administration has been a staunch defender of Israel at the United Nations, shielding it from legally binding Security Council resolutions. It has given Israel billions in military aid. Aside from a brief, temporary and ultimately symbolic pause in arms transfers, Biden has not threatened to cut off aid, or even condition aid on Israel's compliance with international or U.S. law. The Biden administration, to keep weapons shipments intact under U.S. law, has reportedly ignored findings from the State Department and USAID that Israel had blocked U.S. humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Netanyahu's takeaway from Biden's support is that he can take U.S. backing as unconditional and do whatever he wants not only toward Palestinian civilians, but in the region more broadly. Netanyahu has embraced a ""shoot first, notify Biden later"" attitude toward many high-stakes and escalatory actions against adversaries in the Middle East, such as when Israel struck the Syrian headquarters of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, or when Israel leveled several buildings in Beirut in a bombing that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's operations in Lebanon -- against Biden's public wishes -- have already displaced close to a quarter of Lebanon's population and killed hundreds of civilians, according to PBS' NewsHour. And Netanyahu has demonstrated he feels no obligation to listen to U.S. calls to wind down the bloody military operation in Gaza, which is why Israel and Hezbollah have locked horns in the last year.

As Atlantic Council fellow Nicholas Blanford explained to me, Israel's escalation with its adversaries in the region increases the likelihood of a regional war. If, for example, Israel decides to entrench itself in a more wide-scale war in Lebanon, it could nudge Hezbollah to unleash its most destructive firepower, such as its precision-guided missiles that it has so far refrained from using. And if Iran were to fear that Israel is about to wipe out Hezbollah at some point, it could ""activate all [its] proxies across the region"" against Israel, dragging several other countries directly into the conflict.

We don't know exactly how Netanyahu would act if Biden were to condition or cut off aid to Israel. But given that U.S. military support is vital to Israel's national security and military operations, Netanyahu would be far more likely to behave conservatively in his military campaigns and targeted strikes across the region.

Netanyahu is aware that the timing of his more aggressive maneuvering comes at an acutely sensitive time for Biden politically. Biden is likely in the weeks before Election Day to be particularly hesitant to initiate an upheaval in U.S.-Israeli relations by cutting off weapons shipments or demanding that Netanyahu act like more of a cooperative U.S. ally. But at the same time Biden looks rudderless and weak by not doing anything.

When asked at a press conference Friday if he believed Netanyahu was trying to influence the U.S. election, Biden said, ""I don't know."" And when asked by another reporter, ""How long are you OK with Israel bombing Lebanon? What is acceptable to you?"" he smiled and walked away from the podium.

Biden has gotten himself into this bind through his record of unconditional support for Israel, no matter how badly it deviates from basic morality in warfare, international law or U.S. interests. One can't help but wonder if Biden's poor leadership in the Middle East might just mark a historic first: a president inadvertently springing an October surprise on his own party."

One week after Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon and one year after Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in support of Hamas, Jerusalem reinforced its troops fighting inside Lebanon with a third division, prompting immediate questions over the extent of its ""limited"" operations in Lebanon.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Sunday sent troops from its 91st Division, also known as the Galilee Formation, to join forces already in Lebanon hunting down Hezbollah strongholds.

The 91st Division, traditionally responsible for overseeing security for the entirety of the border with Lebanon, will reinforce efforts already being carried out by two other divisions.

Israel's initial advance into Lebanon was led by soldiers from the 98th Division on Oct. 1, which encompassed paratroopers, elite commandos and the 7th Armored Brigade, who were transferred to northern Israel from the border with Gaza in early September for training, reported the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) Long War Journal on Sunday ahead of the IDF announcement.

""Forces from the Commando Brigade, including soldiers from the Egoz Unit, located and destroyed a Hezbollah attack infrastructure, which included a rocket launcher, explosive stockpiles, and additional military equipment,"" the IDF said of the initial operation.

Though Hezbollah's response was fairly muted as many were believed to have retreated ahead of the incursion, at least nine IDF soldiers were killed between Oct. 1-2 during one of the opening battles in Lebanon, confirmed the Long War Journal.

Reinforcements from the IDF's 36th Division, including the Golani infantry, 188th Armored Brigade and the 6th Reserve Infantry Brigade were then sent in, according to reports last week.

Following the Israeli incursion - a security measure that the U.S. and other international allies warned Jerusalem against - IDF spokesperson Rear. Adm. Daniel Hagari said Israel would not push its ground forces north toward Beirut and would instead focus on securing the villages near the border.

Jerusalem has said the operation in Lebanon is necessary to secure the area so some 60,000 Israelis from northern Israel could return home, though data collected by the FDD shows that some 150,000 Israelis have evacuated from the northern border areas.

IDF MEETS LITTLE RESISTANCE FROM HEZBOLLAH AFTER WEEKS OF HITTING TERROR TARGETS, OFFICIALS SAY

Hagari said the incursion would be ""limited"" and take ""days"" to ""weeks"" to complete.

But the renewed support of additional troops on Monday prompted questions over the scope of Israel's plans in southern Lebanon, including from the U.S. State Department on Monday.

In response to questions from reporters regarding Israel's operations in Lebanon, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, ""We're watching this very closely.""

""We support their ability to target militants, to degrade Hezbollah's infrastructure, to degrade Hezbollah's capability. But we are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years,"" he added. ""And ultimately, that's not the outcome that we want to see.""

Israel has not announced any additional plans for its ground forces and said the IDF Divisions have engaged in ""targeted, limited, and localized operations"" in southern Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah's infrastructure.

But one security expert with the FDD pointed out that Israel could be taking precautionary steps to build up its force in the region should Israel decide it needs to bolster its ability to go after Hezbollah even further.

""What the Israelis have been doing is gradually ratcheting up pressure on Hezbollah to make the price of continuing to attack in support of Gaza too costly for the organization,"" David Daoud, senior fellow at FDD specializing in Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital.

Daoud explained that in the wake of the Oct. 8 attacks, Israel and Hezbollah engaged in ""mutual attrition,"" continuing to strike one another but rarely taking the level of attack beyond aerial bombardments, unlike the attacks carried out by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023.

ISRAEL'S GROUND INVASION INTO LEBANON IMMINENT AS CABINET APPROVES NEXT PHASE OF THE WAR

This level of engagement shifted after Israel's telecommunication device operation in which it allegedly detonated some 5,000 pagers previously distributed to Hezbollah operatives, killing more than three dozen and wounding nearly 3,000 others in a coordinated attack in late September.

Israel has not taken credit for the attacks, but according to open-source data compiled by the FDD in its latest interactive report dubbed ""Road to the Third Lebanon War, Mapping the War of Attrition,"" the event was a clear launching point in which Jerusalem drastically changed its modus operandi when it came to countering Hezbollah.

On Sept. 22, Israel carried out its most significant bombardment against the terrorist group than at any other point since the Oct. 8, 2023,attacks, firing some 1,182 strikes, nearly five times the number of attacks it fired during its second-heaviest strike campaign on Feb. 11, 2024, when 239 strikes were fired, the FDD found.

""I would call it a kind of proactive attrition,"" said Daoud, who co-authored the FDD report. ""The Israelis are no longer keeping a balance of attrition, they're really weighing heavily on Hezbollah without going to a full ground invasion.""

The expert explained that the IDF is ""ratcheting up pressure"" on Hezbollah in an attempt to get it to back off its support for Hamas, a similar strategy it has taken in Gaza in an attempt to persuade Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to hand over the hostages.

The merits of this approach are debatable as hostages remain in Hamas captivity despite the immense pains the IDF has caused in the Gaza Strip, and Daoud questioned whether this tactic would be effective against Hezbollah, an organization that is more sophisticated, better armed, better financed and more entwined in Lebanese society.

""I don't see Hezbollah backing down, even at this level of pain that the Israelis are inflicting upon them,"" Daoud said. ""So a ground invasion may become necessary, and you want to make sure that your forces are in place for that to move into effect immediately, if that becomes the case.""

The expert highlighted that Israel may once again be considering the establishment of a ""security zone"" in Lebanon in order to create a buffer between Hezbollah strongholds and the Israeli border, a move that would replicate steps Israel took between 1985 and 2000 and one that would require a prolonged IDF stay in Lebanon.

It is unclear if Israel could be considering another buffer-zone scenario, though it would likely prove unpopular not only with the Lebanese government but with the international community, which has increasingly urged Israel to reduce its footprint in the region by embracing a two-state solution with the Palestinians in the south and along Israel's eastern border.

But Daoud argued that the threat Hezbollah poses isn't going away and that creating a buffer zone combined with continued air strikes could be the solution that appeases the international community best by avoiding an all-out ground invasion across Lebanon.

""There are ways to avoid a ground invasion,"" Daoud argued. ""It will take much longer, but given where international opinion is, this is probably a better option for Israel now than a full ground invasion up to Beirut.""

Though Israel has not announced any plans to engage in a ground operation to oust Hezbollah forces from strongholds like Beirut, it has ramped up the number of strikes on suburban areas outside the capital city, and since late September the U.S. has organized the departure of some 700 Americans from Lebanon."
"CBS News staff in uproar after host challenges guest's anti-Israel views, network leadership responds",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-news-staff-uproar-after-host-challenges-guests-anti-israel-views-network-leadership-responds,2024-10-08T00:11:56Z,"CBS Mornings anchor Tony Dokoupil pressed author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates on whether he believed Israel had a right to exist in a Monday interview.

CBS News is in turmoil after an internal staff meeting addressed the concerns surrounding an interview featuring Ta-Nehisi Coates on Israel's ""right to exist.""

Last week, ""CBS Mornings"" anchor Tony Dokoupil grilled Coates, an author and journalist, on an anti-Israel portion in his new book, ""The Message,"" which describes his travels ""to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how easily we are misled by nationalist narratives, and the tragedy that lies in the clash between the stories we tell and the reality of life on the ground,"" the book summary reads.

Dokoupil brought up this section of the book, telling Coates bluntly that it read like something you would find in ""the backpack of an extremist.""

CBS HOST GRILLS TA-NEHISI COATES ON ANTI-ISRAEL VIEWS IN NEW BOOK: LOOKS LIKE IT CAME FROM AN 'EXTREMIST'

""I have to say, when I read the book, I imagine if I took your name out of it, took away the awards, the acclaim, took the cover off the book, publishing house goes away, the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,"" Dokoupil said.

""So then I found myself wondering, why does Ta'Nehisi Coates, who I've known for a long time, read his work for a long time, very talented, smart guy, leave out so much? Why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it? Why leave out that Israel deals with terror groups that want to eliminate it? Why not detail anything of the first and the second Intifada, the café bombings, the bus bombings, the little kids blown to bits. Is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?"" the CBS anchor continued.

Coates defended the book, saying he sought to give a voice to the Palestinian people, whose views he argued were underrepresented in the American media.

The interview prompted outcry from some CBS News staff, who felt Dokoupil pressed Coates too strongly on his anti-Israel stance. The network addressed the internal frenzy in a staff meeting Monday, which marked the one-year anniversary since the October 7th massacre in Israel. CBS leadership reassured offended staff members that following a review, they concluded that the interview did not meet the company's ""editorial standards,"" the Free Press reported, which obtained audio of the staff meeting.

ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF OCTOBER 7 ATTACKS ARRIVES WITH LASTING TRUAMA FOR ISRAELIS, AMERICAN JEWS: EXPERT

Adrienne Roark, who oversees news-gathering at the network, told employees that covering an event like October 7 ""requires empathy, respect, and a commitment to truth,"" according to the Free Press.

""We will still ask tough questions. We will still hold people accountable. But we will do so objectively, which means checking our biases and opinions at the door,"" Roark reportedly said.

""We are here to report news without fear or favor,"" Roark added, according to the Free Press. ""There are times we fail our audiences and each other. We're in one of those times right now, and it's been growing. And we're at a tipping point. Many of you have reached out to express concerns about recent reporting. Specifically about the CBS Mornings Coates interview last week as well as comments made coming out of some of our correspondents' reporting.""

CBS NEWS CASTS A LONG SHADOW OF ANTI-TRUMP BIAS AHEAD OF ITS VICE-PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

She continued, ""I want to acknowledge and apologize that it's taken this long to have this conversation.""

But not everyone at CBS agreed with the leadership's decision to appease their staff.

CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford reportedly defended Dokoupil's handling of the interview, remarking during the meeting, ""I don't even understand how Tony's interview failed to meet our editorial standards... I thought our commitment was to truth. When someone comes on our air with a one-sided account of very complex situation -- which Coates himself acknowledges that he has -- it's my understanding that as a journalist we are obligated to challenge that worldview, so that our viewers can have access to the truth and can have a more balanced account...,"" Dylan Byers of Puck News reported her as saying.

""And that is what Tony did,"" Crawford added, according to Byers. ""He challenged Coates' one-sided worldview, Coates got to respond. It was civil... I don't see how we can say that it failed to meet our editorial standards.... Tony prevented a one-sided account from being broadcast on our network about a deeply complex situation that completely was devoid of history or fact. As journalists, that's what we have an obligation to do.""

CBS has yet to respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

An imminent ballistic missile strike from Iran looms, but the current alarm is different - more immediate, more dangerous.

It's a terror attack in Jaffa.

The details are still emerging, but we know this much: Several people have already lost their lives.

In a rush, we load up our gear and protective equipment into our vehicle. Just as we're pulling out of the hotel, orders from New York come through: Get back inside. They don't want us on the road with Iran's attack approaching.

FOUR AMERICAN HOSTAGES REMAIN IN HAMAS CAPTIVITY A YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 MASSACRE

Before my producer can even hang up, the car fills with a new sound: the blare of alarms. Iran has fired ballistic missiles - headed straight for us.

It takes about 12 minutes for a missile to travel from Iran to Israel. How far into those 12 minutes we are is anyone's guess.

Our photographer, doubling as our driver, floors the accelerator, weaving through traffic as we race back to the hotel.

We make it back and join about two dozen others in the hotel's shelter. Many of them are Israelis. A father plays with his two daughters, rolling on the ground, laughing. Nearby, people chat calmly, unbothered by the threat of nearly 200 ballistic missiles targeting Israel. I notice a young man standing calmly beside his girlfriend. He's missing a leg from the knee down but stands strong and composed.

""Hamas terrorists,"" he tells me when I ask about his injury. ""They hit us with an RPG.""

He credits his - and others' - composure during this attack to their faith in Israel's air defense systems.

From the shelter, I go live on Fox News Channel, describing those around me. As Israel's layered air defense - comprised of the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow systems - intercepts incoming threats, it becomes clear why the soldier's confidence is well-placed.

HAMAS LAUNCHES ROCKETS FROM GAZA ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 ATTACKS, WHILE IDF STRIKES TERROR TARGETS

Iran is launching the largest ballistic missile barrage in history. Amid this, a Palestinian man in the West Bank dies from falling shrapnel, but not a single additional person in Israel is seriously harmed by the missiles.

It strikes me: the calm in the shelter is born of a tragic familiarity - being fired upon has become normal here.

Terror attacks, while common, rarely reach Tel Aviv.

When we're given the all-clear, we race to the scene of the attack in Jaffa, as originally planned.

Evidence of the brutality is everywhere along the light rail tracks: bloodstains and evidence markers hint at the horror that unfolded just before we arrived.

""When the train stopped and opened its doors, the terrorists walked inside, began firing their automatic weapons, then stepped back out and continued their killing spree,"" the Israeli Police International Spokesman, Dean Elsdunne, tells me.

US ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE 'VIOLENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY' ON AMERICANS ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7

""I even saw an image where the terrorists stood over a civilian who had clearly already been shot, and they continued shooting him,"" he adds.

Seven people lost their lives in the attack.

My mind flashes back to what I witnessed 63 miles south of Tel Aviv, in the devastated city of Rafah in southern Gaza.

Weeks earlier, I had embedded with the IDF in the evacuated city, where soldiers exchanged gunfire with militants.

There wasn't a single civilian in sight, but remnants of life before the war were scattered everywhere - a child's superhero mask, clothes, household goods buried beneath the rubble from Israeli airstrikes.

Harris and Trump marked 1 year since the Oct. 7 attacks with tributes to the victims,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144699/kamala-harris-donald-trump-october-7,2024-10-07T22:25:41Z,"One year after Hamas attacked Israel, both major-party presidential candidates marked the date on Monday with promises of continued support for the Jewish state.

Vice President Harris remembered the victims of the Oct. 7 attack by planting a memorial tree at her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., while former President Trump visited a sacred site for Hasidic Jews in Queens, N.Y.

""I will never forget October 7, and the world must never forget,"" Harris said during a tree-planting ceremony on the grounds of the vice president's residence. ""We must work to ensure nothing like the horrors of October 7 can ever happen again.""

Hamas, which controls Gaza, killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7 and took some 250 hostage in Gaza, according to Israel. A year later, more than 100 hostages are still unaccounted for. Israel's response to the attack has killed at least 41,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials.

Harris reiterated her support for Israel's defense, and promised the Biden administration would continue working to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. She then read the names of seven missing American citizens.

Harris also called for efforts to ""relieve the immense suffering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza who have experienced so much pain and loss over the year.""

She appeared alongside her husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish and and who has led White House efforts to fight antisemitism.

Trump met with members of an Orthodox Jewish community in New York on Monday morning, and visited the grave of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, an influential orthodox rabbi who died in 1994. Trump was then scheduled to attend an Oct. 7 remembrance event Monday evening with Jewish leaders, according to Trump campaign officials.

Hamas' stated goal is the elimination of Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel says the objective of the war in Gaza is to eliminate Hamas.

The war has exposed rifts within the Democratic Party over the Biden-Harris administration's support for Israel. Those divides are particularly pronounced among younger voters -- a key voting bloc for Democrats and a group more likely than older voters to express sympathy for the Palestinian people. According to the Pew Research Center, voters ages 18-29 also are less supportive of U.S. military aid to Israel.

Trump has sought to capitalize on those tensions within his rival's party, saying recently that any Jewish voter who supports a Democrat is a ""fool."" Those remarks drew widespread criticism from Jewish organizations across the ideological spectrum.

He continued emphasizing the message in an interview Monday with radio host Hugh Hewitt. ""I did more for Israel than anybody, I did more for the Jewish people than anybody, and it's not a reciprocal, as they say,"" Trump said."

For Palestinian civilians caught in the middle of the ongoing conflict between Israeli forces and the Hamas militant group, the consequences have been unremittingly difficult, and deadly.

The death toll from Israel's offensive in Gaza is now approaching 42,000 Palestinians, with another 39 deaths recorded Monday at local hospitals, according to Gaza's health authorities.

Hamas, designated a terrorist group by the United States and several other nations, has seen its control over territory in Gaza diminish over the past 12 months, leaving a political and logistical vacuum that international aid groups have struggled to fill.

Cease-fire talks between Hamas and Israel, brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, are on hold, so for civilians in Gaza, the forced displacement that for many began last October, still has no end in sight.

In the Deir al-Balah region of central Gaza, 58-year-old Abu Nidal Musleh lives in a makeshift tent, wearing mismatched shoes.

The father of seven comes from the same area of northern Gaza were civilians were once again ordered to evacuate Monday, and he's been displaced four times in the last year.

When Hamas-led fighters attacked communities in southern Israel a year ago, they killed more than 1,200 and seized about 250 hostages, according to Israeli officials. Musleh was a teacher on his way to school that day.

He told NPR on Monday he feels empathy for the Israeli hostages held by Hamas -- but he blames Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the suffering both sides have endured, and he insists peace will only be possible if Israeli citizens oust their premier.

""Rise up against Netanyahu,"" he said. ""Rise up -- so we can have normal relations.""

Meanwhile, in the West Bank, violence has worsened in the past year between Palestinian militants belonging to Hamas and other armed groups, and Israeli settlers and the Israeli military, which oversees the occupied territory with a vast network of checkpoints and military outposts.

Over the past few months, some of the heaviest Israeli airstrikes in decades have rocked Palestinian communities in the West Bank, killing dozens, alongside large-scale raids into cities including Jenin.

In Ramallah, the Israeli-occupied West Bank's biggest city, dozens of Palestinians gathered in the main square Monday, waving Palestinian flags and carrying anti-occupation signs.

Basma Abu Sway said she had come to mark one year since the war in Gaza began, and called last Oct. 7 one of the most important days in Palestinian history.

She said she hopes the sacrifices made by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank will not be for nothing.

""All this blood, all this death is bringing peace to Palestine,"" she said. ""We deserve as Palestinian people to live in complete liberation.""

Settler violence and Israeli military raids into towns and villages in the West Bank have killed more than 730 Palestinians since the beginning of the war, according to a combined count of data from the United Nations and Palestinian health authorities.

On Monday the Palestinian advocacy group, Palestinian Prisoners' Club,, announced that Israeli military forces had arrested 45 people through Sunday night into Monday morning across the West Bank.

Rima Nazzal was also in Ramallah's Manara Square Monday, and said she felt concern and fear -- worried that Israel's occupation of Palestinians would grow stronger as a result of the its military's actions after Oct. 7 last year.

""The world says Israel has a right to defend itself,"" she said. ""As if it says Israel has a right to defend its occupation."""

This story is a part of an NPR series reflecting on Oct. 7, a year of war and how it has changed life across Israel, the Gaza Strip, the region and the world.

NPR journalists have spent the past year witnessing, capturing and documenting the suffering and pain that war has inflicted on people in the Gaza Strip, Israel, the occupied West Bank and Lebanon.

For Israelis, it began when Hamas militants stormed out of the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7 last year, attacking soldiers, families in their homes and a rave packed with young people. The attacks killed around 1,200 people and took 250 hostage, according to Israeli authorities.

Israelis have been divided since: Many have spent the past year in rallies demanding a cease-fire that frees the hostages. Others have pressed their government to continue fighting Hamas, even blocking aid crossing into Gaza.

In Gaza, nothing looks the same a year into the war. Among the more than 41,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire this past year are hundreds of families, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. More than half of those killed are women and children. Around 100,000 others in Gaza have been wounded, thousands of them children who have lost limbs.

A year on, nearly everyone in Gaza is displaced, huddling in bombed out schools and under makeshift tents without electricity, running water or safety.

Below is a collection of moments from the past 365 days of this war, captured by NPR photographers and others across the region."

Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed Monday that the U.S. ""will continue to work tirelessly"" to bring home the four American hostages who have now been held by Hamas for more than a year inside the Gaza Strip.

The four that remain -- Keith Siegel, 65, Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Omer Neutra, 22, and Edan Alexander, 21 -- were abducted by the Palestinian terrorist group exactly one year ago Monday on Oct. 7, 2023. The abductions took place alongside the murder of approximately 1,200 Israelis.

""Hamas also took 254 people hostage that day, including 12 Americans. Four of those Americans - Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Itay Chen, Judy Weinstein, and Gad Haggai - were murdered by Hamas. Four were released through an agreement the United States negotiated last November, but four remain in captivity in Gaza: Edan Alexander, Keith Siegel, Sagui Dekel-Chen, and Omer Neutra,"" Blinken said in a statement.

""There are also an estimated 97 other hostages who remain held in Gaza today. They include men, women, young boys, young girls, two babies, and elderly people from more than 25 nations,"" Blinken added. ""Hamas should release these hostages immediately. Every single one of them must be returned to their families, and the United States will continue to work tirelessly to bring them home.""

HAMAS LAUNCHES ROCKETS FROM GAZA ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 ATTACKS, WHILE IDF STRIKES TERROR TARGETS

Blinken, who on Monday called Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel the ""largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust,"" also said ""It is time to reach a ceasefire agreement that brings the hostages home, alleviates the suffering of the Israeli and Palestinian people, and ultimately brings an end to this war.""

The youngest of the hostages, 20-year-old Edan Alexander, graduated from Tenafly High School in New Jersey in 2022 before volunteering to serve with the IDF.

""He was kidnapped Oct. 7th from his post, from the IDF post, and since then, we have no additional information about this abduction,"" his father Adi has said.

Adi and his wife Yael wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times in September saying that for hundreds of days ""the world has failed our son and his fellow hostages: The Israeli government has abandoned them, too many countries have turned a blind eye, and while we're grateful for the U.S. government's steadfast support, its efforts have yet to yield results.

Omer Neutra, 22, also volunteered to serve in the IDF, according to his parents Orna and Ronen.

""He's like an all-American kid. He loved sports. He was accepted to Binghamton University, but decided to defer this school. And he went to Israel on a gap year, and he connected deeply with the country, with his peers, and he decided to volunteer to the IDF, and he was taken from his post,"" his mother Orna has said.

She recently told the New York Post from her home in Plainview, New York, ""Our kid is a bargaining chip in this geopolitical nightmare, and we, the families, we're just floating on this wave. We're trying not to sink.""

HEZBOLLAH ROCKET ATTACK ON ISRAEL HITS HAIFA FOR FIRST TIME

Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose 36-year-old son Sagui is still being held in Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, said in an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" in September, ""It is absolutely clear, the only way to get hostages home alive is by some kind of negotiated agreement with Satan.""

Dekel-Chen was abducted by Hamas in Kibbutz Nir Oz one year ago, according to the American Jewish Committee. The organization said he made sure his then-pregnant wife and his two daughters were safe in a shelter before confronting Hamas terrorists who had broken into his home.

Last November, Elan Siegel, the daughter of 65-year-old Keith Siegel, wrote in a column for Fox News Digital, ""They forced my parents, unassuming people filled with kindness and a quiet sensitivity, into my father's car and took them to Gaza.""

Siegel's wife Aviva later was released from captivity.

""It's just cruel to think that he's in such terrible conditions for so long,"" Aviva Siegel recently told the New York Post. ""What they're going through is the cruelest thing on Earth.""

The Israel Football Association (IFA) has responded to allegations of discrimination and a proposed suspension of its team from the Palestinian Football Association (PFA).

FIFA, the world's soccer governing body, launched an investigation into allegations of discrimination against the IFA last week. FIFA leaders made this decision when they ruled against suspending Israel from international play after the PFA proposed a suspension to Israel amid the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza earlier this year.

In a statement provided to Fox News Digital by IFA head of communications Shlomi Barzell over the weekend, the IFA condemned the PFA for its recent proposal to FIFA.

""Whoever fantasized about the suspension of Israeli football from the international arena or sanctions through lies and false accusations, has suffered a defeat,"" the statement read. ""Again, we have acted over time in different channels, in a calculated and proactive manner in the face of the challenge of the Palestinian Association and its leader to distort reality, and the result today leaves no room for doubt.

""We respect the authors of the report submitted to the council members and the decision of the council members to consider transferring two issues to a legal examination, as long as there is any factual justification for it. Thanks to values that represent a glorious democracy and an independent and determined legal system of the Football Association, we have never violated and will not violate any of the FIFA/UEFA rules,"" the statement read.

The PFA has not responded to multiple requests for comment from Fox News Digital.

The PFA's original proposal claimed at least 92 non-professional Palestinian players have been killed in the war, football infrastructure has been destroyed, its leagues suspended and its national team required to play World Cup qualifiers abroad. The Palestinian federation wanted FIFA to adopt appropriate sanctions against Israeli teams, including the national side and clubs.

Katarina Pijetlovic, head of the PFA's legal department, addressed FIFA's decision not to suspend Israel in posts on X on Oct. 3.

""FIFA allowed Israel FA to continue using the Palestinian territory [occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem] as their own territory, and to use football under its umbrella as an instrument of colonial expansion,"" she wrote in a post on X. ""The decision is purely political. Will we wait 2 yrs again, as in 2015-17, for the committee to suggest the obvious and then have their suggestion rejected again? Why don't they just say it: Israel has impunity to destroy FIFA member associations & use their colonized territories.""

""The people of Palestine know this team acts as a form of resistance and is conveying a message to the world,"" Gaza-Abed said. ""More than 50 sports facilities have been reduced to rubble in Gaza, including nine out of 10 of Gaza's stadiums. Almost every club has been destroyed in this war, while one stadium in Deir el-Balah has been turned into a shelter for thousands of displaced people.""

FIFA's disciplinary committee will now be asked to look into the allegations of discrimination. The PFA has specifically accused the IFA of complicity in violations of international law by the Israeli government, discrimination against Arab players and inclusion in its league of clubs located in Palestinian territory.

""The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offense of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,"" FIFA said in a statement. ""FIFA's Governance, Audit and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate... the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.""

The PFA's proposal of suspension was enough to convince FIFA to seek an independent legal council and hold a landmark council meeting to make a decision on whether to suspend Israel from international soccer because of the conflict with Hamas, said FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the FIFA congress in May.

However, for the time being, it doesn't appear that Israel will be subject to a suspension. A suspension may have severely impacted its hopes to compete in the 2026 World Cup, which will be played in North America. The final will be played in East Rutherford, New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from New York City.

Countries have been banned from competing in the World Cup in the past based on the actions of their governments and national team administrations.

Germany and Japan were banned from the 1950 World Cup after the end of World War II. South Africa was banned from 1966 to 1992 for violating FIFA's anti-discrimination charter due to apartheid. Mexico was banned for two years after using overage players in qualifiers for the 1989 World Youth Championship.

Israel has only ever qualified for the World Cup once, in 1970, and it didn't make it out of the group stage. Israel won a championship in the 1964 Asian Games. However, they were moved from the Asian Football Federation to the the European Confederation UEFA in 1994, where they have struggled to compete. The team suffered its most lopsided loss in its history in a 7-1 blowout to Germany in 2002.

Israel is currently in the midst of its UEFA Nations League schedule. It will play France on Thursday after starting off 0-2.

Meanwhile, Palestine is currently in the midst of group play for the FIFA World Cup Asian qualifiers. It will play Iraq on Thursday after starting group play with one loss and one draw. Palestine has never qualified for the World Cup.

Monday marks the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel, which killed 1,195 people, including 815 civilians, and resulted in 251 people being taken hostage. At least 31 Americans were killed during the attacks and 13 others were missing.

On Aug. 15, at least 40,005 Palestinians were reported to have been killed in Gaza since the war began. Gaza's health ministry doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but says at least 5,956 women and at least 10,627 children have been killed.

One year after the attack, Hamas marked the anniversary by firing a barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv on Monday.

Israel's war in Gaza rages on even as Israel is now fighting a new war against Hezbollah, escalating its bombing campaign in Lebanon the past three weeks. Last week Israel faced additional attacks from Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, in the form of missile strikes.

The strikes forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday, and even forced a pair of Israeli women's basketball teams to abandon their game and flee to shelter, per the Jerusalem Times."

Sen. JD Vance blasted the Biden-Harris administration on Monday for not doing enough to bring home the hostages that Hamas took from Israel during the deadly Oct. 7 attack one year ago.

Vance, R-Ohio, spoke during the Philos Project's Memorial Rally and March on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., briefly taking aim at President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

""I'm going to get a little political here. It is disgraceful that we have an American president and vice president who haven't done a thing,"" Vance said. ""Vice President Harris, our message is, 'Bring them home.' Use your authority to help bring them home. We can do it. We just need real leadership.""

Iran-backed Hamas terrorists launched a massacre against Israel in the Oct. 7 attack last year, killing about 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, and taking about 250 hostages. A year later, about 100 people, including several Americans, remain in Hamas captivity, as U.S.-led efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage release deal have sputtered out.

The attack sparked a war in Gaza, where Israel has moved to eliminate Hamas and return those taken hostage. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians.

Harris came under fire Sunday for a lengthy ""word salad"" answer in which she appeared unable to fully commit to Israel during an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes.""

Meanwhile, Vance gave full-throated support for Israel, saying that former President Trump will make sure Israel has the right to protect itself and that the hostages are returned home.

""I speak for Donald Trump and saying that when he is president, America will protect our American Jewish brothers and sisters. We will stop funding anti-American and anti-Jewish radicals. And we are going to bring home American hostages wherever they're held and whoever is holding them,"" he said.

Thousands breached a border fence. Others arrived in speedboats. Some even came by paraglider in a dawn attack by Hamas fighters a year ago that caught Israel by surprise, leaving 1,200 people dead and another 250 as hostages. It also set in motion events that now threaten to turn Israel's long-running conflict with Iran's proxies into a direct and dangerous war with Tehran.

Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023, marked the deadliest day in the history of modern Israel, triggering a devastating attack on Palestinians. The result has been a humanitarian catastrophe for Gaza. Beginning in the days after the Hamas attack, Israeli warplanes began punishing airstrikes inside the narrow strip of Palestinian territory that also lies adjacent to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. By the end of the month, Israeli forces had launched a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza.

At the one-year mark in the Israel-Hamas war, here are four things that are key to where things stand today.

In the aftermath of the Hamas attack, as Israelis mourned those killed, they also feared for the safety of the hostages. A central plaza in downtown Tel Aviv, unofficially dubbed Hostages Square, was quickly transformed into a gathering place for the families, friends and supporters of the captives. ""Bring them home now!"" emerged as a potent rallying cry, and posters showing the faces and names of the hostages became ubiquitous. Many Israelis began wearing special necklaces, bracelets and T-shirts to show their support for the captives. Daily vigils in Hostages Square drew large crowds.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- already weathering intense criticism for intelligence failures in the lead-up to the surprise attack -- came under intense pressure to halt the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages.

Although Israel and Hamas managed a brief cease-fire in November that allowed for the exchange of more than 100 hostages for nearly 250 Palestinian prisoners, the truce lasted just a week. Hamas did unilaterally release four hostages, and eight others were rescued by Israeli forces. Israel's military also recovered the bodies of several hostages.

The fate of the remaining captives in Gaza has remained an open wound for many Israelis. Netanyahu's office believes that of the 101 hostages still unaccounted for in Gaza, about a third are likely dead.

The hostages question continues to shape Israel's public response to the conflict.

Since the start of Israel's military response, the country's attacks have killed at least 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 16,500 children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Another 95,000 people have been injured, the ministry says.

Israel's military began its assault on Hamas in the north of Gaza, and as Palestinian civilians sought to escape the fighting, most of them fled southward, displacing them from their homes and cutting them off from critical infrastructure needed for daily survival.

Recent data from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization and Palestinian officials in Gaza indicate the attacks have damaged or destroyed more than half of Gaza's homes, 80% of its commercial facilities and 85% of the territory's schools.

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has called the humanitarian situation in Gaza a ""moral stain on us all,"" and the aid group Refugees International has said that Israel's military response ""has wrought disproportionate death and suffering among civilians in Gaza, generating famine-like conditions while obstructing and undermining the humanitarian response.""

Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, which Israeli authorities considered to be a Hamas stronghold, experienced some of the most intense bombardment of the conflict.

In the first few months of fighting, Rafah, near the border with Egypt in southern Gaza, was designated as a ""safe zone"" by the Israeli military -- meant as a place where civilians could shelter and get access to desperately needed international humanitarian aid. Even so, Israel continued to carry out airstrikes on Rafah, some targeted at Hamas fighters or facilities, while others aimed to free Israeli hostages, according to the Israeli military. Some of those airstrikes hit homes, killing and injuring dozens of civilians, and others destroyed food distribution sites. More than half of Gaza's prewar population of 2.2 million was believed to be sheltering in Rafah. In May, Israel issued evacuation orders for the city and launched an offensive that sealed the border with Egypt, which until then was one of the main entry points for humanitarian aid.

Food, drinking water and materials for temporary shelters are in short supply and are being carried in by trucks operated by international relief organizations. People in Gaza are down to one meal every other day, and an estimated 50,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are in urgent need of treatment for malnutrition.

U.S. efforts to speed aid to Gaza have also floundered. A special $230 million temporary floating pier known as the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore system (JLOTS) operated only intermittently as damage from high winds and rough seas in the eastern Mediterranean repeatedly rendered it inoperable.

Besides the brief cease-fire to facilitate a hostages-for-prisoners swap, repeated rounds of peace talks -- some mediated by Qatar -- have failed to make much progress. Deep-seated animosities and the fragmented nature of the Palestinian leadership have played a part in preventing any lasting peace deal.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has tried to walk a fine line between diplomatic and military support for its long-term ally, Israel, and a desire to mitigate the suffering in Gaza while trying to contain a wider war that increasingly has dragged Iran and Israel into direct conflict and could engulf the rest of the Middle East.

For the moment, cease-fire talks that at times sparked optimism have fallen silent.

In late September, Secretary of State Antony Blinken summed up the U.S. position, saying, ""Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorism. The way it does so matters.""

Meanwhile, public opinion in the U.S. has been split largely along partisan lines, with conservatives showing support for Israel, but some people, younger and more liberal, turning out for pro-Palestinian rallies on college campuses.

Among Democrats, more than half say that Israel bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war in Gaza, while only about 4 in 10 Republicans do, according to a Pearson Institute/AP-NORC poll published last week.

That political dichotomy could influence the outcome of a likely tight U.S. presidential race, with some Democrats suggesting that Netanyahu is ignoring the Biden administration's peace entreaties in an effort to tip the election toward former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, voters in key battleground states give Trump higher marks than his opponent, Vice President Harris, on foreign policy matters, according to a recent poll by the New York-based Institute for Global Affairs.

From the opening days of the conflict in Gaza, the Biden administration warned against allowing the Hamas attack to morph into a war that could bring in Hezbollah -- the Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant group -- as a primary combatant and could eventually lead to a direct conflict with Tehran.

But increasingly in recent weeks, that's exactly what seems to be happening.

On Oct. 8, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets against Israel in support of the Palestinian militants fighting in Gaza. Israel hit back, and for months, low-level conflict simmered along the Lebanon-Israel border. Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, mostly stayed out of the conflict. But an Israeli attack in April against an Iranian diplomatic base in Syria that killed several of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers changed the dynamic. Less than two weeks later, Iran retaliated with a large-scale drone and missile strike on Israel. The attack, heavily telegraphed by Tehran in an apparent effort to contain the fallout, was easily repulsed by Israeli air defenses, assisted by the United States.

Fast-forward to last month: In an operation credited to Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, in synchronized attacks over two days, electronic pagers belonging to members of Hezbollah suddenly exploded across Lebanon, killing more than a dozen people -- including two children -- and wounding thousands more, according to Lebanese health authorities.

Soon after, Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes against southern Lebanon that it said were aimed at Hezbollah targets. One that hit a residential building in downtown Beirut killed a top Hezbollah commander.

As Israeli airstrikes continued days later, multiple residential buildings in southern Beirut were demolished. On Sept. 27, Israel announced that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who led the militant group for more than three decades, was killed in one of the strikes. Hezbollah later confirmed his death.

Israel also hit ports and power stations in Yemen operated by another Iran-backed group, the Houthis.

The United Nations says about 1 million Lebanese have fled their homes amid the Israeli airstrikes. Israeli authorities say about 63,000 Israelis remain displaced from the border area with Lebanon due to Hezbollah rocket fire.

On Oct. 1, Israel opened a ground offensive in southern Lebanon, a move that hearkened back to a similar 1982 invasion of the country's south by Israeli forces, which led to an 18-year occupation and to a monthlong war that Israel fought against Hezbollah in 2006. Less than 24 hours later, Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack on Israel. The country's extensive defenses -- bolstered by two U.S. destroyers deployed in the region -- intercepted most of the Iranian missiles. However, Israeli officials acknowledge that some of the Iranian missiles did hit an air base."

The Iranian-backed Hamas and its supporters unleashed a scale of unprecedented barbarism, including beheadings and burning bodies, within the territory of the Jewish state, resulting in the mass murder of nearly 1,200 people, including over 30 Americans.

The U.S. designated terrorist movement Hamas also kidnapped more than 250 people on that fateful day that jolted Israel like none of the numerous wars against Iran-backed proxies that the tiny Jewish state has fought within this century. As of Monday, 101 hostages still remain in Hamas captivity, .

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

After a year of intense war with Hamas, including the opening of six additional fronts against the Islamic Republic of Iran's ""Axis of Resistance,"" Netanyahu has bounced back to take on the threat to Israel's very existence. He is in his prime as a modern war planner and head of state, a number of Israeli experts told Fox News Digital, including Israel's top diplomat to the United Nations.

""Prime Minister Netanyahu's leadership in this war is a case study in tenacity and courage.""

""Netanyahu was completely shocked during the first hours on the first day of the attack, but at the same time, he understood what was going on and controlled events. Netanyahu responded very quickly,"" Ariel Kahana, the senior diplomatic correspondent for the widely read Hebrew-language daily Israel Hayom, told Fox News Digital.

Kahana referenced Netanyahu's public announcement on Oct. 7, in which he declared, ""Citizens of Israel, we are at war, not in an operation or in rounds, but at war. This morning, Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the State of Israel and its citizens.""

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ISSUE WARNING AHEAD OF OCT 7 ATTACKS ANNIVERSARY

Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, said, ""This isn't a war Israel started nor is it a war Israel wanted. But, under the leadership of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel has succeeded in mitigating the threat of Hamas by destroying its tunnel infrastructure and taking out its leaders. Israel is also successfully degrading Hezbollah in the north by eliminating its senior leadership and launching a targeted operation in southern Lebanon with the goal of pushing the group north of the Litani River and reducing the threat the terrorist organization poses to our northern border.""

Danon, who is a member of Netanyahu's conservative Likud party, added, ""While we are making progress, there is still work to be done. We still have 101 hostages who are held in brutal captivity in Gaza, and we still have 70,000 Israelis who are refugees in their own country, unable to return to their homes in the north.""

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY TERRORISTS IN GAZA

Prior to Oct. 7, Netanyahu was an embattled prime minister. His right-wing coalition government had suffered public humiliation when his administration was forced to abandon its judicial reform plan because of massive civil society protests.

Now, with a string of tactical victories over Hezbollah and Hamas' top leaders, including Israeli control over most of the Gaza Strip, Bibi, as he is known in Israel by his nickname, has gained popularity in political polling.

""Bibi made the right actions against Hamas and Hezbollah. That is why you see him rising in the polls.""

One key turning point for Israel is the near total decimation of the leadership of the U.S. classified terrorist movement Hezbollah, including its leader Hassan Nasrallah, in Lebanon.

ISRAEL WAS BEHIND LEBANON PAGER ATTACK TARGETING HEZBOLLAH, SENIOR US OFFICIAL SAYS, AS NEW BLASTS REPORTED

The de facto ruler over the Lebanese state, Hezbollah, launched missiles at Israel one day after the Hamas invasion, on Oct. 8. Last week, Israeli ground troops entered south Lebanon, with a view toward rooting out Hezbollah terrorists and missiles that sparked the flight of as many as 70,000 Israelis from their homes in the north.

Kahana noted, ""Bibi made the right actions against Hamas and Hezbollah. That is why you see him rising in the polls. He is the only one to use the term victory. You don't hear that from the security establishment."" He cited the examples of Bibi's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and Herzi Halevi , the chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, who ""are not talking about a complete defeat of Hamas.""

The veteran Israeli commentator said Israel's seizure of the southern Gaza city of Rafah was a telling example of a clash between Bibi and his war planners, Gallant and Halevi. There was hesitation on the part of Gallant and Halevi while Netanyahu wanted to expedite the capture of Rafah, the last major holdout of sizeable Hamas terrorist forces. Kahana chalked up a possible explanation of delay from Gallant and Halevi to the Biden administration's interference in having expressed opposition to the IDF operation in Rafah.

After a four-month offensive in Rafah, the IDF, in September, declared victory over Hamas' Rafah brigade. The incursion into Rafah also secured the release of four Israeli hostages in June. From May to September, the IDF eliminated thousands of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in Rafah.

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

According to Kahana, ""Bibi had to push the army to act."" He compared Bibi to Britain's WWII prime minister, Winston Churchill, who demanded that his army do certain things but encountered resistance. Kahana noted, ""Netanyahu has full responsibility for what brought about Oct. 7, but he is leading the war better than Gallant, Halevi and Benny Gantz.""

""What is the strategy, what is the exit plan in the war against Hezbollah?""

Gantz, a retired general and leader of the main opposition party, left Bibi's war cabinet in June.

Yet Bibi still has many critics who believe he should have tendered his resignation on Oct. 7 or a few months into the war against Hamas. Netanyahu has also been accused of forgoing the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and thousands of Israelis have protested on a near weekly basis against his policies since the war began.

Yossi Melman, a veteran Israeli columnist for the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, is one of Bibi's sharpest critics. Melman said, ""His performance is very bad."" He said Bibi has ""no vision and no strategy."" Melman asked, ""What is the strategy, what is the exit plan in the war against Hezbollah?""

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

He claimed, ""Most of his decisions are about political and personal survival.""

Israel's then-attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, charged Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a legal saga that started four years ago and is still unfolding. Netanyahu has vehemently denied all the allegations against him.

Melman also claimed that Netanyahu, along with his cabinet, military and security chiefs, refused to accept responsibility for Oct. 7.

As one of Israel's leading intelligence experts, he attributed the penetration of Hezbollah's leadership structure to the ""last four chiefs of the Mossad and the military chiefs. ""Israel's foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, built these abilities over the years,"" he said.

He also claimed that Netanyahu also ""strained relations with the U.S. in an unprecedented way. His performance is full of ungratefulness. The U.S. sent air carriers and the U.S. provided $14 billion in extra military aid and resupplied ammunition. Without that, Israel could not sustain one year against Gaza and now Lebanon and also Iran.""

Melman also noted that Bibi has failed to secure the freedom of 101 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.

Caroline Glick, who served as an adviser to Netanyahu, took issue with criticism against him, pointing out, ""Prime Minister Netanyahu's leadership in this war is a case study in tenacity and courage. Israel's other political leaders and military leadership all demanded that he capitulate to continuous pressure from the Biden-Harris administration to stand down and permit Hamas to survive and accept Hezbollah's continued presence on the border, sufficing with an entirely defensive posture.""

She continued, ""Had Israel agreed, its regional standing would have completely collapsed. He refused. His tenacious refusal to give up the fight and determination to fight to victory is the reason Israel has been able to turn the corner. Israel is winning today in a way that seemed unimaginable a year ago. We never would have made it to this turning point had it not been for Netanyahu."""

TOPLINE Over the last several months, joint state and federal task forces have raided more than 100 vape and smoke shops, hemp product manufacturers and distributors in North Carolina, alleging that they are selling marijuana disguised as hemp.

The 2018 Farm Bill allows the production of hemp and all its derivatives so long as it contains 0.3% of THC or less. In 2022, hemp-derived cannabinoid product sales hit $28 billion overall, while legal marijuana products generated $26 billion in sales during that same period, according to cannabis data firm Whitney Economics.

But hemp farmers, Whitney Economics estimates, have lost about $3.1 billion in annual sales due to the state bans and legal confusion that has followed.

Despite what the Farm Bill states, there is plenty of debate about whether hemp-derived THC products are legal under federal law. That's because hemp-derived cannabinoids -- including delta-9 THC and delta-8 THC (a less potent compound that is affectionately called ""weed lite"" or ""decaf kush"") -- are legal under the Farm Bill if those compounds are found naturally in the plant.

Yet most intoxicating hemp products on the market are made by converting hemp-derived CBD isolate into delta-9 THC or delta-8 THC using a chemical process.

North Carolina's crusade against hemp is not the only front in this war on drugs. Late last month, California Governor Gavin Newsom banned hemp-derived THC through an emergency order. Newsom said that the move was to prevent the sale of intoxicating hemp products to children.

But California also views hemp products as a threat to its struggling $5 billion legal marijuana market.

WHY IT MATTERS ""What's going on in the hemp industry right now shows how complicated and nuanced the legalization of cannabis can be,"" says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. ""Even though marijuana and hemp are variations of the same plant -- Cannabis sativa L -- marijuana is still illegal at the federal level while hemp is legal.""

One year ago today, Hamas launched an ambush attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking hostages. This unleashed the deadliest war in Palestinian history. According to the Gaza health ministry, at least 41,000 people in Gaza have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and fire. Now, Israel is bombing Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Hear directly from people in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank as they describe how one year of this war has upended their lives. For more coverage marking this anniversary, check out NPR's special series page.

The war in the Middle East is personal in the swing state of Michigan. The GOP and Democrats are focused on the Arab and Muslim American voting bloc, and the state has the largest Lebanese American population in the country. Many in the state have families living in the areas of Lebanon that are being bombed right now.

A new report has found that both Harris' and Trump's economic plans would increase the national debt. According to the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, Trump's plan would add an estimated $7.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, while Harris' proposals would cost the government an estimated $3.5 trillion. The committee has cautioned that there could be a future fiscal crisis if politicians do not take more decisive action on the national debt. Let's take a closer look at the details of both economic plans.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Michigan to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

Michigan, a ""blue wall"" state, is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House. But the victory won't be easy. Harris and former President Donald Trump remain in a close battle. Here are key factors that could decide which way Michigan swings:

""The day still keeps surprising us,"" my colleague Anas Baba in Gaza texted me last Oct. 7, close to midnight.

I was at a hospital in southern Israel. The waiting room was full of parents in a daze, waiting for word about their children who had come under attack at an outdoor techno rave near the Gaza border. In Gaza, our producer Anas was taking photos of families fleeing their homes as Israeli airstrikes rained down.

It was the deadliest day in Israeli history. It sparked the deadliest war in Palestinian history. One year later, it has grown into a regional war. Every day keeps surprising us.

A year later, I find myself thinking about where the survivors and witnesses of this war draw strength.

I think about Batya Ofir, a woman my colleague Itay Stern and I met the other day at Kibbutz Be'eri, the Israeli village that suffered the greatest loss -- 102 people there were killed. Her brother was killed along with his family. She felt survivor's guilt, and she told us she asked herself whether she wanted to keep on living.

""I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she said. Today, she is learning how to kayak in the sea to help her face her fears. ""I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

Our colleague Anas Baba in Gaza has been reporting for NPR in Gaza all year. Again and again, he has videotaped bodies brought into the morgue after Israeli airstrikes. He always trains his camera on young children, sheltering near the morgue, standing alone and watching silently as bodies are laid out.

What gives him strength, he said, is collecting biscuits and fruit to give to the children he meets. ""I can help them survive,"" he told me.

He often meets a young girl named Habiba at the hospital in central Gaza. She's been colorblind since birth. One day, she told Anas she saw a man drowning with water coming out of his nose. It wasn't water; it was blood.

""This girl does not know the color of blood,"" Anas told me. ""I wish all the children in Gaza were colorblind now."""
Vigils and protests mark one year since Hamas attacks on Israel as fighting rages on,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/g-s1-26634/october-7-israel-gaza-lebanon,2024-10-07T09:59:01Z,"Two people embrace as relatives and supporters of Israelis killed in the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas attack attend a ceremony at the Nova memorial near Kibbutz Reim in southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2024.

Memorial services across Israel are taking place Monday, a year on since Hamas' attacks on communities close to the country's border with Gaza, and as the Israeli military extends its retaliation against the group in Gaza as well as on Hezbollah targets to the north in Lebanon.

Twelve months ago, fighters from Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and several other nations, killed around 1,200 people and seized more than 200 hostages from inside Israel, according to the Israeli government.

The ensuing war in Gaza has killed at least 41,900 Palestinians and wounded more than 97,300, according to Gaza's health ministry on Monday.

In Lebanon, where Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets on Israel in support of Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza, the death toll has risen above 2,000, according to Lebanese officials. Israeli airstrikes continued to pound parts of the capital Beirut overnight into Monday, after rockets launched from Lebanon hit the Israeli port city of Haifa Sunday. The United Nations says more than 1 million Lebanese have been displaced from their homes, including tens of thousands who have fled across the border into neighboring Syria.

Across the world, candlelight vigils are taking place Monday to commemorate those killed in the surprise Hamas attacks one year ago, with thousands planning to gather, from Tel Aviv to Paris to New York, as well as marches and protests to demand a cease-fire, particularly in Gaza.

Talks to produce a cease-fire, which many Israelis hope would see the estimated remaining 101 hostages released by Hamas, are on hold.

Across Israel, memorial events will mark the deadliest day in the country's history. The government has organized one, another is being led by the family members of Israeli taken hostage or killed, and more are being held in locations close to Gaza where the attacks happened last year.

One of those is at the Nova music festival site, where Israelis gathered Monday to listen to the last track of music played there before Hamas fighters ambushed festival-goers.

A wail in the crowd pierced a moment of silence, as attendees remembered the more than 360 people killed at the site a year ago.

""We tried to wake up from this nightmare, but we cannot,"" said Ofir Duchovne, who was there to mourn his 26-year-old friend. ""I did not imagine that the war would be so long in Gaza. And now we have another front on the north and with Iran,"" Duchovne said. ""And we're stuck. Nothing has changed.""

Nearby, frequent Israeli artillery fire into Gaza was audible, and the Israeli military said it had responded with airstrikes to rockets had been launched out of Gaza at almost the same moment they had done a year ago, at the start of the current war.

At another rally in nearby Kibbutz Be'eri, a community close to Gaza where almost 100 residents were killed and more than two dozen hostages seized, the plight of those still held inside Gaza was central to the event.

""Wars do not end in absolute victory or a clear decision, wars end in agreements,"" said Merav Svirsky, whose brother Itay Svirsky was taken hostage and then killed in January in Gaza. ""The question is, with how many human lives will we pay by then? The lives of soldiers, the lives of civilians and the lives of civilians including our people who are currently hostage in Gaza and have been in immediate life-threatening danger for a year."""
One year after 10/7 attacks and Democrat-run states have let antisemitism fester,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/one-year-after-10-7-attacks-democrat-run-states-have-let-antisemitism-fester,2024-10-07T09:22:57Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

October 7th was the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Hamas invaded Israel, murdering people at random, raping, destroying homes and kidnapping people back to Gaza. There are more than 100 still held hostage, including four Americans.

Raw and hurting, American Jews watched the streets of U.S. cities fill up with crowds. The people in the streets weren't marching to stand with the slaughtered and the raped. They were gleeful, exuberant and there were many of them.

In New York's Times Square, hundreds of people gathered on October 8, while Israel was still sorting through their dead, and counting how many children and elderly had been kidnapped, to flash swastikas and chant ""death to Israel"" as well as ""700,"" the number of Israeli dead counted at the time. That number was later revised to 1,195.

AS OCTOBER 7TH ANNIVERSARY APPROACHES, JEWISH STUDENTS BRACE FOR PROTESTS, VOW TO 'WALK PROUDLY'

In Los Angeles, it's been nearly a year of violent protests outside synagogues and in Jewish neighborhoods. One Jewish man was killed after a confrontation in November.

It seemed like antisemitism was festering all over the country.

But a closer look showed that it wasn't, actually, happening everywhere, it was very specifically happening in places primarily run by Democrats. It's not that antisemitism can't exist in red areas. It can, it does. Vandalism, verbal harassment, even physical assault can happen in Republican-led places. But the occurrence is far rarer and the real difference is the consequences.

According to the Anti Defamation League (ADL) ""The states with the highest number of incidents were California (1,266), New York (1,218), New Jersey (830), Florida (463) and Massachusetts (440)."" Four of those states are blue states. In my red home state of Florida, we had approximately the same number of incidents as Massachusetts while having about three times the population and a third of the incidents of New York despite having over 2 million more people.

The ADL is a left-leaning Jewish organization, and yet they admit, ""On a per capita basis, the states with the highest concentration of antisemitic incidents were New Jersey - with 8.93 incidents per 100,000 residents - followed by Vermont (6.64), Massachusetts (6.28), New York (6.23), Maryland (5.49) and Connecticut (5.09). On the city level, two cities - Manhattan (26.84 per 100,000) and Washington, D.C. (25.75 per 100,000) - stood out with far and away the highest levels of incidents per capita. Brookyln [sic], NY, stood out specifically in terms of physical assault incidents, with 1.16 assaults per 100,000 residents."" Again, all deep blue states and cities.

The argument to defend the blue states, and their rampant antisemitism, is that Jews primarily live in those blue states, so of course, antisemitism will be higher. But that doesn't explain Florida's low count. It's also hard not to notice that Mississippi had 19 incidents of vandalism and harassment while New Hampshire had 35 when they each have under 1% of their population being Jewish and Mississippi is nearly double New Hampshire's population. There is a pattern, and it's related to whom the population elects.

Antisemitism simply does not thrive in red areas the same way as it does in areas dominated by Democrats. Jew-hatred, and the chaos that accompanies it onto our streets is put down as quickly as it surfaces in places like Florida.

Last October, Dr. Ahmed ElKoussa was fired from his job as a Miami dentist after ripping down posters of kidnapped hostages being held by Hamas. Anti-Israel agitators protested outside Real-Time Laboratories, an American company which is a subsidiary of an Israeli weapons manufacturer, in Boca Raton, but were met with even more pro-Israel protesters. When the anti-Israel protesters got violent, Boca Raton Police immediately took action and made arrests.

And in May, when anti-Israel protesters pulled their usual move of attempting to block a highway in Orlando, they lasted a total of 11 minutes before Florida Highway Patrol arrested them. Governor Ron DeSantis boasted, ""I think that's the world record.""

Meanwhile, in New York, the Manhattan district attorney has dropped all charges against the violent anti-Israel protesters who occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall. In California, protesters have spent the last year blocking traffic for the Palestinian cause. Only some incidents yielded arrests. In March, protesters stopped traffic outside San Francisco International Airport and blocked security lines inside for four hours. No one was arrested. This simply does not happen in red states.

School campuses in red states were relatively quiet, while Ivy League campuses in the northeast featured Jewish students being told to ""go back to Poland"" and assaulted. The protests that did spring up on red state campuses were quickly brought under control.

Antisemitism simply does not thrive in red areas the same way as it does in areas dominated by Democrats. Jew-hatred, and the chaos that accompanies it onto our streets is put down as quickly as it surfaces in places like Florida.

It was obvious to the students at some of the red-state universities that the protests were about Israel, yes, but they were about America too. U.S. flags were often torn down and replaced with Palestinian flags. At the University of North Carolina, fraternity brothers protected an American flag from being defaced, while at Princeton University, protesting students halted a Memorial Day parade because it featured an American flag.

Open antisemitism exposes a deep rot in societies and the hatred of Jews for the last year has caused many to notice that the same people hate America too. History is filled with examples of governments and societies that no longer exist because succumbing to the world's oldest hatred was a clear sign that their civilization was on a downhill trajectory. What is happening in blue cities is exposing their own decay.

Cities, like New York, that had been prospering not so long ago have had a hard time bouncing back from the bad policies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the rolling back of crime policies during the Bill de Blasio administration. Antisemitism is a symptom of a larger problem and places that control antisemitic activity can count on flourishing in a way that places that don't won't. Jew-hatred can happen anywhere, the acceptance of it does not."
"One year after 10/7, Iran is losing the war. Now, Israel must secure peace",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/one-year-after-10-7-iran-losing-war-now-israel-must-secure-peace,2024-10-07T09:22:56Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

One year ago, Iran took a gamble and started a war in Gaza with the attack by Hamas that killed nearly 1,200 Israelis, including over 40 Americans, and took more than 200 hostages

A year later, it is clear that Iran is losing this war.

For his part, Ayatollah Khamenei on Friday, October 4, 2024, remembered the massacre as ""logical and legal"" and used his first public Friday sermon in five years to proclaim that Iran ""won't back down."" He also had a rifle at the podium. He's that worried.

ISRAELI MILITARY KILLS 250 HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS SINCE START OF LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN LEBANON

You can measure the defeat of Iran in two ways. The first is restoring Israel's security and carrying out the military destruction of Iran's terror agents Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and more.

Israeli strikes of the past several weeks have brought this goal closer.

Second, getting Israel and Saudi Arabia back on track toward normalizing relations will be the ultimate defeat for Iran.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

Iran couldn't stand it.

Last fall, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman were in serious, quiet negotiations. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan wrote in his Foreign Affairs article that the work toward joint infrastructure projects and new partnerships between Israel and its Arab neighbors was ""bearing fruit.""

""Every day we get closer,"" bin Salman said in an interview aired Sep. 20, 2023.

""We can forge a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said to President Joe Biden during a televised meeting in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly sessions that same day.

The impending deal included a significant Palestinian component of concessions by Israel. ""It is not a done deal and there are many variables, but the odds are more than 50%,"" a senior Israeli official told Axios at the time.

Diplomacy was bubbling along, with Netanyahu invited to Washington, D.C., at the end of the year.

You can imagine how that went over in Tehran.

Less than two weeks later, Iran gave ""the green light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut"" on Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, sending word to Hamas and Hezbollah, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The objective was to force Israel into a war to blacken its reputation and scorch any path to peace.

To do it, Iran coached Hamas to change tactics.

Just three years earlier, in May 2021, Hamas waged an all-out missile war with huge salvoes to overwhelm Israel's missile defenses, to no avail. Even with the incredibly brief warning times characteristic of short-range launches, Israel's multi-layered defensive system held. Of course, the Israeli Air Force hit weapons caches and launch sites. Egypt stepped in to broker the ceasefire.

This time, the kind of war sought by Iran would have to go beyond missile attacks.

Officers of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps began specific planning with Hamas for the attack in August 2023. The goal was ""the most significant breach of Israel's borders since the 1973 Yom Kippur War,"" the Journal reported Oct. 8, 2023.

And so it was. Note Iran was content to let the civilians of Gaza pay a terrible price being caught of the middle of a war zone.

Most of the Hamas military structure in Gaza was destroyed by the spring of 2024. Biden offered a ceasefire on May 30. Hamas toyed with agreement, but this time there would be no ceasefire despite strenuous efforts by Egypt and Qatar. Iran wasn't ready.

Enter Hezbollah. A surge in rocket attacks across the alleged UN ""blue line"" effectively saw Hezbollah take the lead in fighting. Now, Israel would have to contend with Hezbollah, too. The war entered a new phase with the July 30 killing of Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas Politburo, in Tehran itself.

Israel's systematic campaign has decimated Hezbollah's leadership, culminating with the pager attacks and the death of Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's strikes in Lebanon are now attempting to restore border safety.

A year after the initial attack, Iran is the loser by any military standard. Two big missile attacks on Israel have been thwarted. The military advantage rests with Israel. However, I suspect more strikes on legitimate military and infrastructure targets to reduce Iran's power may be required.

Despite Israel's military successes, dangers remain. For a year, the American military has done everything President Joe Biden asked in the name of deterrence. This includes steps that made sense: U.S. Navy destroyers intercepting Iran's missiles, aircraft carriers and F-22s deployed with strike options. And measures that didn't, such as the Gaza aid pier. The bottom line is 40,000 U.S. forces deployed to the U.S. Central Command region, all to keep a lid on Iran. That can't go on forever (although China would like it).

The path ahead depends on restoring Israel's security and taking out Iran's capabilities. After that, the goal is to get back to the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a goal shared by the Trump and Biden administrations. It's not easy - the two-state dilemma remains. But it is the one sure way to defeat Iran, for good.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

And it's important for Americans to stay committed to Israel's security and to the diplomatic goals, despite the pain caused by the shock unleashing of antisemitism. Too many 21st Century Americans turned out to be biased, ignorant, susceptible to foreign instigation, or all of the above. We Americans have to do better than this.

Don't forget that in the words of the Justice Department's Indictment of Hamas, the government of Iran's regional and global campaign of terrorism aims to ""weaken and ultimately destroy both the United States and Israel.""

America's best interest remains to support Israel - and take all military steps necessary to get back to the regional diplomacy that will shut down Iran for good."
New Jersey high school allegedly banned yellow ribbons honoring Israeli hostages: 'Deeply offensive',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-jersey-high-school-allegedly-banned-yellow-ribbons-honoring-israeli-hostages-deeply-offensive,2024-10-07T09:06:55Z,"October 7th Nova festival survivor Millet Ben Haim shares the harsh reality of the Israel-Hamas war as the one-year anniversary nears.

A New Jersey high school is accused of banning yellow ribbons, aimed at honoring Israeli hostages abducted by Hamas, at a club fair, a move critics described as ""deeply offensive"" and ""blatant antisemitism.""

Fair Lawn High School also prohibited Israeli flags at the event, because administrators believed the flags were too political, some parents and the group StopAntisemitism allege, noting that members of the Muslim Student Association were permitted to display a keffiyeh, a traditional headdress worn by men from parts of the Middle East, according to the New York Post.

The event, according to the report, was partly promoting a trip to Israel.

""What happened at Fair Lawn High School is an alarming case of hypocrisy and blatant antisemitism,"" StopAntisemitism founder Liora Rez told the outlet. ""This incident is nothing short of a direct violation of Jewish students' rights to express their identity and humanitarian concerns.""

AMERICAN FATHER OF HAMAS HOSTAGE ITAY CHEN PUSHES US, ISRAEL ON 'PLAN B' AS NEGOTIATIONS FALTER

Between 33% to 40% of the 35,000 residents in Fair Lawn are Jewish. Fair Lawn in Bergen County is located about 17 miles from New York City.

This comes a year after Hamas terrorists' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks against Israel, which led to military retaliation from Israel and sparked a still-ongoing war in the Middle East. More than 250 people, including some Americans, were abducted by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attacks. Many hostages have since been released, rescued or killed, while dozens are still held by Hamas.

One parent said the school district's failure to address complaints about alleged antisemitism is not a new concern.

""The incident at Fair Lawn High School's Club Fair is not an isolated event but part of a disturbing pattern of antisemitism that I and other parents have been battling for years,"" Adi Vaxman, founder and president of Operation Israel, which provides humanitarian relief to Israel, told the New York Post.

""Despite numerous meetings with the board of education and the superintendent, promises of inclusion in anti-antisemitism efforts have gone unfulfilled,"" added Vaxman, whose daughter Maya attends the school.

Vaxman continued: ""The administrator's claim that the yellow hostage ribbon -- a humanitarian symbol calling for the release of innocent civilians abducted from their homes and held in subhuman conditions by Hamas -- is 'political' is deeply offensive and unacceptable.""

ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF OCT. 7 ATTACKS ARRIVES WITH LASTING TRAUMA FOR ISRAELIS, AMERICAN JEWS: EXPERT

Claiming a double standard, Vaxman said that the black-and-white keffiyeh, which she says is ""a symbol of the armed resistance against Israelis,"" was allowed to remain on display at the club event for hours.

""This glaring double standard exposes the bias of the school and the administrator in question,"" she said. ""It's alarming that the school supports the Muslim Student Association identifying as Palestinian while censoring the Israeli flag for the Jewish Student Union. Israel is the world's only Jewish state, naturally associated with Judaism and relevant to the [Jewish Student Union's] advertised trip to Israel.""

Fair Lawn High Principal Paul Gorski released a statement defending the school's response to ribbons and flags.

""We take pride in our Student Activities program as well as the leadership shown by both students and faculty,"" Gorski wrote. ""During this year's event, both the Muslim Student Association and the Jewish Student Union were asked to adjust items that were not part of their original displays. Both groups received the same instruction and were treated equally.""

Gorski said no students were disciplined in connection with their participation at the club fair.

The principal also said the high school participates in the Anti-Defamation League's ""No Place for Hate"" initiative and that the school was ""proudly recognized"" with a Gold Star distinction from the group during a ceremony earlier this year.

""We condemn antisemitism and remain steadfast in our commitment to creating an inclusive community where hate is not tolerated,"" he said. ""When we return to school after being closed for the Jewish holidays, we will engage in dialogue with our students and community. Hate has no home at Fair Lawn High School.""

Vaxman, however, maintains that the school discriminated against Jewish students during the club fair.

""This selective application of rules further demonstrates the discriminatory treatment of Jewish students,"" Vaxman said. ""The school's response is extremely disappointing and fails to address these core issues. Their participation in the 'No Place for Hate' initiative rings hollow when Jewish students face such blatant discrimination and intimidation in their school on a regular basis. We demand concrete actions, not empty platitudes, to combat antisemitism and ensure true equality for 'all' students."""

They survived the Oct. 7 attack locked in their home's safe room. Cohen's goal is to rehabilitate the kibbutz and bring all the survivors back within two and a half years. Maya Levin for NPR hide caption

This story is a part of an NPR series reflecting on Oct. 7, a year of war and how it has changed life across Israel, the Gaza Strip, the region and the world.

KIBBUTZ BE'ERI, Israel -- The natural course of grieving is distorted here, a year after the Oct. 7 attacks.

This tight-knit Israeli community near the Gaza border is digging up its dead from temporary graves further away and reburying them back home, where it is safer to gather now, a year into the Gaza war.

""I'm so exhausted after every funeral that we have to deal with again,"" said Gal Cohen, the head of the kibbutz. ""Because it brings [back] everything, and we cry again.""

Israeli authorities say about 1,200 people were killed last Oct. 7, as Hamas led thousands of attackers bursting out of Gaza, ambushing Israeli towns and communities. Kibbutz Be'eri suffered the biggest loss of any single village: 102 people killed -- about one out of every 13 people living there.

The deadliest single attack in Israeli history led to the deadliest war in Palestinian history, with more than 41,000 Palestinians killed in the Gaza Strip this past year, according to health officials there.

This year, Kibbutz Be'eri has grappled with questions of death, memory, guilt and vengeance.

""Questions from [the] inferno, really,"" says Merav Roth, a prominent Israeli psychologist, and the sister of former Israeli prime minister Yair Lapid, who has counseled the kibbutz members all year long.

This is the story of some of their answers.

Silence is what helped keep the survivors of this small community alive the day of the attack. Silence is what they carried out of hiding from their safe rooms along the Gaza border to a hotel on the Dead Sea that took them in.

""It was the most quiet place I've ever seen,"" says Roth, who met them there. ""Everybody were quiet, defeated. Their bodies were, like, no air inside.""

She had heard their whispers on Oct. 7, carried live on the news.

""The Israelis, we all were on the radio, hearing them whispering to the radio people: 'Why doesn't anyone come? Where are everybody? Where's the army? They're in my house, they're shooting at me.' We will remember this for the rest of our lives, all of us,"" Roth says.

When the Israeli military eventually published its investigation into the attack on Kibbutz Be'eri, it found about 340 attackers had infiltrated the community and that it had taken about seven hours for significant numbers of Israeli forces to arrive to fight off the invasion there.

It took many weeks to account for everyone: who was dead, who was captive in Gaza. Roth sat with the survivors of Kibbutz Be'eri in the Dead Sea hotel basement as the village secretary read the names of 27 identified bodies and 108 people unaccounted for.

""It's just name by name by name,"" Roth said. ""Everybody are, again, quiet, dead quiet.""

This year, Roth has helped the kibbutz make agonizing decisions.

""For instance, there is a boy in the kibbutz who lost four members of his family, two parents and two siblings. So do we tell him about each separately or do we tell him about all of them together?"" she says.

Roth has also counseled former hostages who returned from Hamas captivity in Gaza, families whose loved ones were killed in captivity, and Israelis who didn't experience a personal loss but still suffer from sleeping difficulties, anxiety attacks and depression.

""They are extremely anxious about the future of this place. Many of them leave the country. Because their parents told them that in the Holocaust, those who didn't leave, died,"" she says. ""Hopelessness and helplessness are so strong. The trauma is national.""

From the very first days after the Oct. 7 attack, Roth coached other therapists how to respond.

""When I gave guidelines to the therapists in Be'eri at the beginning, I said, smile and say, how are you? Because these people don't know that it still matters. You have to show them that their wellbeing is still relevant. The life instinct wants to see that someone calls him back.""

At Kibbutz Be'eri, one recent afternoon, teens and parents walked quietly out of the neighborhood cemetery after a funeral for a mother and her 15-year-old son -- two of the many reburials of recent months.

Reburied with the boy was his surfboard: his dying wish as he bled out in his home Oct. 7.

Batya Ofir attended the funeral. She recently reburied her own brother and his family in the kibbutz cemetery, after viewing his partially decomposed body be exhumed from its temporary grave.

""It was not easy,"" she says, ""but I had to see him.""

She wanted to be with his body at the moment it was unearthed. She had not lived on the kibbutz any longer and felt guilty she wasn't with her brother and family in their worst moment on Oct. 7.

Ofir says she made a decision, after her brother was killed.

""I said to myself, what do you want? To continue living? I can also not. I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she says. ""I have a family, I have children, I have grandchildren. I draw. I'm learning to kayak, to deal with all my fears. I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

A couple hundred families have moved back to Kibbutz Be'eri. Cohen, the head of the community, is overseeing an ambitious project to bring the residents back within two and a half years.

The kibbutz has broken ground on a new neighborhood of 52 homes.

A short walk away, though, are the homes that were attacked last year. Bullet holes, shattered windows, a pair of children's shoes in the debris: Oct. 7 frozen in time.

There's a debate in the community about what to do with these broken homes. Cohen says it will be put up for a vote.

""Some of the people say, let's make it like Auschwitz. Okay? And it'll be open for people to come and see what happened here,"" he says.

But he says others who survived the attack are taking sleeping pills to cope with the trauma and cannot bear seeing the destroyed homes. ""I believe we'll have to take them all down in the end.""

He doesn't want one person moving back to the kibbutz to see the remnants and relive the nightmare.

Yasmin Raanan, 56, waters her new plants on her patio. She and her husband moved back home to the kibbutz from the Dead Sea hotel a few months ago.

On Oct. 7, she grabbed her personal firearm, and she and her husband locked themselves inside their reinforced shelter room at home. They survived the attack because they had installed a sliding bolt on the safe room. The attackers tried but failed to open the door. Her neighbors' safe rooms only had the standard locks and were breached.

When she was finally rescued that night, and led out of her safe room, she found her living room floor covered in rows of grenades, gas canisters, explosives, rocket-propelled grenades and rifles. She understood: Her home had been transformed into the attack headquarters. Neighbors all around her were gunned down.

Then she saw the man she had heard all day loading gun cartridges in her home. He was sitting outside, she says, stripped naked by orders of the military, and guarded by an Israeli soldier.

""I came with my gun to kill him,"" she recalls. ""A commando soldier said, 'Ma'am, we are a moral people.' I said, 'I have no more morals anymore.'""

The commando took away her weapon, and she says she took the attacker's face in her hands and demanded to know his name. He gave it.

One year later, the Israeli military has left much of Gaza in ruins. That gives her a measure of comfort.

And one year on, the passage of time has taken some of the edge off her anger.

""A year later, things sink in a bit,"" she says. ""Time heals."""
"American father of Hamas hostage Itay Chen pushes US, Israel on 'Plan B' as negotiations falter",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-father-hamas-hostage-itay-chen-pushes-us-israel-plan-b-negotiations-falter,2024-10-07T08:16:30Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

""When was the last time you talked to your kid? Do you know where he slept last night? Do you know what he ate? Do you know if he had a blanket on him?"" Ruby Chen, father of Itay Chen who was taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, asked in a sit-down interview with Fox News Digital.

""All those types of questions are questions that we ask ourselves constantly,"" he said. ""The feeling is that we've been failed.""

Itay,19 years old when he was taken, has remained a hostage held in Gaza for 365 days after his unit in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was attacked in southern Israel when Hamas terrorists flooded the border in a series of mass assaults.

Chen, a New York City native, said he and his wife have been given ""unprecedented"" access to the White House, the CIA and other top agencies throughout the last year to discuss ongoing strategies to try and get the hostages out of Gaza.

ISRAEL SAYS TOP HAMAS RAFAH BRIGADE 'DISMANTLED' ON PHILADELPHI CORRIDOR, 2,000 TERRORISTS KILLED

The Chens have not only met with national security adviser Jake Sullivan a dozen times, as well as CIA Director William Burns and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, they also hold a weekly call with the White House.

But ultimately, these supportive efforts have fallen flat when it comes to the real needs of American families whose loved ones are still held hostage by Hamas.

""We have been failed by the Israeli government, we, as U.S. citizens, feel we've been failed by the Biden administration despite all of the access that they've provided us,"" he explained. ""They share as much as they can. But at the end of the day, it's... very black and white.

""Where is he?""

Chen explained that following the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, the Israeli government pushed a strategy to secure the release of the then 251 hostages by bombarding suspected Hamas positions in Gaza.

In the initial weeks following the deadly Hamas attacks, Israel began pounding northern Gaza - a move Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believed would bring Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar ""to his knees"" and make him be ""willing to release hostages.""

A week-long cease-fire in November saw the release of 105 hostages. Twelve other hostages have been freed following negotiations during the immediate aftermath of the attack, or because of IDF rescue operations between February and August.

YAZIDI WOMAN HELD HOSTAGE FOR 10 YEARS IN GAZA RESCUED IN ISRAEL, US OPERATION

None of the eight American hostages that were kidnapped have been released, and only seven continue to be held by Hamas after the body of Hersh Goldberg-Polin was discovered by IDF forces in late August, after he along with five others were killed by the terrorist group.

More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in the Gaza Strip - 97 of whom were abducted on Oct. 7, 2023.

The Chens, other American families and the international community have repeatedly urged Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire agreement and return all hostages to their families.

But disagreements over security corridors in Gaza have created a seemingly insurmountable hurdle as U.S., Egyptian and Qatari officials work to get Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement.

The father of the IDF soldier pointed out that so long as no one is discussing a ""day after"" plan for the Gaza Strip and the Palestinians there, Hamas will continue to hold tightly to its most powerful bargaining chip, the hostages.

""Where is Hamas in the day-after? And if no one is willing to talk about it, then Hamas believes that they are better off holding on to the hostages until something changes,"" he explained. ""It's a jihad organization. They wish to have chaos. They are looking for a regional conflict.

""When they see that there's now a conflict with Lebanon, that does not motivate them to get into a cease-fire agreement. On the contrary, they wish to belong, and have other players join in this jihad against Israel,"" Chen continued. ""So I question, what is the plan?""

""I am very critical of the time,"" Itay's father said. ""The last 10 months, I've been asking Mr. Sullivan, What's plan B?

""I haven't heard of a Plan B. And that's unacceptable,"" he added.

BLINKEN TRAVELS TO EGYPT FOR CEASE-FIRE TALKS AS ISRAEL ADDS NEW WAR GOAL

Securing peace in the region became even more precarious last week after Israel, against the objections of the U.S. and its international allies, launched an incursion into southern Lebanon with the expressed intent of dismantling the threat posed by Hezbollah.

Chen pointed out that this second front not only added another dimension to securing the release of the hostages, but it also seemingly pushed talks with Hamas on the backburner as concerns remain high over a broader regional conflict.

""If you could follow the news, you could see that the hostage issue has been less prioritized,"" he said. ""And that's a very difficult feeling for us and the families.""

Netanyahu has said his top priority is securing the release of the hostages, but his refusal to withdraw from the Philidelphi Corridor due to security reasons has created a negotiation impasse and questions have begun to mount over whether the prime minister is truly prioritizing the hostages over his push to ""eliminate Hamas.""

But the parents of Itay - who has been described as a ""fun-loving kid,"" the ""sandwich"" of the family with an older sibling and younger sibling, everybody's ""best friend,"" and a former Boy Scout turned a young man with a loving girlfriend - cannot allow for him, or the others still in Gaza, to be at the mercy of any political agenda.

""I'm a guy that comes from New York City - and we talk less, we look at actions. The actions of the last year show the opposite."" Chen said. ""He can say whatever he wants. I don't believe a thing that comes out of his mouth, I believe in what he does.""

The father of three also urged the Biden administration to question whether it is still in the U.S.'s strategic interest to unequivocally back Netanyahu.

""There is no accountability from either side for failed negotiation. You do not see any equation that says, 'OK, if you do not do A, then there's a consequence' on either side,"" Chen said in reference to both Israel and Hamas. ""There's no consequence associated with a negative action to a strategic interest of the United States.""

Chen also argued that ""effective pressure"" needs to be put on Hamas by reevaluating what other ""pressure points"" can be utilized.

The father pointed to the clear need for tougher economic and diplomatic involvement when it comes to international aid sent to Gaza - including tougher sanctions not only on adversarial nations but on partner countries that allow aid to flow into Gaza.

This includes stricter oversight of United Nations-provided humanitarian aid, which though intended for the Palestinian people, is falling into the hands of Hamas, a group that is not designated as a terrorist organization by the UN.

Hamas has long been accused of seizing basic goods in Gaza and then reselling them in a black-market scheme at exuberant prices.

Reports have further indicated that Hamas for years has had substantial access to monetary aid siphoned from funds provided by top organizations like the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which has been directly used for combatant operations against Israel, including tunnel building and access to arms.

But aside from the substantial need to address aid-based concerns, Chen also argued that diplomatic solutions are not being fully recognized by the U.S.

Nations like Russia and Thailand secured the release of their citizens taken by Hamas, and Chen argued Washington - which was able to negotiate with its biggest adversary just months ago to free U.S. citizens from Russian prisons - should be working to do the same to secure the release of those held in Gaza.

""So, it's possible,"" Chen said. ""Complicated, yep. Doable, yep.""

""The assumption that was put in front of us at the beginning was that U.S. hostages will come out via a larger deal that Israel will be a part of. And if that assumption is not working out after a year, then yes, we need to challenge the administration and look at that assumption."
Israeli strike on Gaza mosque kills 19 as conflict widens in Lebanon,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5142440/israeli-gaza-lebanon-oct-7,2024-10-06T19:40:29Z,"Smoke billows from the site of an Israeli air strike that targeted a neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs on Oct. 6, 2024.

Israel has intensified its strikes in Gaza and Lebanon, as the expanding conflict in the Mideast approaches one full year since the Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7.

Israeli airstrikes this weekend have killed scores of people, according to health officials in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israel's government continues to mull a response to nearly 200 Iranian missiles targeting Israel last week.

In northern Gaza, the Israeli military dropped leaflets warning of a ""new phase of war,"" as commanders issued fresh evacuation orders for the several hundred thousand residents that remain in the northern part of the strip.

In the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza, Israeli ground troops have encircled a sizeable swathe of territory, where they say they have launched a large-scale assault against Hamas fighters for the first time in months, forcing civilians once more to flee.

Meanwhile, just days after sending soldiers into southern Lebanon, the Israeli military has struck buildings and other targets it links to Hezbollah across Lebanon overnight.

Israel says its recent operations inside Lebanon are part of an attempt to prevent Hezbollah rockets that have landed in northern Israel for the past year, forcing tens of thousands of Israeli civilians to evacuate towns and cities in the region.

At least 56 people have been killed in Gaza this weekend, according to the local health authorities there, prompting a seemingly endless series of funerals after a strike on a mosque Sunday. The building was so close to a nearby hospital morgue that no ambulances were required, with bodies of the at least 19 dead simply carried by hand from one compound to the next.

Israel said it had been a ""precision strike"" on the mosque, targeting Hamas militants inside, but mourners said the approaching one-year mark of the fighting in Gaza was a horrible reminder of the costs families there have faced, with more than 41,000 deaths recorded in the past 12 months.

""Enough, world, enough, tomorrow will be a complete year,"" said Hakima Al Jamal, as she watched her dying father be carried out of the mosque. ""We are tired. By God, we're so tired.""

More Israeli troops are being moved to the border with Gaza to protect one-year commemoration ceremonies in communities affected by Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks last year that killed some 1,200 people and saw more than 200 hostages taken into Gaza.

On the eve of those ceremonies, a knife and gun attack in the southern city of Beersheba has left one person dead and 10 others wounded, according to Israeli emergency services.

Police have not yet identified the attacker, who launched the rampage at the city's central bus station. But officials said they were treating it as a terror incident, with the country currently on high alert after several stabbing, shooting and ramming attacks in the past year, including one in Tel Aviv last week that saw seven shot inside and around a transportation hub.

In southern Lebanon, the Israeli military says it has lost as least nine of its troops and killed more than 400 Hezbollah fighters, as it ramped up destructive strikes on the capital Beirut. The strikes were concentrated in the city's southern suburbs that have historically served as a hub for Hebzollah, an Iran-backed militant group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and other nations.

Israel says its latest strikes targeted ""weapons storage facilities and infrastructure sites,"" but in the past two weeks similar strikes have also killed civilians, including children. The total death toll in Lebanon has now topped 1,000, and the Israeli assault has displaced more than a million people -- around a fifth of the country's population.

In the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, new arrivals from the country's south -- some of them refugees from Syria forced to move on once more by another round of conflict -- have seen their lives shattered in a short period of time.

While local residents sit on blue plastic benches -- young men sharing videos on their phones, older couples whiling away the time -- the Israeli airstrikes penetrate further north into the country, leaving few secure locations for civilians.

One man, Riqad, who only gave his first name out of concerns for his safety, had arrived four days ago with his family from the southern suburbs of Beirut, after earlier fleeing Israeli attacks near their home in the southern city of Tyre.

""There is no safe place"" Riqad said Saturday. ""The Israelis are bombing everywhere."" As he spoke, two young children in his family asked an adult relative if the bombs would reach them at the hotel where a politician affiliated with Hezbollah had granted shelter to them and other displaced families.

A few hours earlier, Israeli jets had fired on a nearby refugee camp for Palestinians, close to Tripoli. The attack targeted a commander linked to the militant group Hamas, as well as members of his family, and represented the most northerly attack by Israel since the conflict began in Gaza, 200 miles to the south.

The devastating impact on Lebanese society has been shockingly swift. One pre-med student, who gave only her first name Yasmin, had started college only a month earlier.

""I thought it would be one of the best years of my life. I've worked so much to get to the university I am in,"" she said. ""Now, all I miss is my university days ... the coffee there, my friends, studying in the library. That's all I want now."""
Why The Israel-Hamas War Death Toll Is Uncertain -- 1 Year After Start Of War,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/06/why-the-israel-hamas-war-death-toll-is-uncertain-1-year-after-start-of-war/,2024-10-06T19:18:56Z,"A year after Hamas attacked Israel, prompting a counterattack on Gaza and a regional conflict that recently bled into Lebanon, the death toll continues to grow, but remains uncertain amid discrepancies in figures reported by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and logistical challenges in tracking the dead.

The Gaza Health Ministry has struggled to maintain accurate tallies due to the destruction of data-keeping technology and infrastructure in the war, according to analysis published by The Lancet, which noted an estimated 10,000 victims are likely still buried in the rubble of destroyed buildings. Some of the dead also go uncounted because ""what we've seen in Gaza is entire families just being wiped out,"" so there is no one to report them dead, Emily Tripp, the director of Airwars, a watchdog group that tracks war casualties, told Nature.

The non-governmental organization, Airwars, has also determined the death toll is likely underestimated after finding some victims' names are missing from the list released by the Ministry. Some experts, including Israel-based independent researcher Mark Zlochin, believe the death toll is overcounted because it likely includes people who are missing, but not dead, he told the scientific journal Nature.

The Ministry updated its breakdown of the fatalities in May to clarify that approximately 25,000 of the 35,000 reported dead at the time were ""people who have been fully identified."" The Ministry revised its count of women and children estimated to be dead to about 60% of all reported fatalities, down from a previous estimate of about 70%, sparking allegations of inaccuracies from Israeli officials. The World Health Organization, however, expressed confidence in the new tally amid the dispute, noting that it's a ""step forward"" that 25,000 bodies have been identified, World Health Organization spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said during a press briefing at the time that it's ""normal"" for death tolls to shift in conflict.

Nearly every day. The death toll doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. The death toll includes nearly 16,756 children and more than 10,000 people who are missing.

More than 97,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

1,139 have been killed and at least 8,730 have been injured, as of Sunday, according to Israeli officials.

At least 742 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and more than 6,250 have been injured.

Hamas invaded Israel in a surprise land, sea and air attack launched from the Gaza Strip in what was the deadliest day in Israeli history, and for Jews since the Holocaust, following decades of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Hamas militants took more than 240 people hostage; 154 of whom have been freed or rescued, with 97 remaining in Gaza, including 33 believed to be dead. Israel declared a state of war the day after the attack and launched air strikes, followed by a ground invasion, on Gaza. The Israeli invasion has spawned a humanitarian crisis as the dismantling of critical infrastructure and the Israeli occupation has blocked routes into Gaza, restricting the flow of aid. The outpouring of international support for Israel has dwindled since the start of the war as a broad coalition of its allies, including the U.S., have called for a cease-fire. The war has since expanded to Lebanon as tensions between Hezbollah and Israel reached a tipping point in July when a rocket attack Israel says Hezbollah carried out killed 12 children playing soccer in the Golan Heights region. Israel has retaliated with air strikes followed by a ground invasion, killing Hezbollah's' longtime leader and other top officials, and Hezbollah has vowed its strikes will continue unless there's a cease-fire in Gaza.

56%. That's the share of Israelis who want to see an end to the war if all hostages are returned, according to a July poll by the Israel Democracy Institute.

Fox Nation's 'Black Saturday' with Trey Yingst takes viewers inside horrific events of October 7,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/fox-nations-black-saturday-trey-yingst-takes-viewers-inside-horrific-events-october-7,2024-10-06T12:20:32Z,"Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst's new book, which is available now, provides a riveting, on-the-ground account of the devastating Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.

A three-part docuseries of the same name, based on Yingst's book, is streaming now on Fox Nation, with a condensed version airing on Fox News Channel on Sunday night at 10 pm ET.

Yingst began writing ""Black Saturday: An Unfiltered Account of the October 7th Attack on Israel and the War in Gaza"" during the immediate aftermath of Hamas' horrific assault. At the same time, he was also working to provide Fox News viewers with the latest information from southern Israel and Gaza.

Yingst told Fox News Digital he feels the book is unique because it was penned in the field by a correspondent who was ""living this story"" in real time.

ANTONY BLINKEN DOES VICTORY LAP ON BIDEN-HARRIS 'STRONGER' FOREIGN POLICY SAME DAY IRAN ATTACKS ISRAEL

""'Black Saturday' is the gold standard in storytelling when it comes to what took place on October 7 in southern Israel and the war that followed,"" Yingst said from Tel Aviv.

""A massacre against the civilian population of Israel unfolded in the early hours of October 7, when Hamas militants crossed the border from the Gaza Strip into the communities that line Gaza in southern Israel, and it killed soldiers and civilians alike and dragged more than 240 hostages back into Gaza,"" he continued. ""'Black Saturday' talks about our experience, the Fox News team in Jerusalem responding to that attack.""

Yingst and his team reported from the Gaza border area as the attack unfolded.

""'Black Saturday' tells that story, and then the stories of the soldiers and the police officers and the civilians in southern Israel who were trying to make sense of what was unfolding, and then take the fight back to Hamas inside Gaza, along with the stories of Palestinian civilians who were directly affected by this conflict and continue to be affected today,"" he said.

Yingst has extensive sources inside the Israeli military, along with inside Hamas' senior leadership. He also speaks to Palestinian civilians in Gaza on a regular basis, and Israeli civilians who are waiting for their loved ones to come home after being taken hostage.

""This book really captures all of those angles. It is a book about Israelis. It is a book about Palestinians. It is a book about October 7 and the war that followed, and it is a book about humans,"" Yingst said.

He details the horrifying ordeal at the start of the book and shows readers the risks that reporters take to bring critical information to the world.

""The soldiers that we were with got lost, and they were driving through areas that hadn't been cleared, that Hamas was routinely operating in, firing RPGs, anti-tank missiles and small arms fire at Israeli soldiers in the weeks prior, and we had no way out. We were stuck in that moment, and as I open this book, 'Black Saturday,' I talk about this moment,"" he said.

""I truly thought this could be it,"" Yingst continued. ""This could be the moment that I die.""

For the project, Yingst interviewed a range of people to include multiple perspectives, including Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, high-ranking IDF soldiers, Hamas official Dr. Basem Naim and Gazan journalist Nael Ghaboun.

""I think that when you read it, you will learn more about what that morning was like for Israelis who were living through hell on Earth. You'll learn more about the behind-the-scenes reporting that we did to bring that story to our viewers under fire in real time,"" Yingst said.

""Black Saturday,"" the latest offering from Fox News Books, also includes 16 pages of full-color photographs.

A strike on a mosque kills 19 as Israel bombards northern Gaza and southern Beirut,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/g-s1-26576/israel-bombards-northern-gaza-and-southern-beirut,2024-10-06T12:14:54Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike on a mosque in the Gaza Strip early Sunday killed at least 19 people, Palestinian officials said, as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Beirut in a widening war with Iran-allied militant groups across the region.

Displaced people were sheltering at the mosque that was struck near the main hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah. A further four people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering displaced people near the town.

The Israeli military said both strikes targeted militants, without providing evidence.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead from the strike on the mosque were all men.

Israel is still battling Hamas in Gaza a year after the group's attack on Israel, and has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has been trading fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel has also vowed to strike Iran itself after Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week.

The widening conflict risks drawing in the United States, which has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel, as well as U.S.-allied Arab countries that host American forces. Iran-allied militant groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have already joined in with long-distance strikes on Israel.

The Israeli military, meanwhile, announced a new air and ground offensive in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, home to a densely populated refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. It circulated photos and video footage showing a column of tanks heading toward the area.

Israeli forces encircled Jabaliya as warplanes struck militant sites inside, the military said. Over the course of the war, Israel has carried out several large operations there, only to see militants regroup.

Israel reiterated its call, from the opening weeks of the war, for the complete evacuation of northern Gaza. Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained in the heavily destroyed north after earlier Israeli warnings that sent around a million fleeing to the south.

""We are in a new phase of the war,"" the military said in leaflets dropped over the area. ""These areas are considered dangerous combat zones.""

Palestinian residents reported heavy Israeli strikes across northern Gaza. The Civil Defense -- first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government -- said several homes and buildings had been hit and they were not able to reach them because of the bombardment.

Residents posted about the airstrikes and mourned their relatives on social media. Imad Alarabid said in a Facebook post that an airstrike on his home in Jabaliya killed a dozen family members, including his parents. Saeed Abu Elaish, a Health Ministry medic, said he was wounded and bleeding.

""Pray for us,"" he wrote on Facebook.

Hassan Hamd, a freelance TV journalist whose footage had aired on Al Jazeera and othr networks, was killed in artillery shelling on his home in Jabaliya. Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera reporter in northern Gaza, confirmed his death.

The military says it has expanded the so-called humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, urging people to head there. Hundreds of thousands of people have already sought refuge in sprawling tent camps there with little in the way of food, water or toilets. Israel has carried out strikes in the humanitarian zone against what it says are militants hiding among civilians.

Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says a little more than half were women and children.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack and took another 250 hostage. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

In Beirut, airstrikes lit up the skyline and loud explosions echoed across the southern suburbs, known as the Dahiyeh, throughout the night, as Israel struck what it said were Hezbollah militant sites.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said the area was hit by more than 30 strikes overnight, the heaviest bombardment since Sept. 23 when Israel escalated its air campaign.

The targets included a gas station on the main highway leading to the Beirut airport and a warehouse for medical supplies, the agency said. Some of the overnight strikes set off a long series of explosions, suggesting that ammunition stores may have been hit.

Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted.

Hezbollah said it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers in northern Israel ""with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately."" It was not possible to confirm the claim.

At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from its border so that tens of thousands of Israeli citizens can return to their homes.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily.

Last week, Israel launched what it said was a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters.

It is not possible to verify battlefield reports from either side."

'There is no life' after Oct 7: An Israeli mother grapples with grief one year after Hamas' devastating attack,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/there-no-life-after-oct-7-israeli-mother-grapples-grief-one-year-after-hamas-devastating-attack,2024-10-06T11:06:34Z,"Sigal Shemer, an Israeli mother from Lod, Israel, opens up about the murder of her eldest son on Oct. 7 and how she's navigating her grief one year later.

Sigal Shemer headed to the cemetery in Lod, a city in central Israel, in late September to wash her son's headstone and place flowers on his grave.

Ron, her eldest son, was murdered by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, after the militant group launched an early morning attack on southern Israel, killing roughly 1,200 people and taking more than 250 as hostages, according to estimates from Israeli authorities.

Numbers compiled by Fox News indicate an estimated 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza, almost 365 days later, including seven Americans.

Sigal reflected on the death of her son and the enduring impact of Oct. 7, one year later, in an interview with Fox News Digital.

Trauma has reshaped her life and left an indelible mark on her family, but she's found some solace and hope through the Jerusalem-based nonprofit OneFamily, which offers support and resources to victims of terror. Through community outreach, the organization has become a lifeline, helping her navigate the complexities of her sorrow while honoring her son's memory, amid a background of ongoing violence and loss.

Ron had been attending the Nova music festival in Re'im when the carnage unfolded, running with his friends to a car to escape the sound of gunshots in the area and the horror that was beginning to take place.

But the 23-year-old didn't want to leave without two of his close friends. He opted not to get into the car and instead went to look for Dan and Omar. Soon after he found them, the trio went inside a shelter not far from the festival.

HAMAS TERRORISTS 'SYSTEMATICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY' COMMITTED SEXUAL VIOLENCE DURING OCT. 7 ATTACK: REPORT

""He told to a friend, 'Don't be afraid. I will attack if someone will come in. I will attack them, and I will take care of you.' But the terrorists dropped three grenades into the shelter,"" his mother told Fox News Digital.

Dan was killed, Omar survived and Ron was taken outside, where he was heard fighting and struggling with Hamas militants. He wasn't heard from for days and his family feared he had been taken hostage.

""One week after, there was a knock on the door, and they told us -- the army and the police told us -- that Ron is... is not... is not alive because they shot him in the head,"" Sigal said.

She took a moment to remove her glasses and wipe away the tears from her eyes. The death of her son is still palpable and raw for the mother of two, who is survived by her husband Oren, and younger son Bari.

Sigal remembered Ron as a young man who loved people and animals, loved to travel and loved to help others.

He was a counselor at a Jewish youth summer camp in Pennsylvania, where he taught children Muay Thai, a form of boxing and the national sport of Thailand.

Since his murder, the Shemer family has returned to the camp, meeting with those who knew Ron and visiting all of his favorite places in the United States.

Before Oct. 7, Ron was on a 10-month trip to South America and Sigal feared for his safety.

""All the time, I was afraid that something will happen to him because it's, you know, in Brazil, the Amazonas, Colombia -- places that -- they're not so safe. And I tell him, please come home, please come home. It's not safe there. So, he came home and it's not safe here. It's not safe to be here,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""The terrorists, the monster... came inside the country and killed and murdered and raped and burned a lot of people, innocent people.""

""There is no life. I think there is no life. There is no life from the 7th of October,"" she added.

Sigal was working as an event producer prior to the day that's now known as ""Black Saturday."" She's since left her job, consumed by grief, and now works two days a week taking care of dogs, something her son loved to do.

""I want people to know that my son and all of the murdered boys and girls on the 7th of October are lost for the world,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""Many people in Israel lost their sons and daughters for nothing. Just for nothing.""

OneFamily Fund has provided support to many families whose loved ones were murdered in the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.

Naomi Nussbaum, OneFamily's executive director, told Fox News Digital how they use different types of therapy to help families cope with the loss of a loved one.

""We offer three types of support: Emotional support, financial support and legal aid. We've given out much, much more financial aid now than before because of the kind of devastation, you know, the nature of the attack on October 7th,"" she said.

""There's traditional therapy with psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, trauma-informed therapists tackling PTSD throughout all the categories. Dealing with PTSD is the most insidious and difficult part of the terror attacks to deal with. Then, we have the social network, which is really the heart and soul of OneFamily.""

Sigal has met with other mothers whose children were murdered and said it's not an easy thing to do, but it's helpful to speak with someone who's suffering from a similar situation and going through the same stages of grief.

""We're like professional friends for life. And the other people in the group that we put her with will be there also. You know, she can call anybody at any time to have dinner or to go for a walk or for a birthday or the anniversary of a death. They'll be there for each other forever,"" said Nussbaum.

""It takes a lot of courage and strength to smile again for the first time or to take a little bit of joy to say, let's go out to dinner tonight. Sometimes, the guilt and the grief and bereavement is too strong, and people can't do that. So, OneFamily, really with open arms and a lot of love, does everything they can to get them to want to come back to life again.""

A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital in Israel's nearly 12-month-long war against Hamas, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 6,200 women and 11,300 children.

The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.

Israel expands its bombardment in Lebanon as thousands flee widening war,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/g-s1-26567/israel-expands-its-bombardment-in-lebanon-as-thousands-flee-widening-war,2024-10-06T07:14:31Z,"MASNAA BORDER CROSSING, Lebanon -- Powerful new explosions rocked Beirut's southern suburbs late Saturday as Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon, also striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in the north for the first time as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters.

Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza.

The strong explosions began near midnight and continued into Sunday after Israel's military urged residents to evacuate areas in Dahiyeh, the predominantly Shiite collection of suburbs on Beirut's southern edge. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. They followed a day of sporadic strikes and the nearly continuous buzz of reconnaissance drones.

Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted.

The strikes reportedly targeted a building near a road leading to Lebanon's only international airport, and another building formerly used by the Hezbollah-run broadcaster Al-Manar. Social media reports claimed that one of the strikes hit an oxygen tank storage facility, but this was later denied by the owner of the company Khaled Kaddouha.

Shortly thereafter, Hezbollah claimed in a statement that it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers near the Manara settlement in northern Israel ""with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately.""

On Saturday, Israel's attack on the northern Beddawi camp killed an official with Hamas' military wing along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palestinian militant group said. Hamas later said another military wing member was killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley. The aftermath showed smashed buildings, scattered bricks and stairways to nowhere.

Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began , in addition to most of the top leadership of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah as fighting has sharply escalated.

At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from shared borders so displaced Israelis can return to their homes.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily.

Last week, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a brief war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters.

Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters in Damascus that ""we are trying to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon."" The minister said the unnamed countries putting forward initiatives include regional states and some outside the Middle East.

Araghchi spoke a day after the supreme leader of Iran praised its recent missile strikes on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary.

On Saturday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ""Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and respond to these attacks, and it will do so."" On Lebanon, he said ""we are not done yet.""

Fleeing Lebanon on foot

Israel's military earlier Saturday said about 90 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Most were intercepted, but several fell in the northern Arab town of Deir al-Asad, where police said three people were lightly injured.

At least six people in Lebanon were killed in more than a dozen Israeli airstrikes overnight and into Saturday, according to the Lebanese state-run National News Agency.

Nearly 375,000 people have fled from Lebanon into Syria in less than two weeks, according to a Lebanese government committee.

Associated Press journalists saw hundreds continuing to cross the Masnaa Border Crossing on foot, crunching over the rubble after Israeli airstrikes left huge craters in the road leading to it on Thursday. Much of Hezbollah's weaponry is believed to come from Iran through Syria.

""We were on the road for two days,"" said Issa Hilal, one of many Syrian refugees in Lebanon who are now heading back. ""The roads were very crowded ... it was very difficult. We almost died getting here."" Some children whimpered or cried.

Other displaced families now shelter alongside Beirut's famous seaside Corniche, their wind-flapped tents just steps from luxury homes. ""We don't care if we die, but we don't want to die at the hands of Netanyahu,"" said Om Ali Mcheik.

The Israeli military said special forces were carrying out ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon. It said troops dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border.

More evacuation orders in Gaza

Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the Health Ministry there, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. Almost 90% of Gaza's residents are displaced, amid widespread destruction.

Palestinian medical officials said Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza on Saturday killed at least nine people. One in the northern town of Beit Hanoun killed at least five, including two children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Another hit a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four, Awda hospital said.

Israel's military did not have any immediate comment but has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas.

An Israeli airstrike killed two children in Gaza City's Zaytoun neighborhood, according to the civil defense first responders' group that operates under the Hamas-run government.

Israel's military warned Palestinians to evacuate along the strategic Netzarim corridor in central Gaza that was at the heart of obstacles to a cease-fire deal. The military told people in parts of the Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps to evacuate to Muwasi, a coastal area it has designated a humanitarian zone.

It's unclear how many Palestinians are in those areas. Israeli forces have often returned to areas in Gaza to target Hamas fighters as they regroup."

About 3 in 10 (31%) Americans believe Israel's military operations in Gaza are going too far, a slight increase from last December, according to a new Pew Research Center poll, which shows a plurality of Americans, 36% to be exact, are unsure about Israel's handling of its war with Hamas. Meanwhile, 20% of Americans believe Israel is doing enough while 12% say Israel should be doing more -- but both of those numbers have declined in the past 10 months, from 25% and 16%, respectively.

The Pew Research Center poll also found more Americans in September said the U.S. should play a role in resolving the war diplomatically (61%) than they did in February (55%). And Republicans in September remained more likely than Democrats (25% vs. 13%) to say the U.S. should not be involved in the diplomatic resolution of the war, according to the Pew Research Center, a drop from the 32% of Republicans and 21% of Democrats who said in February there should be no U.S. involvement in the war's resolution.

A new survey from the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 25% sympathize more with Israelis, and 15% sympathize more with Palestinians. Most -- 31% -- claimed to have equal sympathy for both sides, and another 26% report having no sympathy for either. These numbers also have not changed much since before the attack on Israel last year.

The Associated Press-NORC survey marked an increase in the number of Americans who support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, up to about 29% now compared to 22% before the Oct. 7 attacks, in August 2023. Around half of the Americans surveyed said they neither favor or oppose an independent state (a drop from 58% in August 2023), while 17% were opposed, about what it was (15%) in 2023.

About 4 in 10 Americans say the U.S. is spending too much on military aid for Israel, very consistent with polls in February and November, according to the Pearson and AP survey.

Even before the Oct. 7 attack -- and Israel's two-front war in Gaza and Lebanon -- a whopping 79% of Americans were either concerned or very concerned about the Israel-Hamas war leading to a larger Middle East conflict, according to a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll published a year ago.

""The mix of U.S. opinions on the Gaza war reflects the complexity of a conflict where Americans may see bad actors and innocent victims on both sides,"" the Associated Press reported, citing Paul Poast, a political scientist at the University of Chicago and a research affiliate of the Pearson Institute. Poast added the conflict's nuances have lended to ""very strong views on both sides.""

The U.S. has remained a large player in the Israel-Hamas war despite stopping short of putting American boots on the ground in Gaza or Lebanon. President Joe Biden has laid out multiple ceasefire proposals in the last year that have largely failed to materialize, while also trying to walk the rope between supporting Israel's war against Hamas and providing humanitarian support for the people of Gaza, who continue to face strikes from Israel, famine and mass displacement. American concern about a larger conflict in the Middle East has proven relevant, as Israel's attacks against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have raised the ire of Iran, which launched missile strikes at Israel this week. Biden has continued calling for ceasefires as the conflicts escalate, though it remains unclear how much influence the U.S. will have on Israeli military operations given that the two allies have seemingly been on different pages multiple times in the last year. The White House said last month it was not notified about Israel's strikes in Lebanon that killed longtime Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and provoked retaliatory strikes from Iran.

Newly revealed emails show senior military officials raised concerns with the White House within days of Israel commencing its operation in Gaza.

Reuters obtained and examined emails between senior State Department and Pentagon officials between Oct. 11-14 that showed concern and alarm as Israel started hitting the Gaza Strip with missile strikes.

The emails specifically focused on the mass evacuation of Palestinians as a potential legal issue. Dana Stroul, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East at the time, wrote to senior Biden aides Oct. 13 and warned that Israel could face war crime charges for its actions.

The emails also include pressure to include messages of sympathy for the Palestinian people and to allow more aid into Gaza while seeking to remain in solidarity with Israel.

Israel's invasion of Gaza has proven polarizing and painful for the Democrats. The progressive wing and younger voters are trying to hold the Biden administration to account for its support of Israel as tens of thousands of Palestinians die.

The invasion also made it difficult -- if not impossible -- for aid groups to help the displaced residents of Gaza who fled their homes to avoid getting caught up in Israel's operations.

Stroul outright alleged that Israel could be ""close to committing war crimes"" after the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) dropped leaflets over northern Gaza urging residents to flee their homes ahead of the military rolling into the territory as part of the early ""targeted incursions.""

""Their main line is that it is impossible for one million civilians to move this fast,"" Stroul wrote. One official said that such an operation was not possible without creating a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""

Three senior U.S. officials argued the White House was slow to address these problems, with Biden's team at one point arguing that the U.S. was ""leading international efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza,"" which would remain a ""top priority.""

Bill Russo, at the time an assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of Global Public Affairs, attempted to drive home the long-term impact of the U.S.'s ""lack of response on the humanitarian conditions"" in Gaza, calling it ""ineffective and counterproductive"" while also harming relations with Arab nations.

""If this course is not quickly reversed by not only messaging, but action, it risks damaging our stance in the region for years to come,"" Russo wrote in one email, according to Reuters. A colleague forwarded his emails to White House officials and warned that ""otherwise would-be stalwart"" Arab partners might think twice about relations with the U.S.

Opinion | How Israel's invasion of Lebanon could spiral into a massive regional war,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-lebanon-war-iran-hezbollah-biden-rcna173364,2024-10-04T16:30:43Z,"An expert explains why Israel's intensifying war on Hezbollah is risky for the region.

Israel moved military forces into southern Lebanese territory Monday, an invasion that marks a major new level of intensity in about a year of conflict with Hezbollah. The paramilitary organization fired rockets at Israeli positions in the Shebaa Farms the day after Oct. 7 ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people after Hamas' attacks on Israel. (That area is a disputed territory which Lebanon and Syria say belongs to Lebanon, and Israel controls and says belongs to Syria.) Hezbollah, sometimes called a state within a state, is backed by Iran and does not have widespread support in Lebanon.

Then Tuesday, Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, citing last week's assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and, this summer, the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

The Biden administration has long opposed an Israeli incursion into Lebanon. But in the past year, the administration has also been unwilling to take any meaningful steps to rein in Israel's behavior, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acting boldly to assert more dominance in the region and degrade Israel's adversaries -- with a continued disregard for civilian lives. Israeli airstrikes have struck medical facilities and already killed hundreds of civilians in Lebanon. The probability of a regional war seems to be growing by the day.

To better understand the unfolding conflict, I called Nick Blanford, a Beirut-based fellow at the Atlantic Council and the author of ""Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel.""

Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Zeeshan Aleem: What is happening right now and how do we know when to say whether this is a new war?

Nicholas Blanford: I think you have to put the developments of the last few weeks into some context. One day after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Hezbollah staged a pro forma attack against Israeli positions along the Lebanon-Israel border, and it dedicated this attack to its allies -- Hamas in Gaza. But very quickly it turned into a kind of a tit-for-tat, daily attacks. The Hezbollah guys would attack Israeli military positions along the border; the Israelis would retaliate with artillery fire airstrikes into south Lebanon. And this really continued from October almost uninterrupted.

There was a clear moment in September when Israel's patience ran out. And they escalated in a very dramatic fashion, by detonating thousands of pagers which they'd been able, apparently, to booby trap. The following day, they detonated hundreds of walkie-talkies. That was followed up by intense airstrikes across areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a presence. And those attacks have intensified over the past two weeks, climaxing on Sept. 27 with the massive airstrike on Hezbollah's underground headquarters in south Beirut, which killed the veteran Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who has led the group for 32 years. The latest development is the advance of some elite Israeli army units into southern Lebanon where they have reportedly already taken some casualties.

So I would say we are in a war but it is not yet full scale. Both sides are mainly hitting military targets, not infrastructure as well, although hundreds of civilians have been killed in Lebanon.

Could you give us a brief primer on Hezbollah? How it emerged, what it is, what it believes in and its social function in Lebanon?

Blanford: Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organization that follows the Iranian, theocratic system of rule. Hezbollah has a secretary general -- most recently the late Nasrallah -- but the true leader of Hezbollah is the spiritual leader of Iran, currently, Ali Khamenei. He's the ultimate authority and, in general, the Iranians will set the strategic agenda.

Hezbollah emerged after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to kick out the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was deployed in strength in south Lebanon. The Israelis in '82 reached all the way to Beirut and then they gradually withdrew. By 1985, they were occupying a border strip along the Lebanon-Israel border and Hezbollah became the main resistance force against that Israeli occupation. Particularly during the 1990s, Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran but also supported by neighboring Syria, was able to deal blow after blow to the Israeli occupation forces, and that culminated in May 2000 with Israel pulling out of south Lebanon.

Hezbollah refused to put down its arms after the Israelis left. They said, 'We need to keep our arms, our military force, to deter Israel from coming back into south Lebanon.' But there was also another unspoken reason, which is that Hezbollah gradually became a source of deterrence for Iran -- especially after the war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 when it expanded very quickly and acquired a great deal of weaponry from Iran, Syria and elsewhere. So, for Iran, Hezbollah has now become a major force multiplier.

Hezbollah has a slightly schizophrenic character, because it is ideologically beholden to the Islamic leadership of Iran, but of course it is a Lebanese organization. It survives or falls depending on the support it gets from the Lebanese Shia community, which is why, since the beginning, Hezbollah has invested a lot in social welfare organizations.

The Shia population of Lebanon tends to be traditionally fairly downtrodden. They live in the poorer areas of the country, traditionally neglected by central governments. And Hezbollah really stepped in with schools, with hospitals, with repairing war damaged houses, even things like helping farmers with agricultural aid. It's become an indispensable organization for the Lebanese Shia community. So they've been able to maintain that support since the early 1980s.

Other communities: the Christians and Sunnis, in particular, the Druze, to an extent, [say] 'Well, hang on a minute. We do have a national army. Why do we need a Shia militia, armed to the teeth, stronger than many armies around the world, to defend Lebanon?' So there have been growing calls for Hezbollah to disarm, and this is why Hezbollah has moved deeper into Lebanese politics, particularly over the last 19 years, since the 2005 parliamentary elections.

What are the fundamental dynamics driving how Hezbollah and Israel's government see each other, both in terms of geopolitical interests and domestic political interests?

Blanford: Ideologically, Hezbollah and Iran want to see the end of Israel, and the restitution of Palestine to the Palestinians. They have in the past assisted Palestinians during the Al Aqsa Intifada. They would help the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza fight the Israelis. But in the past, they didn't get directly involved. When they kicked the Israelis out of Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah didn't immediately rush across the border into Israel and say, ""We're going to go and liberate Jerusalem now."" There's an acknowledgment that it's up to the Palestinians to liberate themselves, but Hezbollah is definitely there to help.

When you look at it more realistically, the reason why Hezbollah is so powerful now is because the Iranians want them to be. We go back to this notion of Hezbollah forming a key role in Iran's deterrence architecture: The stronger Hezbollah becomes, the safer Iran feels.

The Institute for National Security Studies, a leading think tank in Israel, has for the past few years described Hezbollah as Israel's greatest threat, which is quite remarkable in itself, because we're not talking about a country, we're talking about an organization, albeit one that is backed by a powerful regional country.

The Israelis have watched Hezbollah grow stronger and stronger. What the Israelis are doing now is something they haven't dared to do before, and that is to really go for broke with Hezbollah. What's interesting is I think the Israelis are gambling that Hezbollah and the Iranians do not want a full-scale war with Israel right now. Why? Because if there is a full-scale war, whatever the outcome, Hezbollah will take a huge battering, as indeed we're seeing now, and there's no guarantee that Hezbollah will be able to rebuild, rearm and re-equip as quickly as it did after the 2006 war to continue serving as a deterrence for Iran. In other words, if Hezbollah gets engaged in a full-scale war now, Iran could lose its major deterrence factor in that war, and all this would be for the sake of coming to the support of Hamas in Gaza. Hamas is small fry compared to Hezbollah -- Hezbollah is much, much, much more important to Iran than Hamas. Which is why Hezbollah is still acting with a certain amount of restraint despite Israel's escalated action against it. Hezbollah still has not used its arsenal of precision-guided missiles.

It's a dangerous gamble. It could go wrong. Especially now that Israeli troops are operating on the ground in south Lebanon, Hezbollah's home turf. The current conflict could spill into a major war. We're still below that threshold moment, but if it happens, it has a potential to go regional, dragging in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Can you walk us through the different scenarios you see unfolding here?

Blanford: The least likely one is that a cease-fire comes in. The Americans and the French had an idea for a 21-day cease-fire to calm things down along the Lebanon-Israel border. Netanyahu has rejected it. So that's not going to happen..

A second scenario is that what we're seeing now continues. The Israelis haven't started hitting Lebanese infrastructure, power stations, bridges, roads, the airports, seaports; they are focusing on Hezbollah military targets by using air power and now ground forces, albeit in a limited manner. Hezbollah, by the same token, is striking back at Israeli military targets. They haven't been hitting Israeli infrastructure. Now this could go on even at this heightened rate. But under current circumstances, I suspect that Hezbollah will continue doing what it's doing -- in other words, absorb these blows that the Israelis have inflicted, and keep firing rockets into Israel.

In some respects, the Israeli ground maneuver could play right into Hezbollah's hands, as the Israelis are entering terrain that Hezbollah has had for 18 years [and Hezbollah has been able] to prepare for exactly this eventuality. When the Israelis did move into Lebanon in 2006 after two weeks of aerial bombing, they came in for a big surprise. They didn't understand Hezbollah's underground bunker networks, its ambush positions, firing positions.

You could have a similar scenario this time round, albeit on a larger scale, where the Israelis, who have a better understanding of what Hezbollah is about these days, could come in in force for what they would describe perhaps as a limited incursion to basically rubble-ize and depopulate this broad strip of south Lebanon. But they risk losing a lot of troops because they're going to be operating in Hezbollah's environment. And at the end of it, if the mission is successful, what do you do then? Do you reoccupy south Lebanon? If so, you've gone back to the situation between 1978 and 2000 and that didn't end too well for the Israelis. But if you pull back to the border, then what is to stop Hezbollah basically moving back into the border district and beginning to rebuild?

There could come a point when the Israelis say, 'We've hit all the targets from the air and our soldiers are fighting on the ground but Hezbollah is still firing rockets across the border.' And this is where perhaps a third scenario can kick in: The Israelis conclude that, well, we're going to have to escalate this even further by deploying a larger number of troops into Lebanon to expand the target set to include Lebanese infrastructure as well. It could be at that point that Hezbollah, with Iranian blessing, feels it has no choice but to launch its precision-guided systems at Israeli military and infrastructure targets. This is where the conflict could go regional.

What role does the U.S. have in all this, and what advice would you give to the Biden administration on how to prevent a full-scale regional war from breaking out?

Blanford: Yes, a regional war potentially could happen. If the Iranians assess that Hezbollah is about to get bludgeoned by Israel, they may conclude, 'We've got nothing left to lose. We're about to lose Hezbollah. Let's go large. We'll activate all our proxies across the region, and we'll give it a go and see what happens to Israel.'

I think the Biden administration is in a difficult position. President Biden is enormously frustrated with Netanyahu, partly because of the Gaza conflict going on for so long. But he has been urging Netanyahu since the get-go to not open a second front with Hezbollah. Now you could argue that a second front was open anyway, because of these simmering tit-for-tat attacks that have been going on across the Lebanon-Israel border since October. But these attacks were containable. Hezbollah has said, 'Look, this is a support front that we're doing. Once the war in Gaza ends, we're going to stop.' So the emphasis has been very much on trying to conclude a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which will then have a trickle-down effect and should stabilize the Lebanon-Israel border. But of course, we haven't had a Gaza cease-fire. The conflict continues, and now the Israelis clearly have lost patience with Hezbollah and have gone large.

There's very little that the Biden administration feels it can do, particularly when you've got a very close election coming up in just over a month now. So the Biden administration could do what it's done before, and then suspend arms shipments to Israel, but this time do it properly. Cut off all military support to Israel. That would put a lot of pressure on Netanyahu to start picking up the phone and listening when Biden calls. But I don't think they're going to do that because there'll be a political backlash in the United States, and that could affect Kamala Harris' chances against Donald Trump. I think Netanyahu is taking advantage of this and is going for it."
Iran Refuses To Back Down As Its Proxies Endure Unprecedented Attacks,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2024/10/04/iran-refuses-to-back-down-as-its-proxies-endure-unprecedented-attacks/,2024-10-04T16:03:18Z,"Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, appeared in public on Friday to announce Iran will continue supporting its regional proxies against Israel despite them coming under unprecedented attack and pressure.

""The resistance in the region will not back down even with the killing of its leaders,"" Khamenei declared at Friday prayers in Tehran.

The supreme leader, who has the final say in all affairs in Iran since 1989, also dubiously claimed that Israel ""cannot seriously harm"" neither Hezbollah nor Hamas and said the latter's fight against Israel provides a ""vital service for the entire region.""

His appearance came less than a week after Iran launched its largest-ever ballistic missile strike against Israel on Tuesday. It also follows a deadly Israeli air and ground campaign in Lebanon, suspected Israeli sabotage of Hezbollah communications with explosive-packed pagers, the assassination of longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, and airstrikes and a rare commando raid in Syria.

These actions badly hurt Iran's most militarily powerful regional proxy, prompting Tehran to lash out with Tuesday's strike, launching a massive barrage of at least 180 ballistic missiles, including some of its most advanced models. That attack ultimately caused minor damage to Israeli homes and a large airbase but no casualties inside Israel -- although falling shrapnel did kill a 38-year-old Palestinian in the West Bank. While none of its military capabilities, the targeted airbase houses many of Israel's most advanced fifth-generation F-35 aircraft, were destroyed in the attack, Israel had to expend several multi-million-dollar Arrow interceptor missiles to counter the incoming missiles.

Following the attack, a senior Israeli military official said, ""We should expect to strike government centers and possibly eliminate figures like Khamenei in Iran."" Pro-government media in Iran lauded the supreme leader for appearing in public in light of such threats and Israel's more general track record of successfully assassinating senior figures inside Iran.

Khamenei reportedly warned Nasrallah in the days leading up to his September 27 assassination to leave Lebanon. Following the simultaneous detonation of thousands of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies on September 17-18 -- injuring thousands of members and disrupting the group's communications -- Khamenei sent a brigadier general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Abbas Nilforoushan, to Beirut to convince Nasrallah. Nilforoushan subsequently perished in the same devastating Israeli strike that killed Nasrallah.

As Hezbollah's secretary-general since February 1992, Nasrallah was undoubtedly and the single most important figure in Iran's regional militia proxies, the self-styled Axis of Resistance. For Khamenei, his loss was as consequential, if not more so, than the US assassination of the IRGC extraterritorial Quds Force commander, Qassem Soleimani, in a January 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad.

Israel is also believed to have targeted Nasrallah's presumed successor, Hashem Safieddine, in heavy airstrikes on a bunker in Beirut on Thursday night.

Israel has also been busy afflicting potentially mortal blows against Hezbollah's powerful rocket and missile arsenal, estimated to number anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 surface-to-surface projectiles, including long-range and precision-guided munitions.

Israel launched its current offensive against Hezbollah -- dubbed Operation Northern Arrows -- on September 23, with the Israeli Air Force executing its most extensive airstrikes ever, using 250 fighter jets to strike 1,600 Hezbollah targets on that day. While undoubtedly devastating, the Israeli military said at the beginning of the campaign that reports of these airstrikes destroying 50 percent of Hezbollah's rockets were most likely exaggerated.

However, by October 1, senior Israeli and American officials assessed that the Israeli air campaign has destroyed half of the militia's missiles and rockets. However, they again noted that the surviving half of arsenal could still pose a significant threat to Israel.

For years, analysts assessed that a Third Lebanon War could see Hezbollah unleash an enormous missile and rocket barrage, overwhelming Israel's multilayered air defense and causing significant casualties and extensive damage. For example, veteran journalist and Hezbollah expert Nicholas Blanford predicted that such a scenario could see Israel's home front ""experience its greatest destruction and loss of life since the 1948 war"" while Lebanon would become a parking lot.

Since September 23, as it potentially faces a ""use it or lose it"" scenario with its arsenal, Hezbollah has mainly used short-range rockets, only launching a single ballistic missile toward Tel Aviv on September 25, which Israeli air defenses swiftly intercepted. Iran had helped Hezbollah to build up this arsenal primarily to deter an Israeli airstrike against its nuclear program. It's widely speculated that one reason Hezbollah did not unleash more missiles since it was awaiting authorization from Tehran. On the other hand, Israeli attacks on and sabotage of its command, control, and communications could have also been the primary factor.

While Israel is unlikely to prove capable of destroying this entire arsenal with airstrikes alone, it could severely cripple it, stripping Hezbollah of its main strategic asset and Iran of its main regional deterrent against Israel. Furthermore, Hezbollah may find it difficult to replenish its losses in the short term if the current fighting stops soon.

As The New York Times reported, the current Israeli campaign -- which also includes an ongoing ground incursion into South Lebanon that has already resulted in deadly clashes, with eight Israeli soldiers killed on Wednesday -- did not begin in Lebanon but next door in Syria.

More than a week before the pager explosions, Israel launched airstrikes against Syria on September 8, itself not unusual. However, this time, an estimated 100 helicopter-borne commandos raided an underground Hezbollah missile production facility deep near northwestern Syria's Masyaf, not far from the Lebanese border.

The facility previously belonged to the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, which manufactured Syria's notorious chemical weapons. It was built too deep underground for bunker-buster bombs, like the ones believed to have been used to kill Nasrallah in his Beirut bunker, to damage sufficiently. So, the commandos raided the facility, planting explosives to destroy the equipment used to manufacture Hezbollah missile components. They were in and out in only 15 minutes.

""It initially looked to be a one-off attack on a Hezbollah weapons facility, but it now appears to have been the opening salvo in a covert-in-name-only campaign against the Iranian proxy group,"" the Times report noted.

How all of this ends is impossible to predict. Khamenei's reiteration on Friday that his regime won't back down comes as Israel has vowed to retaliate directly against Iran for Tuesday's missile attack, which could see this already deadly Middle East conflagration spread even further.

For now, it seems clear that Iran's regional proxies may well have endured their deadliest days ever and mightn't fully recuperate their former strength and many of the military capabilities they possessed just over a mere week ago."

Fox News' ""Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.

TOP 3:

- As Oct. 7 anniversary approaches, Jewish students vow to 'walk proudly'

- CNN's Amanpour says Iran does not want to 'escalate' conflict even as Iranian rockets strike Israel

- Harvard went easy on students for antisemitic conduct, House committee finds

- Hugh Hewitt: How Kamala Harris' snub of Netanyahu only seemed to embolden Israeli leader

TOP STORY: With the first anniversary of October 7 fast approaching, universities and college students are bracing for renewed anti-Israel demonstrations on campuses across the United States. In particular, the National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) is orchestrating a nationwide ""Week of Rage"" on campuses beginning Monday.

VIDEO: Comedian and pro-Israel influencer Zach Sage Fox believes an interview he filmed in the West Bank could show Americans how Palestinian civilians truly feel about Jewish people - but it took him months to recover the footage after he was threatened to delete it. Watch it here:

COME AGAIN, CHRISTINE?: CNN chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour insisted Tuesday that Iran does not want conflict to escalate with Israel or the United States, and that Tehran felt it had ""no choice"" but to strike the Jewish state after Israel took out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon last week. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan disagreed, calling the attack ""a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event.""

GRADING ON A CURVE: Harvard University went easy on students whose antisemitic conduct violated its own policies, according to the House Education and the Workforce Committee, which probed anti-Israel college protests in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. Of 68 students disciplined, none are currently suspended, 52 remain in ""good standing,"" 15 are not, and one is on leave. The committee said it believes Harvard is in violation of Title VI, which forbids ""a hostile environment based on race, color, or national origin.""

HUGH HEWITT: Vice President Kamala Harris sent a very public message to her anti-Israel supporters when she skipped Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit this summer. And ever since, Netanyahu has embraced a different strategy, from his fiery address the United Nations General Assembly last week, to taking the war to Hamas and Hezbollah.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: ""This October 7, as I mourn the innocent lives lost and pray for the brave men and women of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who continue to fight, I will walk proudly and be a tribute, a public voice of remembrance, for all those beautiful souls who were stolen from us too soon.""

Israeli airstrikes cut off a key crossing between Lebanon and Syria,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/g-s1-26287/israeli-airstrikes-lebanon-syria-crossing,2024-10-04T07:56:14Z,"BEIRUT -- Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria.

The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates.

Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The blasts overnight rocked Beirut's southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers (miles) away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday.

The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details.

The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon's Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing.

Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces.

Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous.

It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between Sept. 23 -- when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon -- and Sept. 30.

There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there.

Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence.

Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their Oct. 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry."
"FIFA to investigate Israel, days after Iran attacks, for alleged discrimination due to Palestinian complaints",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fifa-investigate-israel-alleged-discrimination-after-palestinian-complaints,2024-10-03T22:49:54Z,"Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., says the Biden-Harris administration is ""out of step"" with the conflict in the Middle East.

FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, intends to launch an investigation against the Israel Football Association (IFA) over allegations raised by the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), it announced on Thursday.

FIFA's disciplinary committee will be asked to look into allegations of discrimination as the PFA has accused the IFA of complicity in violations of international law by the Israeli government, discrimination against Arab players and inclusion in its league of clubs located in Palestinian territory.

""The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offense of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,"" FIFA said in a statement. ""FIFA's Governance, Audit and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate... the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.""

Fox News has reached out to the PFA and IFA for comment.

The PFA previously proposed a suspension for Israel over the war in Gaza. The PFA proposal to 211 member federations called for ""appropriate sanctions, with immediate effect, against Israeli teams,"" according to FIFA documents released this year.

The proposal cited ""international law violations committed by the Israeli occupation in Palestine, particularly in Gaza"" and cited FIFA statutory commitments on human rights and against discrimination.

""All the football infrastructure in Gaza has been either destroyed, or seriously damaged, including the historic stadium of Al-Yarmuk,"" the PFA wrote, adding that it had support for the motion from the federations of Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Yemen.

The PFA's proposal was enough to convince FIFA to seek an independent legal council and hold a landmark council meeting to make a decision on whether to suspend Israel from international soccer because of the conflict with Hamas, said FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the FIFA congress in May.

""FIFA will mandate as of now, independent legal expertise to [analyze] the three requests [from the Palestinian FA] and ensure the statutes of FIFA are applied in the right way,"" Infantino said. ""Due to the urgency of the situation, an extraordinary FIFA Council will be convened and will take place before July 20 to review the results of the legal assessment and to take the decisions that are appropriate.""

FIFA said on Thursday that it won't suspend Israel but that the investigation into alleged discrimination will be carried out.

The most recent and prominent example of a country to have its athletes banned from major international sports competition was Russia at the Paris Olympics this summer.

ISRAELI WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAMS FLEE GAME AFTER IRANIAN MISSILE STRIKES

Russia was banned because it had invaded Ukraine just four days after the end of the 2022 Winter Olympics. The International Olympic Committee considered this attack a violation of the Olympic truce, which is a resolution that calls for all nations to lay down arms and not engage in conflict starting one week before the Olympics begin and ending one week after the end. The Russian Olympic Committee lost its appeal against its suspension by the International Olympic Committee in February.

Belarus, which was used as a staging ground for the invasion, was also not allowed to compete in Paris.

However, a total of 32 athletes from Russia and Belarus competed in Paris as neutral participants; 17 previously represented Belarus and 15 represented Russia. They were not allowed to boast their country's flag, but they were able to attend the closing ceremony.

Countries have also been banned from competing in the World Cup in the past, but those nation's players were never allowed to compete as neutrals.

Germany and Japan were banned from the 1950 World Cup after the end of World War II. South Africa was banned from 1966 to 1992 for violating FIFA's anti-discrimination charter due to apartheid. Mexico was even banned for two years after using overage players in qualifiers for the 1989 World Youth Championship.

FIFA's announcement comes the same week that Iran launched a massive missile strike against Israeli cities.

Iran's strikes on Israel forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday.

The barrage of aerial warfare was the first time in Israeli history that the country's densely populated cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - in the center of the biblical nation, faced such potentially devastating attacks. The Israeli military said most of the missiles were intercepted, per the Associated Press.

Iran also warned that a retaliatory strike could warrant further ballistic response.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said during the Asia Cooperation Dialogue summit this week that Israel must not believe it can act with ""impunity,"" according to Reuters.

""Any type of military attack, terrorist act or crossing our red lines will be met with a decisive response by our armed forces,"" said Pezeshkian.

This Monday marks the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel by Hamas terrorists. Conflict between Israel and surrounding countries in the region since then has led to widespread tensions across the U.S. over concerns of a humanitarian crisis."

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the heads of the country's security establishment on Wednesday following Iran's firing of 181 missiles into Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar was also in attendance at the summit in Doha, where he called the ongoing violence in the Middle East a ""collective genocide"" perpetuated by Israel, according to Reuters.

""It has become crystal clear that what is happening is genocide, in addition to turning the Gaza Strip into an area unfit for human habitation, in preparation for displacement,"" the Qatari monarch said.

Watch: Pro-Israel influencer recovers West Bank interview with Palestinian woman he was threatened to delete,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/pro-israel-influencer-recovers-west-bank-interview-with-palestinian-woman-that-he-was-threatened-to-delete,2024-10-03T09:09:30Z,"Zach Sage Fox traveled to the West Bank to see if Palestinian people truly support the Hamas terror group, but he almost didn't make it out alive.

Comedian and pro-Israel influencer Zach Sage Fox believes an interview he filmed in the West Bank could show Americans how Palestinian civilians truly feel about Jewish people - but it took him months to recover the footage after he was threatened to delete it.

Fox has been on a crusade to educate his followers since the terror attacks of October 7. He went viral earlier this year when his ""Gaza Graduation"" video featured anti-Israel protesters in New York City struggling to correctly answer basic questions about the Israel-Hamas war and decided to take his popular man-on-the-street style interviews to the West Bank, a contentious territory that Palestinians hope to establish as an independent state along with the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.

Fox, a ""loud and proud"" Jewish American, told anyone who asked that he was an Italian American and was able to cross the border into the West Bank without issue, because Israelis and Jewish people are not welcomed in the region.

INFLUENCER WENT TO THE WEST BANK TO SEE IF PALESTINIANS SUPPORT HAMAS - HE ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT ALIVE

Fox found several people walking West Bank streets who were quick to express support for the Hamas terror group and declared Israeli hostages should not be released, but things got dicey when he tried to interview a woman whose hair was fully covered. A ""very upset"" Palestinian man approached him and asked him to delete the footage.

""They're not used to anybody questioning their narrative that they've been brainwashed to believe. And you can see it ... I'm interviewing that girl just for several minutes and these men watching it, they can't even accept that you would be asking questions because it's not a free society,"" Fox told Fox News Digital.

Fox recalled the man yelling ""something about modesty,"" and that females shouldn't speak for all Palestinians. Fox attempted to ignore the man, but he only grew more agitated and started calling additional Palestinian men for support. He explained that he caved and deleted the footage when his Muslim cameraman said the angry group was threatening their lives.

Fox initially enlisted a team of IT specialists who were able to recover some of the footage, and every interview that was salvaged made the viral ""Wild West Bank"" video. But his conversation with the woman who sparked the conversation remained lost.

""Dozens of cyberhackers,"" additional IT specialists and even an Israel Defense Forces veteran with a passion for technology all tried unsuccessfully to restore the video. Fox was beginning to lose hope, but was eager to show the world what this woman had to say because she was ""emblematic of the mindset"" in the region.

She was ""clearly educated"" and spoke perfect English, dressed in designer clothes and said she was an engineer. Yet, she believed all Zionist should be killed.

FOX NEWS MEDIA DRAWS 10.4 MILLION FOR SIMULCAST OF THE CBS VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Another technology expert caught wind of the story and offered to help recover the video. Fox thought it was impossible and was reluctant to set himself up for further disappointment but eventually said ""f -- k it"" and gave them a shot.

""A week later I got a call that they recovered almost all of it. It was a miracle,"" Fox said.

Fox then watched the footage and ""couldn't believe his eyes.""

""To see that interview back after three months was insane... I didn't know when my cameraman stopped filming, so I didn't realize, one, that you could see the men starting to pull the other men in the into the thing. I didn't realize you could see that behind me,"" he said.

""I also didn't realize that my cameraman kept the camera going long enough so that you actually saw the people cut the camera off and stop the shoot,"" Fox added. ""So, that was like wild to me.""

Fox then published ""Wild West Bank: Deleted Scenes Exploded,"" allowing the world to see the footage the angry Palestinian men tried to scrub.

VIRAL INFLUENCER ZACH SAGE FOX PUT SPOTLIGHT ON CLUELESS ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS: 'NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING'

In the shocking video, the woman told him that most Palestinians support Hamas, she proudly declared being ""really satisfied"" with footage Hamas terrorists took on Oct. 7. She also denied Hamas killed babies and women during the attack and said no Israelis are ""innocent civilians."" She suggested she is a ""refugee"" despite her family living in the West Bank for multiple generations and flatly dismissed a two-state solution. Along the way, Fox politely pushed back on antisemitic claims and absurd talking points.

""I am an educated person, it's either us or us,"" she said when suggesting Jewish people need to leave Israel for good. When Fox told her there would ""never be peace"" with that mindset, she fired back, ""It's their problem.""

As a man began lurking in the background, Fox asked if she believes Zionists deserve to die.

""Cut, cut real quick,"" the man said. ""What side are you on?""

Fox calmly responded that he was simply asking questions, but the man demanded to know where he was from.

""I'm from the states,"" Fox answered as the man demanded the cameraman stop recording.

The video abruptly cuts off.

NETANYAHU RESPONDS TO HEZBOLLAH ATTACK THAT KILLED CHILDREN AT SOCCER FIELD: 'THIS WILL NOT GO UNANSWERED

Fox feels ""vindicated"" that he was able to share the footage.

""I just think this girl is really representative of how these people think,"" Fox said.

""I feel bad for her, I know that sounds crazy cause she's literally sitting there saying everyone who I love deserves to die,"" he continued. ""But my takeaway is that she's the perfect example of somebody who's not stupid. She's an engineer, she's a smart girl, but she's been brainwashed by the propaganda they're taught in Palestine.""

Earlier this year, the Department of State urged Americans to avoid the West Bank because of ""terrorism and civil unrest.""

Fox remains one of the only Americans to enter the West Bank and try to ask tough questions, but he doesn't believe State Department warnings are the thing keeping America journalists out of the region.

""I genuinely think that they know deep down, whether they want to admit it or not, that they would find... it totally negates their narrative, which is that, you know, 'Hamas is bad, but the Palestinians are separate,'"" Fox said.

""I wish that was the case. I truthfully didn't believe it myself until I went there that day,"" he added. ""They love Hamas."""

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) met on Wednesday following Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel, but overshadowing the meeting was Israel's announcement that it had banned the U.N. secretary-general due to his failure to condemn Iran.

""Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel does not deserve to step foot on Israeli soil,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said about the decision to declare U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as persona non grata.

""This is an anti-Israel secretary-general who lends support to terrorists, rapists and murderers,"" Katz argued. ""Guterres will be remembered as a stain on the history of the U.N. for generations to come.""

Iran on Tuesday fired over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel after the death of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah and after the Israel Defense Forces began focused incursions into Lebanon to hit the terrorist group.

ISRAEL URGES UN TO CONDEMN IRAN AFTER LATESTS ATTACKS

Guterres on Tuesday issued a brief statement following Iran's attack, calling it the ""latest attacks in the Middle East"" and broadly condemned the conflict as ""escalation after escalation.""

He also slammed Israel for its actions in Gaza and the West Bank, claiming that Israel has ""conducted in Gaza the most deadly and destructive military campaign in my years.""

""The suffering endured by the Palestinian people in Gaza is beyond imagination,"" Guterres said. ""At the same time, the situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, continues to deteriorate, with Israeli military operations.""

""Construction of settlements, evictions, land grabs and the intensification of settler attacks progressively undermine any possibility of a two-state solution, and simultaneously, armed Palestinian groups have also used violence,"" he said.

HAMAS LEADER KILLED IN LEBANON WAS UN EMPLOYEE, AGENCY CONFIRMS

Israel blasted Guterres for failing to ""unequivocally"" condemn Iran's attack or even name Iran while discussing the attack. Israel responded with the persona non grata declaration, effectively banning him from entering its borders.

""Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel, as nearly all the countries of the world have done, does not deserve to set foot on Israeli soil,"" Katz said.

""This is a secretary-general who has yet to denounce the massacre and sexual atrocities committed by Hamas murderers on Oct. 7 and has not led any resolutions to declare them a terrorist organization,"" Katz continued.

""A secretary-general who provides support to the terrorists, rapists and murderers of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and now Iran, the mothership of global terror, will be remembered as a stain on the history of the U.N. for generations to come,"" he added. ""Israel will continue to defend its citizens and uphold its national dignity, with or without António Guterres.""

BBC NEWS SPURS OUTRAGE AFTER COMMENTATOR DEFENDS HEZBOLLAH, IRAN: 'OPENLY PRO-TERRORIST'

And while it took nearly a day following the attacks to condemn Iran, Guterres seemed to get the message, telling council members: ""As I did in relation to the Iranian attack in April - and as should have been obvious yesterday in the context of the condemnation I expressed - I again strongly condemn yesterday's massive missile attack by Iran on Israel.""

Israel's decision to ban Guterres prompted anger from Algeria, which first expressed ""sincere gratitude... solidarity, admiration and support for the secretary-general.""

""This decision reflects a clear disdain of the U.N. system and the entire international community,"" the representative from Algeria said. ""For the Israeli authorities, no narrative nor truth exists except their own.""

However, some permanent members of the council expressed clear support for Israel and condemned Iran for the attack while urging Tehran to cease its support for terrorism through its proxy forces.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield ""unequivocally"" condemned Iran's attack and called for further sanctions against Tehran. She also explicitly tied Iran to the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, arguing that ""Iran was complicit... through its funding, training, capabilities and support for the military wing of Hamas.""

ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS REGULAR INFANTRY, ARMORED UNITS JOINING LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN SOUTHERN LEBANON

""After Hamas's horrific attack carried out nearly a year ago today, the United States sent a clear message to Iran: Don't exploit the situation in ways that would risk propelling the region into a broader war,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

""The IRGC flagrantly and repeatedly ignored this warning by encouraging and enabling the Houthis in Yemen to disrupt global shipping and launch attacks against Israel by supporting militant groups in Syria and Iraq,"" she continued.

""Iran's stated intention was to avenge the deaths of two IRGC-supported terrorist leaders and an IRGC commander by inflicting significant damage and death in Israel,"" she added. ""Thankfully, and through close coordination between the United States and Israel, Iran failed to achieve its objectives.""

""This outcome does not diminish the fact that this attack, intended to cause significant death and destruction, marked a significant escalation by Iran,"" she stressed.

The United Kingdom also condemned Iran's attack and expressed ""full support"" for Israel ""in exercising its right to defend itself against Iranian aggression.""

France urged Iran to ""abstain from any action that could lead to additional destabilization,"" going further to condemn the ""attack that targeted civilians in Jaffa.""

""Civilian populations are the first victims of this horrible situation,"" the French representative said. ""The situation is serious.""

Iran ultimately pleaded its case before the council, arguing that the Security Council has ""remained paralyzed due to the United States obstruction"" and accused permanent members France and the United Kingdom of acing as ""serious enablers"" of Israel who ""attempt to justify Israeli heinous crimes under the guise of self-defense, shifting the blame onto Iran."""
Iranian Media Claims Israeli F-35 Fighters Destroyed In Missile Strike,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/02/iranian-media-claims-israeli-f-35-fighters-destroyed-in-missile-strike/,2024-10-02T16:46:50Z,"Iran launched its largest attack on Israel to date, firing upwards of 180 missiles on Tuesday. Experts have suggested it was larger and more complex than the strikes conducted in April, and the attack employed the Islamic Republic's Fattah-1 and Kheybarshekan missiles. Israel has claimed that most of the incoming missiles were shot down, and no Israelis were killed -- although Palestinian officials reported that a Palestinian man was killed by falling debris.

Damage was also reported to be minimal, but on social media on Wednesday, many pro-Iranian supporters echoed reports from Iranian state media that the missiles successfully struck Israeli airbases. Claims were made that the attack destroyed entire squadrons of the Lockheed Martin F-35I Adir -- the Israeli Air Force's fifth-generation fighter.

Videos on social media showed missiles targeting Tel Aviv, and showing the devastation that the IAF's F-35s were purported to cause in Gaza. Iranian propagandists have also alleged that Nevatim Air Base, the home of two F-35I squadrons, was also ""completely destroyed"" in the attack.

Yet another post claimed Palestinian activists disrupted domestic F-35 production by damaging a manufacturing facility. When and where the video was filmed hasn't been confirmed.

Together, these are the latest attempts to spread misinformation and propaganda without supporting evidence.

""Some of the missiles fired at Israel seem to have hit Israeli airbases, but the claim that dozens of F-35s were destroyed appears to be completely fabricated,"" explained Dr. Kurt Braddock, assistant professor of public communication in the School of Communication at American University. ""The protest at Teledyne seems to have been very minor in scope, and there is no evidence that it will slow down production of any materials.""

Though it would appear that Tuesday's missile strike was largely thwarted, the commentary on social media suggested it was a huge military success. The news was shared by those who may have believed the original posts, making it seem even more credible.

""The spread of these posts can be considered either misinformation or disinformation. In the case of the former, people on social media may see the videos/images and simply think they are true, and re-post them because they feel they are sharing true news without critiquing it,"" added Braddock.

Iranian state media presented a fictional narrative, and it also likely employed operatives on social media to post their own claims -- which served to provide confirmation for an event that didn't occur.

""The originators of the posts are engaged in spreading disinformation -- the purposeful spread of false information for strategic purposes,"" Braddock suggested.

""The goal of most mis/dis-information is not to convince people that something that didn't happen -- dozens of F-35s destroyed -- happened,"" explained Dr. Matthew Schmidt, associate professor in the National Security Department at the University of New Haven.

""It's designed to flood the mediascape with false information that causes a psychological response where people are overloaded with contradictory information and respond to this cognitively by questioning all the information in the mediascape, true and outlandishly false alike,"" warned Schmidt. ""The attackers hack our brains by flooding us with information and trigger a cognitive response based on the volume of data coming at us, regardless of its veracity.""

The result is that even easily verifiable true information may be doubted, including any factual information that reaches the target audience. Moreover, facts can be attacked and dismissed.

Schmidt said it can be exhausting, and many simply quit trying to find any truth in the ocean of disinformation.

""This creates a benefit for the attacker, because it creates a psychological environment where future lies will be ignored, because the audience has been made too exhausted to do the work to identify and counter them,"" he added.

Even if Israel offers its own social media response that shows largely undamaged bases, such photos and videos are to be equally dismissed as misinformation/disinformation. And that could play into Tehran's favor, at least in the short term.

""The goal was largely to sow doubt about claims by the Israelis that the Iranian attack was largely ineffective -- which is what seems to be the truth,"" said Braddock.

""Reports indicate that although not all Iranian missiles were intercepted, the ones that did land did minimal damage with no Israeli casualties,"" Braddock emphasized. ""That could be seen as an embarrassment for Iran and a show of strength for the Israeli defensive measures. By spreading disinformation that seems to suggest the missiles were more effective than they actually were, the posters are trying to communicate the 'effectiveness' of the Iranian attack."""
How Iran's missile strike on Israel appears to have hit some targets,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5135646/iran-missile-strike-israel-appears-to-hit-some-targets,2024-10-02T16:37:05Z,"Projectiles above Jerusalem, on October 1, 2024. Israel says Iran launched more than 180 missiles but that the assault did little damage. MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images/AFP hide caption

Iran's strike on Israel appears to have been more effective at reaching its targets than an attack in April of this year.

Videos posted to social media and geolocated by NPR and the online investigations group Bellingcat show multiple warheads landing around two Israeli air bases: Nevatim Airbase in the south of the country and Tel Nof Airbase in central Israel. One video filmed near Tel Nof also appeared to show possible secondary explosions, indicating that ammunition or fuel may have been struck by a missile.

Videos also showed warheads landing in northern Tel Aviv, near the headquarters of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad. Those warheads appear to have missed their target, and did not inflict any real damage. One video showed a large crater around 500 yards from the spy agency's headquarters.

Experts say the attack was somewhat more successful than the one in April of this year, which was almost completely neutralized by Israeli and American air defenses.

""It looks like more missiles seem to be hitting targets in Israel this time around,"" says Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. That could be in part because ""the Iranians seem to be using newer, more sophisticated missiles.""

US Calls Strikes ""Ineffective""

Both the U.S. and Israel downplayed the strikes. ""This attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a briefing Tuesday. The U.S. said it had fired about a dozen interceptors from warships in an effort to blunt the Iranian assault.

According to reports in the Israeli media, the military acknowledged that the strike had damaged ""several"" airbases. However it said that no aircraft had been destroyed. Israeli media reported that the attacks had mainly damaged maintenance areas and office buildings.

An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson declined to comment to NPR on casualties or damage resulting from the strike. The Israeli military spokesperson, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said in a briefing on the social media platform X that, ""We don't want to tip off Iran... Our air force and air force bases remain operational.""

Although the strike may have been limited in the damage it caused, it was a clear challenge to Israel's much-vaunted air defense systems. Israel's main system, called Iron Dome, has proven incredibly effective rockets from nearby adversaries like the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Iron Dome uses relatively cheap interceptor missiles together with state-of-the-art radars and high-speed computing to quickly determine which incoming missiles pose a threat. It only takes shots at the ones it determines are falling in populated areas.

Better missiles and more of them

But ballistic missiles from Iran travel much higher and faster than those fired from nearby Lebanon and Gaza. The missiles fly briefly into space before coming down on their targets near or at hypersonic speeds. Israel has a separate missile defense system known as Arrow, which is capable of intercepting missiles near or in space, but Arrow has fewer interceptors than Iron Dome.

When Iran attacked Israel in April, it used around 100 ballistic missiles in conjunction with roughly 200 low flying drones and cruise missiles, according to Yehoshua Kalisky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv, Israel. The drones and cruise missiles were shot down easily by fighter jets, leaving the missiles for Arrow, he says.

This time, Iran launched around 180 ballistic missiles, putting more strain on the Arrow system. ""The job for the Arrow was much easier [in April],"" he says.

Moreover, images of the missiles being fired out of Iran, together with pictures of debris that fell in Israel, suggests more sophisticated ballistic missiles were used, Lewis says.

In the April attack, Lewis says Iran used primarily liquid-fueled missiles that were relatively inaccurate. Half of the missiles fell more than a half mile from their targets. ""It's pretty hard to destroy something with that level of accuracy,"" he says.

In this latest attack, Iran used new solid-propellant missiles that are more accurate, he says. Lewis and other researchers say at least some of the missiles used appear to be Iran's newest design, the Fattah, a medium-range ballistic missile that may have a degree of maneuverability as it enters the atmosphere, allowing it to alter course and avoid interceptor missiles.

Lewis says he believes Iran's latest strike was designed to show some restraint. The warheads fell primarily on air bases which may have been used in last week's attacks on Hezbollah's leadership, he points out. ""It's very typical to see Iranians pick military targets that are linked to the military strike that they're responding to,"" he says.

The strike also appeared to largely avoid civilian areas. The only publicly acknowledged death from the attack so far was a Palestinian man in the West Bank who was apparently struck by a falling missile body. A school in central Israel was also hit, though no casualties were reported.

Despite the attempt to control escalation, Israel is likely to respond with force, says Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Following the April attack, Israel knocked out an air defense radar near Iran's nuclear facilities in Natanz, he points out. That limited attack was designed to send a message: ""The Israelis can penetrate Iranian airspace, they've demonstrated that time and time again,"" he says. ""They can bring the hurt to Iran.""

Israel's military spokesperson Peter Lerner suggested that it would only be a matter of time before the nation struck back directly against Iran. ""One ballistic missile is an unacceptable reality for any sovereign state,"" he told reporters. ""One hundred and eighty means there will be consequences."""
Will Netanyahu 'take the fight directly to Iran' after massive missile strike across Israel?,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-weighs-israeli-response-irans-massive-missile-attack-amid-fears-all-out-war,2024-10-02T15:11:46Z,"JERUSALEM -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the heads of the country's security establishment on Wednesday following Iran's firing of 181 missiles into Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

Fox News Digital spoke to military and Iran experts about the growing chance of a wider confrontation between the Jewish state and the clerical regime in Tehran breaking out.

""After the Iranian missile attack against Israel there is no questioning anymore the basic understanding that Iran is the greatest generator of terror and death in the Middle East. Until now, Israel has been playing a whack-a-mole game with Iran's proxies - fighting Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and others,"" Yaakov Katz, the author of ""Shadow Strike: Inside Israel's Secret Mission to Eliminate Syrian Nuclear Power,"" told Fox News Digital.

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER TELLS US ONLY 'MILITARY ACTION' CAN RETURN PEOPLE TO HOMES AMID HEZBOLLAH THREAT

Katz, who is a senior fellow at the global think tank Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI), added, ""With Iran again attacking Israel directly, the time has come to take the fight directly to Iran. The ayatollahs there need to be made to pay a price.""

The headline by military analyst Amos Harel in the left-wing Haaretz paper read on Wednesday: ""After an unprecedented Iranian attack, we are in a regional war.""

The Islamic republic has been recognized as the center of Mideast volatility, terrorism and jingoism for decades. In 2010, Saudi Arabian King Abdullah told the United States to ""cut off the head of the snake"" by launching military strikes to eradicate Iran's reported nuclear weapons facilities.

Iran's strikes on Israel forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday. The barrage of aerial warfare was the first time in Israeli history that the country's densely populated cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - in the center of the biblical nation, faced such devastating attacks. The Israelis did not panic and stayed relatively calm under the pressure of the largely surprise attack.

The only fatality from the Iranian barrage was the murder of a Palestinian man in the West Bank (known in Israel by its biblical regional name of Judea and Samaria).

""Tonight Iran attempted to kill thousands of Israeli men, women and children but thanks to our miraculous defense system Iran failed miserably. Tehran is hurting after seeing its proxies in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen get crushed by Israel. Tehran made a huge mistake tonight and will pay a heavy price at the time and place of our choosing,"" Lt. Col. Yoni Chetboun, former deputy speaker of the Knesset and an IDF special forces operator in reserves, told Fox News Digital.

IRAN'S 'NUCLEAR ENERGY MOUNTAIN' IS 'FULLY SAFE' AFTER ISRAELI STRIKE: STATE MEDIA

Chetboun was a decorated special forces operator from the second Lebanon war, when Israel fought the Iran-backed terrorist movement Hezbollah in 2006.

Prior to Iran's military strike on Israel in April, Fox News Digital reported that the Biden-Harris administration released billions in sanctions relief to Iran that will flow into its proxies' war machines, according to experts.

The topic of funneling billions to Iran's regime surfaced during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday. Republican Sen. JD Vance said, ""Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration.

""What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies. And God forbid, launching against the United States as well.""

BIDEN ADMIN UNDER PRESSURE TO STOP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SANCTIONS RELIEF TO IRAN

Lisa Daftari, an expert on Iran, said, ""The conflict between the Iran regime and Israel did not commence today, in April, or on Oct. 7 of the previous year. Its origins trace back to 1979, when the mullahs ascended to power, promulgating a doctrine that demonized the 'Great Satan,' a term for the United States, and the 'Little Satan,' referring to Israel.

""Over the past 45 years, the Iran regime has persistently targeted American and Israeli interests, orchestrating terror proxies to execute its strategic objectives against both nations. More recently, U.S. policies that have enriched the mullahs have facilitated billions of dollars on establishing a formidable encirclement around Israel, via the regime's various proxies in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza and the West Bank.""

In April, Iran's regime launched a sprawling aerial attack, with over 300 suicide drones and missiles, on Israel. Jerusalem countered the Iranian swarm of missiles with a targeted strike against military installations in the Iranian province of Isfahan.

Daftari, editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk news website, added, ""Israel's recent military actions signal a departure from the more restrained posture observed in April, when the nation's defense capabilities against missile threats were deemed a victory. The recent strategic strikes in Lebanon underscore Israel's heightened efforts to neutralize enduring existential threats.""

She noted that it historically has engaged in tit-for-tat-like responses but noted, ""Israel is now poised to take decisive measures aimed at neutralizing this looming risk, with its focus now entirely on the regime in Tehran.""

NETANYAHU CALLS MIDEAST CONFLICTS CHOICE BETWEEN 'BLESSING OR A CURSE,' WARNS ABOUT ISRAEL'S 'LONG ARM'

David Wurmser, a former senior adviser for nonproliferation and Middle East strategy for former Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital, ""This is a war between Israel and Iran which began as a direct war on April 14. The war is a twilight struggle between a nation run by a tyranny that seeks to extinguish the other. Either Iran or Israel, but not both, will emerge from this war not only as victor but survivor.""

He said the so-called ""ring of fire that Iran built around Israel not only had an aggressive aim - to choke Israel to death by initiating a violent war of attrition and isolation, including closing ports and ending international airlines' flying to Israel - but also acted as a defensive deterrent against Israel, shielding Iran from any potential Israeli proactive action against Iran. With the destruction of Hezbollah, the strategic linchpin of the proxy network at the center of that ring of fire, as the greatest threat Israel faces, Iran was left fully exposed to the full weight of Israeli power.""

He echoed the strong language of Israel's military and political leadership, which ""promised to inflict severe pain on the regime of the Iran's supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Ali Khamenei... Iran will surely now feel the vulnerability as the Israelis without fear any more of Hezbollah or Iran will take the war from the defensive to the offensive against Iran's regime, "" said Wurmser.

He added ""The mistake Iran made, as do its proxies and its minions in the West protesting on campuses, is not that they underestimate Israel's capabilities and its unity, but that they internalized their own ideology that Israel is a fake, fragile colonial entity rather than a deeply rooted civilization. Israel has shown that despite its mistakes and setbacks, its internal strength transcend that of any of their neighbors."""

""There are no words. Only heartbreak,"" Israel posted on X. ""May the memory of the victims be a blessing.""

Israeli police said Wednesday that a total of seven people were killed in a shooting that unfolded just minutes before Iran started launching ballistic missiles at Israel in retaliation for the recent killings of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

Two Palestinian men from the Israeli-occupied West Bank town of Hebron opened fire, including shooting directly into a light rail carriage crowded with passengers that was stopped at a station.

The suspects -- who police say had no prior arrests, although one had been involved in disturbing the peace at a demonstration -- were later shot and killed by security guards and armed pedestrians, according to The Associated Press. Police and paramedics who responded to the scene treated another 16 people injured from the shooting.

Segev-Vigder lived in Tel Aviv and operated a fitness and Pilates studio, while her husband, Yaari Vigder, is an Israeli reservist soldier, The Jerusalem Post reports.

""Ari was in a carrier that covered Inbar's entire upper body during the attack, he was not injured at all,"" the website cited Yaari Vigder as telling Israel's Channel 11 news.

""For the rest of his life -- may he feel the same love he received from Inbar,"" he reportedly added.

The website identified four other victims as Revital Bronstein, 24, Shahar Goldman, 30, Nadia Sokolenko, 40, and Ilya Nozadze, 42.

Sokolenko's family told Israel's TPS news agency that they were waiting for her to return home from grocery shopping Tuesday night and her friends started checking area hospitals after her phone stopped answering calls.

Greece's foreign ministry also said Wednesday that a Greek national who lived in Jerusalem was among the dead.

Israel Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X in the wake of the attack that ""I will now demand in the cabinet discussion that the family members of the abominable terrorists from Hebron who carried out the heinous attack in Jaffa be deported to Gaza tonight and their homes should be turned into ruins for them to see and see."""
Israel sends more troops to Lebanon as it vows a 'painful' response to Iran's missiles,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5136592/israel-lebanon-iran-missile-attack-hezbollah,2024-10-02T14:00:21Z,"Smoke rises from the site of an Israeli airstrike in Dahiyeh, Beirut, Lebanon, Wednesday. Hassan Ammar/AP hide caption

Israel says it is sending more troops into southern Lebanon to fight Hezbollah, as Israel also promised a ""painful"" response after Iran fired nearly 200 missiles at Israel Tuesday night.

The Israeli military said it is deploying more soldiers and an armored tank brigade to assist in what it called a ""limited, localized"" ground offensive against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon.

On social media, the Israeli military's Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, warned residents of an additional 24 villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate immediately. ""For your safety, you must leave your homes immediately,"" he said, adding that any civilian near Hezbollah fighters, facilities or weapons risks their lives.

Residents were advised to evacuate north of the Awali River, about 30 miles from the Lebanese border with Israel.

Also on Wednesday, sirens went off across Israel's north after the Israeli military said around 100 rockets were fired from Lebanon. The military issues alerts to communities around the port city of Haifa and Western Galilee, both near the Israel-Lebanon border.

The Israeli military announced a soldier killed in combat in Lebanon, according to The Associated Press, which said Hezbollah claimed to have killed and wounded an unspecified number of Israeli troops.

Iran fired about 180 ballistic missiles toward Israel late Tuesday. The Israeli military said most were intercepted, but there were several hits.

The Pentagon said two U.S. destroyers also fired a dozen interceptors at the Iranian missiles headed to Israel.

The only confirmed death from the Iranian attack was in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where a 38-year-old Palestinian man was killed after a missile fell on the city of Jericho, according to Palestinian civil defense.

Video footage shared on social media showed a large crater where a missile had landed near Israel's Mossad spy agency headquarters.

Officials in Jordan said two people were lightly injured from falling shrapnel.

Now, the region is bracing for Israel's response and the risk of a wider war.

""This evening, Iran made a big mistake -- and it will pay for it,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said hours after the attack.

Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari called Iran's attack ""a severe and dangerous escalation,"" and promised, ""We will respond wherever, whenever and however we choose.""

And on Wednesday, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said Israel's response will be ""decisive and painful.""

Iran's Revolutionary Guard said late Tuesday that the missile attack was in response to several recent killings, including the assassination of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah late Friday in Beirut; the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran in July in a strike widely assumed to be carried out by Israel; and an Iranian commander.

Iran's mission at the United Nations said the attack was a ""legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime."""

As Israeli forces prepare for what officials characterize as a limited ground incursion into Lebanon, the world is bracing for the possibility that the conflict will expand into a larger regional war, a greater likelihood in the wake of Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

The two sides have clashed for close to a year, dating back to Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The skirmishes have led to hundreds of deaths along the border and the displacement of thousands more.

The violence reflects the damage that Iranian-backed militant groups, like Hamas and Hezbollah, have done in the Middle East for four decades. The roots of their capacity to inflict harm lie in the October 1983 suicide bombing of the U.S. Marine headquarters in Beirut, which was the largest non-nuclear blast the FBI ever investigated.

Though the attack, which killed 241 soldiers, sailors, and Marines, horrified President Ronald Reagan, he never retaliated against the then-fledgling Hezbollah.

ISRAEL UNBOUND

This decision to forego a military response, coupled with America's withdrawal from Lebanon, sent a message that terrorism worked. Small and relatively inexpensive acts of extraordinary violence could effectively defeat major militaries and superpowers. This emboldened these groups, as well as their Iranian sponsors. The results have been catastrophic for the region and the cause of peace.

By the early 1980s, Lebanon had been torn apart by years of civil war and sectarian violence that had resulted from a political tug-of-war between the nation's Christians, Sunnis and Shiites. Adding to the bloodshed was the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had moved into Beirut after being driven out of Jordan in 1971.

The PLO, upset over the loss of land during Israel's 1967 war against its Arab neighbors, fought a guerrilla campaign against Israel in an effort to obtain a homeland for the Palestinian people.

END US FUNDING FOR UN AGENCY GIVING IMMUNITY TO ITS MURDEROUS HAMAS MEMBERS

In June 1982, Israel invaded, pummeling Beirut with artillery in an attempt to eradicate the PLO, which had been attacking it from Lebanese territory. The rain of Israeli fire devastated entire city blocks. ""Even in Lebanon,"" wrote columnist Jack Anderson, ""a land inured to catastrophe, the bombardment of West Beirut was a horror beyond endurance.""

Israel's bloody war in Lebanon alarmed many, including Reagan, who worked to broker a deal to end the violence, remove the PLO, and send in U.S. Marines as peacekeepers to stabilize the region.

But American troops were not the only foreign military force to arrive in Lebanon that year. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Shiite religious leader who rose to power in Iran in 1979, saw an opportunity to capitalize on the chaos, to export and propagate his revolution.

UN ABDICATES ROLE OF MIDDLE EAST PEACEMAKER BY BACKING TERRORISTS

With that goal in mind, Khomeini sent an army of 800 elite Revolutionary Guards into Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, a lawless region near Syria. The Iranian soldiers fanned out through the impoverished Shiite communities in southern Lebanon, attending mosque, giving speeches, and recruiting disenfranchised young men to fight against American and Israeli forces.

These efforts helped produce two homegrown Shiite terror organizations: Islamic Amal and the Islamic Jihad Organization. These two Iranian-backed groups would soon merge, however, and become known simply as Hezbollah or the Party of God, aided by Iranian money, training and weapons.

Hezbollah's first strike against the U.S. came on April 18, 1983, when a suicide car bomber crashed into the front of the American Embassy in Beirut. The blast collapsed the entire front of the building, killing 63 people including 17 Americans.

IRAN'S OPTIONS DWINDLE AS IT PREPARES RETALIATION FOR DEATH OF NASRALLAH

But that attack paled in comparison to the one that would follow 188 days later.

At dawn on a Sunday morning in October 1983, a bomber in a Mercedes truck crashed through security and penetrated the lobby of the four-story Battalion Landing Team headquarters in Beirut, where some 350 American soldiers, sailors and Marines were asleep.

The blast, which investigators later determined exceeded 12,000 pounds of TNT, collapsed the building into a pile of broken concrete and twisted rebar. ""It was,"" as one survivor later recounted, ""like every atom in the universe blew apart.""

The screams from buried victims prompted one of the greatest rescue efforts in modern memory, as troops attacked the rubble pile with shovels, Ka-Bar knives and their bare hands.

For those Marines trapped underground, it was hell. Among them was Chaplain Danny Wheeler, who spent five hours buried in a concrete crypt before rescuers finally found him. ""The next thing I knew, I felt a hand on my hand,"" Wheeler recalled. ""I held it.""

Wheeler was the last survivor rescued, and one of the lucky few. All told, the bombing killed 220 Marines, 18 sailors and three soldiers, wounding another 112.

The attack shocked Reagan, who initially resisted pressure from many in Congress and the public to pull American forces out of Lebanon. In a nationally televised speech on Oct. 27, the president instead recommitted America to stabilizing the area.

""Brave young men have been taken away from us. Many others have been grievously wounded. Are we to tell them their sacrifice was wasted?"" Reagan said. ""We're a nation with global responsibilities.""

WHY BIDEN'S SPEECH AT UNGA SHOULD SET OFF ALARM BELLS ACROSS THE GLOBE

But that resolve faded in early 1984, when the Lebanese national government and military ultimately collapsed. On Feb. 7, Reagan announced that he planned to send American troops back to their ships.

In an effort to avoid drawing attention to America's sudden reversal and withdrawal, he skipped the televised speech, instead releasing a written statement to reporters. On March 30, Reagan notified Congress that he planned to officially terminate America's peacekeeping mission.

This withdrawal created a vacuum that Hezbollah capitalized on to gain power and influence, eventually becoming the dominant political party in Lebanon.

WHAT IF ISRAELIS COULD VOTE IN US ELECTIONS?

Additionally, America's abrupt departure coincided with the administration's refusal to retaliate for the bombing of the U.S. Embassy or the Marine headquarters. In the wake of the October bombing, members of the National Security Council drew up a plan to target Iran's terror camp in the Bekaa Valley.

Reagan initially supported it, but Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger convinced the president to backtrack, arguing that retaliatory action demanded the type of conclusive proof of the identity of the attackers that is often elusive in terror attacks. ""I'm not,"" Weinberger later said, ""an eye for an eye man.""

Whatever the merits of Weinberger's thinking, the results of Reagan's decision were calamitous. For the small cost of a truck, some explosives and the single life of a terrorist, Iran successfully drove the U.S. from Lebanon and suffered no consequences.

That was the critical lesson our enemies learned from this tragedy, a fact the CIA zeroed in on in a 1987 report. ""Many Iranian leaders use this precedent as proof that terrorism can break U.S. resolve.""

The agency also concluded that Iranian leaders exploited the uncertainty that had troubled Weinberger. ""Compared with overt military attacks, terrorism and sabotage also offer a degree of plausible deniability and present the United States with a less clear-cut justification for retaliation.""

America's failure to respond to the killing and wounding of hundreds of our diplomats and service members in Beirut served as a green light for Iran to continue and even escalate its proxy war of terrorism that menaces the region.

And it is a price America, Israel and our allies continue to pay four decades later.

Col. Timothy Geraghty, who was the commander of the Marines in Lebanon in October 1983 and later worked for the CIA, understands that better than anyone. ""Our timidity,"" he concluded, ""whetted the jihadists' appetite.""

October 7th anniversary weighs heavy as Jews enter the High Holy Days,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5108867/october-7th-anniversary-jewish-high-holy-days,2024-10-02T09:03:56Z,"A table covered with a cloth featuring the Loyola Marymount Hillel logo in the front, and six portraits of hostages who were killed sitting on top of it. Jason DeRose/NPR hide caption

On the table outside Rabbi Zachary Zysman's office at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, six portraits of hostages killed by Hamas are weighed down by a small stone, placed there as an act of remembrance.

Nearby, a stack of brochures for a Krav Maga self-defense class leans against a pad of paper on which people can write prayers, eventually to be tucked into the Western Wall in Jerusalem.

Zysman, the chaplain for Jewish life at Loyola Marymount, has carefully prepared for the Jewish new year, Rosh Hashanah, which begins at sunset on Wednesday and Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, later this month. In the middle of the Jewish High Holy Days comes the anniversary of October 7, the deadliest attack against Jews since the Holocaust.

No matter when the one-year anniversary fell, it would have been difficult, but Zysman said it's particularly poignant ""at a time when we're thinking about repentance, renewal and hope.""

His flock is small but close-knit. Loyola Marymount is a Jesuit university with about 10,000 students, 375 of whom are Jewish.

""One of the messages I've repeated over and over to my students is: What is our responsibility to each other?""

Along with other chaplains on campus, Zysman has hosted speaker series, workshops and roundtables discussions on anti-Semitism and Islamophobia during this past year, but the days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur will be less about education and more about personal and communal religious devotion for students.

The motif of death is frequent during High Holy Days liturgies, and Zysman said The phrases ""Who shall live? and 'Who shall die?"" take on a deeper resonance this year.

More than 1,200 Israelis, not all of whom were Jewish, died in the Hamas attacks of October 7, and 100 Israelis remain held hostage by Hamas, according to the Israeli government. More than 41,500 people in Gaza have been killed during the Israeli bombardment that followed, according to Palestinian health authorities.

Loyola Marymount senior Maya Golban says she has been reflecting on the lives - and deaths - of so many people since October 7.

""I can't personally change the politics of the Middle East, but what I can do is honor the people who've lost their lives.""

Golban said she's become considerably more active in Jewish groups on campus over the last year, where she's sometimes felt on the defensive, having to repeatedly justify her beliefs.

As she enters the High Holy Days, she said she continues to pray for ""the peace and safety of everyone in the region: Israeli, Palestinian and Bedouin.""

During the weeks leading up to the High Holy Days, Rabbi Jocee Hudson has been teaching a lunchtime class on the University of Southern California campus in Los Angeles. She's the rabbi at the Hillel Jewish Center, just across the street.

""Welcome everyone. Let's put our feet on the ground,"" Hudson said as students finished the vegan enchiladas Hillel provides, while others snuck in at the last minute. ""As we gather, the question for today is 'What's on your heart?'""

Hudson opened the class by leading the group of about ten through a centering exercise.

""We root ourselves in presence."" she said, ""We root ourselves in the right here right now. As we say the blessing for Torah study.""

Together, the class recited the Hebrew prayer which translates, ""Blessed are you, oh Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hallows us and commands us to study the words of Torah.""

Among those taking this class is senior Dylan Julia Cooper.

""Right in the aftermath of October seventh,"" she said, ""we held a memorial on campus, which was so beautiful. And it was also really hard because people came to protest. And it was really difficult in my grief to hold my friends crying in my arms and know that people were protesting 20 feet away.""

Cooper, who's majoring in anthropology and theater, said it's been a year of perseverance and that October 7 coming in the middle of the High Holy Days ""serves as a reminder of how much we can endure as a community, as a universe.""

Cooper said he's used the weeks leading up to Rosh Hashanah to figure out how to let go of disillusionment over protests.

""My Jewish friends, my Muslim friends, my Palestinian Friends, my Israeli friends,"" says Cooper, ""I want them all to feel supported and loved by me. And I don't think that holding on to my anger or holding grudges is a good way to do that.""

Sitting next to Cooper in class was Matan Marder Friedgood, a junior at USC. He described this past year as one on edge.

""I have a friend who's not Jewish who's taking a Jewish studies course"" he said. ""She goes, 'Oh, Matan, you're Jewish!' And I feel myself tense up. I'm like 'What is this going to be about? What's going to happen?""

But in this story, it turns out he was more worried than he needed to be.

""She's like 'What's a Shabbat morning service?' It's the most benign question,"" he said. ""That was the year in a nutshell: 'You're Jewish.' Uh oh.""

But for Marder Friedgood, that intensity has meant the discovery of something about himself that he finds surprising.

""My connection to Judaism has grown stronger,"" he said, ""because of the pressure that's been put on it. And my connection to other Jews has grown stronger because of the pressure. And I am much more willing to embrace it publicly.""

Marder Friedgood's been asking himself how he and his community can put aside the fear and apprehension of the past year and welcome the Jewish New Year with sweetness.

""How do we bring back the Jewish Joy?"" he wondered. ""How do we just reincorporate all the positive -- all of what it means to be Jewish, all of the great things, all of the reasons we love it -- and hold the sadness and the grief at the same time?""

These are questions many Jews are asking themselves in the lead-up to both the High Holy Days and the October 7th anniversary. They're questions with no easy answers.

""It is only through experiences of very real grief that I have come to understand the capacity for very real joy,"" said Hillel Rabbi Jocee Hudson. ""It comes in the context of time, following Oct. 7th where all of us in the Jewish community have experienced deep anguish.""

""As we have seen tens of thousands of Palestinians also killed, we have ongoing anguish,"" she said. ""And there are students who have deep reactions to that -- deep moral outrage.""

That outrage is also why preparing for the High Holy Days this year has been so intense.

""When our hearts are broken open in grief,"" Hudson said, ""there are two possibilities: One is pulling back. The other is reaching out. And that's the spiritual work.""

It's spiritual work that asks a lot of 19 or 20 or 21-year-olds. But it's spiritual work that college junior Matan Marder Friedgood wants to help his community do together, even on October 7 itself. He and a housemate are planning a vigil on the University of Southern California campus that day.

""We're both musicians and so we're trying to uplift the space through creating -- I think we have a 10-piece band to try and play Israeli and Jewish music -- an atmosphere that is holding all the sadness and holding all the grief and all the anger. And we're looking toward the future.""

It's a future - a new year - marked by the hope for peace rather than the carnage of war. Marder Friedgood plans to end the vigil by teaching those gathered to sing in Hebrew a prayer for peace.

It's the closing line from the Medieval prayer known as the Kaddish. One translation reads, ""He who makes peace in the heavens -- may He bring peace to us and all the people of Israel. Let us say, 'Amen.'"""

Hours before the vice presidential debate, former President Donald Trump addressed a crowd at his campaign rally in Wisconsin and bashed the Biden administration over Iran's historic attack on Israel.

""A short time ago, Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at Israel... I've been talking about World War III for a long time, and I don't want to make predictions because the predictions always come true. We're not going to make [predictions]... but they are very close to global catastrophe,"" Trump said. ""We have a non-existent president and a non-existent vice president who should be in charge, but nobody knows what's going on.""

Trump's comments come after Israel said Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at the country, marking the largest ballistic missile attack in history.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike late last week and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst.

Iran's Revolutionary Guard warned in a statement released by Iranian state media that if Israel responds to the missile barrage, ""it will face crushing attacks.""

Trump accused President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of weak leadership on the world stage.

""That's why Israel was under attack just a little while ago. Because they don't respect our country anymore. The so-called enemy doesn't respect our country any longer,"" Trump said.

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES ACROSS ISRAEL

Trump claimed Biden and Harris made Iran rich in a very short period of time.

""They have $300 billion now. They're rich. I mean, they pay 6 billion every time they have somebody that was kidnaped, it's always $6 billion,"" Trump said.

""Iran was on the verge of bankruptcy. They had no money left. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. The people they're fighting now, they would have been willing to make any deal. You could have made any deal. But Kamala flooded them with American cash and everything. Now, I mean, they're flooding them with cash. It's honestly not even believable,"" Trump continued.

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the Iranian missile attack on Israel was ""defeated and ineffective"" and that the U.S. military coordinated with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to repel the strikes.

""U.S. naval destroyers joined Israeli Air Defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles. President Biden and Vice President Harris monitored the attack and the response from the White House Situation Room, joined in person and remotely by their national security team,"" Sullivan said.

Sullivan characterized the attack as a ""significant escalation"" while speaking at a White House briefing on Tuesday.

Sullivan said no deaths were reported on the Israeli side, although the White House is monitoring the reported death of a Palestinian civilian in Jericho in the West Bank.

""We do not know of any damage to aircraft or strategic military assets in Israel. In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective. The word fog of war was invented for a situation like this. This is a fluid situation,"" he said.

Many missiles were intercepted by Israel's missile defense systems, while others did hit the ground.

The Pentagon says the U.S. fired approximately 12 interceptors against Iranian missiles.

Antony Blinken does victory lap on Biden-Harris' 'stronger' foreign policy same day Iran attacks Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/antony-blinken-op-ed-touts-biden-harris-foreign-policy-renewal-same-day-iran-attacks-israel,2024-10-01T22:09:19Z,"Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest on Israel's possible response after the Iran missile attack on 'Your World.'

Secretary of State Antony Blinken published an op-ed Tuesday touting the Biden-Harris administration's foreign policy record, stating they took drastic deviations from former President Trump, the same day Iran directly attacked Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles.

Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel Tuesday evening local time in what the administration called a ""signigicant escalation by Iran."" The indiscriminate rocket fire were part of the Shia regime's response to Israel assassinating nearly all of Hezbollah senior leadership, including long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Hours before Iran's attack, Blinken's op-ed touted how Biden-Harris' ""renewal"" strategy post-Trump was working and strengthening America's interests abroad.

""The Biden administration's strategy has put the United States in a much stronger geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,"" Blinken said.

PENTAGON SENDING A 'FEW THOUSAND' PERSONNEL TO MIDDLE EAST DAY AFTER BIDEN SAID HE WOULDN'T ADD COMBAT TROOPS

Blinken said the administration prioritized international cooperation and avoided making decisions abroad in isolation.

""From day one, President Biden and Vice President Harris made a foundational choice that in a more competitive and combustible world, the United States cannot go it alone. If America wants to protect its security and create opportunities for its people, it must stand with those who have a stake in a free, open, secure, and prosperous world and stand up to those who threaten that world,"" he wrote. ""President Biden and Vice President Harris pursued a strategy of renewal, pairing historic investments in competitiveness at home with an intensive diplomatic campaign to revitalize partnerships abroad,"" he said. ""This twin-pillared strategy, they believed, was the best way to disabuse competitors of their assumptions that the United States was declining and diffident.""

Blinken also stated the war in Gaza is interconnected to Iran's maligned behavior.

""Without an end to the war in Gaza and a time-bound, credible path to statehood that addresses the Palestinians' legitimate aspirations and Israel's security needs, normalization cannot move forward. But if these efforts succeed, normalization would join Israel to a regional security architecture, unlock economic opportunities across the region, and isolate Iran and its proxies,"" he continued. ""Glimmers of such integration were on display in the coalition of countries, including Arab states, that helped Israel defend itself against an unprecedented direct attack from Iran in April.""

The State Department referred Fox News Digital to the department's briefing when asked for comment.

House Republicans have described Biden-Harris foreign policy as one aiming at ""appeasement,"" particularly towards Iran.

CBS host grills Ta-Nehisi Coates on anti-Israel views in new book: Looks like it came from 'an extremist',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-host-grills-ta-nehisi-coates-anti-israel-views-new-book-looks-like-came-from-an-extremist,2024-10-01T20:50:22Z,"CBS Mornings anchor Tony Dokoupil pressed author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates on whether he believed Israel had a right to exist in a Monday interview.

""CBS Mornings"" anchor Tony Dokoupil grilled author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates over whether he believed Israel had ""a right to exist"" in a tense interview on Monday.

Coates appeared on the show to preview his new book, ""The Message,"" which is a collection of new essays by the best-selling author about his travels to different parts of the world.

""In the book's longest section, Coates travels to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how easily we are misled by nationalist narratives, and the tragedy that lies in the clash between the stories we tell and the reality of life on the ground,"" the book summary says.

Dokoupil confronted Coates on this section of the book, telling him bluntly that it read like something you would find in ""the backpack of an extremist.""

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES ACROSS ISRAEL

""I have to say, when I read the book, I imagine if I took your name out of it, took away the awards, the acclaim, took the cover off the book, publishing house goes away, the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,"" Dokoupil said.

""So then I found myself wondering, why does Ta'Nehisi Coates, who I've known for a long time, read his work for a long time, very talented, smart guy, leave out so much? Why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it? Why leave out that Israel deals with terror groups that want to eliminate it? Why not detail anything of the first and the second Intifada, the café bombings, the bus bombings, the little kids blown to bits. Is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?"" the CBS anchor continued.

Coates defended the book, saying he sought to give a voice to the Palestinian people, whose views he argued were underrepresented in the American media.

""I would say the perspective that you just outlined, there is no shortage of that perspective in American media,"" Coates replied.

""I have asked repeatedly in my interviews whether there is a single network, mainstream organization, in America with a Palestinian-American bureau chief or correspondent who actually has a voice to articulate that part the world. I've been a reporter for 20 years. The reporters are those who believe more sympathetically about Israel and its right to exist don't have a problem getting their voice out. But what I saw in Palestine, what I saw on the West Bank, what I saw in Haifa in Israel, what I saw in the South Hebron Hills, those were the stories I have not heard. Those were the stories that I was most occupied with,"" he continued.

Coates also said the 260-page book was not meant to be a ""treatise on the entirety of the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis.""

Dokoupil continued to press the far-left author, claiming his book would leave readers questioning why Israel even existed.

""But if you were to read this book you would be left wondering why does any of Israel exist? What a horrific place committing horrific acts on a daily basis. So I think the question is central and key: If Israel has a right to exist. And if your answer is no, then I guess the question becomes why do the Palestinians have a right to exist? Why do 20 different Muslim countries have a right to exist?"" Dokoupil asked.

Coates rejected the question, saying that countries are established by force, not rights, and that Israel already exists.

Dokoupil said the author's book ""delegitimizes"" Israel's foundation and ""seems like an effort to topple the whole building of it.""

""What is it that so particularly offends you about the existence of a Jewish state, that is a Jewish safe place, and not any of the other states out there?"" he asked Coates.

""There's nothing that offends me about a Jewish state,"" Coates retorted. ""I am offended by the idea of states built on ethnocracy, no matter where they are.""

""Muslim included?"" Dokoupil asked.

""I would not want a state where any group of people laid down their citizenship rights based on ethnicity,"" Coates said. He explained how he personally witnessed the ""two-tier system"" in Israel, where Palestinians had less freedom and access to resources in ""occupied territories"" than Israelis.

""I'm working with the person that is guiding me, a Palestinian whose father, whose grandfather and grandmother was born in this town. And I have more freedom to walk than he does. He can't ride on certain roads. He can't get water in the same way that Israeli citizens who live less than a mile away from him can,"" Coates said.

The two continued to spar as Dokoupil suggested Coates had portrayed a one-sided view of the conflict.

""But why is that?"" the anchor pressed. ""Why is there no agency in this book for the Palestinians? They exist in your narrative merely as victims of the Israelis, as though they were not offered peace at any juncture, as though they don't have a stake in this -- "" he asked.

Coates appealed to his own ancestry and America's history with racism to defend his particular viewpoint on the conflict in Gaza.

""I have a very, very, very moral compass about this. Again, perhaps it's because of my ancestry. Either apartheid is right or it's wrong. It's really, really simple. Either what I saw was right or it's wrong,"" he explained.

""I am against a state that discriminates against people on the basis of ethnicity. I'm against that. There is nothing the Palestinians could do that would make that okay for me. My book is not based on the hyper-morality of the Palestinian people,"" he went on to say.

We are now going to look at what the appropriate next steps are to secure, first and foremost, American interests and then to promote stability to the maximum extent possible as we go forward,"" Sullivan said.

He said the U.S. will consult with the Israelis on next steps in terms of response and how to deal with the Iranian attack.

The White House is particularly focused on protecting U.S. service members in the region and implored American citizens in Lebanon to follow the State Department's guidance of finding civilian commercial means to leave the country, Sullivan said.

Sullivan also expressed his condolences to the victims who were killed in a shooting in the Israeli city of Jaffa, located near Tel Aviv on Tuesday. At least eight people were killed and at least seven injured, local officials have told Fox News.

The incident, which is believed to be a terror attack, took place Tuesday outside a newly built light rail station on Jerusalem Street. Authorities say at least two individuals who opened fire on a crowd of people have been neutralized.

Writer Ta-Nehisi Coates says he long felt the pull to visit Africa -- and yet it was a trip he kept putting off.

""When you're Black in this country, Africa -- or the story that's told about Africa -- is a weight,"" Coates says. ""I always knew it was a trip that I had to take. But I think, in the back of my mind, I knew that I would have to confront some things, that it would not be a vacation.""

When Coates did finally travel to Senegal, he says it felt like a pilgrimage. As the plane descended into Dakar, he was so overcome with emotion that he uttered a profanity.

""It came out of nowhere, and I was shocked at myself,"" he says. ""But I think it was evidence of some things that I really had been burying that had to be confronted.""

While in Dakar, Coates visited the the island of Gorée, and the fort in which people were held before being forced onto ships that would take them to enslavement in the United States. There he says, ""What I imagined was my many, many, many, many, many grandmothers who were taken in that way. That was what I saw. ... That hit hard.""

Coates won the 2015 National Book Award for Between the World and Me, which was written in the form of a letter to his 15-year-old son about what it means to be a Black teenager and a Black man in America. In his new book, The Message, he reflects on his time in Senegal, as well as trips he took to South Carolina and to Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He describes it as a book about nationalism and belonging.

""It is about the nationalisms of people who are told that they are nothing, that they are not a nation, that they are not a people ... that the only place in the world that is fit for them is as an underclass or maybe not in the world at all,"" he says. ""And the stories that we construct to fight back against that.""

On staying on a beach in Senegal, contemplating the people who were taken to enslavement in America

There were people very clearly vacationing with their kids and frolicking in the water. And there was one of those really fancy pools that was kind of level with the ground and people serving drinks. And there was a DJ. And I went and I sat down in the restaurant ... and where I was seated, I could look out onto the Atlantic Ocean. And I knew that what I was feeling at that moment was not what everybody else there was feeling. It was like I was at a funeral. And everybody else was at a wedding. That's what it felt like.

On his parents naming him Ta-Nehisi as a way of connecting with their African roots

I think what my parents sought to do from the moment I was born was inure me against the racism of culture that pervades American life and really takes Africa and the story of Africa as its root. And what they sought to do was throw it back. And what they picked for me was an ancient Egyptian name that refers to the ancient kingdom of Nubia in the south, the place of ostensibly Black kings and Black kingdoms and Black queens and great deeds that were done by Black people. And to root me in that as a counter to the racist narrative that I would undoubtedly hear as I went through my life.

There are both Palestinians who live in Hebron and also there are Jewish settlers on the West Bank who live in Hebron also. They are not accorded the same rights. And this was made viscerally clear to me as I walked through Hebron with the group that I was with. There were streets that we would encounter where we were allowed as non-Palestinians to walk and Palestinians were not allowed to walk. ...

I was on my way to support a vendor, and a guard came out and he stopped me and he said, ""What's your religion, bro?"" And I said, ""I don't really have a religion. I'm not a particularly religious person."" He said, ""Come on, don't play. What is your religion? ... What is your parents' religion? ... What was your grandmother's religion?"" I said, ""Well, my grandmother was a Christian."" And he said, ""Ok, you can go past."" And it was so blatant. It was so clear. ... I wouldn't have been allowed to pass [if I was Muslim]. That was clear.

On differences he observed between the ways that Palestinians and Israelis are treated in the Israeli-occupied West Bank

I was being made aware of the fact that if a Palestinian is arrested on the West Bank, they are subject to the military system of justice, whereas if a Jewish settler is arrested on the West Bank, they're subjected to the civil system. ... I was made aware of the differing water laws that govern [access] depending on who you are, an entire separate system of justice that was ... separate and unequal. As a descendant of someone who was, or peoples who are, born into a system of governance that was separate and unequal, it was very hard for me to not be struck by that emotionally.

On the ways in which victims can become victimizers

I am part of a community that fought in the Civil War to free themselves as members of the Union Army, and we praise that effort, and we talk about that effort. And some of those soldiers went West and fought wars against the indigenous people of this country. They became victimizers. I'm part of a community that in an effort to to free itself and liberate itself from white racism in this country, bought into the dream of Liberia, which meant going over to Africa and subjecting Africans to Western civilization ... and ""Christianizing"" them and ""civilizing"" them. That is victims becoming victimizers.

What is uncomfortable is for us to see that the victimization and oppression, even at its highest point, may not necessarily be ennobling. ... In the most cliché terms -- I'm sorry to use this -- but to be a hurt person who hurts people [is] certainly possible. And that's a dark thought, ... because I think we want to believe that having that oppression is some sort of card, you know, a moral high ground that is automatically conferred. But the fact of the matter is that sometimes that's true. Sometimes it's not. And I think as much as I saw the connection between Black people and Palestinians when I was over there, it was not so hard for me to see myself in the Israelis.

On the need for more Palestinian voices to be heard

We need more Palestinians to be enshrined to tell their story and to tell their perspective. ... The people who are enduring, from my perspective, this system of apartheid have not been enshrined to speak about what future they would envision. ... It would be as if we were trying to figure out segregation ... and we completely sidelined Black people and deprived them of the ability to articulate what they felt the world should look like. Imagine a world where there can't be an ""I Have a Dream"" speech because nobody will cover it, and nobody will give the opportunity for that message to get out in the first place."
"IDF meets little resistance from Hezbollah after weeks of hitting terror targets, officials say",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/idf-meets-little-resistance-from-hezbollah-after-weeks-hitting-terror-targets-officials-say,2024-10-01T15:58:39Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Israel Defense Force (IDF) has met little resistance since announcing its ""limited"" invasion of southern Lebanon early Tuesday morning local time, a move aimed to subvert Hezbollah's buildup along the shared border.

Israel has been increasing its strikes for weeks against the terrorist organization in southern Lebanon, as well as with targeted strikes in Beirut.

On Tuesday, the IDF confirmed in a statement shared with Fox News Digital that since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel - after which Hezbollah began striking military posts along Israel's northern border - the IDF has conducted dozens of ""targeted operations"" to ""dismantle Hezbollah's terrorist capabilities"" that pose a threat to civilians in the north.

ISRAELI MINISTERS FRUSTRATED OVER US, IDF LEAK ON LEBANON OPERATION: REPORT

IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Tuesday that IDF special forces have entered Hezbollah compounds in ""dozens of locations"" along the Israel-Lebanon border, collected intelligence and dismantled positional strongholds.

""Our soldiers entered Hezbollah's underground infrastructures, exposed Hezbollah's hidden weapon caches, and seized and destroyed the weapons, including advanced Iranian-made weapons,"" Hagari said. ""Overall, IDF soldiers exposed and dismantled over 700 Hezbollah terror assets during these operations. And there's a lot more work to do.""

Since the war began nearly a year ago, Israeli special forces reportedly began conducting small raids in southern Lebanon, in some cases utilizing the very tunnels Israel seized from the terrorist group years prior, and renewed attention has been brought to how the Hezbollah network operates.

The terrorist group for years has relied on its heavy entanglement in civilian life, particularly in southern Lebanon, where it has rented civilian infrastructure to serve as weapons depots and even missile launcher sites. Civilian buildings have also been used to cover entrances to the group's sophisticated tunnel network that is estimated to stretch over 100 miles in length cumulatively across the region.

But despite the feared all-out war that had the potential to erupt upon Israel's invasion of its northern neighbor, Hezbollah's resistance has been minimal.

PENTAGON SENDING A 'FEW THOUSAND' PERSONNEL TO MIDDLE EAST DAY AFTER BIDEN SAID HE WOULDN'T ADD COMBAT TROOPS

Security experts feared Hezbollah's longtime backing from Iran would enable it to levy as many as 8,000 rockets per day in a worse case scenario, and its more than 50,000 operatives, including the elite Radwan forces, could pose a significant threat against an Israeli ground campaign.

Hagari confirmed to reporters Tuesday that IDF forces were actively working to dismantle Radwan infrastructure near the border in southern Lebanon.

""We need to take care of it because we will not let another 7th of October occur next to our border,"" he said.

In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks, the IDF assessed that some 2,400 Radwan terrorists, along with another 500 Palestinian Jihadists trained by the elite force, were positioned in villages across southern Lebanon poised to attack.

But the IDF on Tuesday also highlighted that Hezbollah failed to mount a counter force in response to Israel's incursion.

Jonathan Conricus, former IDF spokesperson and current senior fellow for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah's near-complete lack of a counter force could be explained by several reasons.

""The IDF conducted hundreds of special operations during the last months to map and analyze Hezbollah's hostile infrastructure in civilian houses in southern Lebanon, as well as targeted aerial campaigns against Hezbollah personnel,"" he said. ""Hezbollah terrorists sustained severe casualties and started to flee from southern Lebanon.

""It remains unclear how many Hezbollah militants remain in the south,"" he added.

Given the unknown number of terrorists who fled the south, most likely to other strongholds in Beirut and in central Lebanon, reporters questioned the current IDF spokesman if this could mean that Israel will need to expand its operations north.

""We're not going to Beirut,"" Hagari told reporters, emphasizing Israel's stated goal to return its citizens to their northern homes. ""We are focusing in the area of those villages, the area next to [the] border. And we will do, in this area, what is necessary to dismantle and demolish Hezbollah's infrastructure.""

Hagari would not provide specifics on the operational timeline but said Israel's campaign in Lebanon would be conducted in ""days [to] weeks."""

The Israeli military has launched what it calls a ""limited"" incursion ground offensive in southern Lebanon against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. This action comes almost a year after Israel and Hezbollah began exchanging fire, forcing Lebanese and Israeli people living along the border to flee their homes. It also follows Israeli airstrikes that killed a number of top Hezbollah officials in Beirut on Friday. Yesterday, Hezbollah's deputy Naim Kassem addressed supporters, stating they would continue the battle in support of Palestinians and defend Lebanon.

For the first and likely only time, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will face off in a vice presidential debate tonight.

Union dockworkers along East Coast and Gulf Coast ports began striking early today, halting the movement of more than $2 billion worth of goods, including cars, clothing, paper, farm machinery and much more. Picketing started just after midnight after talks between the International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance, representing ocean carriers and port operators, failed to result in a new contract. The strike, which impacts work at 14 ports, has two major sticking points: wages and automation. Trade groups warned President Biden that an extended strike would have dire consequences for the U.S. economy.

State Department diplomat worked on project claiming Hezbollah's aim is to 'achieve social justice',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/state-department-diplomat-previously-wrote-puff-pieces-on-radical-islamic-terrorists-social-justice,2024-10-01T09:23:31Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A U.S. State Department diplomat was previously involved in a project spotlighting influential figures in the Middle East, which included descriptions of some designated terrorists as individuals aiming to achieve ""social justice.""

Usra Ghazi is a foreign service officer, who got her first stint in the department during the Obama administration in 2015, briefly leaving in 2018. She returned again in 2019 as a diplomat.

The State Department's security clearance process for this role is rigorous; Fox News Digital asked the State Department how Ghazi's process went. ""Due to privacy considerations, the Department cannot provide any information regarding any current or former employees' security clearance,"" they said in a statement, which also confirmed she is currently an employee.

From 2009-2010, Ghazi edited and prepared two of the first editions of a textbook publication called ""The 500 Most Influential Muslims."" The text harshly criticizes attempts to reform traditional Islam, calling modernism ""an object of derision and ridicule [that] is scorned by traditional Muslims and fundamentalists alike.""

STATE DEPARTMENT MANDATES SUPPORT FOR DEI IDEOLOGY AS PREREQUISITE FOR PROMOTIONS: 'YOU ARE JUDGED'

Ghazi worked on the textbook while she studied abroad in Amman, Jordan, at the ""Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre"" from 2009-2010, according to her LinkedIn.

Ghazi went abroad as a participant in an international exchange program sponsored by the Clinton Global Initaitive and the office of Queen Rania of Jordan.

The academic work at times used soft language surrounding America-hating terrorists, like Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

The publication Ghazi worked on described the terror group Hezbollah as a ""social justice"" movement and an ""International Symbol of Resistance Against Israel,"" according to the publication.

""Hezbollah is a Shi'a Islamic political party and paramilitary organization based in Lebanon. Hezbollah's ideology is based on seeking social justice through Islamic ideals,"" the publication spotlighting the influence of Hassan Nasrallah said.

The long-time Hezbollah leader Nasrallah was killed last week in an Israeli airstrike.

""Political and military successes have made Nasrallah a vastly influential figure in Lebanon, and in the Middle East more broadly. Nasrallah and Hezbollah are also controversial; the US and Canada list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization,"" the description continued.

It then went on to tout Hezbollah's social justice mission.

""Israel remains a key issue for the Muslim world and Hezbollah's aim to achieve social justice there is central to its activities,"" the text said.

""Hezbollah has also won significant grassroots support by cultivating a social welfare system that provides schools, clinics, and housing in the predominantly Shi'a parts of Lebanon, and also in others. These welfare activities are run with efficiency and rival those carried out by the state, giving the organization even broader appeal,"" it continued.

The State Department said its position on Hezbollah was ""quite clear"" and referred Fox News Digital to Monday's State Department briefing, where spokesperson Matt Miller condemned the group as a terrorist organization and stressed Israel's right to defend itself.

PENTAGON EQUITY CHIEF PRAISES BOOK CALLING 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS 'MENACES' AS SHE PUSHES FOR 'REVOLUTION'

The 2009 edition of ""500 Most Influential Muslims"" spotlighted Khaled Mashaal, describing him as one of the most prominent leaders of Hamas, as a ""Fighter for Social Justice"" and ""Pioneer."" The blurb did mention, as the one noted above, that the U.S. considers Hamas a terrorist organization.

""Since becoming head of Hamas, Mashaal has seen the organization through multiple attempts at a roadmap to peace and a major Israeli siege of the Gaza Strip,"" it said.

""Mashaal has been recognized for his persistence with Hamas's efforts -- at present leading in exile from Syria. His determination is combined with a unique effort at diplomacy,"" it said. ""Mashaal has been one of the most direct, and candid leaders in dialogue and confrontation with Israel and this has garnered international recognition.""

In addition to working at the State Department, Ghazi is currently involved in ""America Indivisible"" as a senior adviser, according to her LinkedIn. She was previously its director from 2018-2019. America Indivisible currently promotes its publication from 2020 on its site, recommending that people read ""credible sources"" like ""MuslimGirl"" in order to combat religious intolerance.

MuslimGirl's objective is to draw awareness ""to the Qur'an's message of gender equality and Islam's principle of peace,"" according to the website's description.

Fox News Digital's previous review of MuslimGirl found that it was filled with articles containing pro-Palestinian propaganda from 2016 to the present.

NEW STATE DEPARTMENT DIVERSITY CHIEF BELIEVES US IS A 'FAILED HISTORIC MODEL' WITH A 'COLONIZING PAST'

For example, one week after the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, MuslimGirl published an article which said, ""Was it plausible to believe that [the Palestinians] would remain passive forever?""

The piece also questioned whether associating Hamas with terrorism was political.

""The term 'terrorist'... warrants careful consideration,"" the article said. ""How... can this label be applied to those defending their homeland...""

""MuslimGirl Staff"" published an article in May 2021 that said that evangelical Christians were a ""threat,"" while also claiming that evangelicals are more dangerous to Jews than Palestinians.

Fox News Digital contacted the State Department for comment in March asking questions about Ghazi's affiliation with America Indivisible, particularly given its recommendation of MuslimGirl. In the months that followed, Ghazi had not changed her public affiliation with America Indivisible."
Morning Glory: Israel unbound,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-israel-unbound,2024-10-01T09:20:06Z,"'Special Report' panelists discuss the latest presidential polling in key battleground states as Election Day inches closer.

When Israeli Prime Minister visited the United States at the invitation of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) this past summer, the Congressional leaders intended the visit to be a gesture of support for our embattled ally.

But Vice President Harris, who ought to have presided at the joint session of Congress in her role as President of the Senate along with Speaker Johnson -- with both seated behind Netanyahu -- instead skipped the Israeli PM's address to the joint session of Congress on July 24. Harris thus sent a very public message to her supporters -- she did not care to reschedule previous commitments though Netanyahu's visit was long in planning -- and then met with Netanyahu privately as did President Biden.

Whatever the President and Vice President said to the Prime Minister after what the Vice President did by way of very visible messaging, Netanyahu embraced a different strategy for Israel after his return to Jerusalem. Two months later, when Netanyahu returned to the states to deliver a fiery address the United Nations General Assembly last week, that new strategy had already rolled out in large part in the region, though it is crescendoing still.

First, Israel took the war everywhere in Gaza, and Hamas is all but obliterated as an organized fighting force though 101 hostages remain in the terrorists' tunnel network and the condition of Yahya Sinwar is unknown. Sinwar's military commander, Mohammed Deif, was killed in an Israeli air raid in southern Gaza on July 13, though that news was not confirmed until after Netanyahu's visit to Congress.

Not long after Netanyahu's return to Israel, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated on July 31 along with his personal bodyguard while in the Iran's capital of Tehran.

Fuad Shukr, a senior commander in Iran's proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, was killed by the Israeli Air Force a day earlier, on July 30. Hezbollah's top military commander thereafter, Ibrahim Aqil, and 10 other senior commanders of Hezbollah's elite ""Radwan Force"" -- structured as special operation forces trained to invade Israel and hold terriroty -- were killed in an air strike on September 20.

On September 28 the leader of Hezbollah, its ""Secretary General"" for four decades, Hassan Nasrallah, and at least 10 other senior members of the terror organization were killed in a massive Israeli air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Among the dead was also at least one senior general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iranian state media confirmed General Abbas Nilforoushan, 58, had been at the doomed conference in Nasrallah's underground bunker.

HAMAS LEADER KILLED IN LEBANON WAS UN EMPLOYEE, AGENCY CONFIRMS

In the middle of these strikes at all of the senior terror leadership in Lebanon, hundreds if not thousands of Hezbollah terrorists and their accomplices in Lebanon were killed or wounded in the beeper and walkie-talkie attack that astonished the world. (Israel has not claimed responsibility for this attack.)

Over the weekend, strikes continued on the remaining senior leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and other terror groups and a second round of punishing air strikes on significant assets in Yemen were conducted by the Israeli Air Force in reprisals for that country's ruling terrorists attacks on Israeli via ballistic missiles.

There were also reports on Monday that the Israeli special forces had been conducting raids in southern Lebanon, including inside of Hezbollah's vast tunnel network, in preparation for ground operations to secure northern Israel from the threat of ongoing attacks against the Jewish State which began on October 8th, the day after the barbaric Hamas massacre of 1,200 inside the southern border of Israel (and the kidnapping of 250 more, more than a hundred of whom have been rescued or released via negotiations last fall.) A desperate and disorganized Hamas seems incapable of even responding to proposals for hostage exchanges and the IDF is going about methodically destroying Gaza's 500 miles of terrorist tunnels.

Netanyahu and his governing coalition got stronger this weekend as a former ally turned rival became an ally again as Gideon Saar brought his ""New Hope"" party into the governing coalition led by Netanyahu and his Likud party.

What this week and the next four that follow right up to the United States presidential election will bring in Israel, Lebanon, Gaza and the entire region is unknown, but what is clear is that Israel does not feel in the least constrained by President Biden and his team and their mantra of ""de-escalation.""

Israel tried every tactic requested by the United States, did its best to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage deal, and was repeatedly spurned by the terrorists in Gaza. (The consequences of the U.S.-enforced delays will be assessed after the wars conclude.) Though Vice President Harris had ""studied the maps"" of Rafah and publicly concluded that Israel could not evacuate the more than a million Palestinians taking refuge there, Israel in fact did just that, and without loss of innocent life save those of the soldiers of the IDF killed in the Rafah operations and six hostages Hamas terrorists ruthlessly executed, including an American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin.

At the same time as the Gaza War intensified, Israel hammered Iran's other proxies in Lebanon and Yemen, both of which -- Hezbollah and the Houthis -- had kept up a barrage of rocket, drone and missile strikes on the Jewish State.

After Netanyahu's visit to the Congress and his snub by the possible next president, it seems clear he returned to Israel resolved to prosecute Israel's seven front war on his terms, not those of the United States, which itself continues to be subject to missile and drone barrages against its fleet and land forces in the region and to reply only intermittently. Nothing the United States has done can compare with Israel's withering counter-attacks. Israel is restoring deterrence in the region and Iran, which threatened to strike back against Israel, has not yet attempted a reprise of its direct assault on Israel in April.

Whatever Biden and Harris and all their senior officials intended Israel to do, unless they recommended Netanyahu do all of the above, then Israel has shrugged off the demands made of it by the appeasement-driven Biden-Harris administration.

Perhaps Netanyahu is simply unwilling to risk what are widely expected to be the anti-Israel policies of Harris should she win. Perhaps he took the measure of President Biden and concluded the American Commander-on-Chief is spent and not really in command at all.

Correlation is, of course, not causation. But whatever Biden and Harris said to Netanyahu in July, unless it was ""Go get them,"" the Israeli Prime Minister has decided to protect his people and not his friendships with the clueless foreign policy blob inside the Beltway."
Pentagon sending a 'few thousand' personnel to Middle East day after Biden said he wouldn't add combat troops,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-sending-few-thousand-us-troops-middle-east-one-day-after-biden-promised-he-wouldnt,2024-10-01T02:00:03Z,"DOD spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Monday the additional troops are to augment U.S. forces already there on heightened alert.

The Pentagon announced on Monday that it is sending a ""few thousand"" U.S. personnel to the Middle East to support Air Force squadrons a day after President Biden vowed not to send combat troops to the region.

Speaking at a press gaggle with reporters on Monday, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the U.S. was sending a ""few thousand"" more troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to defend Israel, if needed.

Biden gave a firm ""no"" when asked Sunday if he planned to deploy additional combat troops to the Middle East.

This increased presence is to include multiple warplane squadrons, complimenting the F-15s, F-16s, A-10s and F-22s already stationed in the region.

ISRAEL WILL LAUNCH 'LIMITED' GROUND INVASION IN LEBANON 'IMMINENTLY' US OFFICIAL SAYS

The planes were initially supposed to rotate in and replace the squadrons stationed there. Instead, both the current and new squadrons are to remain in place to double the available airpower because of increased tensions in the region and concern that Iran might respond to Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader last week in Lebanon.

Singh said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ""increased the readiness of additional U.S. forces to deploy, elevating our preparedness to respond to various contingencies. And DOD (Department of Defense) maintains robust and integrated air-defense capabilities across the Middle East, ensuring the protection of U.S. forces operating in the region.""

The few thousand additional personnel are not combat troops but rather maintenance crews and those who can help with the air defense mission and refueling. The additional forces would raise the total number of U.S. personnel in the region to as many as 43,000.

The Pentagon's announcement follows word that Israel has already launched limited raids across its northern border into Lebanon amid an anticipated wider ground invasion.

It also follows recent strikes into Lebanon and the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist organization. Israel is also engaged in an ongoing war in the south against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after the Palestinian terrorist group sparked the conflict with its bloody incursion into southern Israel in October 2023.

Secretary Austin announced Sunday he was temporarily extending the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and its embarked air wing in the region. A U.S. official said the extension would be for about a month.

HEZBOLLAH SAYS IT WILL CHOOSE NASRALLAH'S SUCCESSOR 'AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY'

A second U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman, sailed from Virginia last week and is en route to Europe. It will head to the Mediterranean Sea and again provide a two-carrier presence in the broader region. It's not expected to arrive for at least another week.

Biden told reporters on Monday, ""I'm more aware than you might know"" about reports that Israel is planning a limited ground campaign in Lebanon after nearly a year of trading attacks with Hezbollah in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, and he said he wants an immediate cease-fire.

When asked about the reports, Biden said he was ""comfortable with them stopping"" and that ""We should have a cease-fire now."""
Trey Yingst: Redefining War Correspondence In The Digital Age,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ianshepherd/2024/09/30/trey-yingst-redefining-war-correspondence-in-the-digital-age/,2024-09-30T20:59:45Z,"In an era where traditional media is rapidly evolving, Trey Yingst stands out as a trailblazer, redefining the role of a foreign correspondent for the digital age. As the chief foreign correspondent for Fox News, Yingst has not only excelled in conventional reporting but has also emerged as a pioneer in leveraging social media to deliver real-time, impactful journalism to a global audience.

The Journey to Fox News

Yingst's journey into journalism began during his college years at American University in Washington, D.C. In 2016, while still a student, he co-founded a company called ""News to Share,"" which allowed him to report from conflict zones around the world. This early experience sparked a passion that would define his career.

""This was my first taste of international journalism,"" Yingst recalls. ""I traveled all over the world, from Ukraine to Gaza to Sub-Saharan Africa. This is when I think my passion was really sparked for what I'm doing today.""

Now, a decade later, Yingst finds himself at the pinnacle of his field, serving as the chief foreign correspondent for Fox News. His role involves leading all foreign coverage for the network, not just from the Middle East but also from hotspots like Afghanistan, Ukraine, Pakistan, Lebanon, and Iraq.

Embracing Social Media in Journalism

What sets Yingst apart is his innovative approach to using social media platforms as an extension of his reporting. Recognizing the changing habits of news consumers, particularly younger audiences, Yingst has adapted his journalistic style to meet viewers where they are - on their phones and social media feeds.

""You know, there are millions of people who want to watch on TV, and they have cable, and each day or night they sit down and they sit in front of their TV and watch the news,"" Yingst explains. ""A new generation of people, they're consuming news in a different way. They're consuming it on social media. They're consuming it on their phones, on the go.""

To cater to this evolving audience, Yingst uses a variety of platforms including TikTok, Instagram, X (formerly Twitter), and Facebook. He tailors his content to each platform, ensuring that his reporting reaches the widest possible audience in the most engaging formats.

Innovative Content Formats

Yingst's social media strategy involves a mix of different content types, each designed to give viewers a unique perspective on the stories he covers:

1. Selfie Videos: These short, personal videos allow viewers to feel as if they're on the ground with Yingst. He recalls a viral TikTok video of him riding in the back of a pickup truck with the Taliban, which resonated strongly with younger audiences who hadn't seen this type of raw, immediate reporting before.

2. Raw Footage: On platforms like Instagram, Yingst shares unedited video from the field, such as rockets being intercepted or scenes of destruction in Gaza. This gives viewers an unfiltered look at the realities of conflict zones.

3. Real-Time Text Updates: On X, Yingst provides rapid-fire text updates, taking advantage of the platform's features to bold or italicize key information. This creates a newsletter-like experience for followers seeking the latest developments.

4. Photography: Through his Instagram page ""Experience Humans"" Yingst shares powerful still images that humanize the individuals caught in conflicts, fostering empathy and understanding among his audience.

Ethical Considerations in Real-Time Reporting

With the immediacy of social media comes heightened responsibility. Yingst is acutely aware of the ethical considerations in reporting from conflict zones and sharing potentially sensitive content in real-time.

""For me, ethics is of the utmost importance,"" Yingst emphasizes. ""When we're covering an active war zone where things are changing very quickly, you have civilians involved. Oftentimes people are killed or injured in front of you, and so you have to think about that as you are reporting.""

Yingst maintains a strict policy of aligning his social media journalism with the high standards of television reporting. He's transparent with his audience about the information he chooses to withhold for ethical reasons and provides content warnings when sharing graphic or potentially disturbing material.

""Black Saturday"": A Journalistic Milestone

Yingst's commitment to comprehensive, balanced reporting is perhaps best exemplified in his new book, ""Black Saturday."" The book provides an in-depth account of the October 7, 2023 attack on Israel by Hamas and the subsequent war, offering perspectives from all sides of the conflict.

""Black Saturday is the gold standard in journalism about the October 7 massacre, Black Saturday and the war that followed,"" Yingst states. ""It is a book like no other, because it takes the reader into that day, not just from the perspective of my team on the ground in southern Israel as the attack is unfolding, but you also hear firsthand accounts from police officers, from soldiers, from survivors, from hostages who were taken from their homes and dragged into Gaza and then later released as part of the November ceasefire deal.""

The book also includes accounts from Palestinian civilians, doctors, journalists, and Hamas officials, providing a 360-degree view of the conflict. This approach aligns with Yingst's commitment to objective, informative journalism that follows in the footsteps of industry greats like Edward R. Murrow and Walter Cronkite.

The Mental and Physical Toll of War Reporting

""Black Saturday"" also touches on an often-overlooked aspect of war correspondence: the mental health challenges faced by reporters in conflict zones. Yingst is candid about the difficulties of processing the traumatic events witnessed in the field while maintaining professional composure and meeting the demands of real-time reporting.

To cope with these challenges, Yingst emphasizes the importance of preparation. ""I am a big believer in preparing mentally and physically for war during times of peace,"" he says. His regimen includes daily gym visits, running, meditation, a healthy diet, and practices like cold exposure to maintain mental discipline.

The Future of Journalism

Yingst's approach to journalism represents a new paradigm in news reporting. By combining traditional journalistic values with innovative use of social media, he's creating a model for how reporters can engage with audiences in the digital age.

""I think you'll continue to see a shift in the industry as a whole, as social media gets more and more popular in the way that people consume videos changes,"" Yingst predicts. He envisions a future where audiences can curate their news diet across various platforms, from traditional TV broadcasts to streaming services and social media updates.

For aspiring journalists looking to follow in his footsteps, Yingst offers two key pieces of advice: set a long-term goal and put in consistent, disciplined work. ""Understand that I didn't have more than 400,000 X followers overnight. I've been on X for more than 10 years,"" he says, emphasizing the importance of persistence and hard work in building a following and credibility as a journalist.

As the media landscape continues to evolve, Trey Yingst stands as a prime example of how traditional journalism can adapt and thrive in the digital age. His innovative approach to reporting, commitment to ethical standards, and ability to connect with audiences across multiple platforms make him a true pioneer in the field of modern journalism."

Fateh Sherif was killed Monday in an airstrike on the al-Bass refugee camp in the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, along with his wife and children.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA) noted that Sherif had been on suspension with the organization since March but had not been fired.

""Fateh Al Sharif was an UNRWA employee who was put on administrative leave without pay in March and was undergoing an investigation following allegations that UNRWA received about his political activities,"" an UNRWA spokesperson said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

At the time, his suspension sparked widespread protests and strikes by teachers in Lebanon.

""Sherif was responsible for coordinating Hamas' terror activities in Lebanon with Hezbollah operatives. He was also responsible for Hamas' efforts in Lebanon to recruit operatives and acquire weapons,"" the Israel Defense Force (IDF) and Israeli Security Agency (ISA) said in a joint statement.

""He led the Hamas terrorist organization's force build-up efforts in Lebanon and operated to advance Hamas' interests in Lebanon, both politically and militarily.""

Israel alleges UNRWA is overrun with terrorist sympathizers, a claim the agency denies.

Sherif was the principal of the UNRWA-run Deir Yassin Secondary School in al-Bass and head of the UNRWA teachers' union, which has around 2,000 teachers.

""Through that position, and as principal of a large UNRWA school, he was able to recruit operatives, and to brainwash generations of Palestinians to engage in terrorism,"" Hillel Neuer, executive director of UN Watch, told Fox News Digital.

Neuer and his organization had long pushed U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and UNRWA chief Philippe Lazzarini to fire Sherif and said they provided both with a dossier proving his involvement in Hamas.

""Everyone at UNRWA knew. Yet they refused to act,"" Neuer said.

""Even as school principal al-Sharif openly incited terrorism on social media for over a decade, UNRWA did nothing. They failed to fire or even condemn their school principal for being a Hamas terror chief. Only this year, when there was intense scrutiny of UNRWA, did they finally slap him on the wrist with a suspension - while for months insisting that they were conducting 'an investigation.'""

The Sherif killing unfolded as another terrorist group, the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, said three of its leaders were killed in an airstrike that hit the upper floor of an apartment building in Beirut, according to Reuters.

Israeli officials said Monday they will ""continue to operate against anyone who poses a threat to the civilians of the State of Israel.""

Israel over the past few days has expanded its attacks on Iran-backed militant groups in the region, also killing Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in an airstrike over the weekend.

While it weighs a full-on ground offensive, the IDF has been launching small special forces operations in southern Lebanon.

An NPR investigation: A murder in Hebron,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/27/g-s1-17637/hebron-west-bank-israel-asylum-ahmad-abu-markhiya,2024-09-30T10:05:03Z,"Note: This story contains graphic descriptions of violence.

HEBRON, West Bank -- Around sunset on Oct. 5, 2022, two 24-year-old men drank tea on a terrace overlooking the hills of their ancient holy city. The evening ended with one of them decapitated and the other under arrest.

Palestinian law enforcement officers in Hebron, the largest Palestinian city in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, say they have witnessed many crime scenes, but never one with a severed head. The city's historical core -- a militarized zone with Palestinians, Israeli settlers and the tomb of the patriarch Abraham, revered by them both -- has seen some of the ugliest violence and injustices of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but that was not this story.

Images of the crime scene quickly spread on social media, as did the suspect's last name. A mall and butcher shop belonging to the suspect's extended family were vandalized. ""A horrific crime,"" read one Palestinian news headline. The Palestinian police called it a ""new type of crime to be seen in the Palestinian areas."" A Palestinian talk show asked the victim's cousin what happened. ""This thing,"" he said, ""cannot be discussed in the media.""

In Israel, news of the murder was reported very differently. ""Kidnapped to the Palestinian Authority territories and murdered because of his sexual orientation,"" read one Israeli report. ""A bloody reminder of the LGBTQ situation in the Palestinian Authority,"" read another.

Ahmad Abu Markhiya was among a rare group of Palestinians from the West Bank granted the temporary right to live in Israel: those deemed to face threats to their lives because they are gay.

His gruesome murder received international attention and then faded from headlines. During the Gaza war, it has come to light again. Pro-Israel campaigns have cited his killing as an example of Palestinian savagery. Pro-Palestinian advocates say Israel weaponizes gay rights to distract from its actions in Gaza.

A one-and-a-half-year NPR investigation into the life and murder of Abu Markhiya -- drawing from police files, court documents and more than 40 interviews in Israel and the West Bank -- reveals a far more complex web of circumstances surrounding the killing than has previously been reported.

This is the story of a man in search of home, caught between two societies that never fully granted him one. For some, his murder was to be weighed against the shame he caused in life. For others, his murder robbed him of the chance to extricate himself from a society that refused him dignity and freedom.

Our investigation traces the victim's escape from the West Bank to Israel, probes the mystery of what drew him back and identifies his accused killer for the first time. It also explores the parallel justice systems -- official and traditional -- that have examined his murder but have yet to resolve it.

Two years -- and one war -- later, justice remains deferred for Ahmad Abu Markhiya.

It was the spring of 2021, a year and a half before his murder, when Abu Markhiya sent a Facebook message asking for help.

Rita Petrenko answered it. At the time, she ran The Different House, an Israeli nonprofit organization advocating on behalf of LGBTQ+ Palestinians seeking safety in Israel. Homosexuality is largely shunned in Palestinian society. Palestinians contacted her to say they were fleeing life-threatening persecution from their families, and she helped them secure official papers to stay in Israel.

Abu Markhiya told her he had been on the run from city to city in the West Bank for more than a year, ever since his uncle caught him being intimate with another young man, and men in his family beat him. (His family denies it threatened him.)

He told Petrenko he fled to the streets of Hebron, then to the West Bank cities of Beitunia, Ramallah and Tulkarem, as men in his family pursued him. He told her a relative opened fire on his car, so he took the risk of slipping through Israel's network of concrete walls, wire fences and military checkpoints -- built after a wave of Palestinian bombings in Israel two decades ago and designed to control Palestinian entry into Israel. Then he slept in a Tel Aviv parking lot for two weeks.

In a previous life in her native Russia, Petrenko worked for the police, training dogs to detect clues at crime scenes, so she considered herself a good lie detector. She believed there were some Palestinians who pretended to be gay to seek asylum abroad -- and others who were indeed gay and fabricated threats from their family to gain access to Israel and live a freer life. But Abu Markhiya's story struck her as credible. It didn't seem likely he would suffer weeks on the streets to back up a false story. ""That's not a life worth making something up for,"" she said.

Palestinians and Israelis who knew him say there was no doubt he was gay.

Petrenko submitted Abu Markhiya's testimony to the Israeli defense unit that grants Palestinians permits, and officers summoned him to an interview at a military facility. They concluded that sending him back to the West Bank would put him at risk.

But Israel would not grant him permanent asylum as a Palestinian. Historically, Israel has granted non-Jews asylum only in rare cases. It is especially opposed to an influx of Palestinians. But over the years, Israel has taken in Palestinians who spied for Israeli security agencies and needed cover, and in the last few years, it has granted protection to a couple of hundred Palestinians facing threats to their lives in the West Bank because of their gender or sexuality.

Israel granted Abu Markhiya a temporary residency permit, on condition that he apply for resettlement abroad through the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. On June 1, 2021, Petrenko applied to the UNHCR on Abu Markhiya's behalf. She hoped Canada or Australia would accept him, as they had taken in Palestinian LGBTQ+ asylum-seekers in exceptional cases. But other categories of Palestinians seemed to be given priority, she said, like people with academic degrees and women facing immediate threats to their lives. (The UNHCR said it does not comment on individual resettlement requests.)

While Abu Markhiya waited for an answer, he lived in at-risk-youth shelters and worked restaurant jobs illegally. At the time, Israel would not grant LGBTQ+ Palestinians work permits or health care. Given their tenuous status, many gay Palestinian asylum-seekers were coerced by their circumstances into sex work. Israeli welfare programs offered them -- including Abu Markhiya -- housing and rehabilitation programs to escape sexual exploitation, said Asma Alssaad, one of his shelter counselors.

In Israel, Abu Markhiya chose the nickname Esso. Alssaad said it was Arabic for Esau, the grandson of Abraham in Islamic and Jewish tradition. ""Many young Palestinians who escape to Israel choose an alias for themselves. It serves the purpose of dividing between the life they used to have in the West Bank and the life they have in Israel. Of course, it's also for reasons of confidentiality,"" Alssaad said.

Israeli shelter volunteers said Abu Markhiya was more mature than other young residents. He was clean-shaven and well-groomed, and he kept his locker organized.

He had plans for his future.

""To rent a house with a friend. To be loved,"" said Maiyan Price Zohar, 28, his primary Israeli counselor at the shelter. ""He wanted to live.""

In the summer of 2022, an Israeli Supreme Court petition by human rights groups prompted Israel to grant work rights and health care to LGBTQ+ Palestinians with Israeli permits. By then, Abu Markhiya had been in Israel for a year. Israeli defense officials renewed his permit but sought answers from the UNHCR: How much longer would it take to resettle him abroad?

In late August 2022, Petrenko asked the UNHCR to expedite Abu Markhiya's request for resettlement. Out of all the Palestinians she represented, he had waited the longest. He was receiving threatening calls and was eager to move abroad.

Weeks later, Abu Markhiya was dead.

The day after his murder, his community of gay Palestinian asylum-seekers and their Israeli advocates held a small memorial ceremony in Tel Aviv. They lit candles arrayed to spell out his name, Ahmad, in Hebrew.

His counselors and friends at the shelter were distraught: How did he disappear from Israel to the Palestinian city of Hebron? They were certain he would have never gone willingly to the same city where he was under threat.

Many were convinced he was kidnapped or lured there, and all were convinced his killing was an anti-gay attack. But the Israeli police did not contact them to seek their testimony. They heard no word about any formal investigation, nor did they expect to. His Israeli counselors didn't think Israeli police would care about a murder of a Palestinian in the Palestinian territories, and they didn't think Palestinian police would bother to investigate the murder of a gay man.

""It's a black hole,"" said Ofir Zweigenbom, one of Abu Markhiya's Israeli counselors.

In the twilight zone between Abu Markhiya's conditional life in Israel and gruesome death in the West Bank, they thought there would never be answers.

What his supporters in Israel did not know was that the chief Palestinian prosecutor of Hebron was pressing charges against the suspected murderer.

In a gleaming new limestone courthouse funded by the Canadian government, Nashat Ayoush sat at a large desk dressed in a white shirt and tie, in front of framed photos of the late Palestinian Authority leader Yasser Arafat and the current leader, Mahmoud Abbas.

Ayoush had spent his entire career in the Palestinian state prosecutor's office, part of the civil justice system set up in the 1990s, as Palestinians built the institutions they hoped would eventually form the core of a country independent from Israel.

He collected all the details of Abu Markhiya's murder -- witness testimony, the autopsy and a photo of the 24-year-old defendant taken shortly after his arrest -- in an orange file folder held together by a black cord, Criminal File 2725/2022.

The evening of the murder, according to a copy of the indictment obtained by NPR, a family of four heard a commotion outside the old stone house they were renting in Hebron. ""When they looked out of their window, a few meters from the crime scene, they saw the suspect stabbing the victim with a knife in his neck and then dragging him,"" the indictment says.

They called their landlord, Mohammed Abu Eisheh, a respected dentist who lived in a stately house next door. He rushed home from his dental clinic downtown and alerted police, who arrived moments later. They found a young man standing under an oak tree next to a decapitated body. ""Upon seeing the police, he attempted to flee but was arrested, his hands and clothes stained with blood,"" the indictment says.

It was the dentist's son, Anas Abu Eisheh. The crime took place in his backyard. ""We caught him red-handed,"" Ayoush said.

A trail of blood ran from a storage room attached to the stone house, where the victim was killed, to the side of a hill under the oak tree some 20 yards away, where Anas Abu Eisheh had dragged the body and tried to hide it, according to the indictment.

The cause of death, according to the autopsy report reviewed by NPR, was 10 stab wounds to the chest and lower neck. Only after he died had he been beheaded.

""It was a shock for us,"" Ayoush said.

As news reports spread about a gay Palestinian murder case in Hebron, officials from the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights raised the case with Ayoush, and a U.S. diplomat inquired with the Palestinian Authority's attorney general. The Palestinian Authority has long been scrutinized for lax prosecution of family violence against women and girls. A gruesome anti-LGBTQ+ killing would be a stain on the Palestinian leadership, which was reliant on international support.

""We explained to them that our investigations did not indicate any link between his being gay and the murder,"" Ayoush said. In fact, Ayoush said, the question of the victim's sexuality never came up in the Palestinian police interrogations, despite all the press reports alleging Abu Markhiya had faced anti-gay threats in the West Bank. Homosexuality is taboo in the West Bank's traditional Palestinian society, but it is not outlawed, he told us repeatedly.

Documented anti-gay killings are rare in the West Bank. LGBTQ+ advocates say some killings are framed as accidents. Others are shrouded in accusations of treason. Six months after Abu Markhiya's murder, a 23-year-old Palestinian was killed by militants who accused him of spying for Israel. In a purported confession video, he claimed Israeli agents blackmailed him with video footage of him having sex with another man.

In 2014, an anonymous group of former Israeli intelligence officers said they were instructed to extort gay Palestinians to spy for Israel or be exposed.

In 2019, after years of quiet activism, the Palestinian queer group alQaws staged a public demonstration in Haifa, a city in Israel with a large progressive Arab community, to protest the stabbing of a gay teenage Palestinian citizen of Israel. Weeks later, Palestinian police banned the queer group from holding events in the West Bank, saying it violated Palestinian values.

The Palestinian activist community saw this public struggle as progress; there were other countries in the region that had no queer organizing at all.

But then the community faced a setback in the months before Abu Markhiya's murder. Vigilantes in the West Bank attacked a venue hosting an openly gay Palestinian singer and disrupted a march perceived to be associated with the gay community. Palestinian police failed to prosecute the suspects. The Palestinian LGBTQ+ activist community has maintained a low profile ever since. No queer organization in the West Bank issued a statement about Abu Markhiya's murder.

The chairman of the Palestinian Psychiatric Association, Dr. Tawfiq Salman, has counseled West Bank families whose children have come out as gay in recent years. ""I'm convincing the families how to accept their sons, their daughters, as they are,"" he said. ""They have to deal without violence."" He said one client said he was moving his family to the U.S. to protect his gay son from repercussions from his community.

In our conversations with Abu Eisheh, he did not deny his son Anas, a law student at Hebron University, killed Abu Markhiya. But he said the killing had nothing to do with homosexuality. He said that his son, a longtime friend of Abu Markhiya, was mentally ill -- and that Abu Markhiya was to blame.

A few years prior, he said, Abu Markhiya had given Anas drugs, which he claimed induced schizophrenia that his son was treated for with antipsychotics. Abu Eisheh said his son began engaging in violent outbursts against his family. He believes on the day of the murder, Abu Markhiya gave his son an illegal substance that interacted with his medicines, triggering a psychotic episode that resulted in the gruesome crime. His son told investigators he had no recollection of the killing.

NPR was unable to verify that Anas was being treated for mental illness at the time of the crime. Abu Eisheh provided two psychiatric reports citing his son's aggressive behavior and religious delusions about resembling an Islamic messianic figure, but one document was dated three years before the killing and the other, written at the request of the family, was dated three days after the murder.

Salman, the psychiatric association chairman, said some Palestinian murder suspects' families claim mental illness to protect the family's reputation and prevent revenge killings. Ayoush, the Hebron prosecutor, said the suspect's motive in this murder case was irrelevant.

""We have sufficient proof against him. ... We are not obliged by Palestinian law to search for the motive,"" Ayoush said. He said he was treating the case like any other. That was the essence of justice he was hoping to prove the Palestinian government would be able to pursue.

On March 29, 2023, the Palestinian public prosecutor charged Anas Abu Eisheh with premeditated murder. The prosecutor said it was a crime punishable by life imprisonment.

NPR attended a hearing at the Hebron First Instance Court on Sept. 6, 2023, five months into the proceedings. The courtroom was covered in sleek wooden paneling, and the judge sat high atop a raised bench. The mood was tense: Guards were spread throughout the room, separating the defendant's brother and the victim's cousin.

Abu Eisheh, handcuffed and flanked by more guards, was ushered into the defendant's glass cage. He stood tall and appeared attentive but showed no emotion. In a raised voice, the counsel for the prosecution read the charge against him.

Earlier that year, the defendant had been transferred from detention in Hebron to a Bethlehem psychiatric hospital for an examination. The judge had requested a psychiatric evaluation as to whether the defendant was aware of his actions at the time of the crime. The judge read aloud the hospital's response: It was inconclusive. The judge ordered the hospital to conduct a repeat psychiatric evaluation, and court was adjourned.

Outside the walls of the courthouse, a different kind of justice was being pursued.

Sheikh Walid Tawil sat in his downtown Hebron office wearing a brown shawl with gold embroidered trim, a red-and-white-checked keffiyeh headscarf and a thick gold and silver watch. In his hands he held a chunky chain of shiny wooden prayer beads. He is a member of the Tawil tribe, one of 176 tribes or family clans present in Hebron. The 52-year-old sheikh leads an ultrareligious Islamic life -- four wives, 20 children -- and is a central figure in a parallel justice system of community reconciliation called sulh.

The tradition, practiced since before the creation of modern Palestinian criminal courts, centers on the asha'er, the family clans that play powerful roles in Palestinian society. Crimes between individuals become disputes between families. The goal is to prevent retaliation, assign responsibility, restore civil peace and reintroduce the offending family back into society.

Four days after Abu Markhiya's murder, Tawil presided over a large mediation ceremony as the representative of the defendant's family. Another sheikh, Fayez Al-Rajabi, represented the victim's family.

The two men brokered the traditional one-year atwa -- a written admission of guilt and a truce to prevent a blood feud between the families. The defendant's family paid the victim's family the standard compensation of 100,000 Jordanian dinars, the equivalent of about $141,000 -- a sum pegged to the currency of Jordan, which ruled the West Bank before Israel occupied it. The two families agreed to hold negotiations to determine whether the victim's family was owed any more money, in order to reach a final reconciliation before the truce expired a year later on Oct. 9, 2023.

Unlike the Palestinian civil justice system, which played down the question of homosexuality in this murder case, the traditional system appeared to place it front and center.

""Gays have no rights in society, religion or family,"" Tawil told us. The Quran condemns sex between men, according to traditional readings of the text, and some sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad prescribe the death penalty for it, but Islamic scholars have debated the topic for centuries.

Tawil was not suggesting that Abu Markhiya was killed because of his sexuality. But proving that he was gay would be a mitigating circumstance for the perpetrator. It could compel the victim's family to drop any further demands for financial compensation and to reach a final resolution.

""We are an Islamic society in Hebron,"" the sheikh said. ""If the victim has a bad reputation, the reconciliation fee is less.""

Both Palestinian justice systems, official and traditional, seek to avoid strife between family clans. A compromise between the families is preferable. Whatever the families decide in the traditional arbitration process affects the sentencing in the official criminal case. With a homicide, a family reconciliation agreement can reduce a prison sentence by a third, according to Ayoush, the prosecutor.

The first time we met, Abu Eisheh, the defendant's father, welcomed us into his dental clinic in downtown Hebron. He sat behind his desk wearing blue scrubs. The wall next to him was covered in diplomas and certificates.

He did not condone the murder. But it was a family feud to resolve, and rumors about the victim's sexuality gave the defendant's family the advantage.

""When the event took place, everyone denounced it and were very upset with the event, with Anas,"" his father said.

That changed when the Israeli media reported that Abu Markhiya was a gay asylum-seeker.

""The Israeli media provided us with a free service and broadcasted videos and broadcasted reports that the boy was gay. Within 24 hours ... the entire public opinion flipped from being against Anas to being with Anas. The pressure let up on us a lot, as a family,"" Abu Eisheh said.

He let out a small laugh.

""If we prove that Ahmad is gay, the problem will resolve more easily,"" Abu Eisheh explained. He said the victim's family ""will try to finish the issue quickly because this would be considered a shame for the family.""

On the outskirts of Hebron, on the side of a scraggly mound and up a set of exposed concrete steps, is the small home of Awatef Abu Markhiya, Ahmad Abu Markhiya's mother. His father died some years ago, and she remarried. She has the same angular jaw and almond-shaped eyes as her late son.

Her family advised her not to speak about her son's murder. Whatever she said could prejudice the reconciliation negotiations.

""Ahmad had a very, very good heart,"" she said. She cried, describing a beloved son, and repeatedly denied he was gay.

""We know he was not gay,"" Al-Rajabi, the Abu Markhiya family's arbitrator in the mediation, told us. ""We don't have homosexuality in Hebron. This is Abraham's city.""

Why did Abu Markhiya return to the city he had fled?

""I know the whole story from the beginning to the end,"" a man in his early 20s from Hebron told NPR in the summer of 2023.

This young man was both a friend of the victim and a relative of the defendant. He spoke on condition of anonymity because he is also gay and had run away from home after the murder, afraid of being targeted for his sexuality.

He said Abu Markhiya had been haunted by a case of blackmail from the time he fled to Israel until the end of his life.

He said there was a man in Hebron who had pursued Abu Markhiya for sex and threatened to release an intimate photo of him. Abu Markhiya knew the man personally and complained to the police three weeks before fleeing to Israel, and he filed an additional complaint against the alleged blackmailer several months later, according to police records reviewed by NPR.

In a phone interview with NPR, the alleged blackmailer, whom NPR is not naming due to possible repercussions against him given the intense taboos in the West Bank against homosexuality, said he was detained and denied the allegations, and he said that his family convinced Abu Markhiya to withdraw the complaint a few weeks before his murder.

Abu Markhiya arrived in Hebron. His family said that he was there to seek Palestinian health insurance coverage for a work-related injury (at the time, it was still difficult for gay Palestinian asylum-seekers to access Israeli health care) and that he intended to withdraw his police complaint (though the Hebron prosecutor's office said he did not end up withdrawing it). He told his family he needed to settle his affairs because he planned to move abroad. His advocate in Israel -- Rita Petrenko -- had asked the U.N. to expedite his resettlement request.

Hours before the murder, the young man said he saw Abu Markhiya: He had gotten a haircut in downtown Hebron. Then he went to meet Abu Eisheh.

The young man said that Abu Eisheh had also been pursuing Abu Markhiya, wanting to be in an intimate relationship together and promising to protect him, but that Abu Markhiya refused.

It remains unclear why the two met that evening and what compelled the killer to murder and behead Abu Markhiya. The accused killer's family denies that Abu Eisheh is gay or that his relationship to the victim was more than just friendship.

But what compelled Abu Markhiya to return to the city he had escaped appears to have been the hope of tying up loose ends and getting a fresh start.

On Oct. 7, 2023, almost exactly one year after Abu Markhiya's murder, Hamas carried out the deadliest single attack on Israelis in history, and Israel began its deadliest Gaza offensive in history.

In the global debate over the Gaza war, LGBTQ+ rights have taken center stage. Groups like Queers for Palestine have been a fixture at anti-war rallies, accusing Israel of embracing gay rights to ""pinkwash"" war crimes.

Israel's advocates have fired back, criticizing queer protesters for condemning Israel rather than Hamas Islamists, who reject gay rights. ""Some of these protesters hold up signs proclaiming gays for Gaza,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu told a joint meeting of U.S. Congress in July. ""They might as well hold up signs saying 'Chickens for KFC.'""

Abu Markhiya's story has been resurrected in this firestorm by pro-Israel campaigns online. One of them, Queer in Gaza, cites his killing and states: ""Protect LGBT Palestinians. Only Israel does.""

During the war, Israel revoked all Palestinians' permits in Israel, citing security concerns. In a survey of 73 Palestinian LGBTQ+ asylum-seekers, conducted three months into the war by the Association for LGBTQ Equality in Israel, most said they lost their jobs, were assaulted and were arrested. Some said they were also deported to the West Bank. Human rights groups intervened, and Israel reversed the deportations of protected LGBTQ+ Palestinians.

The war also brought sweeping Israeli crackdowns to the West Bank, putting the Abu Markhiya murder proceedings into a deep freeze.

About six months had passed since Abu Eisheh was charged with premediated murder for the killing and beheading of Abu Markhiya. Ayoush, the Hebron prosecutor heading up the case, could not reach his own courthouse for a month due to Israeli roadblocks. (He was later reassigned to another role in the justice system and is no longer on the case.) Lawyers were kept waiting hours at Israeli checkpoints when traveling from one city to another. The Palestinian Bar Association went on strike for six months due to the movement restrictions. Neither the accused murderer nor his lawyer appeared at court hearings during that time.

The court proceedings are still dragging on, with no progress a year and a half after they began. Abu Eisheh remains in a Hebron detention center, where he is allowed weekly family visits. Whether due to a high sensitivity around this murder, incompetence, indifference or some other reason, the Bethlehem psychiatric hospital has not heeded repeated court requests to submit an evaluation of the defendant and whether he is fit to stand trial. In May, the director of the hospital told NPR, ""We will contact the court soon.""

To this day, it has not submitted its evaluation.

While the official West Bank criminal justice system was paralyzed at the start of the Gaza war, the traditional justice system thrived. Fresh tragedies sidelined older ones, and families resolved pending disputes. The war offered an opportunity to put the Abu Markhiya murder case to rest as well.

The atwa, the truce between the Abu Markhiya and Abu Eisheh families, had expired on Oct. 9, 2023, two days into the war. On Oct. 16, the Abu Eisheh family paid a visit to the Abu Markhiya family home. They asked the victim's family to reconcile, but the victim's family demanded more money as compensation for the murder. The two sides agreed to convene a council of city dignitaries to reach a final reconciliation, saq al-sulh, by January 2024.

That committee has never convened.

Sheikh Tawil, the Abu Eisheh family's arbitrator, was not concerned. He was confident the Abu Markhiya family would not seek revenge or more money. He was convinced by the documents attesting to the defendant's mental illness, and he held up his phone to show us Israeli news articles that identified the victim as gay and photos of the memorial candles in Tel Aviv spelling out his name, Ahmad, in Hebrew.

""This of course in our society is completely forbidden. We cannot allow any homosexual person to have any kind of rights in society,"" he said.

The arbitrator for the Abu Markhiya family insists the case remains unsettled. But convening a council of city dignitaries would only resurface the central question of the unresolved case -- whether Abu Markhiya was gay. Answering that question could risk the family's reputation by association. It also would weaken the family's ability to make further claims for accountability for their son's murder.

By this logic, in Hebron's communal justice system, the scales are now balanced.

""Ahmad deserves accountability and he deserves dignity,"" said Sa'ed Atshan, an associate professor at Swarthmore College and a Palestinian LGBTQ+ human rights advocate who authored a book on queer Palestinians and has been following the murder case. ""What a travesty. He was so close to freedom.""

One spring evening, several months into the war, Abu Eisheh walked across his rocky backyard to the old stone house where the murder took place. An Israeli warplane rumbled in the sky; Hebron is a short distance from Gaza.

It was sunset, around the same time his son drank tea with Abu Markhiya on the terrace before the stabbing. From there, the young men had looked out onto an expansive view of the hilly city.

On the horizon were the onion domes of Hebron's Russian Orthodox church, the city's only surviving church. Thousands of years ago, according to tradition, the patriarch Abraham came to the city and pitched his tent near an oak tree that still stands on the church grounds.

A much younger oak tree marks the spot where the victim's head and body were found. He was buried in the center of Hebron, not far from the tomb of Abraham.

Nearly two years have passed since Ahmad Abu Markhiya was killed. His mother, Awatef, still denies he was gay. She still does not know why he was killed or whether the murder case will ever be laid to rest. She prays for justice of a different kind."
An airstrike hits a Beirut residential building as Israel expands attacks in Lebanon,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/g-s1-25396/israel-beirut-lebanon-hezbollah,2024-09-30T07:30:35Z,"JERUSALEM -- The first apparent Israeli airstrike on central Beirut in nearly a year of conflict leveled an apartment building early Monday. It came after Israel hit targets across Lebanon and killed dozens of people, as Hezbollah sustained heavy blows to its command structure, including the killing of its leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

The airstrike hit a multistory residential building, according to an Associated Press journalist at the scene. Videos showed ambulances and a crowd gathered near the building in a mainly Sunni district with a busy thoroughfare lined with shops.

A Palestinian leftist faction in Lebanon said three of its members were killed in the airstrike. The Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine said in a statement early Monday that its military and security commanders in Lebanon, and a third member, were killed in the attack.

The group has not played a significant role in the ongoing conflict between Israel and the Shiite militant group Hezbollah.

An official with Lebanon's Civil Defense had earlier said that a member of the al-Jamaa al-Islamiya was killed in the strike and that 16 other people were wounded, but the Sunni militant group, which fights alongside Hezbollah, has not confirmed the death of any of its members.

Also early Monday, another strike killed a commander with the militant group Hamas, which has a presence in Lebanon's Palestinian refugee camps. Hamas said Fatah Sharif and his family were killed in an airstrike on the Al-Buss refugee camp in the southern port city of Tyre.

In the past week, Israel has frequently targeted Beirut's southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence -- including a major strike on Friday that killed Nasrallah -- but had not hit locations near the city center.

Israeli officials had no immediate comment.

Earlier, Hezbollah confirmed that Nabil Kaouk, the deputy head of its Central Council, was killed Saturday, making him the seventh senior Hezbollah leader killed in Israeli strikes in a little over a week. They include the group's founding members who had evaded death or detention for decades.

Hezbollah also confirmed that Ali Karaki, another senior commander, died in the strike that killed Nasrallah. Israel says at least 20 other Hezbollah militants were killed, including one in charge of Nasrallah's security detail.

The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 105 people were killed around the country in airstrikes Sunday. Two strikes near the southern city of Sidon, about 45 kilometers (28 miles) south of Beirut, killed at least 32 people, the ministry said. Separately, Israeli strikes in the northern province of Baalbek Hermel killed 21 people and wounded at least 47.

Lebanese media reported dozens of strikes in the central, eastern and western Bekaa and in the south, besides strikes on Beirut. Israel says it targets militants, but the strikes have hit buildings where civilians were living and the death toll was expected to rise.

In a video of a strike in Sidon, verified by the AP, a building swayed before collapsing as neighbors filmed. One TV station called on viewers to pray for a family caught under the rubble, posting their pictures, as rescuers failed to reach them. The Lebanese Health Ministry reported at least 14 medics were killed over two days in the south.

President Joe Biden said Sunday that he would speak soon with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and believes that an all-out war in the Middle East must be avoided. ""It has to be,"" Biden told reporters at Dover Air Force Base in Delaware as he boarded Air Force One for Washington.

Meanwhile, wreckage from Friday's strike that killed Nasrallah was still smoldering. Smoke rose over the rubble as people flocked to the site, some to check on what was left of their homes and others to pay respects, pray or simply to see the destruction.

In response to the dramatic escalation in Israeli strikes on Lebanon, Hezbollah significantly increased its rocket attacks in the past week, from several dozen to several hundred daily, the Israeli military said. The attacks injured several people and caused damage, but most of the rockets and drones were intercepted by Israel's air defense systems or fell in open areas.

The army says its strikes have degraded Hezbollah's capabilities and the number of launches would be much higher if Hezbollah had not been hit.

Also on Sunday, the Israeli military said dozens of its aircraft struck Houthi targets in Yemen in response to a recent attack. The military said it targeted power plants and sea port facilities in the city of Hodeida.

The Houthis launched a ballistic missile attack toward Israel's Ben Gurion airport on Saturday when Netanyahu was arriving. The Houthi media office said the Israeli strikes hit the Hodeida and Rass Issa ports, along with two power plants in Hodeida city, a stronghold for the Iranian-backed rebels. The Houthi-run Health Ministry said the strikes killed four people and wounded 40 others.

The Houthis claimed they took precautionary measures ahead of the strikes, emptying oil stored in the ports, according to Nasruddin Ammer, deputy director of the Houthi media office. He said in a post on X that the strikes won't stop the rebels' attacks on shipping routes and on Israel.

Meanwhile, White House national security spokesman John Kirby said Israel's airstrikes in Lebanon had ""wiped out"" Hezbollah's command structure, but he warned the group will work quickly to rebuild it.

""I think people are safer without him walking around,"" Kirby said of Nasrallah. ""But they will try to recover. We're watching to see what they do to try to fill this leadership vacuum. It's going to be tough. ... Much of their command structure has now been wiped out.""

Speaking on CNN's ""State of the Union,"" Kirby sidestepped questions about whether the Biden administration agrees with how the Israelis are targeting Hezbollah leaders. The White House continues to call on Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a 21-day temporary cease-fire floated by the U.S., France and other countries during the U.N. General Assembly last week.

A wave of Israeli airstrikes across large parts of Lebanon have killed more than 1,030 people -- including 156 women and 87 children -- in less than two weeks, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry.

Hundreds of thousands of people have been driven from their homes. The government estimates around 250,000 are in shelters, with three to four times as many staying with friends or relatives, or camping out on the streets.

Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group and political party backed by Iran, Israel's chief regional rival, rose to regional prominence after fighting a devastating monthlong war with Israel in 2006 that ended in a draw.

Kaouk was a veteran member of Hezbollah going back to the 1980s and served as Hezbollah's military commander in southern Lebanon during the 2006 war with Israel. The United States announced sanctions against him in 2020.

Hezbollah began firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. Hezbollah and Hamas are allies that consider themselves part of an Iran-backed ""Axis of Resistance"" against Israel.

The conflict has steadily ratcheted up to the brink of all-out war, raising fears of a region-wide conflagration.

Israel says it is determined to return some 60,000 of its citizens to communities in the north that were evacuated nearly a year ago. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its rocket fire if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which has proven elusive despite months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas led by the United States, Qatar and Egypt."
Writer Ta-Nehisi Coates returns to nonfiction with his essay collection 'The Message',NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/nx-s1-5043643/writer-ta-nehisi-coates-returns-to-nonfiction-with-his-essay-collection-the-message,2024-09-29T23:46:37Z,"NPR's Ayesha Rascoe asks Ta-Nehisi Coates about his new collection of three essays, ""The Message."" It is Coates' return to nonfiction after nearly a decade.

Ta-Nehisi Coates is no stranger to tackling fraught topics. A decade ago, his article in The Atlantic titled ""The Case For Reparations"" spurred a national conversation about compensating African Americans. His goal, he says, was to get people to stop laughing about the idea and start talking. He followed up a year later with a book called ""Between The World And Me,"" an exploration of his own history and the realities of being Black in the U.S. History is complicated, Ta-Nehisi Coates says, and so in his new book, ""The Message,"" he takes on the stories that we tell and that others tell about three places - the Middle East, the American South, and Africa. His journey begins with travel to Goree Island just off the coast of Senegal, to the Door of No Return, a memorial to the victims of the Atlantic slave trade. Coates says that place and that portal, which legend says enslaved people pass through to be shipped to the new world left him speechless, and that in the end, he rejects romantic notions that Black people's worth is based on potential royal ancestry, snatched from dignity into slavery.

TA-NEHISI COATES: To base your self-worth as a people, to base your self-esteem on being Black or being part of the African diaspora or part of the Black diaspora, on the same metrics of the people that enslaved you, is a mistake. So all of this conversation about who we are the descendants of, our need to put ourselves in the shoes of people that did, quote-unquote, ""great things"" or made great, you know, works, is to, in fact, to repeat the mistake.

RASCOE: What is it, though? Because I think it is so complicated as a Black American born in this country to go to Africa. I haven't been, but I know people will feel a connection. And I'm sure you've heard of the diaspora wars. You know this. There are Black Americans who say, I'm not African. I've never been there. That's not me. How do you reckon with all that? And what is Africa to you?

COATES: I can't make anybody feel a certain kind of way. And I wouldn't ask anybody. If you don't know feel a connection in Africa, that's certainly, you know, your right. I didn't go there looking for acceptance necessarily from Africans...

COATES: Well, maybe kinship, but not necessarily acceptance.

COATES: But, you know, I didn't show up, you know, like, break out the drums for me and say, welcome home, brother. You know, I didn't need that. This is the site of my creation as an African American. My great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandmothers were taken from this place on the water, and then in the plantations of this country here, we were genocided and created into a new people. But the process begins there. The great epic that I rooted myself in, the great Black American epic, the great Black diasporic epic - I was at the origin point. That was deeply moving.

RASCOE: You also go to South Carolina. You talk about a teacher who risked her job to keep teaching your book ""Between The World And Me."" And this is where you get into book bans and censorship. But you say in one passage that much of the hoopla about book bans and censorship gets it wrong. What do we get wrong?

COATES: I think the first thing I would say off the top is that I as the writer and the author of the book, I am not the victim.

RASCOE: You don't take it personally. It's not - you are not being victimized.

COATES: I don't. But I'm also not the person who's going to suffer. My personal offense and to make it about me misses the point. The people that are really hurt are the children and the students there. They're not necessarily hurt because they need to be exposed to my voice or my books, or they need to adopt my politics or my particular view of the world. But I know that the seat of me as a writer is so much varied literature in terms of its type and genre, and what all of that literature had in common was to open the world for me, and to say that I was free to find my own politics, my own views, my own future, I did not necessarily have to even believe everything that was said within my own house.

RASCOE: Is there a reason why you think writing catches it more than even other...

RASCOE: ...You would think with the internet and all these things, that would be much more dangerous...

RASCOE: No, the writing is extremely dangerous. And the books in particular are very dangerous. In fact, I think the people who are in favor of book bans understand the power of books much, much better than those that oppose them. Books are intimate. It's a one-on-one connection. So that kid in South Carolina, that 15-year-old, 16-year-old kid is taking ""Between The World And Me"" or whatever other book they're reading - they're taking it into their bedroom, and they're having a connection with them that nobody else can actually perceive. Even if you took the book from the kid and read it yourself, you would still not have the same interaction because the way books work is they are necessarily a union between the imagination of the reader and the words that are on the page.

RASCOE: The longest essay in the book is on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Why did you choose to delve into this topic, which is one of the most, if not the most, fraught topic of public discourse today?

COATES: Well, the fact was probably my most celebrated work of journalism is ""The Case For Reparations."" That essay has a section in which it talks about reparations from the state of Germany to the state of Israel as recompense for the survivors of the Holocaust or those fleeing the Holocaust, in fact, fleeing Nazi Germany's existential violence to Israel. And I was roundly and sometimes loudly critiqued for using that as an example.

RASCOE: What was the criticism that you faced for that?

COATES: The criticism was that German reparations had been paid to build a project that necessarily was taking the land from other people, and itself was perpetrating another atrocity. What I wanted to do was I wanted to see that firsthand myself. I wanted to read as much as I could about it within the time I had to get this book done. I wanted to spend as much time as I could out of the three chapters in the book. One of the reasons why that's as long as it is because it's the place that I spent the most time. It's the place I talked to the most people. I felt the responsibility to take that criticism as seriously as I could.

RASCOE: In the essay, you draw parallels to the Jim Crow South with the treatment of Palestinians. And you also say that people say this issue is so complicated, and you say it is not complicated.

COATES: Well, the first thing I will say is history is always complicated. Stories are always complicated. What I saw over there was not especially complicated. It was not any more complicated than American history. Look, I am the descendant and the child of people born into Jim Crow America. When I step into a city like old Hebron, and a man stops me, a man young enough to be my son, with a gun that looks like it's about half his body weight - if I'm walking with a guy whose family has lived in that old city from time immemorial, for generation after generation, and that soldier tells me, I can walk down the street, but he can't, that evokes certain things in me. When I'm around a group of people who have been denied any real ability to determine their fate because of who they are, by which I mean the ability to vote, I can't look at that and say, that's complicated. That's not complicated to me, not with my background.

RASCOE: It doesn't sound like it, but did you have any pause about taking this on? You could have looked at this and said, this is not my conflict. This is not my fight.

COATES: I did. I did, I did. But every single fighter jet that drops a bomb in Gaza is of American providence. This is ours. You know, I think it's irresponsible as an American to say that this isn't really my struggle while your tax dollars undergird this war. I don't think that's an option.

RASCOE: Yes. It criticizes you for, quote, ""refusing to countenance conversations with Jews who don't share his opinions and don't denounce their nation."" How would you respond to that?

COATES: I would respond to that by pointing out that I've spent the vast majority of my career around people, be they Jewish or not, who were very much believers in the dream and the idea of Israel and the Israeli project. That is the waters of journalism that I swam in. That's how that example ended up in ""The Case For Reparations"" in the first place.

RASCOE: Some may hear that and think, like, is the contention that Jewish people control the media or things of that nature - can you clarify what you meant by the representation?

COATES: I meant exactly what I said. I would like to know the number of Palestinians that are working at a major bureau for a major outlet, be that TV, newspaper, magazines. I would like to know the number of Palestinians specifically.

COATES: Who are covering the West Bank, who are covering Israel, who are covering this conflict, as we call it. I would like to know that. I don't necessarily need the numbers of anybody else. I need the numbers of Palestinians.

COATES: Well, here's what I would say. I am here talking about this book as a Black writer. And I'm being interviewed by Black journalists. There is a kind of conversation that you and I can have that is very, very different than the conversation that somebody who doesn't have that experience has. That doesn't mean I'm not going to talk to anybody else. That doesn't mean I shouldn't talk to anybody else. It just means that there is a certain perspective. I think we recognize that across journalism. I think we would say if The New York Times did not have any Black people covering race in this country - I think we would say that's a problem. I am asking that we export that same standard to Israel, to Palestine, to the Jerusalem Bureau.

RASCOE: What would you say to those who I am sure listening to this, who will be concerned, who will say, look, I love ""Between The World And Me."" But on this, I think this could lead to antisemitism. This has gone too far. What do you say to those?

COATES: Not much. I'd say, well, if that's how you feel, that's how you feel. I can't really influence that. You have to do what you have to do. As a writer, what I have to do is I have to be able to look at myself in the mirror and be OK. I got to be able to wake up in the morning and say, I feel like I did the right thing. Folks who feel that it's doing something else and that, you know, it offends their particular politics. I'm sorry, but I have to do what I have to do, and I have to say what I have to say.

RASCOE: That's Ta-Nehisi Coates. He is the author of ""The Message."" Thank you so much for joining us.

Flashback: Biden admin bragged about 'quieter' Middle East one week before attack on Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/flashback-biden-admin-bragged-about-quieter-middle-east-one-week-before-attack-israel,2024-09-29T18:10:55Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

One year ago, Biden administration national security adviser Jake Sullivan praised the administration's success at keeping the peace in the Middle East just one week before the Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.

""The Middle East region is quieter today than it has been in two decades"" Sullivan said during a Sept. 29, 2023, appearance at the Atlantic Festival.

At the time, Sullivan pointed to a list of positive developments in the Middle East, including a truce in Yemen, a decrease in Iranian attacks on U.S. troops, and a ""stable"" Iraq.

ISRAEL-HEZBOLLAH WAR: NETANYAHU 'DID NOT EVEN RESPOND' TO US CEASE-FIRE DEAL, PLEDGES TO FIGHT 'FULL FORCE'

But just one week later, Iranian-backed Hamas launched a terrorist attack against Israel, with the militant group firing rockets at the Jewish state while thousands of militants breached the Gaza-Israel barrier and attacked Israeli civilians.

The attack resulted in over 1,100 deaths, over 250 people taken hostage, and sparked the ongoing conflict between Israel and the militant group.

The Biden administration has attempted to grapple with the conflict ever since, weighing the concerns of some wings of the Democratic Party more sympathetic to Palestinians while continuing to show support for longtime ally Israel.

HOW A US-BACKED UN RESOLUTION FAILED TO STOP HEZBOLLAH TERROR TAKEOVER: 'BIPARTISAN FAILURE'

Meanwhile, Iran has vowed retaliation for multiple Israeli strikes in Lebanon, one of which reportedly killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and spread greater turmoil throughout the region as the administration attempted to call for a three-week cease-fire to head off a potential all-out conflict.

Those tensions with Iran have caused Sullivan to backtrack on some of that optimism from last year, acknowledging fears over escalating tensions in the region while still expressing optimism about a potential resolution to the almost year-old conflict.

""While the risk of escalation is real, we actually believe there is also a distinct avenue to getting to a cessation of hostilities and a durable solution that makes people on both sides of the border feel secure,"" Sullivan said last week, according to a report in Reuters.

The White House did not immediately respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment."

Israel's assassination of Hassan Nasrallah -- who led Hezbollah for more than 30 years -- has been met with mixed reactions in the region. In Israel, there have been celebrations, even as people prepare for the possibility of retaliation. In Ramallah, in the West Bank, streets filled with Palestinians chanting promises to continue resistance against Israel. Nasrallah's death raises questions about who will fill a power void at the top of what the US considers a terrorist organization.

Opinion | Israel bombed my home as a result of my journalism. This can't become our new normal.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israels-closure-al-jazeeras-ramallah-office-sends-chilling-message-rcna172845,2024-09-29T14:11:31Z,"This isn't the first time Israel has taken aim at media workers in Palestine, where it attempts to control the narrative in tandem with efforts to control territory.

On Sept. 22, Israeli forces stormed Al Jazeera's Ramallah office and shut down its operations, effectively barring one of the few remaining windows into the realities of life under occupation in the West Bank. The incident, as alarming as it is, extends far beyond the closure of a newsroom and marks an escalation in Israel's broader crackdown on press freedoms in Palestine. For those of us journalists who have reported from the ground, our work has never been just about reporting the news; it's about making visible to the world a reality that shapes every aspect of our daily lives as Palestinians.

This isn't the first time Israel has taken aim at media workers in Palestine, where it attempts to control the narrative in tandem with efforts to control territory. We've seen similar tactics since October of last year, and long before, when tens of Palestinian journalists were killed along with their family members, media offices bombed, and entire news organizations targeted. I've lost colleagues who reported side by side with me from northern Gaza, like Ismail Al Ghoul. Together Ismail and I endured months of cold and hunger, and terrifying nights during Israel's ground offensives. He and so many other dedicated colleagues were killed for speaking out, for doing their job.

I know this because I survived it. As a writer and reporter for Al Jazeera in Gaza during the war from October 2023 until last May, I experienced firsthand the dangers of reporting on the ground, and the scrutiny I was subjected to for being affiliated with Al Jazeera. The press badge on my chest, meant to ensure my safety, functioned as a target. In December 2023, my home was bombed with me and my family inside, as a direct result of my work, after I received multiple threats via phone calls and text messages from the Israeli military ordering me to stop reporting and cease writing.

My own experience in Gaza bears this out. The bombing of my home didn't just shake my personal life by burying me under the rubble for hours -- it disrupted my sense of purpose as a writer and journalist. For days, I questioned whether I could continue reporting. Knowing the cost, my family lived in constant fear every time I went on assignment, while colleagues around me grew increasingly afraid to speak out, knowing that anyone could be a target at any moment.

What we witnessed daily, from drone surveillance and press tents being bombed to the direct shooting at journalists and targeting of their vehicles as they traveled for coverage, was not just an attack on the ones trying to report, but on the very idea of journalism. It is an attack on the notion that the world has a right to know what happens in places like Gaza and the West Bank. Still, we continued to report because we knew the world needed to see what was happening, and we knew that to stop reporting would mean to surrender to the very forces that sought to silence us.

Al Jazeera has been a crucial voice documenting not only the devastation in Gaza, especially as it produces exclusive access and footage to its viewers from the ground, but also the civil unrest and protests within Israel, the political discontent in Tel Aviv, and the deadly raids on refugee camps in the West Bank. Now, with its Ramallah bureau shut down, that voice is fraying. But this is only one episode in Israel's ongoing campaign against the media in the occupied territories.

What's striking is that it comes nearly one year into Israel's war on Gaza, dimming any hope of renewed global attention as people near an anniversary of death and destruction. What concerns me most is that this is more than just about Al Jazeera. It's about the future of a young generation of journalists aspiring to speak out during times of terror and oppression. As someone who reported from right in front of Israeli tanks, I can say that journalists in Palestine are heartbreakingly treated as a threat.

Israel's efforts to silence the free press represent a tragedy that cuts deep into the ongoing struggle for liberation and peace. It's a tragedy for anyone who values the role of the press in democratic societies. When journalists are attacked, the public is denied the information necessary to truly understand reality.

When the press is silenced, it's not just a building that closes or stories that disappear. It's accountability itself that is lost. It cuts off a vital flow of information to the public. And the consequences ripple far beyond the journalists themselves. The world loses access to the ground truth -- the kind of truth that challenges ""official"" government narratives, the kind that holds the powerful to account.

By attacking journalists, whether through the bombing of their homes, as in my case, or shutting down newsrooms, as we saw in Ramallah, Israel is sending a chilling message: Telling the truth is dangerous work with a steep price.

That's why the closure of the Ramallah office isn't merely an Al Jazeera or local concern -- it's a global one. The erosion of press freedoms in Palestine reflects a disturbing trend, a concerted effort to undermine the institutions that safeguard truth and transparency. It's a pattern of slow, deliberate attempts to dismantle the free press entirely. Because if we allow press freedoms to be eroded in Palestine, what's to stop it from happening elsewhere?

In this critical moment, the world can't afford to look away. In defending journalism, we defend the truth. It's the means by which we fight against injustice. I know what happens when the press is attacked, and I fear we've reached a point where these attacks have become the norm, accepted even. The closure of the Ramallah office is an upsetting move, yes. But it's also an urgent call to action, because it won't stop with Al Jazeera."
Why the U.S. government is hailing Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader as 'justice',NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/29/g-s1-25322/biden-nasrallah-hezbollah-israel,2024-09-29T10:31:10Z,"Shiite Muslims light candles during a protest against the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, in Karachi, Pakistan on Saturday. Fareed Khan/AP hide caption

The death of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah by an Israeli airstrike on Saturday could reshape the war in the Middle East in ways not yet known. The civilian death toll from the strikes is likely to rise. And the Iran-backed Lebanese militacnt group is known for its resilience and retaliation.

But many U.S. leaders have united in their support of Israel's killing of Nasrallah for what they see an appropriate action for the longtime decision maker of an organization that killed many innocent lives.

President Biden said the death of Hassan Nasrallah, leader of the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah, by an Israeli airstrike on Saturday was ""a measure of justice for his many victims.""

""Hassan Nasrallah and the terrorist group he led, Hezbollah, were responsible for killing hundreds of Americans over a four-decade reign of terror,"" Biden said in a statement.

Vice President Kamala Harris and Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson also added their support for the attack.

Harris called Nasrallah ""a terrorist with American blood on his hands"" whose leadership ""destabilized the Middle East and led to the killing of countless innocent people in Lebanon, Israel, Syria, and around the world. Today, Hezbollah's victims have a measure of justice.""

Biden and Harris reiterated their support for Israel's right to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups.

Hezbollah has been linked to several anti-U.S. terrorist attacks since the 1980s. Hezbollah was formed in 1982 in response to Israel's invasion of Lebanon and three years later pledged allegiance to the supreme leader of Iran and called for the destruction of Israel.

The groups attacks against Americans and U.S. interests include the suicide truck bombings in 1983 and 1984 in Beirut that targeted the U.S. embassy, the U.S. Marine barracks and the U.S. embassy annex. The death toll of those attacks was more than 300 Americans and Lebanese.

In 1985, a Trans World Airlines flight was hijacked by an alleged Hezbollah member who fatally shot a U.S. Navy diver.

During the Iraq War, Hezbollah members reportedly armed and trained Shia militias that carried out attacks on U.S. forces during their deployments between 2003 and 2011, according to a U.S. congressional report published last week.

In the Middle East, more than 500 Lebanese and over 30 Israelis have reportedly been killed in recent fighting between Israel and Hezbollah, according to the report.

The Lebanese militant group and Israel have been trading attacks since the current conflict in the Middle East began nearly a year ago. Hamas, the Palestinian militant group governing Gaza and is also backed by Iran, carried out an attack on Israel on Oct. 7. That attack killed around 1,200 Israelis and Hamas militants took some 250 hostages. Israel responded with what's become a months-long assault in the Gaza Strip that has killed more than 40,000 Palestinians.

The 2024 annual threat assessment put out by U.S. intelligence agencies states that Hezbollah ""maintains the capability to target U.S. persons and interests in the [Middle East] region, worldwide, and, to a lesser extent, in the United States."""
Maher rips rapper's profanity-laced tired against USA: 'Sure it was a big hit with the Queers for Gaza crowd',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/maher-rips-rappers-profanity-laced-tired-against-usa-sure-big-hit-queers-gaza-crowd,2024-09-28T14:25:00Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

""Real Time"" host Bill Maher took aim at rapper Macklemore over his ""F--- America"" declaration at an anti-Israel event.

The Grammy-winning artist went viral this week for his appearance at Seattle's ""Palestine Will Live Forever Festival"" which raised money for various groups, including the controversial agency known as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA), which Israeli officials have declared is strongly tied to Hamas, leading to the firing of nine UNRWA staffers allegedly involved in the Oct. 7 terrorist attack.

Israeli officials have declared that UNRWA is strongly tied to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The U.N. itself announced in August that nine UNRWA staffers would be fired due to possible involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel.

""Straight up, say it. I'm not gonna stop you. I'm not gonna stop you,"" Macklemore said, appearing to reference chants from the crowd.

""Yeah, F--- America,"" he said, sparking cheers from the audience.

BILL MAHER: TRUMP IS 'RIGHT' ABOUT THE DANGEROUS RHETORIC AIMED AT HIM, 'BUT HE IS A THREAT TO DEMOCRACY!'

That didn't sit well with Maher, who addressed the rapper's declaration during his closing monologue.

""I'm sure it was a big hit with the Queers for Gaza crowd, literally advocating for a government that would imprison you or kill you for being queer from the safety and security of a country that doesn't do that,"" Maher said.

""Yes, America. The only place in the world where a White guy from the suburbs could become a millionaire rapper because here, every person, regardless of race, class or gender has the right to be talent-free,"" he added.

BILL MAHER TRASHES KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING 'FULL OF S---' ON ISRAEL, MIDDLE EAST: 'JUST SHUT UP'

In a follow-up statement on Instagram, Macklemore seemed to back down from his attack on America: ""My thoughts and feelings are not always expressed perfectly or politely."" He added, ""Sometimes I slip up and get caught in the moment. Saturday night was one of those times. I strive to always lead with love in an effort to bring people together and never to create more division.""

He concluded, ""Unfortunately, the historic event in my hometown that brought thousands of people together to raise awareness and money for the people of Palestine has become overshadowed by two words. I wish I had been in a better place with my grief and anger. But the truth is I'm not ok. I haven't been.""

Maher began his monologue by praising Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz for helping Democrats be more patriotic at this year's DNC convention, but lamented their sentiment hasn't resonated with younger people.

""The protests that started off as justice for Palestine have morphed into a broader kind of America is the problem, 'We f---ed up the whole world' thing,"" Maher said.

""Guess what document allows you to chant 'Hey hey, ho ho' followed by something really stupid,"" Maher asked them before answering with the Constitution.

BILL MAHER MAKES THIS BOLD 2024 PREDICTION AFTER TRUMP-HARRIS DEBATE

After citing a study alleging four out of ten Gen Zers believe the Founding Fathers are ""better described as villains,"" Maher noted that how young some of them were including 18-year-old James Monroe, 21-year-old Alexander Hamilton and 25-year-old James Madison.

""They were the Gen Z of their day, and when they were your age, they started a country. What the f--- have you done?"" Maher asked.

""History is complicated, and Gen Z reasoning is not. They think they're pure, but they're really just simplistic. They know two things: White people did some very bad things and- no, that's it. That's all they know,"" Maher said, later adding ""The citizens of Gaza cannot assemble in protest of their own government, cannot do or say what they want or practice whatever religion they want, or have a free press, all rights guaranteed in just our First Amendment! The irony in all of this is that the world the founders birth, flawed though it may be, provides the bedrock for everything that makes life good for the very people who hate them so much.""

""It's so easy to take for granted individual liberty, a bill of rights, the rule of law, checks and balances, getting a trial by jury, the peaceful transfer of power, protecting minority rights and democracy itself, but those are the things that make our pampered, privileged, bratty lives so relatively cushy. No one starves here, even our poor people are fat,"" he continued. ""Why do millions of people every year risk their lives to come here? Because they want what we got! The founders were flawed, but they did build a place the whole world wants to break into. No one is paying a coyote to smuggle them into India or Russia. Immigrants don't see us as the problem. They see us as a solution. And there's a reason they kill themselves to get here.""

Israel strikes Hezbollah in blast targeting the militant group's leader,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/28/g-s1-25272/israel-strikes-hezbollah-in-blast-targeting-leader,2024-09-28T07:58:55Z,"BEIRUT -- The Israeli military said it struck Hezbollah's headquarters in Beirut on Friday in a series of massive explosions that targeted the leader of the militant group and leveled multiple high-rise apartment buildings.

At least six people were killed and 91 were wounded, Lebanon's health ministry said. It was the biggest blast to hit the Lebanese capital in the past year and appeared likely to push the escalating conflict closer to full-fledged war.

Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was the target of the strikes, according to two people familiar with the matter who spoke on condition of anonymity, including one United States official. The Israeli army declined to comment on who it was targeting. It was not immediately clear if Nasrallah was at the site, and Hezbollah did not comment on the report.

The death toll is likely to rise significantly as teams comb through the rubble of six buildings. Israel launched a series of strikes on other areas of the southern suburbs following the initial blast.

After the strikes, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu abruptly cut short a visit to the United States to return home. Hours earlier, he addressed the United Nations, vowing that Israel's intensified campaign against Hezbollah over the past two weeks would continue -- further dimming hopes for an internationally backed cease-fire.

News of the blasts came as Netanyahu was briefing reporters after his U.N. address. A military aide whispered into his ear, and Netanyahu quickly ended the briefing.

Israeli army spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said the strikes targeted the main Hezbollah headquarters, saying it was located underground beneath residential buildings.

The series of blasts at around nightfall reduced six apartment towers to rubble in Haret Hreik, a densely populated, predominantly Shiite district of Beirut's Dahiyeh suburbs, according to Lebanon's national news agency. A wall of billowing black and orange smoke rose into the sky as windows were rattled and houses shaken some 30 kilometers (20 miles) north of Beirut.

Footage showed rescue workers clambering over large slabs of concrete, surrounded by high piles of twisted metal and wreckage. Several craters were visible, one with a car toppled into it. A stream of residents carrying their belongings were seen fleeing along a main road out of the district.

Israel provided no immediate comment about the type of bomb or how many it used, but the resulting explosion levelled an area greater than a city block. The Israeli army has in its arsenal 2,000-pound, American-made ""Bunker Buster"" guided bombs designed specifically for hitting subterranean targets.

Richard Weir, crisis and weapons researcher with Human Rights Watch, said the blasts were consistent with that class of bomb.

Israel's air forces followed with a new set of strikes early Saturday, also in the southern suburbs, shortly after warning residents of three buildings to evacuate. It said they were being used by Hezbollah to hide weapons, including anti-ship missiles.

Israel's military announced additional attacks on Beqaa in eastern Lebanon and Tyre in the south.

To a degree unseen in past conflicts, Israel spent the week pushing to eliminate Hezbollah's senior leadership. But an attempt to assassinate Nasrallah -- successful or not -- would be a major escalation. The Pentagon said the U.S. had no advance warning of the strikes.

Nasrallah has been in hiding for years, very rarely appearing in public. He regularly gives speeches, but always by video from unknown locations.

The site hit Friday evening had not been publicly known as Hezbollah's main headquarters, though it is located in the group's ""security quarters,"" a heavily guarded part of Haret Hreik where it has offices and runs several nearby hospitals.

Four hours after the strike, Hezbollah had still not issued any statement referring to it. Instead, it announced that it had launched a salvo of rockets at the Israeli city of Safed, which it said was ""in defense of Lebanon and its people, and in response to the barbaric Israeli violation of cities, villages and civilians.""

The Israeli military said a house and a car in Safed were hit, and officials said a 68-year-old woman sustained mild shrapnel wounds.

Israel dramatically intensified its airstrikes in Lebanon this week, saying it is determined to put an end to more than 11 months of Hezbollah fire into its territory. The escalated campaign has killed more than 720 people in Lebanon, including dozens of women and children, according to Health Ministry statistics. A predawn strike Friday in the mainly Sunni border town of Chebaa killed nine members of the same family, the state news agency said.

The United Nations said the fighting has displaced 211,000 people, including 85,000 now staying in public schools and other shelters. Airstrikes have forced 20 primary health care centers to shut down and disrupted access to clean water for nearly 300,000 people.

The scope of Israel's operation remains unclear, but officials have said a ground invasion to push the militant group away from the border is a possibility. Israel moved thousands of troops toward the border in preparation.

At the U.N., Netanyahu vowed to ""continue degrading Hezbollah"" until Israel achieves its goals. His comments dampened hopes for a U.S.-backed call for a 21-day truce between Israel and Hezbollah to allow time for a diplomatic solution. Hezbollah has not responded to the proposal.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, saying it was a show of support for the Palestinians. Since then, it and the Israeli military have traded fire almost daily, forcing tens of thousands of people to flee their homes on both sides of the border.

An Israeli security official said he expects the campaign against Hezbollah would not last for as long as the current war in Gaza, because the military's goals are much narrower.

In Gaza, Israel aims to dismantle Hamas' military and political regime, but the goal in Lebanon is to push Hezbollah away from the border -- ""not a high bar like Gaza"" in terms of operational objectives, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to military briefing guidelines.

In the southern Lebanese city of Tyre, civil defense workers pulled the bodies of two women -- 35-year-old Hiba Ataya and her mother Sabah Olyan -- from the rubble of a building brought down by a strike.

""That's Sabah, these are her clothes, my love,"" one man cried out as her body emerged.

Israel says its accelerated strikes have already inflicted heavy damage on Hezbollah's weapons capabilities and its fighters. A strike Tuesday in southern Lebanon killed a Hezbollah missile unit commander, Muhammad Ali Ismail, and his deputy, Israel's military said Saturday. There was no immediate confirmation from Hezbollah.

But Hezbollah boasted a large arsenal of rockets and missiles and its remaining capacities are unknown.

Hezbollah officials and their supporters remain defiant. Not long before the explosions Friday evening, thousands gathered in another part of Beirut's suburbs for the funeral of three Hezbollah members killed in earlier strikes, including the head of the group's drone unit, Mohammed Surour.

People in the giant crowd waved their fists in the air and chanted, ""We will never accept humiliation,"" as they marched marched behind the three coffins, wrapped in the group's yellow flag.

Hussein Fadlallah, Hezbollah's top official in Beirut, said in a speech that no matter how many commanders Israel kills, the group has endless numbers of experienced fighters. He vowed that Hezbollah will keep fighting until Israel stops its offensive in Gaza.

""We will not abandon the support of Palestine, Jerusalem and oppressed Gaza,"" Fadlallah said. ""There is no place for neutrality in this battle."""
US warships come under attack in Red Sea as nearly two dozen incoming missiles and drones shot down,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/us-warships-under-attack-red-sea-nearly-2-dozen-incoming-missiles-drones-shot-down,2024-09-27T19:42:40Z,"Fox News' Trey Yingst provides details on Israel's latest attack on Hezbollah, as it remains unclear whether Hassan Nasrallah was killed.

Three U.S. warships came under attack Friday off the coast of Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, who have disrupted commercial shipping in the region, but no one was hurt, officials said.

The warships shot down nearly two dozen incoming missiles and drones while transiting a narrow entrance into the Red Sea. None of the vessels was hit, and no sailors on board were hurt, a U.S. official told Fox News.

The USS Stockdale and USS Spruance, along with a littoral combat ship, the USS Indianapolis, were transiting the Bab al-Mandab Strait when the naval warships came under attack from a barrage of incoming ballistic missiles, cruise missiles and drones, the officials said.

EXTREMISTS RISE IN NEW PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY GOVERNMENT AS BIDEN THREATENS ISRAEL OVER GAZA WAR

""We did see a complex attack launched from the Houthis that ranged from cruise missiles and waves,"" Pentagon deputy press secretary Sabrina Singh told reporters Friday. ""My understanding is that those were either engaged in, shot down or failed.""

The Stockdale and Spruance are part of the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group that recently arrived in the Middle East from the Pacific.

U.S. forces have struck back at Houthi militants on multiple occasions for nearly a year. The rebel group has routinely attacked commercial and military vessels at sea over Israel's war against Hamas.

The number of commercial ships passing through the Red Sea has dropped by 90% since the attacks began after the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in Israel. Since then, U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria have come under attack dozens of times. In January, three American soldiers were killed in Jordan.

MORE THAN A MILLION PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARE NOW DISPLACED; WHY ARE ARAB COUNTRIES NOT OPENING THEIR DOORS?

The Houthis recently attacked a Greek-flagged oil tanker, which carried four times the amount of oil that spilled from the Exxon Valdez in Alaska's Prince William Sound in 1989. No major oil spill occurred, and officials said the fires on board the vessel were contained.

The ship was towed into port after being adrift in the Red Sea for days with flames visible on deck.

During her debate with former President Trump, Vice President Harris claimed, ""As of today, there is not one member of the United States military who is in active duty in a combat zone in any war zone around the world, the first time this century.""

At the time of Harris's comments, elite American commandos had just conducted a raid into western Iraq, days prior, to kill ISIS leaders. A number of soldiers were wounded, including one who took shrapnel to his leg, which required surgery.

The USS Dwight D. Eisenhower aircraft strike group returned to Norfolk, Virginia, in July after dropping 420 bombs on Houthi targets in Yemen. Warships in the strike group fired 155 interceptor missiles to shoot down incoming Houthi missiles and drones.

Chappell Roan Cancels Appearances In New York And D.C --  Her Kamala Harris Endorsement Controversy Explained,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/09/27/chappell-roan-cancels-appearances-in-new-york-and-dc--her-kamala-harris-endorsement-controversy-explained/,2024-09-27T17:59:50Z,"Pop singer Chappell Roan, who rapidly rose to fame this year, canceled upcoming appearances at the ""All Things Go"" festivals in New York and Washington, D.C. to ""prioritize my health,"" days after she faced backlash over her comments criticizing both political parties and her initial refusal to endorse Vice President Kamala Harris.

Roan (whose real name is Kayleigh Rose Amstutz) has made several statements in recent weeks criticizing the government and both political parties, largely over her pro-Palestinian views and her advocacy for transgender rights. She told Rolling Stone earlier this month she doesn't ""have a side because I hate both sides"" and is ""so embarrassed about everything going on right now."" She doubled down last week, telling The Guardian she doesn't ""feel pressured to endorse someone"" because ""there's problems on both sides."" Following criticism from Democrats, who compared her unfavorably to straightforward Harris endorsements by fellow pop stars Taylor Swift and Billie Eilish, Roan clarified her views in two TikTok videos this week. On Tuesday, Roan posted a video urging followers to ""use critical thinking skills"" and said it is ""important to question authority and question world leaders,"" clarifying she would not vote for Trump, but did not say whether she would vote for Harris. In another video posted Wednesday, Roan said she will vote for Harris, but clarified she would not fully endorse her because she does not agree with some of Harris' stances, reiterating her views on Gaza and transgender rights. Roan did not specify which of Harris' views on trans rights she opposed, but she previously told Rolling Stone she disagreed with a White House statement sent to the New York Times voicing opposition to gender-affirming surgery for minors -- though the White House reportedly clarified weeks later it will ""continue to fight state and national bans on gender-affirming care"" but believes surgeries should be reserved for adults.

""Yes, one's obviously better than the other,"" Roan said, adding, ""I hope you don't settle for what we have.""

Roan, who is a lesbian and has said much of her artistry is inspired by drag performers, previously turned down an offer to perform at the White House during Pride Month, telling Rolling Stone: ""I'm not going to go to the White House because I am not going to be a monkey for Pride."" Roan said she considered going to read poems written by Palestinian women, but decided against it for security reasons.

Roan has also spoken in recent weeks of feeling pressure because of her rapid rise to fame. She rose to prominence earlier this year following an opening slot on Olivia Rodrigo's tour, a series of successful music festival performances, including what officials estimated was the biggest Lollapalooza set of all time, and a slew of hits including ""Good Luck, Babe!"" and ""Hot to Go!"" Roan has complained about alleged stalkers and harassers in multiple interviews and social media posts, stating: ""I'm allowed to say no to creepy behavior."" She addressed struggling with her newfound fame on stage in June, telling fans: ""I just feel a little off today because I think that my career is just kind of going really fast and it's really hard to keep up.""

"Netanyahu calls Mid-East conflicts choice between 'blessing or a curse,' warns about Israel's 'long arm'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-calls-mid-east-conflicts-choice-blessing-curse-warns-israels-long-arm,2024-09-27T15:51:38Z,"UNITED NATIONS, New York - Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu underscored the conflicts in the Middle East as a choice between ""a blessing or a curse"" as he warned Iran's ""tyrants"" about Israel's ability to defend and avenge itself.

""If you strike us, we will strike you,"" Netanyahu said. ""There is no place in Iran that the long arm of Israel cannot reach, and that's true of the entire Middle East: Far from being lambs led to the slaughter, Israel's soldiers have fought back with incredible courage and with heroic sacrifice.""

Netanyahu took the podium in front of a partially empty General Assembly, with some delegates walking out, but those gathered to hear him offered raucous applause ahead of his speech. Seemingly absent from the speech was the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations and Secretary of State Antony Blinken, who was hosting a global health security event on the sidelines of UNGA.

He revealed that he almost didn't attend the U.N. High-Level Week, but that he felt a need to ""set the record straight,"" which included laying out the choice the world faces.

Netanyahu brought several families with loved ones held hostage by Hamas terrorists in Gaza to New York and once again called for their freedom, noting that, ""I'll say this one more time, we remain focused on our sacred mission, bringing our hostages home. And we will not stop until that mission is complete.""

THE ONLY THING NETANYAHU CAN DO IS EXUDE STRENGTH IN THE FACE OF HIS ENEMIES: ELIZABETH PIPKO

""Israel seeks peace,"" Netanyahu said. ""Israel yearns for peace. Israel has made peace and will make peace again - yet, we face savage enemies who seek our annihilation, and we must defend ourselves against those savage murderers.""

Netanyahu framed the issue as a choice between ""a blessing or a curse,"" with Iran's ""unremitting aggression"" as the ""curse"" against the ""blessing"" of reconciliation between Arab nations and Israel.

CZECH FOREIGN MINISTER HIGHLIGHTS LACK OF EUROPEAN LEADERSHIP, FAILURE TO 'PROJECT GEOPOLITICAL POWER'

""A normalization deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel seemed closer than ever. But then came the curse of Oct. 7,"" Netanyahu said. ""Thousands of Iranian-backed Hamas terrorist from Gaza burst into Israel in pickup trucks, on motorcycles. And they committed unimaginable atrocities.""

The prime minister hammered again on Iran's aggression, warning that if left unchecked will ""endanger every single country in the Middle East and many, many countries in the rest of the world.""

""Iran seeks to impose its radicalism well beyond the Middle East,"" Netanyahu warned. ""That's why it funds terror networks on five continents. That's why it builds ballistic missiles for nuclear warheads to threaten the entire world.""

""For too long, the world is appeasing Iran. It turns a blind eye to its internal repression. It turns a blind eye to its external aggression,"" he added. ""Well, that appeasement must end, and that appeasement must end now.""

Netanyahu called on the U.N. Security Council to ""snap back"" sanctions against Iran and do everything in the organization's power to ""ensure that Iran never gets nuclear weapons.""

However, he lamented that the organization has an apparent bias against Israel and in favor of the Palestinians, citing the ""automatic majority"" of countries that will vote in favor of any policy that hurts Israel.

""For the Palestinians, this U.N. House of darkness is home court,"" Netanyahu said. ""They know that in this swamp of antisemitic bile, there's an automatic majority willing to demonize the Jewish state on anything in this anti-Israel, flat Earth society. Any false charge, any outlandish allegation can muster a majority.""

""It's always been about Israel, about Israel's very existence, and I say to you, until Israel, until the Jewish state is treated like other nations, until this antisemitic swamp is drained, the U.N. will be viewed by fair minded people everywhere as nothing more than a contemptuous force,"" he added.

"Czech foreign minister highlights lack of European leadership, failure to 'project geopolitical power'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/czech-foreign-minister-highlights-lack-european-leadership-failure-project-geopolitical-power,2024-09-27T12:33:16Z,"UNITED NATIONS, New York - Czech Foreign Minister Jan Lipavsky, during an interview with Fox News Digital, bemoaned that Europe now struggles to impact geopolitical issues and lacks clear leadership in the over two dozen member bloc.

""I think it's a clear show that Europe has lost its ability to project geopolitical power, especially into Africa and the Middle East, because we are basically not able to do any kind of measures to stop this irregular migration,"" Lipavsky said.

""When somebody who really has no right for asylum is in Europe, there are no true mechanisms ... so they will need to put more effort into that, definitely,"" he added.

Czechia, also known as the Czech Republic, sits in the middle of Europe and still considers itself the continent's ""natural crossroads,"" which places it in a unique position to discuss matters regarding immigration and conflicts on the border.

HUNGARIAN FM RECALLS STRONG TRUMP ADMIN 'EXPERIENCE,' CLAIMS 'OUR HOPE IS ALL' ON FORMER PRESIDENT

Despite that prominent perspective, Lipavsky noted that ""the leadership must come from the big"" countries, as ""that's how things are done in international politics.""

Lipavsky argued that this lack of leadership has made the conflict between Ukraine and Russia more difficult, but he admitted the war helped waken the bloc's members to certain issues they had ignored.

""We have rediscovered our ability, at least in the east, to protect Ukraine, but, still, we need to do more, honestly,"" Lipavsky said. ""I would not say it's a dire situation, but certainly the lack of leadership also could be visible.""

""As minister of foreign affairs from Czechia, I'm trying to come up with proposals. I'm trying to call for common action,"" he continued. ""For example, we are delivering a lot of ammunition to Ukraine. We have this ammunition initiative.""

""Those are hundreds, thousands of shells, which then make a difference on the battlefields - more than words,"" he added.

Lipavsky framed the current state of international politics as one of ""global confrontation,"" with conflicts across multiple regions that impact all nations due to their effects on everything from energy to food supplies and general shipping.

""We see many conflicts in the Middle East,"" Lipavsky said. ""It's not only Gaza or now Lebanon, where the north of Israel is being shelled by rockets for many months, but it is also the navigation in Red Sea, which is being endangered by Houthis, and those are supported by Iran.""

JUSTICE DEPARTMENT BACKS UN CLAIM RELIEF WORKERS ACCUSED OF AIDING HAMAS ARE IMMUNE

""This is a very complex matter, and we need to de-escalate,"" he added. ""We need to put a lot of effort into peace, but also not forget that Israel has a right to defend itself.""

Czechia earlier this year voted against the Palestinian States gaining expanded powers in the United Nations and last week was one of 14 countries that voted against a Palestinian-drafted resolution that adopted the International Court of Justice opinion that demanded Israel leave Gaza and the West Bank. Lipavsky explained that the resolution ""skewed in one direction,"" which was ""a very basic reason to vote against"" the resolution.

However, he stressed that Russia remains ""definitely"" the most important crisis facing Czechia and other European countries.

""Russia wants to destroy the complete Ukrainian nation. They want to include them into Russia and ... It's like Hitler during the World War. It's absolutely similar,"" Lipavsky insisted.

""We know that we used to be in a sphere of influence of Soviet Union during Czechoslovakia ... after the Second World War until the fall of the Berlin Wall,"" he said. ""I don't want to happen to Czechia again that some dictator will tell us what to do and what to not and to exploit us.

""So we have to defend from this, from this Russian trust, and then of course, to be a good ally to U.S., and good to NATO,"" he added."
End US funding for UN agency giving immunity to its murderous Hamas members,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/end-funding-un-agency-giving-immunity-murderous-hamas-members,2024-09-27T11:09:56Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Against the backdrop of Israel's four-front war for its very existence, the United Nations, with the support of anti-Israel elected officials in the U.S. and elsewhere, are circling the wagons to ensure that UNRWA will continue to brainwash generations of Palestinian children to deny the 3,500-year link of the Jewish people to the land of Israel and the Jewish state's legitimacy.

A new bill launched by anti-Israel members in Congress demands that the U.S. resume its funding of UNRWA, which is currently blocked under U.S. law. This initiative comes as the United Nations insists that all UNRWA employees are legally immune from any prosecution.

This presumably includes UNRWA employees who were members of Hamas and who participated in the Oct 7 Hamas crimes against humanity in southern Israel, where 1,200 Israelis, among them entire Jewish families, were mass murdered and mutilated. Young Israeli women in peaceful communities and at the Nova Peace concert raped, with hundreds kidnapped - dead and alive - to be brutalized and bartered by Hamas for the release of thousands of Palestinian terrorists held by Israel.

The audacity and hypocrisy of a renewed pro-UNRWA campaign is breathtaking. The United Nations has done less than zero to gain the release of innocent hostages taken by Hamas on Oct 7. In fact, U.N. officials and special rapporteurs were eerily silent or, worse, excused Hamas' brutal pogrom.

UN CHIEF DEFENDS UNRWA, SAYS ONLY 'A FEW ELEMENTS' PARTICIPATED IN OCT. 7

And when it comes to the United Nations, words - spoken and unspoken - do count.

Top U.N. officials we recently met with refused to label Hamas a terrorist organization. That policy allows UNRWA's commissioner-general, Philippe Lazzarini to insist that, for the U.N., ""Hamas is not a terrorist group... it is a political movement"".

Lazzarini has refused to say whether UNRWA even considers Hamas a ""militant or armed group."" He hasn't said that membership in an armed group is a sufficient cause for not hiring a person by UNRWA or terminating his or her employment.

Lazzarini has not taken any action to enforce the prohibition on membership in armed groups, let alone take steps to ensure to its donor states that it will identify and dismiss employees who are members of armed groups.

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY HAMAS TERRORISTS IN GAZA

He has neither investigated, suspended nor fired 100 UNRWA staff whom Israel submits are Hamas or Palestine Islamic Jihad's military operatives.

The bottom line is that the day after the war in Gaza ends, unless there is strong opposition from the United States, Hamas is still well-positioned to take back the reins of power over the lives of the people of Gaza and over the minds and hearts of Palestinian children.

Some months ago, I had the opportunity to speak directly to U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken at the State Department. I told him that UNRWA cannot be part of the solution for ""the day after"" in Gaza when it has been a core problem for decades.

As of now, the plans of the U.S. for the day after in Gaza remain unclear.

"Harvard went easy on students for antisemitic conduct, House committee finds",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/harvard-went-easy-students-antisemitic-conduct-house-committee-finds,2024-09-27T08:07:24Z,"Jewish activist and recent Harvard graduate Shabbos Kestenbaum, a registered Democrat, tells Fox News Digital he's decided to endorse former President Trump in 2024 because Kamala Harris ""does not deserve our support.""

Harvard University failed to crack down hard enough on students for antisemitic conduct that violated the Ivy League school's own policies, according to the House Education and the Workforce Committee, which has been investigating anti-Israel demonstrations that gripped American college campuses in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel.

Harvard brought disciplinary cases against 68 students related to an April 24 to May 14 campus encampment, according to documents obtained by the committee. Of those 68, none are currently suspended, 52 remain in ""good standing,"" 15 are not in good standing due to disciplinary probation, and one is on leave.

The committee said it believes Harvard is in violation of Title VI, which forbids ""a hostile environment based on race, color, or national origin.""

""Harvard failed, end of story,"" Chair Virginia Foxx, R-N.C., said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""These administrators failed their Jewish students and faculty, they failed to make it clear that antisemitism will not be tolerated, and in this case, Harvard may have failed to fulfill its legal responsibilities to protect students from a hostile environment. The only thing administrators accomplished is appeasing radical students who have almost certainly returned to campus emboldened and ready to repeat the spring semester's chaos. Harvard must change course immediately.""

JEWISH DEMOCRAT SUING HARVARD OVER ANTISEMITISM CHASTISES HIS PARTY FOR INACTION, ENDORSES TRUMP

According to a summary of its findings provided to Fox News Digital, ""Harvard investigated and documented student violations of its policies, some of which were deemed to warrant semesters-long suspensions, but ultimately failed to enforce its own rules and impose meaningful discipline.""

The committee added that discipline ""would have been consistent with the Harvard Corporation's pronouncement that 'calls for violence' and academic disruptions would 'not be tolerated,'"" asserting that ""[t]he records, however, reveal that Harvard failed to fulfill this commitment and has permitted students to engage in such conduct with no real consequences.""

Between Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas terrorists attacked southern Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking hundreds of hostages into the Gaza Strip, and April 24, 2024, when an anti-Israel encampment formed on the university's campus, ""Harvard failed to impose any formal discipline on any students,"" the committee said in the summary of its findings.

Before the encampment was erected, the committee said, ""Harvard only referred 12 students for discipline for conduct related to two antisemitic incidents: the November 16-17, 2023, occupation of University Hall and the disruption of classes with bullhorns and antisemitic chants on November 29, 2023."" The committee added that no students received formal discipline for these incidents and ""all remain in good standing.""

""Harvard has also failed to hold student groups accountable for antisemitic conduct. On September 10, the Harvard Crimson reported that Harvard lifted the April 22 suspension of the Harvard Undergraduate Palestine Solidarity Committee (PSC),"" the committee wrote, noting that this makes the group eligible for school funding. ""This reversal comes despite the role of PSC and its membership in organizing the unlawful Harvard encampment through the unrecognized group Harvard Out of Occupied Palestine (HOOP).""

The Crimson reported that while PSC itself was not listed as an encampment organizer, many of its members are part of HOOP, and the two groups work together to coordinate their Instagram posts.

HARVARD SLAMMED FOR 'SMOKE AND MIRRORS' ANTISEMITISM RESPONSE: 'THEY ACTUALLY MAKE THINGS WORSE'

The committee noted that Harvard College's Administrative Board downgraded the sanctions of 35 students it initially voted to place on disciplinary probation from a period of six months or longer to periods of less than two months.

""This diminishment meant that none of these students initially slated for longer probation periods remained on probation at the start of the fall 2024 semester,"" their report says.

The board ""initially voted to suspend five students for a year or more for encampment-related conduct violations, but then downgraded their sanctions to probation of no more than a semester,"" the committee said, arguing that those students ""therefore appear to have faced no consequential discipline.""

Documents obtained by the committee show that every Harvard College student who appealed their encampment-related disciplinary sanctions had their sanctions downgraded.

The report cites how one student who participated in the encampment and raised a Palestinian flag over University Hall, which sits on Harvard Yard, ""was initially informed he would receive a three-semester suspension."" But that three-semester suspension was downgraded to probation until Dec. 20, 2024. The committee found four other students who participated in the encampment were each initially told they would be required to withdraw for two terms, but each of these suspensions was downgraded ""to the significantly weaker penalty of probation"" until Oct. 21, 2024.

The committee found that Harvard did not implement any consequences for students who occupied University Hall and who interrupted classes with bullhorns and antisemitic chants.

Nine Harvard students who occupied University Hall on Nov. 16-17, 2023, ""received no formal disciplinary consequences at all"" despite having ""disrupted normal business operations by making loud noises and chanting, with the goal of occupying the building,"" the committee said. Instead, they received informal ""admonishments,"" which, according to Harvard, are ""not considered a formal disciplinary action.""

The five Harvard students who interrupted economics and statistics classes with bullhorns and antisemitic chants, including ""From the river to the sea"" and ""Globalize the intifada,"" on Nov. 29, 2023, received no formal disciplinary consequences, the committee wrote, ""and were instead only 'admonished.'"" Two of those students had also been involved in the occupation of University Hall just weeks before.

"Palestinian President Abbas slams Israel, US during UN speech as critics decry his support for terrorism",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/palestinian-president-abbas-slams-israel-us-during-un-speech-critics-decry-his-support-terrorism,2024-09-26T16:47:24Z,"JERUSALEM -- Mahmoud Abbas, President of the Palestinian Authority, once again delivered a stridently anti-Israel speech at the U.N. on Thursday, where he also praised the anti-Israel protests across the U.S. and condemned Washington for its support of Israel.

Abbas, who presented a 12-point plan for a post-war Gaza that calls for a permanent cease-fire, accused the Jewish state of committing genocide, while calling for its expulsion from the U.N. and taking aim at the Biden Administration for vetoing Security Council resolutions on the issue, while supplying arms to the Israelis.

He charged the U.S. ""furnished Israel with the deadly weapons that it used to kill thousands of innocent civilians, children and women. And this further encouraged Israel to continue with aggression.""

Abbas started his speech by questioning Israel's legitimacy: ""We will not leave. We will not leave. We will not leave. Palestine is our homeland. It is the land of our fathers, our grandfathers. It will remain ours. And if anyone were to leave, it would be the occupying usurpers.""

EXTREMISTS RISE IN NEW PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY GOVERNMENT AS BIDEN THREATENS ISRAEL OVER GAZA WAR

""Abbas spoke for 26 minutes and did not say the word 'Hamas' once. Since the massacre of October 7, Abbas has failed to condemn Hamas for their crimes against humanity,"" Israel's U.N. Ambassador Danny Danon charged in a statement following the speech.

Yet while leaders from around the world watched his UNGA speech, some critics complain the 88-year-old's rule and domination of Palestinian politics in the West Bank (known in Israel by its biblical name of Judea and Samaria in Israel) has done little for the Palestinian cause.

Abbas was born Safed duing the British mandate period [now in Israel]). His family fled to Syria when Arab armies invaded Israel to prevent the establishment of the Jewish state.

Abbas has been accused of rewarding Palestinian terrorism via the infamous ""pay for slay"" system that supports financial stipends for convicted Palestinian terrorists and their family members.

He has also garnered a reputation over the decades as an anti-American agitator who stokes wild antisemitic conspiracy theories. Just last month, Abbas delivered a speech to the Turkish parliament, where he announced that that ""America is the plague, and the plague is America"" and ""We implement Shari'a law: victory or martyrdom.""

Asaf Romirowsky, executive director of Scholars for Peace in the Middle East (SPME), told Fox News Digital that ""Mahmoud Abbas aka Arafat's appointed successor after 20 years has done what Arafat hoped he would, that is maintain a Palestinian stasis while at the same time refusing to root out the corruption within the PA or combat terrorism. Further, as he has shown during his recent speech in the Turkish Parliament, a clear allegiance to Hamas and an endorsement of 10/7, underscoring the consistent antisemitism of his leadership.""

Romirowsky added ""With no heir apparent, Abbas's legacy, as was Arafat's, is that of self-inflicted victimology while maintaining wealth on the back of his own people in the name of the so-called Palestinian struggle.""

MORE THAN A MILLION PALESTINIANS IN GAZA ARE NOW DISPLACED; WHY ARE ARAB COUNTRIES NOT OPENING THEIR DOORS?

Fox News Digital reported shortly after Hamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people in Israel on October 7, including over 30 Americans, that the Abbas' PA might compensate convicted Hamas terrorists for their role in the attack.

Kobi Michael, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Security Studies in Tel Aviv, told Fox News Digital the PA and Abbas ""duplicate all of the corruption, nepotism, and inefficiency of the Palestine Liberation Organization"" that was created by Arafat.

He said ""Abbas does not accept the basic right of the Jewish people to self-determination, and therefore he doesn't recognize the right of the state of Israel to be a nation state of the Jewish people in any borders.""

Michael, who is affiliated with the Misgav Institute continued, ""He has not educated the young generation and has not educated PA officials for peace. On the contrary, Abbas has led and enabled the indoctrination toward hatred and toward delegitimization of the state of Israel.""

In contrast to the U.S.-designated terrorist movement, Hamas, Abbas and the PA are considered to be relatively moderate, according to some Mideast observers.

In 2022, Fox News Digital reported Abbas, issued a shocking diatribe against Israel in the German capital of Berlin, where the Holocaust - the mass extermination of European Jewry - was organized, claiming that the Jewish state has carried out ""50 Holocausts.""

Abbas refused to apologize (or aid in a professional inquiry) in Berlin at the time of the Palestinian Black September massacre of 11 Israeli athletes and a German police officer during the 1972 Munich Olympics."

US and allies call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire between Israel and Hezbollah,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24617/us-and-allies-call-for-an-immediate-21-day-cease-fire-between-israel-and-hezbollah,2024-09-26T03:51:52Z,"NEW YORK -- The U.S., France and other allies jointly called Wednesday for an immediate 21-day cease-fire to allow for negotiations in the escalating conflict between Israel and Hezbollah that has killed more than 600 people in Lebanon in recent days.

The joint statement, negotiated on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly in New York, says the recent fighting is ""intolerable and presents an unacceptable risk of a broader regional escalation.""

""We call for an immediate 21-day cease-fire across the Lebanon-Israel border to provide space for diplomacy,"" the statement said. ""We call on all parties, including the governments of Israel and Lebanon, to endorse the temporary cease-fire immediately.""

There was no immediate reaction from the Israeli or Lebanese governments -- or Hezbollah -- but senior U.S. officials said all parties were aware of the call for a cease-fire. Earlier, representatives for Israel and Lebanon reiterated their support for a U.N. resolution that ended the 2006 war between Israel and the Iranian-backed militant group.

The U.S. hopes the new deal could lead to longer-term stability along the border between Israel and Lebanon. Months of Israeli and Hezbollah exchanges of fire have driven tens of thousands of people from their homes, and escalated attacks over the past week have rekindled fears of a broader war in the Middle East.

The U.S. officials said Hezbollah would not be a signatory to the cease-fire but believed the Lebanese government would coordinate its acceptance with the group. They said they expected Israel to ""welcome"" the proposal and perhaps formally accept it when Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu speaks at the General Assembly on Friday.

While the deal applies only to the Israel-Lebanon border, the U.S. officials said they were looking to use a three-week pause in fighting to restart stalled negotiations for a cease-fire and hostage release deal between Israel and Hamas, another Iranian-backed militant group, after nearly a year of war in Gaza.

The nations calling for a halt to the Israel-Hezbollah conflict are the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates and Qatar.

Work on the proposal came together quickly this week with President Joe Biden's national security team, led by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan, meeting with world leaders in New York and lobbying other countries to support the plan, according to U.S. officials who spoke on condition of anonymity to discuss sensitive diplomatic conversations.

Blinken first raised the proposal with the French foreign minister Monday and then broadened his outreach that evening at a dinner with the foreign ministers of all the Group of Seven industrialized democracies.

During a meeting Wednesday morning with Gulf Cooperation Council foreign ministers, Blinken approached Qatari Prime Minister Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al Thani and Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan to ask their approval and got it. Blinken and senior White House adviser Amos Hochstein then met with Lebanese Prime Minister Najib Mikati, who signed off on the deal.

Sullivan, Hochstein and senior adviser Brett McGurk were also in touch with Israeli officials about the proposal, one of the U.S. officials said. McGurk and Hochstein have been the White House's chief interlocutors with Israel and Lebanon since the Oct. 7 attack on Israel by Hamas launched the war in Gaza.

The officials said the deal crystallized by late Wednesday afternoon during a conversation on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly between Biden and French President Emmanuel Macron.

Blinken expects to meet Netanyahu's top strategic adviser in New York on Thursday ahead of the prime minister's arrival.

An Israeli official said Netanyahu has given the green light to pursue a possible deal, but only if it includes the return of Israeli civilians to their homes. The official spoke on condition of anonymity because they were discussing behind-the-scenes diplomacy.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot told the U.N. Security Council during a special meeting that ""we are counting on both parties to accept it without delay"" and added that ""war is not unavoidable.""

At the meeting, Mikati, the Lebanese prime minister, publicly threw his support behind the French-U.S. plan that ""enjoys international support and which would put an end to this dirty war.""

He called on the Security Council ""to guarantee the withdrawal of Israel from all the occupied Lebanese territories and the violations that are repeated on a daily basis.""

Israel's U.N. Ambassador, Danny Danon, told journalists that Israel would like to see a cease-fire and the return of people to their homes near the border: ""It will happen, either after a war or before a war. We hope it will be before.""

Addressing the Security Council later, he made no mention of a temporary cease-fire but said Israel ""does not seek a full-scale war.""

Both Danon and Mikati reaffirmed their governments' commitment to a Security Council resolution that ended the 2006 Israeli-Hezbollah war. Never fully implemented, it called for a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah, the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Lebanon to be replaced by Lebanese forces and U.N. peacekeepers, and the disarmament of all armed groups including Hezbollah.

Earlier Wednesday, Biden warned in an appearance on ABC's ""The View"" that ""an all-out war is possible"" but said he thinks the opportunity also exists ""to have a settlement that can fundamentally change the whole region.""

Biden suggested that getting Israel and Hezbollah to agree to a cease-fire could help achieve a cessation of hostilities between Israel and Hamas in Gaza.

That war is approaching the one-year mark after Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing about 1,200 people and taking hostages. Israel responded with an offensive that has since killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, who do not provide a breakdown of civilians and fighters in their count.

""It's possible and I'm using every bit of energy I have with my team ... to get this done,"" Biden said. ""There's a desire to see change in the region.""

The U.S. government also raised the pressure with additional sanctions targeting more than a dozen ships and other entities it says were involved in illicit shipments of Iranian petroleum for the financial benefit of Iran's Revolutionary Guard and Hezbollah."
"In the occupied West Bank, Palestinians struggle to access water",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24207/palestinians-west-bank-water-israel,2024-09-25T19:21:26Z,"JORDAN VALLEY, West Bank -- Mansour Arara, 24, sits in the shade of a tree with a group of friends next to the Al-Auja freshwater spring. His young nephew and a friend jump and splash in the cool water. It's a hot July day, nearly 100 degrees, and the sun beats off the dusty landscape around them.

Arara and his friends are boiling water from the spring for tea over a small cooking stove, keeping an eye on the younger boys as they play.

""We were so happy to get here today and not be stopped by the soldiers,"" he says.

This is the fourth spring the group tried to visit today -- the other three were blocked by Israeli settlers with the help of the Israeli military, Arara says. When they tried to come to this spring on other days in the weeks before, he says, Israeli soldiers sent them back.

""They told us that since Oct. 7, we are forbidden from coming here,"" Arara says. Meanwhile, he says he could see Israeli settlers using the spring and collecting water.

For Palestinians living in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, access to water has been a struggle for years. Interim agreements from the 1990s have allowed for a water disparity between Israelis and Palestinians, and Israel's occupation of the West Bank has often meant Israeli settlers' water needs are prioritized over Palestinians'.

But since last Oct. 7, when the Hamas-led attack on Israel sparked the current war in Gaza, water has been even harder to come by. In rural areas, hardline Israeli settlers are taking over freshwater springs. And many Palestinians living in West Bank cities say that tap water now flows much less frequently -- sometimes just once a month. Amid growing violence and economic pain, it's one of the less obvious but fundamental ways life has become more difficult for Palestinians in the West Bank in the past year.

The Al-Auja spring isn't just for cooling off during hot summer days. It's a vital water source to the nearby Palestinian towns, farms and sheep herders. A few months ago, Israeli settlers established a new outpost just a few hundred feet from it. Such outposts are illegal under both Israeli and international law, but increasingly common in the West Bank, as Israeli authorities turn a blind eye -- or in some cases, urge settlers to claim more land.

""I think within a year, [Al-Auja] might be just totally off-limits to Palestinians,"" says Sarit Michaeli, head of international advocacy for B'Tselem, an Israeli human rights organization that tracks abuses in the West Bank.

Michaeli visits the al-Auja spring often. In the weeks since NPR was there in July, she says settlers have encroached even further.

Settlers taking over water sources isn't a new phenomenon, but it has increased dramatically since the war began. Dozens of new settler outposts like the one near Al-Auja have been built since then, often near or around natural water sources traditionally used by Palestinians.

And, Michaeli says, it's not random.

""It's done deliberately in order to take over land,"" she says. ""The settlers talk about it openly. They make videos about it. None of it is a secret. It's done with support, both financial support and also security support of all aspects, all parts of the Israeli government and Israeli authorities.""

Israeli policy in the West Bank -- bolstered by ultranationalist lawmakers who have become powerful in Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government -- encourages the expansion of illegal settlements, and instructs the Israeli police and military to protect them.

In the town of Mazra'a al Gharbieh, 70-year-old Samhan Shreiteh says that for as long as he can remember, every morning, he would go to the water spring nearby to collect water for his family. But last Oct. 8, the day after the war started, he was met at the spring by settlers carrying guns.

""They approached me, they pointed the guns at me, and they said, 'Either you leave now or we'll shoot,'"" he remembers.

Shreiteh says he thought they would kill him. He hasn't been back since -- but he gets close enough to see they're still there, guarding the water.

Losing access to the nearby spring meant Shreiteh's household of 10 now has to rely on water that flows through their taps at home -- something that was already unreliable before Oct. 7 due to persistent water shortages, but now has become even more so.

On this day, the taps are dry. He says there hasn't been water for 20 days. So Shreiteh has to buy water from a water delivery service -- something he's never had to do before -- which the family stores in tanks and buckets outside the house. For this service, he says he's paying five times as much for water as he was before Oct. 7.

He and his family ration water now. They do laundry only once a week, take very limited showers, wash dishes in a big batch at the end of the day, and water their garden only enough to keep it alive.

""I used to work in the garden all day, I would water it every single day,"" he says, standing between rows of olive and lemon trees behind the house. ""But now I sit at home. I only water it once a week, and only if we can afford it.""

In the distance on a hilltop is the established Israeli settlement of Harshan. The steady hammer of construction floats through the air.

""Look, they're building, and we can't even access our land,"" Shreiteh says and points. ""And they have water 24 hours a day.""

In the established Israeli settlements -- legal according to Israel, but still illegal under international law -- the taps don't run dry. That's largely because they're connected to the Israeli water grid. Palestinian cities and towns in the West Bank are not.

Interim peace accords in the 1990s -- which were only supposed to last five years, but are still in effect today -- gave Israel control over 80% of the West Bank's water reserves.

The allocations in those agreements, which haven't changed in 30 years, just aren't enough water for the Palestinians, especially as the occupied West Bank population has nearly doubled since they were signed. Meanwhile, Israel has managed to build a water surplus become a water superpower, due to good planning and investment in desalination technology.

So to make up the difference between water the West Bank has and water it needs, the Palestinian Authority, which governs the West Bank, is forced to purchase water from Mekorot, the national Israeli water company, at several times the cost.

Palestinians also need Israel's permission for virtually any building or maintenance in much of the West Bank, meaning that the Palestinian Authority cannot build a cohesive water grid to allow water-rich areas to easily share with water-poor ones -- or even complete less complicated tasks, like repairing leaky pipes.

All of this has caused a major disparity: A study published by B'Tselem last year found that Israelis, including those living in settlements in the West Bank, on average used 247 liters [65 gallons] of water per day per person -- three times as much as the 82.4 liters [22 gallons] used per Palestinian in the West Bank.

That same study found that nearly all Israelis, including those in settlements, have running water every day, while only about a third of Palestinians in the West Bank do.

But since Oct. 7, Palestinians say it's gotten worse.

""What we feel is that of course there is much less water. That's a fact, and we know it,"" says Dr. Ayman Rabi, executive director of the Palestinian Hydrology Group, an independent organization focused on water access in the West Bank and Gaza.

Water officials across the West Bank estimate that water has been cut by around 35% since Oct. 7. But Rabi says it's hard to know why.

""How is this decision made and what are the grounds for this kind of shortage and cut? Unfortunately, it's really hard to tell. The policy is unclear. But of course, the Palestinians have to suffer from it,"" Rabi says.

Mekorot, the Israeli water company that supplies much of the water to the West Bank, has said it provides water in alignment with the Oslo accords from the 1990s, and directed NPR to the Israeli agency in charge of Palestinian affairs to respond to specific questions about water access in the West Bank. That agency, the Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories or COGAT, denies any reduction in water flow since Oct. 7, placing the blame for shortages on the Palestinian Authority.

The Palestinian Water Authority says Israel has been prioritizing Israeli settlements and reducing the amount of water for the Palestinians.

Meanwhile, throughout the West Bank, Palestinians are increasingly thirsty.

In Ramallah, one of the biggest cities, almost every building has big plastic tanks on the roof -- a way to store water when it does flow to use when it doesn't.

Samer Shini sells those water tanks in Ramallah. On the day NPR visits, he's receiving a new shipment of 10. Shini says they'll sell in less than an hour.

Sure enough, it only takes a few minutes before Abdel Jawad Ewais walks in and buys three to add to the two tanks he already has at home. Ewais, a resident of nearby El-Bireh, says two were enough in past years, but this year, the water comes so infrequently he needs more.

""This year is much worse. Yeah. This year, you know, once a week, we get the water -- three, four hours. And that's it,"" says Ewais, who is Palestinian American, born and raised in Cleveland. ""After October 7, the water decreased a lot, you know -- not just for me, but for everybody. The whole neighborhood.""

Ewais notes it's not just these tanks he has to buy to make up for it. He's also bought a pump and other infrastructure to get the water to flow in his home. All in all, he estimates it has cost him about $1,000 just this year.

""Fortunately I can afford this stuff, because many other people can't,"" he says.

In downtown Ramallah, shopkeeper Adham Nasser sits outside his small store selling elaborately decorated awnings. He lives in a village outside of town and he says his family hasn't had running water in over a month.

He says they have to buy bottled water for all their water needs, including bathing. It's unsustainable for him.

When asked what he'll do if water doesn't flow soon, he replies: ""We will wait for God's relief.""

Nasser worries that in the future there will be no running water for them at all.

""But people are dying in Gaza,"" he says with a sigh. ""So, let them cut our water.""

It's a sentiment you hear often from Palestinians in the West Bank since the war began: As difficult as life gets, at least it's not Gaza."
Justice Department backs UN claim relief workers accused of aiding Hamas are immune,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/justice-department-backs-un-claim-relief-workers-allegedly-involved-hamas-attacks-have-diplomatic-immunity,2024-09-25T16:07:20Z,"Fox News senior national correspondent Rich Edson reports on the president's response to conflicts around the world and his address to the United Nations on 'Special Report.'

The Justice Department (DOJ) has sided with the United Nations in defending in court its relief agency for Palestinians after some workers were found to have likely been involved in the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in Israel.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA) fired at least nine of its employees in August after finding that they likely participated in the Hamas slaughter of 1,200 people, including more than 30 Americans.

Victims of the massacre and their families sued UNRWA in a New York federal court, accusing the group and the individuals involved of aiding and abetting Hamas ""in the commission of international torts.""

The United Nations (U.N.) says the lawsuit should be dismissed, claiming the charter between the U.S. and the U.N. gives the group and its subsidiaries diplomatic immunity. ""Since the U.N. has not waived immunity in this instance, its subsidiary, UNRWA, continues to enjoy absolute immunity from prosecution, and the lawsuit should be dismissed,"" the U.N. stated in response.

UN CHIEF DEFENDS UNRWA, SAYS ONLY 'A FEW ELEMENTS' PARTICIPATED IN OCT. 7

U.S. Attorney Damian Williams of the Southern District of New York filed a brief in July supporting that argument, saying, ""In light of the United Nations' immunity, the Court lacks subject matter jurisdiction over the United Nations.""

The brief notes that ""the United States acknowledges and deplores the profound losses suffered on October 7,"" and that ""the United States takes no position on the factual allegations in the complaint.""

""The United Nations is absolutely immune from suit and legal process absent an express waiver of immunity,"" Williams said, citing the Charter of the United Nations, to which the United States acceded in 1945, that says the U.N. ""shall enjoy in the territory of each of its Members such privileges and immunities as are necessary for the fulfilment [sic] of its purposes.""

Similarly, the individual defendants in the lawsuit also enjoy immunity from suit as U.N. employees, the brief said.

Among other things, the DOJ's brief says that the victims' lawsuit alleges that UNRWA ""knowingly provided monetary and material support to Hamas to build its 'terror infrastructure' leading up to the Oct. 7 attacks, facilitated the construction of Hamas command and control centers, permitted weapons storage in UNRWA facilities, concealed rocket and rocket-launching materials on UNRWA premises, and that that UNRWA chose Hamas-approved textbooks for its schools that were used to indoctrinate children against Israel.""

The suit also alleges UNRWA ""knew several local staff were affiliated with Hamas and paid staff ""in a fashion calculated to further enrich Hamas,"" according to Williams' brief.

UN FORCED TO FIRE 9 EMPLOYEES OVER LIKELY INVOLVEMENT IN HAMAS MASSACRE: 'TIP OF THE ICEBERG'

Mark Goldfeder, director of the National Jewish Advocacy Center, said that DOJ's brief outlining the scope of UNRWA's immunity ""makes a lot of assumptions"" and exhibits a ""lack of appetite on behalf of the executive branch to go after supporters of terror.""

""There are also multiple technical arguments to be made here that UNRWA is not actually immune,"" Goldfeder said in a statement on X, directed at the Justice Department.

""The treaties above are not self-executing; it is only an affiliated organization and was never itself designated under the International Organizations Immunities Act of 1945,"" he continued. ""It saddens me that you chose to simply assume that UNRWA's positions are correct, instead of engaging on any of these points.""

""Perhaps the most egregious assumption you accept is the idea that the claims made by the plaintiffs against all the individual defendants here relate to actions undertaken or omissions made by them in the performance of their official function,"" Goldfeder said.

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY HAMAS TERRORISTS IN GAZA

""To be clear... [the complaint is] chock-full of allegations that these defendants aided and abetted Hamas, and that they did so consciously, voluntarily, and culpably.""

""Is it, pray tell, your contention that all of those actions were what UNRWA was supposed to be doing?"" Goldfeder questioned on the social media platform.

Goldfeder continued in an interview with Fox News Digital, arguing, ""The basic premise of what makes it so absolutely crazy is this - the U.N. is claiming that immunity from civil suits for invading a country and massacring its citizens is necessary for the exercise of its functions. And again, the Biden-Harris administration just filed that they agree. So the point is, if you think that immunity for mass murder is necessary for the U.N. to function, maybe it's time to rethink the U.N. entirely.""

Anne Bayefsky, president of Human Rights Voices and Director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust, says that the practical effect of DOJ's position is ""unaccountabillity"" for UNRWA.

""Regardless of the empty protestations to the contrary, the practical effect of the DOJ position is to contribute to unaccountability for UNRWA and its employees despite their demonstrable connections to Hamas and heinous behavior on multiple fronts,"" Bayefsky said.

""Legally-speaking immunity applies here when employees act within the boundaries of their official capacities. So is the DOJ now arguing that aiding and abetting an officially-designated terrorist organization is UNRWA just doing its job?"" she added.

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY TERRORISTS IN GAZA

When it comes to Israel, the UN isn't interested in easing tensions on Israel's northern and southern borders as much as it is in rewarding terrorism and demonizing the Jewish State. For standing up for itself. For defending its people in a war on seven fronts, orchestrated by the Islamic Republic of Iran, a Shiite supremacist empire hellbent on achieving regional dominance, not diplomacy.

Tehran's proxies -- Hezbollah in the north, Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad in Gaza, the Houthis in Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq and Syria, and

terrorist cells in Judea and Samaria are Tehran's attack dogs, unleashed to

sow death and chaos across the Middle East.

demanding that Israel end its ""unlawful presence in the Palestinian territories"" while calling for sanctions and an arms embargo against Israel -- demonstrates why the United Nations offers little hope for advancing regional peace. The resolution was nothing short of diplomatic terrorism, designed to sabotage real peace efforts by shifting attention away from condemning Hamas for triggering this 11-month war.

Rather than focusing on condemning Hamas for perpetrating the single greatest massacre of Jewish people since the Holocaust, the UN circus has once again adhered to what has now become a predictable, virulently anti-

Israel script.

Peace is hard to come by while the UN remains loath to come to terms with

the sinister reality that one of its agencies, UNRWA in Gaza, has been overrun by Hamas terrorists. For that reason, and for the sake of peace for Israelis and for Gazans, UNRWA must be disbanded.

UNRWA's stated mission is to advance the human development of Palestine

through the achievement of five strategic outcomes, centered on protecting

refugee rights under international law; safeguarding their health; providing

education to school-aged children; offering sufficient opportunities for earning a living; and providing Gazans with basic food and shelter provisions.

But since its founding in 1949, UNRWA has failed miserably in achieving these goals. UNRWA has failed to ameliorate the lives of Gazans, and it has failed to prevent Hamas terrorists from hijacking the agency's operations in Gaza.

How is UNRWA safeguarding the health of Gazans or providing high-quality

education opportunities when it is overrun by terrorists who use schools not to educate but as Hamas command and control centers?

The preponderance of evidence pointing to terrorism at UNRWA has done

little to convince the UN. On Aug. 5, the UN conceded that nine UNRWA

employees likely took part in the Hamas butchering of 1,200 people, which

included more than 30 Americans, on Oct. 7.

Earlier this month, more local UNRWA workers were found to have been disguised as Hamas operatives. On a moral and professional level, UNRWA has failed Palestinians, it has failed Israel, and it has failed the UN.

It is time to deploy a new agency in Gaza that is focused more on humanitarian efforts, and not on activism or, in some cases, terrorism. The latest polio campaign, spearheaded by UNICEF, the World Health Organization and IDF, where more than 600,000 Gazan children were vaccinated, shows that progress is possible when Israel is working with partners interested in humanitarian efforts.

Why Biden's speech at UNGA should set off alarm bells across the globe,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/bidens-speech-unga-should-set-off-alarm-bells-across-globe,2024-09-25T14:08:10Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

President Biden's swan song on the world stage Tuesday at the United Nations General Assembly was a sad demonstration of American weakness and the failed foreign policies of the Biden-Harris administration.

Knowing full well that Iran is the leading state sponsor of terror, responsible for the escalation of instability and hatred on a global scale, the president spent two sentences of his lengthy speech on Iran. He repeated the mantra that Iran will never obtain a nuclear weapon, despite the fact that even the UN's Atomic Energy Agency and everybody listening, knows that under his watch Iran has already become a threshold nuclear power.

President Biden spent more time talking about Gaza than any other specific conflict, notwithstanding the hundreds of millions of people in horrific conditions in conflicts and in countries that the U.N. routinely ignores because the Jewish state is their favorite whipping boy.

And how did Biden talk about ""the Middle East""? Adopting the U.N. narrative, he demanded: ""ease the suffering in Gaza"" and made no mention of the suffering in Israel.

BIDEN ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

While he noted that the families of the hostages are going through hell - alongside ""the innocent civilians in Gaza"" - what about the suffering of all the families of the members of the Israeli Defense Forces killed by Palestinian terrorists or serving on the front lines every day to defend the nation from fiendish adversaries? What about the suffering of millions of Israelis forced to cower in bomb shelters over and over again from the incessant rocket fire?

President Biden then lost his moral compass entirely. He addressed the immediate situation in Lebanon and said: ""too many on each side of the Israeli-Lebanon border remain displaced."" Tens of thousands of Israelis have been displaced from their homes in northern Israel for almost a year because of unprovoked Hezbollah-Iranian attacks. And within one week of Israel finally saying ""enough"" to those attacks and to the imminent catastrophic danger posed by Iran and its proxy, Biden points to displaced Lebanese.

Displaced why? Because Hezbollah has been operating from their homes and neighborhoods and using them as cannon fodder. The moral relativism from the Democratic president of the United States should set off alarm bells.

Adopting yet another U.N. storyline, Biden then told the world to ""address the rise of violence against innocent Palestinians on the West Bank"" - as if there were no rise of violence in the form of Palestinian terror attacks against innocent Israeli Jews for the alleged crime of being Jews in the West Bank, and no Palestinian Authority egging on the terrorists in the West Bank with financial rewards.

In an ominous sign for a President Harris, here's what President Biden didn't take his last opportunity to mention: the global spread of antisemitism. Antisemitism that is promoted and incited by the United Nations and those in his General Assembly audience. Antisemitism that is now doing enormous damage to a tolerant and peaceful America. Antisemitism that fuels the Iranian threat to world peace.

Instead, the Biden-Harris administration issued platitudes about ""common hope"" and ""cooperation"" that are not only commonplace at every U.N. General Assembly gathering but enthusiastically espoused by America's enemies from that same podium.

Opinion | Trump's remarkable endorsement from this Muslim leader ought to alarm Harris,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/muslim-mayor-endorses-donald-trump-rcna172310,2024-09-25T10:40:39Z,"Amer Ghalib, a Muslim immigrant from Yemen and the mayor of Hamtramck, Mich., called Trump ""a man of principles"" and said Harris hasn't addressed his community's concerns.

Amer Ghalib, a Muslim immigrant from Yemen who serves as the mayor of Hamtramck, Michigan -- made headlines this week by endorsing Donald Trump for president. In a Facebook post, Ghalib wrote, ""President Trump and I may not agree on everything, but I know he is a man of principles."" He also called him ""the right choice for this critical time.""

If Ghalib -- a self-described conservative Democrat -- had endorsed Trump in 2020, then he likely would have been subjected to a swift backlash. As a candidate and as a president, Trump had weaponized hate against Muslim and Arab Americans and targeted us with his ""Muslim travel ban"" that in many cases separated families. And Ghalib seems to have braced for a backlash in his endorsement. He wrote, ""I'll not regret my decision no matter what the outcome would be, and I'm ready to face the consequences.""

But even though 81% of voters in Hamtramck, a majority-Muslim city, cast their ballots for Biden in 2020, there appears to have been no notable outrage to Ghalib throwing his support to Trump. That should concern Vice President Kamala Harris and her campaign. There are large Muslim and Arab populations in Michigan, obviously, but also in Pennsylvania, Georgia and Virginia.

Ghalib said Trump recently met with him for 20 minutes when he was holding a rally in Michigan. Ghalib, a vocal critic of the Biden administration's seemingly blind support of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's devastating war in Gaza, cited that as a main driver of his decision. ""We asked multiple times that they should change course, but nothing happened,"" he told reporters. ""Kamala Harris is still going in the same path and nothing was addressed."" Ghalib claims Trump, without providing details, promised to end the war. But even if Trump did, given his anti-Palestinian record as president, we know that it would be consistent with the goals of Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, not the Palestinian people.

According to a recent poll of Muslim voters by Council of American-Islamic Relations, only 11% of Muslim voters nationwide said they planned to support Trump in November. Ghalib's endorsement notwithstanding, the news isn't that Muslims are supporting Trump; it's that they're not supporting Harris. Winning about 30% of Muslim's votes, she was , according to that poll, statistically tied with Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Contrast Harris polling at 30% among Muslim voters with the estimated 69% of Arab or Muslim voters across the country who voted for Biden in 2020.

As a Muslim voter who is clear about the harm Trump will cause, this is worrisome -- but not unexpected. Harris began her campaign inheriting a palpable anger directed at Biden within the Muslim and Arab community for his bear hug of Netanyahu and his continuing refusal to slow down the supply of weapons to Israel's military despite the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent people. But when Biden dropped out and Harris became the Democratic nominee, there was a fresh start. Many in these communities wanted to support Harris -- and many are.

But the Uncommitted Movement leaders told NBC News last week that Harris had given them the ""cold shoulder"" and ""fumbled"" by refusing even the ""small gesture"" of allowing a Palestinian American speaker at August's Democratic National Convention.

That said, unlike Ghalib, ""Uncommitted Movement"" leaders in Michigan announced that while they were not endorsing Harris, their top priority was defeating Trump. They said Trump's agenda includes ""plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organizing."" As a result, they explained point blank, ""We must block Donald Trump, which is why we urge Uncommitted voters to vote against him and avoid third-party candidates that could inadvertently boost his chances.""

Georgia state Rep. Ruwa Romaan, a Palestinian American, was one of the people on the short list to speak at the DNC but was effectively blocked by Harris and the Democratic Party. Romaan told me in an email that Ghalib's endorsement of Trump ""does not represent the overwhelming majority of Muslim voters."" But she added that the Harris campaign is missing an opportunity to animate ""a multifaith, multiracial, multigenerational coalition whose ask is simple: stop the bombs and uphold international humanitarian law"" when it comes to Netanyahu and his military.

Romaan, a first-term Democratic lawmaker in the battleground state of Georgia, said there is still time for Harris to address this issue. If she does, Romaan added, it will lead to a ""decisive edge come November.""

While the suffering in Gaza doesn't get the same headlines it got earlier this year, that suffering is still top of mind for many in the Arab and Muslim communities and our allies. Because the suffering is ongoing. Saturday, the Israeli military launched missiles at a school they claim was being utilized by Hamas and, according to CNN, killed at least 22 people, mostly women and children. ""There was no warning. We were sitting in the schools, and suddenly missiles started raining down on us,"" a witness told a CNN reporter. ""Where is the conscience?""

Beyond Gaza, we are now seeing an alarming and deadly escalation of Israeli military action in Lebanon that has killed more than 500 people and displaced thousands. Israel and Iran-backed Hezbollah have been bombarding each other since the Oct. 7 terrorist attack by Hamas sparked Israel's invasion of Gaza. This could get far worse. UNICEF warned Tuesday that ""any further escalation in this conflict would be catastrophic"" for children and families in Lebanon. If the media is again filled with images of dead women and children caused by Netanyahu's use of U.S. weaponry, Harris will have to denounce this or risk losing even more support from communities that Democrats have depended on for victory.

During her acceptance speech at the DNC, Harris spoke about Palestinians in a way that no Democratic presidential nominee ever has. She described the ""the scale of suffering"" in Gaza as ""heartbreaking."" She not only committed to not only to working toward a ceasefire -- which she first called for in March, well before Biden -- but she also vowed to ensure the ""Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination.""

In contrast, Trump has repeatedly used the word ""Palestinian"" as a slur to attack Democrats who express concern for the brutal suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. As President, he cut millions of dollars in vital aid to Palestinians as Netanyahu urged him. And during the Gaza war, Trump vocally criticized Harris's calls for a ceasefire--with his primary concern not being the slaughter of Palestinians but that Israel was ""absolutely losing the PR war.""

Trump is as pro-Netanyahu and anti-Palestinian as they come. He may have locked up the endorsement of the Mayor of Hamtramck, but thankfully the bigoted Trump will not win a majority of Muslim and Arab American voters in 2024. Yet in a close race, even peeling away a few percentages from these two communities could hand Trump a victory. That is why Harris needs to step up to address the policy concerns of these two communities now. Not just for the good of the Arab and Muslim communities, but for the benefit of all Americans who want to see Trump defeated."
Will The Israel-Hezbollah Fight Trigger A New Civil War In Lebanon?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melikkaylan/2024/09/25/will-the-israel-hezbollah-fight-trigger-a-new-civil-war-in-lebanon/,2024-09-25T08:32:17Z,"The fighting between Israel and the Hezbollah Shiite militias across the border threatens to trigger another civil war in Lebanon. Shiite refugees from the war zone in Lebanon's south are fleeing to nearby Christian and Druze communities - who are blocking the mass entry of said refugees into their areas. Which could easily lead to a confrontation between those communities and Hezbollah, leading in turn to a nationwide conflagration. This time around, the power balances could shift and leave a thoroughly transformed country and region. Let us look at the implications.

The last Lebanese civil war lasted 15 years, caused 150,000 fatalities and ended in 1990. It started with strife between (largely Maronite) Lebanese Christians and Palestinian Muslim refugees whose population had grown sufficiently to create a Muslim majority in the country which included local Sunnis and Shiites. So the Christian pro-Western faction allied with Israel faced a coalition made of pan-Arabists, Muslims and leftists. Yes leftists - it was the height of the Cold War and any tendency sympathetic to the West was instantly associated with imperialism. Those opposing were associated with liberation, revolution and Soviet-aligned countries of the time such as Syria, Iraq and Libya. It sounds like ancient history, a time when the world became familiar with arcane terms like Druze, Maronite and PLO.

That's a very crude sketch because alliances shifted constantly and non-aligned Iran entered the fray, ultimately becoming the dominant force in the country via its Shiite proxy Hezbollah. At one point, in the Reagan era, the US tried to intervene, sent in troops, and was driven out by truck bombs and guerrilla warfare. Strange to say, tired of the civil war's constant threat of instability to a strategically important oil-producing region, the West acceded to an outcome that favored its opponents. Over time, Syria and Iran came out the winners in Lebanon. The US tacitly allowed Lebanese banks to operate with lax regulations to allow rapid capitalization and reconstruction. As a result, money-laundering and contraband material at the ports became increasingly commonplace, lasting to this day, notably in aid of Hezbollah. Dark money from around the world flowed into the country, even from drug cartels. This corruption had global effects with Hezbollah establishing a presence in Venezuela and entering the gold, oil, narco and other markets that benefit the Maduro heirarchy. Meanwhile, not surprisingly, any attempts at sanctioning, say, Syria proved useless because of neighboring Lebanon's open back door to the world.

A lot has changed since the first Lebanese civil war, and some things have changed back again. The Soviet Union collapsed and the international leftist bien-pensant bloc disappeared, as did the Iraqi and Libyan regimes. Syria went to pieces. But Iranian influence has stayed and Russia is back both in Syria and potentially as a supporter of Iran in Lebanon, but remains increasingly neutered by its distraction in Ukraine. Anti-Western pan-Arabism is not a significant force any more, neither is any appeal to national liberation because, after all, the Mullahs in Tehran run Hezbollah while Russia has troops in Syria. Certainly anti-Israeli sentiment is widespread again in Lebanon, for now that is, until internal factionalism complicates sympathies down the line. And there's the rub - because if there's a distinct possibility of renewed civil war there's also a strong possibility of power realignments and changed outcomes.

While many Lebanese might currently agree on the bad guy being Israel, not least for potentially destabilizing the country, absolutely no national consensus exists on who constitutes the good guys. That means no ideological unity on 'resistance', on defending Arab land, on Hezbollah as heroic defenders of last resort. Many quietly feel that Israel might even provide the impetus for throwing off the Hezbollah/Iran yoke that has frozen the country's destiny for decades. Viewed from a very hard-headed perspective - not uncommon in the region - Israel's depletion of Hezbollah's military and financial resources might mean liberation from the old civil war's legacy.

For that to happen, two options obtain. 1)A rival power like the West must replace Iran as a cohering presence but that seems unlikely with the current focus on Ukraine and Taiwan. 2) Israel needs to launch a diplomatic offensive for regional allied states to fill the vacuum of a depleted Hezbollah. Otherwise, the age-old criticism will apply - that Israel has the power to make war but not to make lasting peace in its vicinity, to demolish but not to reconstitute and therefore ends up in endless wars with no permanent security. Who might those states be? Certainly the Abraham Accords countries, with possibly Turkey and Egypt included. None would be seen dead helping Bibi Netanyahu in the current climate but if the incentive is to replace Iran as hegemon, and parade as peacemakers, especially after an extended period of civil war, then the outlook might change."
Hezbollah fires missile at Tel Aviv after heavy Israeli strikes on Lebanon,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/g-s1-24452/hezbollah-fires-missile-tel-aviv,2024-09-25T07:28:40Z,"BEIRUT -- Hezbollah launched a ballistic missile at Tel Aviv early Wednesday, in a further escalation after Israel carried out strikes on Lebanon that killed hundreds of people and the militants fired rockets across wider areas of northern Israel.

The Israeli military said it intercepted the surface-to-surface missile, which set off air raid sirens in Tel Aviv and across central Israel, and there were no reports of casualties or damage. The military said it struck the site in southern Lebanon from which the projectile was launched.

Hezbollah said it fired a Qader 1 ballistic missile targeting the headquarters of Israel's Mossad intelligence agency, which it blames for a recent string of targeted killings of its top commanders and for an attack last week in which bombs hidden in pagers and walkie-talkies killed dozens of people and wounded thousands, including many Hezbollah members.

The Israeli military said it was the first time a projectile fired from Lebanon had reached central Israel. Hezbollah claimed to have targeted an intelligence base near Tel Aviv last month in an aerial attack, but there was no confirmation. The Palestinian Hamas militant group in Gaza repeatedly targeted Tel Aviv in the opening months of the war.

The launch ratcheted up tensions as the region appears to be teetering toward another all-out war, even as Israel continues to battle Hamas in the Gaza Strip. A wave of Israeli strikes on Monday and Tuesday killed at least 560 people in Lebanon and forced thousands to seek refuge.

Families have fled southern Lebanon, flocking to Beirut and the coastal city of Sidon, sleeping in schools turned into shelters, as well as in cars, parks and along the beach. Some sought to leave the country, causing a traffic jam at the border with Syria.

Israel said late Tuesday that fighter jets carried out ""extensive strikes"" on Hezbollah weapons and rocket launchers across southern Lebanon and in the Bekaa region to the north. The military has said it has no immediate plans for a ground invasion but has declined to give a timetable for the air campaign.

Tensions between Israel and the Lebanese militant group have steadily escalated over the last 11 months. Hezbollah has been firing rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza and its ally Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group.

Israel has responded with increasingly heavy airstrikes and the targeted killing of Hezbollah commanders while threatening a wider operation.

The U.N. Security Council scheduled an emergency meeting on Lebanon for Wednesday at the request of France.

Nearly a year of fighting between Hezbollah and Israel had already displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the border before this week's escalation. Israel has vowed to do whatever it takes to ensure its citizens can return to their homes in the north, while Hezbollah has said it will keep up its rocket attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, something which appears increasingly remote.

Israel has moved thousands of troops who had been serving in Gaza to the northern border. It says Hezbollah has some 150,000 rockets and missiles, including some capable of striking anywhere in Israel, and that the group has fired some 9,000 rockets and drones since last October.

Cross-border exchanges began ramping up on Sunday in the wake of the pager and walkie-talkie bombings, which killed 39 people and wounded nearly 3,000, many of them civilians. Lebanon blamed Israel, but Israel did not confirm or deny responsibility.

On Sunday, Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel.

The next day, Israel said its warplanes struck 1,600 Hezbollah targets, destroying cruise missiles, long- and short-range rockets and attack drones, including weapons concealed in private homes. The strikes racked up the highest one-day death toll in Lebanon since Israel and Hezbollah fought a bruising monthlong war in 2006.

An Israeli airstrike in Beirut on Tuesday killed Ibrahim Kobeisi, who Israel described as a top Hezbollah commander with the group's rocket and missile unit. Military officials said Kobeisi was responsible for launches towards Israel and planned a 2000 attack in which three Israeli soldiers were kidnapped and killed. Hezbollah later confirmed his death.

It was the latest in a string of assassinations and other setbacks for Hezbollah, which is Lebanon's strongest political and military actor and is widely considered the top paramilitary force in the Arab world.

Lebanon's Health Ministry said six people were killed and 15 were wounded in the strike in a southern Beirut suburb, an area where Hezbollah has a strong presence. The country's National News Agency said the attack destroyed three floors of a six-story apartment building.

The U.N.'s High Commissioner for Refugees in Lebanon said one of its staffers and her young son were among those killed Monday in the Bekaa region, while a cleaner under contract was killed in a strike in the south.

Hezbollah fired 300 rockets on Tuesday, injuring six Israeli soldiers and civilians, most of them lightly, according to the Israeli military.

The Lebanese Health Ministry said at least 564 people have been killed in Israeli strikes since Monday, including 50 children and 94 women, and that more than 1,800 have been wounded, a staggering toll for a country still reeling from the deadly pager and walkie-talkie bombings last week."

(Credit: Reuters)

United Kingdom Prime Minister Keir Starmer made an unfortunate gaffe during a speech at his party's conference Tuesday when he mistakenly called for the return of ""sausages,"" instead of hostages, held by Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

Starmer was speaking at the Labour Party's annual conference in Liverpool when he called for a de-escalation between Lebanon and Israel, as well as a cease-fire in Gaza.

He also called for the return of hostages being held by the terror group when he slipped up, before quickly recovering.

""I call again for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza, the return of the sausages -- the hostages -- and a recommitment to the two-state solution: a recognized Palestinian state alongside a safe and secure Israel,"" he said.

The mistake quickly went viral.

During his remarks, Starmer was also heckled by a spectator in the audience who shouted about Gaza.

""This guy's obviously got a pass from the 2019 conference. We've changed the party,"" Starmer joked in response, Reuters reported. ""While he's been protesting, we've been changing the party. That's why we've got a Labour government.""

Multiple hostages are still being held in Gaza nearly a year after the group attacked Israeli communities Oct. 7, sparking the latest conflict between Hamas and the Jewish state.

Israel has proposed ending the war if Hamas releases the remaining hostages, along with the demilitarization of Gaza and the establishment of an alternative governing body. Hamas has rejected several offers to end the conflict.

Israel has bombarded Gaza and pledged to hunt down those responsible for the deadly attack. Meanwhile, it has also had to defend itself on a second front against shelling in its north from Iran-backed Hezbollah in Lebanon.

He said the proceeds of the event held at Seward Park Amphitheater would go to various groups, including the controversial agency known as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian Refugees (UNRWA).

Israeli officials have declared that UNRWA is strongly tied to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The U.N. itself announced in August that nine UNRWA staffers would be fired due to possible involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel.

Maher Joudi, the event's organizer, told The South Seattle Emerald the event was purely to support Palestinians.

""The only thing I want anybody to take away from this is - anything that we do in this space is 1,000% for Palestine,"" he told the outlet. ""It is in service of Palestine and those that are fighting every day. We do what we can on this side. And I think as long as we're centering and framing all the work that we do as being in service of them, then we're doing the work.""

Macklemore dropped an anti-Israel song in May titled ""Hind's Hall,"" referring to the Columbia University building that students occupied and renamed in honor of a 6-year-old Palestinian girl killed in the Israel-Gaza war. The song praised the anti-Israel encampments and protests on college campuses across the country and called out President Biden, the police and the music industry.

The rapper this month dropped a second version of the song that now calls out Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee when Biden backed out of the race in July.

It's been nearly a year since Hamas terrorists entered Israel and killed, raped and took hostage hundreds of people. It sparked Israel's ongoing war in the region and no cease-fire appears to be in sight.

The tone was set Tuesday in the hall of the United Nations in New York City after the General Assembly reacted to Secretary-General António Guterres' contempt for Israel's attacks in Gaza, but sat silent during his condemnation of Hamas' near-year-long capture of Israeli hostages.

""Let's be clear, nothing can justify the abhorrent acts of terror committed by Hamas on Oct. 7 or the taking of hostages, both of which I have repeatedly condemned,"" he said as the General Assembly sat and watched. ""And nothing can justify the collective punishment of the Palestinian people.""

The secretary-general's comments were followed by applause by the international body before he continued and said, ""The speed and scale of the killing and destruction in Gaza are unlike anything in my years as Secretary-General.""

BIDEN ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, immediately called out the international body for ""hypocrisy"" following its resounding condemnation of Israel's fight in Gaza.

""When the U.N. secretary-general speaks about the release of our hostages, the U.N. assembly is silent, but when he speaks about the suffering in Gaza, he receives thunderous applause,"" he said in a statement. ""This is the opening signal for the annual charade of hypocrisy.""

The tone of the overall assembly was particularly dark after Guterres warned the ""state of our world is unstainable"" and said, ""We can't go on like this.""

But despite the range of issues he addressed, including the more than two-year war in Ukraine, the civil war in Sudan, female oppression worldwide, the wrath of climate change and global hunger, it was the war in Gaza that dominated the addresses that followed.

The President of Brazil, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, who opened the assembly's debate following Guterres' opening remarks, called out Israel and argued that it is Jerusalem's fault there are still 101 hostages in the hands of Hamas.

""There have been over 40,000 fatal victims, mostly women and children,"" the Brazilian president said regarding the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza, though the figure does not differentiate between civilians and Hamas terrorists killed. ""The right to defense has become the right to vengeance, which prevents an agreement for the release of the hostages and postpones the ceasefire.""

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who has long been critical of Israel, openly drew parallels between Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Nazi leader Adolf Hilter and called Israeli prisons ""concentration camps.""

""Just as Hitler was stopped by an alliance of humanity, Netanyahu and his murder network must be stopped by an alliance of humanity,"" Edrogan said.

Erdogan, like the other nations who followed him, accused Israel of flouting international law and questioned when the nations of the U.N. were going to do something about it.

""I call out to the United Nations Security Council, what are you waiting for to prevent the genocide in Gaza?"" He questioned before positioning his next question at nations like the U.S.: ""How long are you going to be able to carry the shame of witnessing this massacre?""

When asked by Fox News Digital about the overall tone of the morning's debate, the Israeli ambassador to the U.N. called it ""shameful"" and said it was the ""most hostile"" environment he has seen in his roughly 10 years of attending the general debate.

The King of Jordan, Abdullah II bin Al-Hussein, echoed the warnings issued by Guterres and said the U.N. is ""under attack,"" arguing Israel's continued assault with the backing of the U.S. was to blame.

""I cannot recall a time of greater peril than this,"" he said. ""Our United Nations is facing a crisis that strikes at its very legitimacy and threatens a collapse of global trust and moral authority.""

""For years, the global community has taken the path of least resistance, accepting the status quo of the ongoing military occupation of Palestinians all the while paying lip service to the two-state solution,"" Al-Hussein added in direct reference to comments made by President Biden just minutes prior.

""We oppose violence and the targeting of innocent civilians by any party,"" he said. ""But after a year of the war...it is no longer tenable to talk about Israel's right to defend itself in this context without being complicit in justifying the crime.""

Like his predecessors, the Qatari leader argued that Israel's allowance by the international community to continue to carry out strikes in Gaza questions the legitimacy of the United Nations as a whole and has ""inflicted serious damage on the credibility of the post-World War II concepts on which the international community was founded.""

Qatar has played a major role alongside the U.S. and Egypt in an attempt to engage Hamas and Israel in cease-fire negotiations. Though he argued this will not be achieved until Israel stops its occupation in not only Gaza, but elsewhere.

""There is no point in talking about security, peace, and stability in the Middle East region...if not backed by concrete steps leading to an immediate ceasefire and an end to the Israeli occupation of all Arab territories,"" he said in reference to Palestinian lands identified under U.N. Resolution 181, like Gaza and the West Bank, as well as the Golan Heights which Israel seized from Syria following the Six Days War in 1967."
UNICEF USA BrandVoice: Children's Lives At Risk As Armed Conflict Intensifies In Lebanon And Israel,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/unicefusa/2024/09/24/childrens-lives-at-risk-as-armed-conflict-escalates-in-lebanon-and-israel/,2024-09-24T17:48:32Z,"Cross-border shelling and air raids threaten children's lives and mental health

UNICEF is working with partners to provide urgent assistance to children and families caught in rising hostilities between Israel and the armed group Hezbollah. The protracted cross-border conflict escalated drastically on Sept. 23, reportedly killing nearly 500 people, including at least 35 children -- and injuring more than 1,600.

""I am deeply alarmed by the ongoing surge of deadly attacks in Lebanon and Israel, which earlier today reportedly claimed the lives of at least 24 children in southern Lebanon,"" UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell said in a press statement on Sept. 23. ""The intensifying violence represents a dangerous escalation for civilians in the area.""

""Countless more children are in danger, with thousands of families displaced from their homes, and attacks on civilian infrastructure,"" Russell continued. ""Alarming levels of psychological distress have been reported among children in both countries, stemming not only from their sudden displacement but also from the barrage of shelling and air raids which have become their daily reality for nearly a year.""

Prior to the onset of the current conflict, Lebanon's health care system was already on the verge of collapse. As the number of injured rises, UNICEF is dispatching lifesaving medical supplies and commodities to overstretched hospitals facing severe shortages and supply stock-outs in Lebanon.

By Sept. 23, UNICEF had procured and delivered a total of 100 tons of emergency medical supplies to Lebanon's Ministry of Public Health for distribution to public and private hospitals, especially those in conflict-affected areas.

UNICEF also continues to be concerned about the mental health impacts on children in Israel. Learn more about where UNICEF works here.

""Schools are closed today across the country, leaving children at home in fear,"" Ettie Higgins, UNICEF Representative in Lebanon, said in a Geneva Palais briefing on Sept. 24. ""Their caregivers are themselves afraid of the uncertainty of the situation. This fear cannot be overstated, as the barrage of shelling and air raids continue, and increase, daily.""

""Any further escalation in this conflict would be catastrophic for all children in Lebanon, but especially families from villages and towns in the south and the Bekaa, in eastern Lebanon, who have been forced to leave their homes,"" Higgins continued. ""These newly displaced add to the 112,000 people who have been displaced since October.""

Higgins said 87 new shelters are accommodating the growing numbers of internally displaced people. UNICEF is preparing to deliver food, water and essential supplies such as mattresses and hygiene kits to displaced families, especially those in collective shelters.

The conflict is the latest crisis to impact Lebanon, which has been devastated by the Port of Beirut explosion, the impact of COVID-19, conflicts in surrounding countries and a crippling, five-year economic downturn.

Over half the population lives in poverty. An estimated one in seven people in Lebanon are refugees, mostly Palestinian and Syrian -- the highest per capita concentration of refugees in the world.

UNICEF has been on the ground in Lebanon for more than 70 years, working with partners to meet children's basic needs. Since the onset of the conflict, UNICEF has deployed extensive resources to support the resilience of displaced families and mitigate the impact of displacement, including:

UNICEF is urging all parties to the conflict to:

""All parties must uphold their obligations under international humanitarian law to protect civilians, civilian infrastructure, humanitarian workers and medical personnel,"" said Russell. ""This includes facilitating the safe movement of civilians seeking safety. UNICEF urgently calls for an immediate de-escalation."""
"Biden defends withdrawing from Afghanistan, dropping re-election bid in last UN address as president",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-defends-withdrawing-afghanistan-dropping-re-election-bid-last-un-address-president,2024-09-24T15:38:17Z,"NEW YORK CITY -- President Biden, in his final address to the United Nation's General Assembly, warned that the world is at an ""inflection point,"" while defending his decision to withdraw from Afghanistan and his move to suspend his re-election campaign.

Biden delivered his fourth and final speech to the assembly as President of the United States on Tuesday, addressing leaders and representatives from 134 countries around the globe.

""Today is the fourth time I've had the great honor of speaking to this assembly as President of the United States,"" Biden said Tuesday morning. ""It'll be my last.""

Biden reflected on the global order when he was first elected as a U.S. senator in 1972, saying the world was at ""an inflection point"" and a ""moment of tension and uncertainty.""

BIDEN ADDRESSES UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

""The world was divided by the Cold War; the Middle East was headed toward war; America was at war in Vietnam at that point -- the longest war in America's history,"" Biden said. ""Our country was divided and angry, and there were questions about our staying power and our future. But even then, I entered public life not out of despair, but out of optimism.""

Biden said when he was elected president, the world was in ""another moment of crisis and uncertainty,"" referring to the ongoing U.S. presence in Afghanistan.

""We were attacked on 9/11 by Al Qaeda and Osama bin Laden. We brought him justice. Then I came to the presidency in another moment of crisis and uncertainty,"" Biden said. ""I believed America had to look forward--new challenges, new threats, new opportunities were in front of us.""

Biden said he needed to put the United States ""in a position to see the threats, to deal with the challenges, and to seize the opportunities as well.""

""We needed to end the war that began on 9/11,"" Biden said. ""I came to office as president, with Afghanistan to replace Vietnam as America's longest war.""

""I was determined to end it,"" he siad. ""And I did.""

Biden said it was a ""hard decision but the right decision.""

""Four American presidents had faced that decision, but I was determined not to leave it to a fifth,"" Biden said, while acknowledging the decision was ""accompanied by tragedy,"" as 13 U.S. servicemembers lost their lives, along with hundreds of Afghan civilians in a suicide bombing outside of Kabul Airport during the withdrawal.

But under the Biden-Harris administration, officials have sought diplomacy amid global instability and fears of a growing war in the Middle East, especially following its botched withdrawal from Afghanistan, the years-long Russia-Ukraine war, the growing threat from Iran's nuclear development, increased aggression from China, and a crisis at the U.S. southern border.

""I truly believe we're at another inflection point in world history, where the choices we make today will determine our future for decades to come,"" Biden said Tuesday. ""We stand behind the principles that unite us; we stand firm against aggression; we end the conflicts that are raging today. We take on global challenges like climate change, hunger and disease.""

Also under his administration, in 2022, Russian President Vladimir Putin invaded Ukraine.

""The good news is Putin's war has failed,"" Biden said, while adding though, that the world ""cannot grow weary"" and ""cannot look away"" or ""let up on our support for Ukraine.""

As for increasing aggression in China, Biden said there is a need to continue to ""responsibly manage the competition with China so it does not veer into conflict.""

Biden stressed that he is working to ""bring a greater measure of peace and stability to the Middle East.""

""The world must not flinch from the horrors of October 7th - any country would have the right responsibility to ensure that such attack can never happen again,"" Biden said, referring to Hamas' brutal terror attack in Israel. ""Thousands of armed Hamas terrorists invaded a sovereign state, slaughtering and massacring more than 1200 people, including 46 Americans in their homes and at a music festival, the despicable acts of sexual violence, 250 innocents taken hostage.""

Biden said he has met with the families of those hostages.

""I grieve with them,"" he said. ""They're going through hell.""

UN CHIEF DEFENDS UNRWA, SAYS ONLY 'A FEW ELEMENTS' PARTICIPATED IN OCT 7

But Biden said, ""Innocent civilians in Gaza are also going through hell.""

Biden pointed to the ceasefire and hostage deal his administration has worked on with Qatar and Egypt.

""Now it is time for the parties to finalize terms, bring the hostages home, secure Israel and Gaza free of Hamas' grip, ease the suffering in Gaza and end this war,"" he said.

Biden stressed that his administration has been ""determined to prevent a wider war that engulfs the entire region.""

""A full scale war is not in anyone's interest,"" he said. ""Even as the situation has escalated, a diplomatic solution is still possible.""

""In fact, it remains the only path to lasting security,"" Biden continued, so that ""the residents from both countries return to their homes.""

""That's what we're working tirelessly to achieve,"" Biden said.

But as for the war in Gaza, Biden, notably, did not mention rising antisemitism in the United States and around the globe since the Oct. 7 attacks, but instead, discussed the ""rise of violence against innocent Palestinians on the West Bank.""

Biden said the world needs to work towards ""a two-state solution where the world -- where Israel enjoys security and peace and full recognition and normalize relations with all its neighbors; and with Palestinians, living securely with dignity and self-determination in a state of their own.""

Meanwhile, Biden declared the need to continue to ensure Iran will ""never obtain a nuclear weapon.""

As he closed his, likely, final address to the world, Biden said he and world leaders ""must never forget who we're here to represent--We the people.""

UN'S 'PACT FOR THE FUTURE' FULL OF EMPTY PROMISES, WILL BE 'CUDGEL' TO ATTACK THE UNITED STATES, EXPERT WARNS

""These are the first words of our Constitution. The very idea of America. They inspired the opening words of the UN charter. I made the preservation of democracy the central cause of my presidency,"" Biden said.

Biden explained his decision to suspend his 2024 re-election campaign, calling it a ""difficult decision.""

""Being president has been the honor of my life. There is so much more I want to get done,"" Biden said, but urged world leaders not to forget that ""some things are more important than staying in power.""

""It's your people. It is your people that matter most,"" Biden said. ""We are here to serve the people, not the other way around, because the future will be won by those who unleash the full potential of their people to breathe free, to think freely, to innovate, to educate, to live in love openly without fear.""

He added: ""That's the soul of democracy. It does not belong to any one country. I've seen it all around the world.""

Biden stressed the ""remarkable the power of 'We the people.'""

""It makes me more optimistic about the future than I've ever been since I was first elected to the United States Senate in 1972. Every age faces challenges,"" Biden said. ""I saw it as a young man. I see it today. But we are stronger than we think. We're stronger together than alone.""

He added: ""My fellow leaders, there's nothing that's beyond our capacity. If we work together, let's work together."""

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian is set to address the United Nations General Assembly (UNGA) Tuesday afternoon in New York City amid a wash of stories involving Tehran's involvement in assassination attempts against U.S. politicians and election interference.

Pezeshkian, who turned heads this week for his 40-member strong delegation which reportedly includes his adult children, has already made headlines upon his arrival for comments he made suggesting Israel is looking to start an all-out war in the Middle East by turning Lebanon into the next Gaza.

BIDEN TO ADDRESS UN GENERAL ASSEMBLY FOR LAST TIME AS DICTATORS, DESPOTS COME TO NEW YORK

""We do not wish to be the cause of instability in the Middle East as its consequences would be irreversible,"" he told reporters Monday, according to Reuters. ""We want to live in peace, we don't want war.

""It is Israel that seeks to create this all-out conflict,"" he added.

His comments to the General Assembly are expected to largely focus on the ongoing fight in the Middle East as Israel finds itself pitted against Iran's terror proxies Hamas and Hezbollah.

Pezeshkian's comments are likely to draw focus on the high number of Palestinian civilians killed in Gaza, and recently the Israeli airstrikes in Lebanon, where nearly 500 people were killed, according to Lebanon's Health Ministry, reported the BBC early Tuesday. It's not known how many of the dead are Hezbollah terrorists.

IRAN TRIED TO INFLUENCE ELECTION BY SENDING STOLEN MATERIAL FROM TRUMP CAMPAIGN TO BIDEN'S CAMP, FBI SAYS

While the U.N. has condemned Israeli attacks on civilians, the Iranian president's comments are likely to ring hollow among some at the international body as Tehran has substantially backed the terrorist organizations that have engaged in the fight against the Jewish state.

There is the other matter of Tehran's exposed plot to assassinate Donald Trump, as well as potentially President Biden, Nikki Haley, along with other ""politicians, military people or bureaucrats,"" according to FBI documents released by Sen. Charles Grassley, R-Iowa, earlier this month.

The FBI further confirmed last week that Iran hackers attempted to supply the Democratic presidential campaign with stolen communication files from the Trump campaign.

While it appears the Iranian attempts to mimic the Russia-style hack-and-leak operations utilized during the 2016 campaign was a failed push to cause turmoil in the U.S. ahead of the elections, the assassination plot was likely due to the 2020 killing of Gen. Qasem Soleimani during Trump's time as president.

Pezeshkian's trip to the U.S. for the top U.N. meeting drew condemnation from U.S. lawmakers last month. They encouraged Biden to block his visa over concerns his presence would ""raise serious security issues"" for the U.S. and its allies.

Hunger strikers were also reported at a notorious female prison in Iran in protest of the Iranian president's address amid Tehran increasing the number of executions and in a call for the release of all political and ideological detainees, according to Iran International."
Israel and Hezbollah continue to trade fire as residents in Lebanon look for safety,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/24/g-s1-24287/israel-hezbollah-trade-fire-lebanon,2024-09-24T09:44:18Z,"Vehicles wait in traffic in the town of Damour, south of the capital Beirut on Sept. 24, 2024, as people flee southern Lebanon. Israel announced dozens of new air strikes on Hezbollah strongholds in Lebanon on Tuesday, a day after more than 490 people, including dozens of women and children, were killed in the deadliest bombardment since a devastating war in 2006. IBRAHIM AMRO/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

Israeli forces and Hezbollah have continued to trade cross-border missiles through the night and into Tuesday morning, following the deadliest day of airstrikes in the country for almost two decades.

Overnight, the Israeli military said that it initiated airstrikes alongside tank and artillery fire on Hezbollah targets in southern Lebanon.

Hezbollah announced early Tuesday it had fired dozens of rockets into northern Israel, aimed at several military installations, an airbase and a munitions factory.

Israeli authorities say a regional hospital was damaged as sirens sounded throughout large swathes of northern Israel. The Israeli missile interception batteries forced some of the rockets down, the Israeli military said, but several buildings were damaged and firefighting crews were working to extinguish blazes that resulted.

Elsewhere, Israeli strikes in Gaza's southern city of Khan Younis early Tuesday killed at least seven, Palestinian officials said.

On Monday, Hezbollah fired roughly 100 missiles, some of them deep into Israel and around the northern city of Haifa, were largely intercepted and Israeli emergency services only reported a handful of injuries.

The vast majority of the nearly 500 people killed on Monday were in the south of Lebanon, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry, in a region where the militant group Hezbollah has initiated many of its cross-border attacks on targets inside Israel since October 7th.

More than 1,600 Lebanese were wounded, the health ministry added, as thousands more fled their homes and headed northwards away villages, towns and cities in that border region.

On a four-lane highway with two lanes of traffic usually passing in both directions, all four lanes were filled with escaping cars and buses, crammed with passengers. Children sat atop some vehicles or were crammed into the back of vegetable trucks, with some men sitting in the trunk of a car as Lebanese soldiers waved them through.

Residents from southern Lebanon described being told to leave their homes in anonymous phone calls. ""Please leave all your work and go outside,"" Bilal Hemadi said he was told by someone speaking in broken Arabic on an Israeli phone number that called his home's landline number. The businessman, who lives in a border village called Nabatieh, said he responded, ""'OK, thank you,'"" and with his wife and three children he soon headed north to Beirut, where he will shelter with friends.

With little notice, many of the thousands fleeing had little time to pack belongings, and not all were sure in conversations where they would go.

One of Hezbollah's most senior commanders told people mourning at a funeral in Beirut this past weekend that this conflict now represented an open-ended war, while the Israeli military has said it will not rule out a ground invasion across the border into Lebanon's territory.

This latest escalation in cross border violence follows the thousands of unexpected pager and walkie-talkie explosions that left members and allies of Hezbollah dead or severely wounded. Civilians, including children, were also injured or killed during those explosions across Lebanon, and soon after an airstrike Friday in the Lebanese capital killed dozens of other civilians, including children, as well as Hezbollah fighters and the senior commander of the group that the Israeli military said it had targeted.

In a video released Monday, Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu warned people in Lebanon that Hezbollah - which is considered a terrorist organization in several nations, including the United States - was endangering them and they should leave areas close to the border in the country's south and east.

""Please get out of harm's way now,"" Netanyahu said in the message. ""Once our operation is finished, you can come back safely to your homes."" In certain border regions the extent of the destruction from Israeli airstrikes means some residents no longer have homes to which they can return."
GREG GUTFELD: Trump voters expect deeds while Harris voters are fine with words,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-trump-voters-expect-deeds-while-harris-voters-fine-words,2024-09-24T03:35:34Z,"Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and the panel react to the differences between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris on 'Gutfeld!'

You could not get a clearer contrast. And yet, there will be those who hear Harris and love it every bit as much as you loved what you heard from Trump. So why this great divide? Well, it has to do with deeds and words. Trump voters expect deeds. Harris voters are fine with words. A Trump supporter votes for Trump expecting him to act, but a Harris supporter votes for Harris and that is the act. The act of voting is itself the policy and the point. Specifics don't matter. The vote is the virtue signal, a simple requirement with no follow-up necessary.

And that was by design, that the only basis for voting for a Democrat, whether it was Biden or Harris, was that it was only the vote that mattered and that it be against Trump. They can literally switch candidates from one with dementia to another with wet brain. They just expect you to vote for them no matter what. It's an anti-vote, an un-vote. The Harris voters will pull the lever for Kamala and then recede back into their lives where the issues the rest of us care about are left ignored, whether it's illegal immigration, rising crime, [or] the 20% increase in food and gas prices.

Because they've been convinced that none of that matters except only this one-time heroic vote for Kamala. After all, she could be the first Black and Indian female president to get us into a nuclear war. For proof, listen to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle with a New York Times columnist aboard-- prioritizing a vote for Harris over actual policies.

BRET STEPHENS: It's not too much to ask, Kamala, say are you for a Palestinian state if Hamas is going to run that state?

BRET STEPHENS: Yes or no?

STEPHANIE RUHLE: And let's say you don't like her answer. Are you going to vote for Donald Trump?

BRET STEPHENS: No, I'm not.

STEPHANIE RUHLE: Kamala Harris is not running for perfect. She's running against Trump. We have two choices. And so there are some things you might not know her answer to. And in 2024, unlike 2016, for a lot of the American people, we know exactly what Trump will do, who he is and the kind of threat he is to democracy.

KAMALA HARRIS HIT FOR BEING VAGUE, DODGING QUESTIONS IN RECENT INTERVIEWS: 'SHE OWES US THESE ANSWERS'

You know, I'd say she's dumber than a box of rocks, but at least you can throw those at Brian Kilmeade. That's a strategy and it might work. So how do you persuade a Democrat voter that it's a mistake to support Kamala when they aren't even interested in issues? The only counter-strategy is not to call them idiots; that's going to fall on deaf ears. Instead, direct their attention to those outlets who are telling them what to believe.

For the best way to unravel a naive liberal is to expose the lies of those who feed them the lies-- meaning debunk the brainwasher. So next time you get a chance, simply ask a Kamala supporter: Why not Trump? And when they call Trump a racist or sexist, which they will, be prepared to debunk the lies, whether it's the fine people hoax, the drinking bleach hoax or any lawfare. All it takes is one debunking to get them to think that their media isn't giving them the whole story. So you're not asking them to vote for Trump, you're just suggesting whether the information they're getting on Trump is really, in fact, trustworthy.

CNN COMMENTATOR SLAMS HARRIS AFTER OPRAH WINFREY SIT-DOWN: 'WHEN HAS SHE SAT DOWN WITH ANY HOSTILE MEDIA?'

It helps to remind them that 85 to 90% of the media is pro-Kamala and anti-Trump, which tells them that when they believe they're listening to legit news, they're actually being propagandized and brainwashed. That's the first step out of this bubble of blather. And next, if they're open to it, ask them to watch those two interviews because you simply cannot watch both and walk away thinking your media has been telling you the truth.

"Who is Amer Ghalib, the Trump-endorsing mayor of the US' only Muslim-majority town?",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/who-amer-ghalib-trump-endorsing-mayor-uss-only-muslim-majority-town,2024-09-23T17:23:54Z,"Former presidential candidate Vivek Ramswamy explains why he believes Trump is better for America than Kamala Harris, and debuts his new book 'Truths' alongside his new Fox Nation special.

Hamtramck, Michigan, Mayor Amer Ghalib made headlines over the weekend by endorsing former President Donald Trump's latest bid for president, putting the U.S.' only Muslim-majority town in the national spotlight.

Ghalib, who became Hamtramck's first Muslim mayor after being elected in 2021, was born in Yemen and immigrated to the U.S. as a teenager in 1997, according to a profile of the mayor posted by Henry Ford College.

He attended Hamtramck High School and worked at a factory, eventually going on to attend then-Henry Ford Community College and Wayne State University, where he earned his bachelor's degree in biology and pre-med. He later attended the Ross University School of Medicine in Dominica, where he completed four years but did not complete his residency.

Ghalib spent most of his career as a medical professional in Hamtramck, an enclave of Detroit with about 28,000 residents. The town was known as a mostly Polish settlement until recent decades, with a large influx of Middle Eastern immigrants eventually making it the nation's first Muslim-majority city.

MAYOR OF MUSLIM-MAJORITY MICHIGAN CITY ENDORSES TRUMP: 'RIGHT CHOICE FOR THIS CRITICAL TIME'

He made history when he defeated former Hamtramck Mayor Karen Majewski, breaking an over 100-year streak of the city being represented by a Polish-American mayor. The city also became the first in the nation with an all-Muslim elected leadership that same year, with Hamtramck's six city council seats being won by Muslim candidates.

However, Ghalib has also attracted controversy during his time as mayor, including his support of a 2023 resolution that banned the display of LGBTQ+ flags on city property.

""You do not know our city more than we do, and you will not know the consequences of opening the door for every group to fly their flag on city properties,"" Ghalib said in a statement to critics of the move in a Detroit Free Press report. ""Our residents are all equally important to us, and we will continue to serve them equally without discrimination, favoritism or preferential treatment to any group. The city government will stay NEUTRAL and IMPARTIAL toward its residents.""

Later the same year, he attracted more controversy when he failed to condemn one of his political appointees who was accused of making antisemitic comments.

According to a report on the controversy from the Hamtramck Review, Hamtramck Plan Commission member Nasr Hussain came under fire for questioning whether Jewish people were being punished by God during the Holocaust for actions Israel is now taking in Gaza.

TRUMP VOWS TOUGH APPROACH TO SANCTUARY POLICIES

""Was the Holocaust God's advance punishment of the 'Chosen People' for the savagery they're committing today against the innocent Palestinians children and civilians,"" Hussain posted on the popular local Facebook page, ""Hamtramck Square.""

""A heinous act proving that they're as savage and cruel as the Nazis themselves, or even worse.(Take into consideration that God isn't confined by space or time and that they believe in reincarnation.),"" he added.

""You can ask Nasr about that. What do I have to do with his posts! I don't have to comment on every resident's opinion, otherwise I would have commented on some posts that insult Islam and other religions, which are posted frequently by some residents on that same Facebook group,"" Ghalib responded when asked by the Hamtramck Review to respond to the post.

Ghalib and the Hamtramck City Council entered the spotlight again earlier this year, when the city voted unanimously to approve a resolution that required the city to avoid investing in Israeli companies or those supporting ""Israeli apartheid,"" according to a report from the Detroit Free Press, a sweeping show of support for the boycott, divestment and sanctions movement that has targeted Israeli companies.

""For now, the city will do its best to refrain from buying, investing or contracting with companies that support the Israeli genocide,"" Ghalib said after the vote.

KAMALA HARRIS HIT FOR BEING VAGUE, DODGING QUESTIONS IN RECENT INTERVIEWS: 'SHE OWES US THESE ANSWERS'

Nevertheless, Trump lobbied hard for Ghalib's endorsement, according to a report in the Detroit News, holding a private 20-minute meeting with the Hamtramck mayor prior to his event in Flint, Michigan, last Tuesday.

""He asked me if I can endorse him and ask people to vote for him? I told him: 'I'm here to talk about that and how we can make it happen,'"" Ghalib told the Detroit News. ""I then handed him an official letter with some details about our concerns and to invite him to come to Hamtramck if possible.""

Ghalib would eventually come through with that endorsement, taking to Facebook to praise Trump as ""a man of principles.""

"Israel's strikes in Lebanon kill more than 180 people, Lebanese officials say",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5123377/israel-lebanon-hezbollah-fighting,2024-09-23T14:14:21Z,"BEIRUT -- Fighting has escalated at the Israeli-Lebanese border, as Israeli strikes killed more than 180 people largely in southern Lebanon on Monday, according to Lebanese health authorities, in one of the deadliest days of nearly a year of conflict in the region.

Lebanon's Health Ministry says children, women and health care workers were among those killed in Israeli cross-border attacks in southern Lebanon.

Israel and the Iran-backed Lebanese militia Hezbollah have been trading large numbers of attacks across the border since the war in Gaza began in October last year. Hezbollah's leadership says it is acting out of solidarity with Palestinians and the Palestinian militant group Hamas in Gaza.

The Israeli military says it is fighting Hezbollah, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization, to prevent an assault in northern Israel similar to the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack in southern Israel. Israel says it wants degrade Hezbollah's rocket-launching capabilities, push Hezbollah fighters away from the border and allow Israeli families who evacuated the northern region to return home, as NPR's Daniel Estrin reported on Morning Edition.

The Israeli military says its forces struck more than 300 targets, many of which it described as Hezbollah weapons storage depots. Strikes damaged several buildings inside populated areas in Lebanon's south as well as farther east in the country's Bekaa Valley, but at least one landed some 80 miles north of the border near the city of Byblos, according to Lebanon's state-run broadcaster.

Hezbollah has fired hundreds of rockets at Israel in recent days, following the explosion of thousands of pagers and walkie-talkies last week that killed dozens of people and injured thousands more mainly in Lebanon. Israel has not publicly acknowledged a role in the blasts. But a U.S. official, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told NPR that Israel notified Washington it carried out last Tuesday's attacks in Lebanon.

Hezbollah's leadership said in a statement Monday it was targeting dozens of rockets at an Israeli military post in northern Israel. Residents in the city of Nazareth told NPR it was a ""scary night"" into early Monday morning, with ""rockets and interceptions over us all night.""

Israeli authorities acknowledge there have been repeated air raid sirens in the country's north, indicating incoming rocket fire from Lebanon.

On Friday, an airstrike over the Lebanese capital city, Beirut, killed at least 50 Hezbollah fighters and civilians, including children. Israel's military said that strike had targeted a senior Hezbollah commander.

Across villages and towns in southern Lebanon, residents have been departing for safer regions away from the border. Several months ago, Israeli military officials ordered residents living in communities on the Israeli side of that border to also evacuate as skirmishes and tit-for-tat missile barrages intensified.

The Israeli military spokesperson, Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari, warned people living in southern and eastern Lebanon to leave their homes as the air campaign against Hezbollah's fighters and positions increases to widen.

Residents in southern regions received messages in Arabic instructing them to move away from known weapons storage sites controlled by Hezbollah, according to local Lebanese media, prompting a large migration of people inside Lebanon.

Cars filled the main road north from the southern city of Sidon, up the coastline toward Beirut, although some Israeli airstrikes have repeatedly landed dozens of miles inside Lebanese territory."
IDF ops in Beirut bring closure for some; Hezbollah terrorists who killed Americans now dead,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/idf-ops-beirut-bring-closure-for-some-hezbollah-terrorists-who-killed-americans-now-dead,2024-09-23T11:39:53Z,"JERUSALEM -- Israel secured long-overdue justice for the family members of American military and diplomatic personnel murdered by Hezbollah, including the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut.

The initial lack of alleged enthusiasm from the Biden administration and Democratic lawmakers for the targeted killings of senior Hezbollah mass murderers sparked criticism among top counter-terrorism experts.

Take the example of Israel's elimination on Friday of Ibrahim Aqil, who was wanted by the United States for both the bombing of the U.S. embassy, which killed 63 people, and the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut in 1983, when 241 U.S. military personnel were killed by the Iranian-backed terror group Hezbollah.

IRAN OFFICIAL ADMITS COUNTRY'S ROLE IN TERROR BOMBING THAT KILLED 241 US MILITARY MEMBERS: REPORT

The U.S. had a $7 million bounty on Aqil's head, who was the commander of Hezbollah's elite Radwan force. In July, Israel assassinated Hezbollah military Chief of Staff Fuad Shukr, who, like Aqil, was involved in the 1983 Beirut bombings.

Former U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo wrote on X"" The families of the Marines killed in Beirut have waited decades for justice. I'm thankful Israel helped deliver it by taking out one of the world's most vicious terrorists -- Ibrahim Aqil. Let this be a message to Iran and Iran's proxies everywhere.""

A Washington Post report cited Ryan Crocker, whose office was on the fourth floor of the embassy when the blast went off, as commenting on Aqil's death, ""It is still a source of some satisfaction that he finally got it."" Crocker went on to serve as U.S. ambassador to Syria, Iraq and several other nations.

Max Abrahms, a leading expert on counter-terrorism and a tenured professor of political science at Northeastern University, told Fox News Digital that, ""Targeted killings have been a cornerstone of U.S. counterterrorism since the 9/11 attacks. And yet, Israel killing Hezbollah terrorists with American blood on their hands has been rebuked by Democrat leaders.""

He added ""The fact that even targeted killings of terrorists with American blood stained hands get rebuked unmasks the Democratic leadership, which spent the last year pretending that it objected to the Gaza campaign after 10/7 because of its negative impact on the Palestinian population. As we have seen, the Democratic leadership opposes all Israeli measures to counterterrorism, even ones perfectly executed that eliminate any civilian harm.""

Criticism of the Biden administration's initial lackluster response to the killing of Aqil on Friday appeared to prompt a response from U.S. National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, who called Aqil's death ""a good outcome"" on Saturday.

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

""That individual has American blood on his hands and has a Reward for Justice price on his head,"" Sullivan said. He added ""He is somebody who the United States promised long ago we would do everything we could to see brought to justice.""

White House National Security Council communications adviser John Kirby told ""Fox News Sunday with Shannon Bream"" that ""Nobody, including Secretary Austin, is shedding a tear over the death of Mr. Aqil, who does have American blood on his hands. I think the world's better for not having him walking around on the planet anymore. But that doesn't mean we want to see a full out war. We don't believe again, that that's in the best interest of the Israeli people.""

David Wurmser, a former senior adviser for nonproliferation and Middle East strategy for former Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital that, ""The success of Israel's aims is a multi-faceted American interest. First, the demise of so many prominent Hezbollah leaders involves the death of many who are on the American wanted lists, on many of whom the United States has placed hefty bounties. Despite the bounties, however, it was clear the United States had long ago abandoned any effort to bring any of these killers of American servicemen, diplomats and intelligence officers to justice. Their wholesale demise in a matter of two or three days by Israel only further highlights the gap between the lofty rhetoric of a half century of the American foreign policy establishment and the more dishonorable reality.""

He added ""That the U.S. is now taking a de-escalatory position - which creates equivalence between our democratic ally and the terrorists that have the blood of thousands of Americans on their hands, is simply disgraceful. At least now, albeit at Israel's hands rather than ours, our sacred servicemen have been avenged.""

Wurmser noted that ""In the Middle East, we are fortunate to have a powerful and loyal ally that shares our values, Israel, that is attracting a collection of other friendly states to begin to forge a local regional alliance to challenge the region's forces of instability, foremost among them being Iran's regime.""

Matthew Levitt, the director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at The Washington Institute, told Fox News Digital that, ""Over a short period of time, Israel recently eliminated Hezbollah terrorists who were there from the beginning and played hands on rolls and attacks against Americans in the 1980s. U.S. intelligence has been tracking these people for decades.""

ISRAEL DEGRADES IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS IN SPECTACULAR PAGER EXPLOSION OPERATION: EXPERTS

He added ""But these strikes also have very current implications, given that Fuad Shukr and Ibrahim Aqil, together with Ali Karaki, have been jointly running as well as Islamic Jihad organization as a triumvirate since the death of Mustafa Badreddine in Syria several years ago. They were foot soldiers in the 1980s and rose to the highest ranks of the organization.""

Lisa Daftari, an Iranian-American expert on the Islamic Republic and editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk, told Fox News Digital that, ""In eliminating Ibrahim Aqil, Israel has once again demonstrated its unwavering commitment to combating global terrorism -- a fight that serves the interests of all nations dedicated to opposing radical extremism.""

She added, ""The Biden administration should openly commend Israel's efforts and provide robust support, rather than calling for restraint. It's crucial to recognize that if groups like Hezbollah and Hamas cease their hostilities, we may achieve peace. But if Israel halts its operations now, it will continue to endure relentless terrorism, similar to the attacks witnessed on October 7. Our collective security hinges on Israel's resolve to dismantle these threats.""

Retired Marine Corps Sergeant Major Steve Aitken, who was stationed on a boat offshore as the injured were transferred to ships for medical treatment following the terrorist attack, told the Washington Post that Aqil's death was ""God's judgment,"" adding, ""You might get away, but you're not going to get by ... Our memory is long. Israel's is even longer.""

Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., also stressed the significance of Israel's assassination of Aqil writing on X, ""Ibrahim Aqil was a vicious terrorist mastermind who helped murder hundreds of Americans. On behalf of the families of the Marines killed in the Beirut bombings -- and on behalf of all Americans -- I'm grateful justice has finally been served to this killer.""

Aqil also oversaw Hezbollah's operations in Syria, where he enabled Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad to wipe out hundreds of thousands of his own Arab citizens."
"From Gaza to Ukraine, why do so many modern wars last so long?",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/nx-s1-5039157/from-gaza-to-ukraine-why-do-so-many-modern-wars-last-so-long,2024-09-23T10:07:01Z,"A Ukrainian rescue worker looks on at a burning electrical substation hit by a Russian bomb in the Dnipropetrovsk region in eastern Ukraine on Sept. 2. Evgeniy Maloletka/AP hide caption

Shortly after Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014, Ukrainian war correspondent Andriy Tsaplienko was live on TV. The anchor asked him how long the fighting might last.

""I said it could take a couple of years to calm down the situation,"" Tsaplienko recalled. ""When the anchor heard it, he was really terrified on a live broadcast.""

In the 10 years since then, Tsaplienko has been detained and beaten by Russian troops. He's also suffered shrapnel wounds that left him with a limp. He's covered every twist and turn in the fighting -- and still doesn't know when the war will end.

""I don't want to say forever, but for a long time, maybe another next decade,"" he said in an interview in Ukraine's capital Kyiv.

The Ukraine-Russia war, and the Israel-Hamas conflict in Gaza, are both part of feuds with long histories. Ukraine declared independence from Russia in 1918, then lost a war in the years that followed. Ukraine didn't gain independence from Moscow until the 1991 Soviet Union breakup. Meanwhile, the Israel-Hamas battle is part of the larger Israeli-Palestinian dispute that also stretches back a century.

In both current wars, a common question is, ""When will the fighting end?"" But given the tortured history, it might be better to ask, ""Will it ever end?""

""Both of these conflicts have very, very, high stakes that are relatively indivisible,"" said Gideon Rose, who's with the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of How Wars End.

""Russia is trying to conquer Ukraine. Ukraine is trying to fight for its life. The Israelis are trying to suppress all attacks from Gaza and the Palestinians are trying to avoid being completely subjugated,"" said Rose, adding that this doesn't leave a lot of room for compromise.

These conflicts also reflect a harsh reality of many moderns wars. They can grind on inconclusively -- even when the fighting reaches the point where neither side can score a complete battlefield victory.

""Sometimes there is no solution for a decade or two,"" said Paul Salem, who's based in Beirut with the Middle East Institute. ""You've got to manage the problem. You got to contain it. You got to make sure we don't go into World War III.""

These current battlefield scenarios aren't new. In the past, some wars endured for many years, or even decades. But several factors contribute to making modern wars last a long time, and these two in particular.

First, weapons and technology have never flowed so freely. This means a smaller military can get its hands on more and better weapons than previously. Ukraine uses cheap drones to counter Russia's much larger traditional army.

""Drones are just a toy turned into a weapon,"" Andriy Tsaplienko. ""One drone can cost maybe up to $1,000, and you can attack a bigger target like a tank, and destroy the tank, which costs $3 million.""

In the Middle East, Israel receives the vast majority of its advanced weapons from the U.S. Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon used to fire short-range rockets that only threatened communities just across the border in southern and northern Israel.

But with help from Iran, those two groups have been firing thousands of rockets into Israel, and can now strike throughout much of the country.

A second key factor in both conflicts is how they have repeatedly defied lasting political solutions.

""It's not enough to have a military strategy,"" said Chuck Freilich, a former deputy national security advisor in Israel. ""You have to have a political one as well. And Israel hasn't had one for years and years, to my thinking, on the Palestinian issue.""

The Israelis and Palestinians were close to a political settlement way back in the year 2000. Today, a full-fledged peace deal appears more distant than ever.

Paul Salem notes that Israel used to fight traditional state-versus-state wars against neighboring Arab countries -- like Egypt, Jordan and Syria. Now Israel is trying to maintain long-term control over Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza.

""You can win a war, but it's hard to win an occupation,"" said Salem. ""Beating a state and getting the state to say, 'OK, I lose,' or 'I'm going to stop,' is different than maintaining an occupation, which the Israelis have not managed to do sustainably.""

Meanwhile, Russian leader Vladimir Putin meddled in Ukraine's politics for years, seeking to place or keep a Kremlin-friendly leader in power in Kyiv. When that failed, Russia invaded, initially in 2014, and then again, on a much larger scale in 2022.

Leaders often have an incentive to keep fighting

Ultimately, most wars do end with negotiations, though the two sides tend to make a deal only after one or both have reached the point of exhaustion.

""We assume war is so terrible, therefore it must be the incentive of people to stop it,"" said Gideon Rose. ""That's not necessarily the case.""

He notes that leaders waging the wars often make very different calculations than soldiers and civilians bearing the brunt of the conflict.

""Somebody who initiates a war usually has a strong incentive to keep fighting, because unless he can get a real victory when it ends, he's kind of in trouble,"" said Rose.

Leaders who lose wars tend to be tossed out of power, and the potential consequences can be even more serious.

The International Criminal Court in The Hague has issued an arrest warrant for Russia's Vladimir Putin, and prosecutors are seeking warrants for Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.

And in times of war, leaders often pursue goals that may be beyond their reach. Israel's Netanyahu calls for ""total victory"" over Hamas. He wants to end the group's rule over Gaza, and its threat to Israel, once and for all.

Yet Chuck Freilich said Hamas and its allies, Iran and Hezbollah, see mere survival as a victory, and are pursuing their own long-term plans.

""This is a multi-decade war in which there will be round-after-round. And they [Hamas, Hezbollah and Iran] are fully cognizant of that,"" he said.

Freilich also added this sobering note.

""I would say that Iran is an enemy which is too big, too far away, too powerful and maybe too sophisticated in its thinking for Israel to be able to defeat it,"" he said. ""Now, I believe Israel can defend itself against Iran, but I'm not sure that we can defeat it as we did to the Arab countries.""

In the Russia-Ukraine war, Putin describes Ukraine as not being a real country, a place that should be part of Russia.

Andriy Tsaplienko, the Ukrainian war correspondent, says this is exactly why Ukraine keeps fighting.

""We realize this war is crucially important for Ukrainians,"" he said. ""This is the existential war. We will live or we won't live. That's it. I mean, as a nation in general. So that's why we will fight to the end."""
Israel tells Lebanese to leave area where Hezbollah stores arms as it launches strikes,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/23/g-s1-24128/israel-tells-lebanese-to-leave-area-where-hezbollah-stores-arms-as-it-launches-strikes,2024-09-23T08:01:27Z,"JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military on Monday called on residents of southern Lebanon to immediately evacuate homes and other buildings where Hezbollah stores weapons and said it was carrying out ""extensive strikes"" against the militant group.

It was the first warning of its kind in nearly a year of steadily escalating conflict and came after a particularly heavy exchange of fire on Sunday. Hezbollah launched around 150 rockets, missiles and drones into northern Israel in retaliation for strikes that killed a top commander and dozens of fighters

The escalating strikes and counterstrikes have raised fears of an all-out war, even as Israel is still battling the Palestinian Hamas in Gaza and trying to return scores of hostages taken in Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. Hezbollah has vowed to continue its strikes in solidarity with the Palestinians and Hamas, a fellow Iran-backed militant group, while Israel says it is committed to returning calm to the border.

An Israeli military official said Israel is focused on aerial operations and has no immediate plans for a ground operation. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity in keeping with regulations, said the strikes are aimed at curbing Hezbollah's ability to launch more strikes into Israel.

Lebanese media reported that residents received text messages urging them to move away from any building where Hezbollah stores arms until further notice.

""If you are in a building housing weapons for Hezbollah, move away from the village until further notice,"" the Arabic message reads, according to Lebanese media.

It was not immediately clear how many people would be affected by the Israeli orders. Communities on both sides of the border have largely emptied out because of the near-daily exchanges of fire.

Israel has accused Hezbollah of transforming entire communities in the south into militant bases, with hidden rocket launchers and other infrastructure. That could lead it to wage an especially heavy bombing campaign, even if no ground forces move in.

The military said it had targeted more than 150 militant sites early Monday. Residents of different villages in southern Lebanon posted photos on social media of airstrikes and large plumes of smoke. The state-run National News Agency also reported airstrikes on different areas.

An Israeli airstrike on a Beirut suburb on Friday killed a top Hezbollah military commander and more than a dozen fighters, as well as dozens of civilians, including women and children.

Last week, thousands of communications devices, used mainly by Hezbollah members, exploded in different parts of Lebanon, killing 39 people and wounding nearly 3,000. Lebanon blamed Israel for the attacks, but Israel did not confirm or deny its responsibility.

Hezbollah began firing into Israel a day after the Oct. 7 attack in what it said was an attempt to pin down Israeli forces to help Palestinian fighters in Gaza. Israel has retaliated with airstrikes, and the conflict has steadily intensified over the past year.

The fighting has killed hundreds of people in Lebanon, dozens in Israel and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the border. It has also sparked brush fires that have destroyed agriculture and scarred the landscape.

Israel has vowed to push Hezbollah back from the border so its citizens can return to their homes, saying it prefers to do so diplomatically but is willing to use force. Hezbollah has said it will keep up its attacks until there is a cease-fire in Gaza, but that appears increasingly elusive as the war nears its anniversary.

Hamas-led militants stormed into southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting around 250. Some 100 captives are still held in Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead, after most of the rest were released during a weeklong cease-fire in November.

Israel's offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and fighters in its count. It says women and children make up a little over half of those killed. Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, without providing evidence."

Gen. Anthony Tata breaks down the latest conflicts emerging from the Middle East during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

Hezbollah fired more than 100 rockets into northern Israel on Sunday in response to a series of Israeli airstrikes on southern Lebanon, pushing both sides closer to the brink of full-scale war.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) airstrikes targeting Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorists in Lebanon killed dozens, including one of the group's top commanders, Ibrahim Akil.

Hezbollah's deputy leader, Naim Kassem, said Sunday's rocket attack was just the beginning of what's now an ""open-ended battle"" with Israel.

At Akil's funeral, Kassem vowed Hezbollah would continue military operations against Israel but also warned of unexpected attacks ""from outside the box,"" pointing to rockets fired deeper into Israel.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would take whatever action was necessary to restore security in the north and allow people to return to their homes.

""No country can accept the wanton rocketing of its cities. We can't accept it either,"" he said.

Israel's military chief, Lt. Gen. Herzi Halevi, told reporters the army is prepared to increase pressure on Hezbollah in the coming days, adding, ""We have many capabilities that we have not yet activated.""

ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES CONTINUE ON TERRORIST TARGETS, ROCKET LAUNCHERS IN SOUTHERN LEBANON

The Israeli military said it struck about 400 militant sites, including rocket launchers, across southern Lebanon in the past 24 hours, thwarting an even larger attack.

""Last night, hundreds of thousands of Israelis woke up to rocket sirens as Hezbollah launched over 20 rockets towards northern Israel that left communities in ruins,"" IDF spokesperson Lt. Col. Nadav Shoshani said. ""This attack could have caused much more damage, but we were able to minimize their attack with a preemptive strike on rocket launchers across southern Lebanon.""

The latest tit-for-tat between Israeli forces and Hezbollah comes as Lebanon is still reeling from a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday. The explosions killed at least 37 people and wounded about 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which hasn't confirmed or denied responsibility.

Israeli forces have been trading fire with Hezbollah fighters almost daily since Oct. 8, the day after Hamas militants stormed into Israel, killing nearly 1,200 people and taking another 250 as hostages. Hezbollah leadership has said its attacks on Israel are in solidarity with its ally Hamas in Gaza.

IDF SAYS KEY HAMAS OPERATIVE KILLED IN GAZA, FOLLOWING CRIPPLING STRIKE ON HEZBOLLAH

The low-level fighting has killed dozens in Israel, hundreds in Lebanon and displaced tens of thousands on both sides of the frontier. But the fighting has intensified in recent weeks, with Israel shifting its focus from Gaza to Lebanon. Some have expressed concerns that the fight against Hezbollah will strain resources and complicate prospects for an already elusive cease-fire deal.

Retired Army Brig. Anthony Tata told ""Fox & Friends"" that the conflict would only grow and chided the Biden administration for what he deemed a lack of ""moral clarity.""

""It's critical that Netanyahu keeps his eye on the main fight, which is Hamas, and he eliminates Hamas,"" Tata said. ""The main effort is still Hamas. And I think what they have to do is hold what they've got and hold off Hezbollah until they finish up Hamas, and then they can move to the north and ... destroy Hezbollah. You can't do two things at once equally well.""

Asked Sunday if he was worried about rising tensions in the Middle East, President Biden said, ""Yes, I am.""

""But we're going to do everything we can to keep a wider war from breaking out. And we're still pushing hard,"" Biden added.

Hamas is still holding around 100 captives from its attack in southern Israel on Oct. 7, a third of whom are believed to be dead. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, according to Gaza's Hamas-run Health Ministry, which doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants.

Meanwhile, the Israeli military said Sunday it intercepted multiple aerial devices fired from the direction of Iraq after Iran-backed militant groups there claimed to have launched a drone attack on Israel."
Gov. Whitmer balks at questions about Michigan AG Dana Nessel and Rashida Tlaib feud: 'Not getting in middle',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/gov-whitmer-balks-questions-about-michigan-ag-dana-nessel-rashida-tlaib-feud-not-getting-middle,2024-09-22T23:03:33Z,"Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer declined to take a side in a CNN interview when asked about accusations from Rep. Rashida Tlaib against Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer refused to take a side in the feud between Attorney General Dana Nessel and Rep. Rashida Tlaib, D-Mich who accused Nessel of bringing charges against anti-Israel campus protesters at the University of Michigan because she is Jewish.

In an interview on CNN's ""State of the Union"" Sunday, Jake Tapper asked the Democratic governor whether she agrees with Nessel, a Democrat, that Tlaib's accusation about her charging anti-Israel campus demonstrators because of her personal religious bias was rooted in antisemitism.

""Do you think that Tlaib's suggestion that Nessel's office is biased was antisemitic?"" Tapper asked.

HILLARY CLINTON CONDEMNS ANTI-ISRAEL CAMPUS PROTESTS, SAYS 'OUTSIDE' GROUPS INFLUENCED STUDENTS: 'NASTY'

""All I can say is that I know that our Jewish community is in pain, as is our Palestinian and Muslim and Arab communities in Michigan,"" Whitmer said. ""I know that seeing the incredible toll that this war has taken on both communities has been really, really challenging and difficult, and my heart breaks for so many. But as governor, my job is to make sure that both these communities are protected and respected under the law in Michigan, and that's exactly what I'm going to stay focused on.""

Tapper pressed her again, ""Do you think Attorney General Nessel is not doing her job?""

""Because Congresswoman Tlaib is suggesting that she shouldn't be prosecuting these individuals that Nessel says broke the law, and that she's only doing it because she's Jewish, and the protesters are not,"" he continued. ""That's quite an accusation. Do you think it's true?""

Whitmer continued to dodge questions on the issue.

""Like I said, Jake, I'm not going to get in the middle of this argument that they're having,"" she said. ""I can just say this: We do want to make sure that students are safe on our campuses, and we recognize that every person has the right to make their statement about how they feel about an issue, a right to speak out. And I'm going to use every lever of mine to ensure that both are true.""

Nessel, Michigan's first Jewish attorney general, charged nine university students for refusing to leave the anti-Israel encampments in May after police ordered them to vacate, the Detroit Metro Times reported. They are being charged with trespassing and resisting or obstructing a police officer, according to the outlet. Two additional people were charged with attempted ethnic intimidation and malicious destruction of personal property at a separate anti-Israel protest.

JEWISH TEEN'S ASSAULT IN MICHIGAN UNDER INVESTIGATION AS POSSIBLE ANTISEMITIC HATE CRIME:POLICE

Tlaib, a 'Squad' member and vocal critic of Israel, slammed the charges from Nessel as ""shameful,"" telling the Detroit Metro Times in an interview, ""it seems that the Attorney General decided if the issue was Palestine, she was going to treat it differently, and that alone speaks volumes about possible biases within the agency she runs.'

Nessel responded on X, ""Rashida Tlaib should not use my religion to imply I cannot perform my job fairly as Attorney General. It's anti-Semitic and wrong.'""

Whitmer's hesitation to defend Nessel caught the attention of Anti-Defamation League CEO Jonathan Greenblatt, who scolded the governor for failing to support her attorney general.

""@GovWhitmer, when your attorney general prosecutes people for violating the law, harassing Jews, and attacking police officers, it's in the interest of public safety. When a congresswoman accuses the attorney general of prosecuting protestors simply because she's Jewish, it's bias.""

""We basically sat down and answered questions for 45, 50 minutes, and the questions were really raw. I mean, we had a student from Palestine, a Palestinian student. We had a student from Israel, we had students from across the Middle East. We had students from Asia and obviously the rest of the world, struggling to understand what all of it meant. But it was a respectful, informative, open dialogue, and literally at the end of it, the students applauded,"" Clinton told CNN's Fareed Zakaria in an interview that aired Sunday morning of a class she held last year when war broke out in Israel.

Clinton co-teaches a political course at Columbia University, titled ""Inside the Situation Room,"" where she joined Columbia University students on the Wednesday following Oct. 7, when Hamas launched attacks on Israel and sparked the ongoing war. Clinton said following the ""open dialogue"" on campus, she witnessed rhetoric on campus ""morph into something that was not student-led.""

""Within a few days, we were doing an event, and we started being protested - the dean and I and our guests - and being screamed at, being called, you know, all kinds of names. What happened in that period? And the best I can sort of unpack it, is that there, there were already existing groups within our country, and particularly on certain campuses like Columbia, who had talking points, they had a plan for protest and disruption, and I watched it sort of morph into something that was not student led, even though students participated, but which had outside funding, outside direction,"" she said.

Clinton added that ""to this day,"" she's still not sure how the outside funding and outside influence swayed college students to join the anti-Israel protests.

During the 2023-24 college school year, agitators and student protesters flooded college campuses nationwide to protest the war in Israel, which also included spiking instances of antisemitism and Jewish students publicly speaking out that they did not feel safe on some campuses.

Agitators on Columbia's campus, for example, took over the school's Hamilton Hall building, while schools such as UCLA, Harvard and Yale worked to clear spiraling student encampments where protesters demanded their elite schools completely divest from Israel.

The former secretary of state went on to say that when she pressed college students about their anti-Israel views, they lacked historical context surrounding politics in Israel and the Middle East.

HILLARY CLINTON SAYS IT'S A 'DOUBLE STANDARD' TO ASK HARRIS ABOUT HER POLICIES

""A lot of the videos on social media gave not just a one-sided view of the conflict, but a totally anti-Israel, pro-Hamas, not just pro-Palestinian view. And for me, it was distressing, because, look, I have my own opinions formed over many years. I am willing to sit down and have a conversation with anybody, but it's difficult to have conversations with people who hold strong opinions with no factual and historical basis,"" she said.

""And so in trying to talk to students, not just at Columbia, but elsewhere, I would be met with slogans. I would be met with attacks, and, you know, very inflammatory language. And when I would ask, 'Well, what about, do you know what happened in 2000 at Camp David?' 'No.' 'Do you know what happened in 1947?' 'No.' 'Do you know how difficult the relationships have been?' 'No.' 'Do you know that there are Arab Israelis, and some are serving in the IDF?' None of that. And this whole chanting of, you know, 'from the river to the sea.' What does that mean? What river, what sea? That's what bothered me,"" Clinton said.

HILLARY CLINTON REVEALS INITIAL REACTION TO BIDEN WITHDRAWING FROM RACE: 'THIS IS EXCITING!'

Clinton said that so far this year, it ""has been much quieter"" with ""a much more educational environment.""

She condemned the harassment on college campuses against Jewish students, saying the temperature quickly changed from holding ""legitimate"" dialogue among students disagreeing with a country's foreign policies to open antisemitism.

""This was screaming at students who were Jewish, it was blocking their entry into classes or into club activities. It was nasty. And so there was something else going on here that was very troubling. And we now, you know, have seen evidence of, you know, obviously foreign money, foreign influence, the algorithms on TikTok, which were anti-Israel right off the bat. And so I think that a university particularly has an obligation to, of course, protect free speech, but also to protect students against harassment and against the kind of behavior that interfered with their learning,"" she said."
Macklemore declares 'F--- America' to cheers at Seattle concert benefiting UN agency with alleged Hamas ties,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/macklemore-decalres-f-america-cheers-seattle-concert-benefiting-un-agency-alleged-hamas-ties,2024-09-22T15:57:22Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

The rapper Macklemore told a crowd of Seattle concertgoers ""F--- America,"" according to video of his recent ""Palestine Will Live Forever"" performance shared on X.

""Straight up, say it. I'm not gonna stop you. I'm not gonna stop you,"" Macklemore said, appearing to reference chants from the crowd.

""Yeah, F--- America,"" the Grammy-winning performer said, sending the crowd into cheers. The video was shared on X by journalist Cam Higby.

Macklemore, a 41-year-old rapper born Benjamin Hammond Haggerty in Kent, Washington, had advertised a ""Palestine Will Live Forever Festival"" on his Facebook page.

RAPPER MACKLEMORE CALLS OUT BIDEN, POLICE AND MUSIC INDUSTRY IN NEW PRO-PALESTINIAN SONG

He said the proceeds of the event held at Seward Park Amphitheater would go to various groups, including the controversial agency known as the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestinian refugees (UNRWA).

Israeli officials have declared that UNRWA is strongly tied to Hamas in the Gaza Strip. The U.N. itself announced in August that nine UNRWA staffers would be fired due to possible involvement in the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas terror attack on Israel.

Fox News digital reached out to representatives for Macklemore for comment, but they did not immediately respond.

Macklemore dropped an anti-Israel song in May titled ""Hind's Hall,"" referring to the Columbia University building that students occupied and renamed in honor of a 6-year-old Palestinian girl killed in the Israel-Gaza war. The song praised the anti-Israel encampments and protests on college campuses across the country and called out President Biden, the police and the music industry.

The rapper this month dropped a second version of the song that now calls out Vice President Kamala Harris, who became the Democratic presidential nominee when Biden backed out of the race in July.

Macklemore seems to threaten that Harris will lose support in the battleground state of Michigan, which has a large Arab and Muslim community in Dearborn, for supporting Israel.

""Hey Kamala, I don't know if you listening but stop sending the money and weapons or you ain't winning Michigan. We uncommitted and hell no we ain't switching positions because the whole world turn Palestinian,"" the song says.

The music video shared on X shows a clip of Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Mich., when those lyrics play. The song also includes the antisemitic chant, ""From the river to the sea,"" which calls for the elimination of Israel.

Macklemore, who has an estimated net worth of $25 million, according to Celebrity Net Worth, also declares in the second version of the song, ""Capitalism killing us, that's something we can't afford"" and sings, ""There will never be freedom by pleading with Zionists.""

Macklemore has increasingly weighed in on conflicts in the Middle East. Last month, he canceled an upcoming October concert in Dubai over the United Arab Emirates' role ""in the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis"" in Sudan through its reported support of the paramilitary force that's been fighting government troops there, according to The Associated Press.

In an Instagram post at the time, Macklemore said he had a series of people ""asking me to cancel the show in solidarity with the people of Sudan and to boycott doing business in the UAE for the role they are playing in the ongoing genocide and humanitarian crisis."""
"Dozens of rockets fired into Israel from Lebanon, IDF says",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/22/g-s1-24085/dozens-of-rockets-fired-into-israel-from-lebanon-idf-says,2024-09-22T05:58:32Z,"NAHARIYA, Israel -- Over 100 rockets were fired into Israel from Lebanon early Sunday, with some landing near the northern city of Haifa, as Israel and the Hezbollah militant group appeared to be spiraling toward all-out war following months of escalating tensions.

The rockets streaked over a wider and deeper area of northern Israel than previous volleys and set off air raid sirens across the region. The Israeli military said rockets had been fired ""toward civilian areas,"" pointing to a possible escalation after previous barrages had mainly been aimed at military targets.

Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said it treated four people for shrapnel wounds, including a 76-year-old man who was moderately wounded near Haifa, where buildings were damaged and cars set on fire. It was not immediately clear if the damage was caused by a rocket or an Israeli interceptor.

The barrage came after an Israeli airstrike in Beirut killed at least 37 people, including one of Hezbollah's top leaders as well as women and children. Hezbollah was already reeling from a sophisticated attack that caused thousands of personal devices to explod e just days earlier.

The Israeli military said it carried out a wave of strikes across southern Lebanon over the past 24 hours, hitting some 400 militant sites, including rocket launchers.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire since the outbreak of the war in Gaza nearly a year ago, when the militant group began firing rockets in solidarity with the Palestinians and its fellow Iran-backed ally Hamas. The low-level fighting has displaced tens of thousands of people on both sides of the frontier.

Neither side is believed to be seeking a war. But in recent weeks, Israel has shifted its focus from Gaza to Lebanon and vowed to bring back calm to the border so that its citizens can return to their homes. Hezbollah has said it will only halt its attacks if there is a cease-fire in Gaza, which appears increasingly elusive as long-running negotiations led by the United States, Egypt and Qatar have repeatedly bogged down.

The war in Gaza began with Hamas' Oct. 7 attack into Israel, in which Palestinian militants killed some 1,200 people and took around 250 hostage. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead. Gaza's Health Ministry says over 41,000 Palestinians have been killed. It does not say how many were fighters but says women and children make up over half of the dead.

Israeli media reported that rockets fired from Lebanon early Sunday were intercepted in the areas of Haifa and Nazareth, which are further south than most of the rocket fire to date. Israel canceled school across the north, deepening the sense of crisis.

Hezbollah said it had launched dozens of Fadi 1 and Fadi 2 missiles -- a new type of weapon the group had not used before -- at the Ramat David airbase, southeast of Haifa, ""in response to the repeated Israeli attacks that targeted various Lebanese regions and led to the fall of many civilian martyrs.""

In July, the group released a video with what it said was footage it had filmed of the base with surveillance drones.

Hezbollah has vowed to retaliate against Israel for a wave of explosions that hit pagers and walkie-talkies belonging to Hezbollah members on Tuesday and Wednesday, killing at least 37 people -- including two children -- and wounding around 3,000. The attacks were widely blamed on Israel, which has not confirmed or denied responsibility.

On Friday, an Israeli airstrike took down an eight-story building in a densely populated neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs as Hezbollah members were meeting in the basement, according to Israel. Among those killed was Ibrahim Akil, a top Hezbollah official who commanded the group's special forces unit, known as the Radwan Force.

Lebanon's health minister, Firass Abiad, told reporters Saturday that at least seven women and three children were killed in Friday's airstrike on the building. He said another 68 people were injured, including 15 who were hospitalized.

It was the deadliest strike on Beirut since the bruising monthlong war in 2006 between Israel and Hezbollah, and the casualty count could grow, with 23 people still missing, a government official said.

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant said the attack broke up the group's chain of command while taking out Akil, who he said was responsible for Israeli deaths. He had been on the U.S. most wanted list for years, with a $7 million reward, over his alleged role in the 1983 bombing of the U.S. Embassy in Beirut and the taking of American and German hostages in Lebanon during the civil war in the 1980s."
Israel raids and shuts down Al Jazeera's bureau in Ramallah in the West Bank,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/22/g-s1-24083/israel-shuts-down-al-jazeera-bureau-ramallah-west-bank,2024-09-22T05:19:31Z,"This image made from video provided by Al Jazeera English shows Israeli troops raiding their bureau in Ramallah, West Bank, Sunday, Sept. 22, 2024. Al Jazeera/AP/Al Jazeera hide caption

Israeli troops raided the offices of the satellite news network Al Jazeera in the Israeli-occupied West Bank early Sunday, ordering the bureau to shut down amid a widening campaign by Israel targeting the Qatar-funded broadcaster as it covers the Israel-Hamas war in the Gaza Strip.

Al Jazeera aired footage of Israeli troops live on its Arabic-language channel ordering the office to be shut for 45 days. It follows an extraordinary order issued in May that saw Israeli police raid Al Jazeera's broadcast position in East Jerusalem, seizing equipment there, preventing its broadcasts in Israel and blocking its websites.

The move marked the first time Israel has ever shuttered a foreign news outlet operating in the country. However, Al Jazeera has continued operating in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and in the Gaza Strip, territories that the Palestinians hope to have for their future state.

There was no immediate acknowledgement of the shutdown by Israeli forces. The Israeli military did not respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press. Al Jazeera denounced the move as it continued broadcasting live from Amman in neighboring Jordan.

Armed Israeli troops entered the office and told a reporter live on air it would be shut down, saying that staff needed to leave immediately. The network later aired what appeared to be Israel troops tearing down a banner on a balcony used by the Al Jazeera office. Al Jazeera said it bore an image of Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian-American journalist shot dead by Israeli forces in May 2022.

""There is a court ruling for closing down Al Jazeera for 45 days,"" an Israeli soldier told Al Jazeera's local bureau chief, Walid al-Omari, in the live footage. ""I ask you to take all the cameras and leave the office at this moment.""

Al-Omari later said that Israeli troops began confiscating documents and equipment in the bureau, as tear gas and gunshots could be seen and heard in the area.

The Palestinians secured limited self-rule in Gaza and parts of the occupied West Bank through the 1993 Oslo agreements. While Israel occupies and controls vast areas of the West Bank, Ramallah is under full Palestinian political and security control, making the Israeli raid on the Al Jazeera office that much more surprising.

The Palestinian Journalists Syndicate denounced the Israeli raid and order.

""This arbitrary military decision is a new aggression against journalistic work and media outlets,"" it said.

The Palestinian Authority administers parts of the West Bank. Its forces were driven from Gaza when Hamas seized power in 2007, and it has no power there.

The network has reported on the Israeli-Hamas war nonstop since the militants' initial cross-border attack on Oct. 7 and has maintained 24-hour coverage in the Gaza Strip amid Israel's grinding ground offensive that has killed and wounded members of its staff. It remains unclear whether the Israeli military would target Al Jazeera's operation in Gaza as well.

While including on-the-ground reporting of the war's casualties, Al Jazeera's Arabic arm often publishes verbatim video statements from Hamas and other regional militant groups.

That has led to Israeli claims by officials up to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that the network has ""harmed Israel's security and incited against soldiers."" Those claims have been vehemently denied by Al Jazeera, whose main funder, Qatar, has been key in negotiations between Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire to end the war.

An order closing Al Jazeera in Israel has been repeatedly renewed in the time since, but it hadn't as of yet ordered the Ramallah offices closed.

The Israeli government has taken action against individual reporters over the decades since its founding in 1948, but broadly allows for a rambunctious media scene that includes foreign bureaus from around the world, even from Arab nations. It also blocked the foreign broadcasts of the Hezbollah-affiliated, Beirut-based Al Mayadeen news channel at the start of the war.

Criticism of Al Jazeera is not new. The U.S. government singled out the broadcaster during America's occupation of Iraq after its 2003 invasion toppled dictator Saddam Hussein and for airing videos of the late al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden.

Al Jazeera has been closed or blocked by other Mideast governments.

Most notably in 2013, Egyptian authorities raided a luxury hotel used by Al Jazeera as an operating base after the military takeover that followed mass protests against President Mohammed Morsi. Three Al Jazeera staff members received 10-year prison sentences, but were released in 2015 following widespread international criticism.

The Israel-Hamas war began when Hamas-led fighters killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in an Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding around 100 hostages. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between fighters and civilians.

The closure of Al Jazeera's Ramallah office also comes as tensions continue to rise over a possible expansion of the war to Lebanon, where electronic devices exploded last week in a likely sabotage campaign by Israel targeting the Shiite militia Hezbollah.

The explosions Tuesday and Wednesday killed at least 37 people -- including two children -- and wounded around 3,000 others."
MSNBC host defends Harris avoiding policy questions: She's not 'running for perfect',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/msnbc-host-defends-harris-avoiding-policy-questions-shes-not-running-perfect,2024-09-21T14:26:07Z,"Harris-Walz campaign senior adviser Keisha Lance Bottoms defended the relatively small number of unscripted media appearances done by Vice President Kamala Harris.

MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle went to bat for Vice President Kamala Harris, insisting she doesn't have to address policy questions from the press because ""she's not running for perfect, she's running against Trump.""

On Friday's installment of ""Real Time with Bill Maher,"" Ruhle rushed to defend Harris after host Bill Maher torched the VP's recent comments laying out her plans for a post-war Middle East, suggesting it was hollow.

""She is in a tricky position because Joe Biden is currently the commander in chief and she's the VP,"" Ruhle told Maher. ""So it's very difficult for anybody in her position to kind of thread this needle and say, 'Here's what we should do, here's our plan' when he's the current commander in chief.""

""She's in this weird space of like an improv show, of like a 'yes, and,' 'Yes to what he's doing and I think we should do this,' So it's especially tricky.""

HARRIS ADVISER BRUSHES OFF LACK OF INTERVIEWS: 'SHE'S A VERY BUSY PERSON'

Fellow panelist, New York Times columnist Bret Stephens, turned to Ruhle with an ""honest question,"" asking whether Harris was being ""vague"" for political reasons or ""does she simply have no idea?"" Ruhle insisted that wasn't an ""honest question"" since she'd never say Harris has ""no idea.""

""I'm an undecided voter. I'm never gonna vote for Trump, but I'm not sure I want to vote for Kamala,"" Stephens told Ruhle. ""And my fear is that she doesn't really have a very good command of what she wants to do as president. It would be great for her to sit down with you [Bill Maher], or George Stephanopoulos, or you Stephanie.""

""It's not too much to ask Kamala, 'Say, are you for a Palestinian state if Hamas is gonna run that state? Yes or no?'"" he later added.

""And let's say you don't like her answer. Are you going to vote for Donald Trump?"" Ruhle shot back. ""Kamala Harris is not running for perfect. She's running against Trump. We have two choices. And so there are some things you might not know her answer to. And in 2024, unlike 2016 for a lot of the American people, we know exactly what Trump will do, who he is and the kind of threat he is to democracy.""

""Stephanie, the problem that a lot of people have with Kamala is we don't know her answer to anything, okay?"" Stephens doubled down.

""But you know his answer to everything!"" Ruhle interjected.

BARBARA WALTERS WOULD EXPECT KAMALA HARRIS TO DO INTERVIEWS, AUTHOR SAYS: 'PART OF THE JOB OF BEING PRESIDENT'

""And that's why I would never vote for him and people shouldn't vote for him,"" Stephens continued. ""But people also are expected to have some idea of what program is of the person you're supposed to vote for! You're not supposed to say 'Well, you have to vote for y because x is that and the other.' Let's find out a little bit more. And I don't think it's a lot to ask for her to sit down for a real interview as opposed to a puff piece in which she describes her feelings of growing up in Oakland with nice lawns.""

""I would just say to that- when you move to Nirvana, give me your real estate broker's number and I'll be your next door neighbor. We don't live there!"" Ruhle exclaimed.

After she and Maher further mocked Stephens for remaining undecided, the columnist told them he is among the ""millions of Americans who Kamala has to persuade if she wants to win.""

""Did you ever play the game Would You Rather? Because that is what voting for the president is, okay?"" Ruhle later told Stephens.

Earlier in the conversation, Ruhle agreed with Maher that Trump was a ""threat to democracy"" and defended the ABC News moderators' uneven fact-checking of Trump versus Harris at the presidential debate.

""When Donald Trump tells lie after lie, you don't say 'Well, nobody seems to care. It's our job in the media- when people complain 'Donald Trump got fact-checked way more than Kamala Harris did,' you're damn right he did! You know why? He told more lies!"" Ruhle said."

"After repeated promises from Biden administration that a cease-fire is close, war in Middle East is escalating",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/repeated-promises-biden-administration-cease-fire-close-war-middle-east-escalating,2024-09-20T19:42:42Z,"The IDF said the targets were ready to be used 'in the immediate future' to fire into Israeli territory. (IDF)

After months of public optimism about the prospects of a ceasefire, Biden administration officials have soured on the prospects of an end to the war between Israel and Hamas.

""We aren't any closer to that now than we were even a week ago,"" National Security Council spokesman John Kirby admitted to reporters on Wednesday. He called the prospects of a completed deal ""daunting.""

""No deal is imminent,"" one U.S. official told The Wall Street Journal. ""I'm not sure it ever gets done.""

Israelis point the finger at Hamas for killing six hostages earlier this month, including a U.S. citizen. Arab officials lay blame on Israel for explosive pagers and walkie-talkies and airstrikes aimed at killing Hezbollah fighters for making the prospect of a multi-front war more likely.

""There's no chance now of it happening,"" an Arab official said after the recent campaign against Hezbollah. ""Everyone is in a wait-and-see mode until after the election. The outcome will determine what can happen in the next administration.""

For Biden, a former chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who ran on his diplomacy chops, failure to secure a deal would be a blow to his legacy. It would mean a presidency bookended by a chaotic pullout from Afghanistan at the start and the false hope that peace -- and the return of some 250 hostages taken by Hamas on Oct. 7 -- was just around the corner after the outbreak of war in the Middle East.

Along with the recent attacks on Hezbollah, officials cited another main reason for pessimism to the Journal: the number of Palestinian prisoners that Israel would be asked to release to bring home its hostages.

Joel Rubin, former deputy assistant secretary of state, told Fox News Digital he's less pessimistic about the potential for a deal.

""Nobody's walked away from the table. They haven't stated they're done. Qatar and Egypt are still partnering with us on these talks. The three-stage agreed-upon framework is still in place,"" he said.

""The hangups are on the implementation side, not the framework side,"" he said, noting that negotiations as far as which prisoners will be released, how their safety will be guaranteed and what to do with Hamas Leader Yahya Sinwar remain open-ended.

ISRAEL STRIKES HEZBOLLAH TARGETS IN LEBANON

""These implementation issues keep coming up,"" he said. ""That's where you keep hearing Hamas growing its demands, adding new names, expecting more. And that's where you hear Israel, you know, calling for the Philadelphia corridor, which suddenly has dropped out of the discussion, right? They both want more and more advantage and gains on their side, which is why negotiators are exasperated.""

While the Biden administration continues to try to find ways forward on a deal, public comments that have strung along hope for months are now conflicted by some of the privately held sentiment that cease-fire efforts are futile.

On July 19, Secretary of State Antony Blinken said a cease-fire deal was within sight.

""I believe we're inside the 10-yard line and driving toward the goal line in getting an agreement that would produce a cease-fire, get the hostages home and put us on a better track to trying to build lasting peace and stability,"" Blinken said.

On Aug. 17, President Biden said he was ""optimistic"" a deal could be reached. ""We are closer than we've ever been,"" he said, adding that he was sending Blinken to Israel to continue ""intensive efforts to conclude this agreement.""

On Aug. 19, Blinken said that Israel had ""accepted a proposal"" and the next step was for Hamas to agree.

""The next important statement is for Hamas to say 'yes,' and then, in the coming days, for all of the expert negotiators to get together to work on clear understandings on implementing the agreement,"" Blinken said at a press conference in Tel Aviv.

HOW DID THE HEZBOLLAH PAGER EXPLOSIONS HAPPEN? 5 THINGS TO KNOW

""This is a decisive moment, probably the best, maybe the last opportunity to get the hostages home, to get a cease-fire and to put everyone on a better path to enduring peace and security.""

But those comments came one day after Hamas had said it would not agree to that proposal. They objected to Israel having control of the Rafah and Philadelphia corridors, as Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu had demanded.

Then again on Sept. 2, Biden claimed the U.S. was ""very close"" to finalizing a cease-fire deal that would see the release of hostages. Asked why he was optimistic despite other deals having failed, he said, ""Hope springs eternal.""

Even this week, Blinken expressed optimism about a deal, though he warned after the pager blasts that ""escalation"" threatens to thwart progress.

""It's imperative that all parties refrain from any actions that could escalate the conflict,"" Blinken said at a news conference in Egypt.

He said he was focused on a deal that would bring calm on all fronts, including Israel's northern border with Lebanon. Blinken said that 15 out of 18 paragraphs of a deal had been agreed by all sides.

He blamed long wait times for messages to be passed between the parties for leaving space to disrupt the talks.

""We've seen that in the intervening time, you might have an event, an incident -- something that makes the process more difficult, that threatens to slow it, stop it, derail it -- and anything of that nature, by definition, is probably not good in terms of achieving the result that we want, which is the cease-fire,"" Blinken said.

After Egypt, he went to Paris to discuss the prospects of a deal with his European counterparts.

U.S. national security adviser Jake Sullivan met Wednesday with the relatives of the seven remaining U.S. hostages held in Gaza, where the families said they ""expressed frustration with the lack of tangible progress"" to Sullivan.

On Thursday, Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in a televised address called the pager attacks ""a declaration of war"" and that attacks against Israel would continue until the war with Gaza is over. Likewise, Israel's defense minister vowed to continue striking Hezbollah in Lebanon, aiming to stop the group's rocket and missile attacks so some 70,000 Israelis who live in the northern border region could return home."

Former President Donald Trump is casting himself as Israel's ""protector"" and warning Jewish voters against supporting his rival, Vice President Harris.

Trump addressed the Israeli-American Council summit in Washington, D.C, on Thursday, during an evening focused on commemorating the October 7 attacks that sparked Israel's war with Hamas.

Speaking to a mostly friendly crowd, Trump touted his past support for Israel and, without providing evidence, claimed that the Jewish state will soon cease to exist unless he's elected.

""It's total annihilation -- that's what you're talking about,"" Trump said. ""You have a big protector in me. You don't have a protector on the other side.""

Trump also accused Harris of ""pandering"" to Hamas supporters and said ""Jewish people have no excuse"" for supporting his Democratic rival. Trump has a long history of accusing Jewish Democrats of being disloyal to Israel.

Harris has said that she will support Israel's right to defend itself while also calling the suffering in Gaza ""devastating.""

The Hamas attack on October 7 killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took more than 200 hostages, including some American citizens. Since then, health officials in Gaza say more than 40,000 Palestinians have died.

Trump's address to the Israeli-American Council comes just weeks after a 23-year-old Israeli-American, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, was found shot dead in a Hamas tunnel in Gaza, along with the bodies of five other hostages.

Other featured speakers Thursday night included Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York and Republican megadonor Miriam Adelson."

(Courtesy New York Post)

A Cornell University professor who was accused of ""justifying terror"" after describing Hamas' bloody Oct. 7 operation in Southern Israel as ""exhilarating"" is coming under fire again for taking part in an anti-Israel march on the college campus this week, when protesters could be heard chanting ""long live the intifada"" before crashing a career fair.

Russell Rickford, an associate professor of history at Cornell University, was seen on video with a keffiyeh around his shoulders marching with dozens of anti-Israel supporters on campus Wednesday.

Some of the protesters, many of whom wore face masks and were also clad in keffiyehs, carried Palestinian flags and signs reading, ""Cornell divest from genocide"" and ""defund genocide.""

CORNELL PROFESSOR WHO WAS 'EXHILARATED' AFTER HAMAS ATTACK ISSUES APOLOGY FOR 'REPREHENSIBLE' REMARKS

The boisterous, pan-banging protesters eventually disrupted a career fair at the Statler Hotel on campus, as Rickford could be seen on video looking on and clapping his hands outside.

School officials said the demonstrators pushed past school police officers, although it does not appear that Rickford was part of the group that burst into the career fair.

""Guests of the university felt threatened. And students were denied their ability to experience the career fair,"" Joel Malina, the vice president of university relations at Cornell said in a statement. ""This behavior is unacceptable, a violation of university policy, and illegal.""

One Jewish student told the New York Post that the instructor's presence at the protest was ""insane"" and another accused him of ""emboldening hate."" Video shows the group chanting, ""long live the intifada."" Intifada is an Arabic word for a rebellion or uprising, or a resistance movement.

Rickford, who specializes in African American political culture, was roundly condemned last year when he made inflammatory comments about Hamas' sneak terror attack that killed 1,200 people and led to the current war in Gaza.

""It was exhilarating, it was energizing.... I was exhilarated,"" Rickford said at the time. He later walked back the comments and apologized, describing the speech as ""reprehensible.""

The self-identified ""secular Marxist"" eventually went on leave amid the media firestorm over his comments about the Hamas killing spree against hundreds of civilians, including American citizens, but he has now returned to the college.

Amanda Silberstain, vice president of Chabad and Cornellians for Israel, an Israel advocacy group on campus, said Rickford marched with students to the Statler Hotel but is unsure if he went inside.

""He was wearing a keffiyeh and smiling. Rickford knows he's immune from consequences,"" Sillberstein told the Post. ""We have a professor who is promoting antisemitic narratives and emboldening hate.""

DIVERSITY PROFESSOR ACCUSED OF VERBALLY ATTACKING STUDENTS AFTER TERRORISM REMARK CLEARED OF ANY WRONGDOING

Malina said that students who violated university policies during the protest would be referred to the Office of Student Conduct and Community Standards for ""immediate action including suspension"" while faculty and staff would be referred to human resources.

""These individuals will also be subject to potential criminal charges,"" Malina said.

Cornell provided Fox News Digital with a prior statement from Molina when asked for comment about Rickford's latest actions.

""Last October, Professor Russel Rickford made a horrific comment at an off-campus rally in downtown Ithaca. As then-President Pollack and Board Chair Kayser noted at the time, his comment was reprehensible and demonstrated a complete disregard for humanity. Professor Rickford apologized for his comments and took a voluntary leave of absence for the remainder of the academic year.""

""Consistent with well-established principles of academic freedom, Cornell has a process for considering whether public statements such as those expressed off campus by Professor Rickford at a political rally fall under the category of protected speech, or rather demonstrate prohibited bias, discrimination, or harassment. Given that Professor Rickford's comments were made as a private citizen in his free time, the university's academic leadership has concluded that Professor Rickford's conduct in relation to this incident did not meet that high bar.""

Fox News Digital was unable to reach Rickford for comment.

Rickford's comments on political violence go as far back as a decade.

In two videos reviewed by Fox News Digital, one from 2021 and another from 2014, Rickford discussed his desire for an anti-racist ""insurgent"" group to take power in the United States. In one of the videos, he said some White people are ready to commit ""race suicide"" and went on to discuss the ""politics of violence"" while simultaneously attacking the ideals of civility.

During a webinar hosted on a Cornell platform in February 2021, Rickford endorsed ""radical frameworks for anti-racism."" The radical frameworks call for a fundamental revolutionary change in society to change the distribution of wealth in neo-Marxist fashion.

""Radical anti-racists ... knew justice required not ... dialogue ... but genuine reallocations of resources and power. Attacking the roots of White supremacy meant challenging the normal operations of capitalism.""

Rickford has also said that the Black Lives Matter movement ""reflects this more ... redistributive mode of anti-racism,"" adding that ""What we need is not more civil dialogue [but] more insurgent popular anti-racist movements that fight the whole apparatus of oppression."""
Dem lawmakers push bill to restore funding to UN agency with alleged ties to Hamas: 'So necessary',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dem-lawmakers-push-bill-restore-funding-un-agency-alleged-ties-hamas-so-necessary,2024-09-19T22:54:52Z,"The Israeli Defense Force on Tuesday released video they claim shows Hamas terrorists operating inside a UNRWA base near Rafah.

A group of Democratic lawmakers is calling for the U.S. to restore funding to a controversial United Nations agency that supports much-needed humanitarian aid to Palestinian refugees but faced accusations that some of its employees participated in the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel.

Speaking at a press conference outside the U.S. Capitol on Thursday afternoon, Democratic Reps. André Carson of Indiana, Pramila Jayapal of Washington and Jan Schakowsky of Illinois, among others, said passing H.R. 9649, or the UNRWA Funding Emergency Restoration Act, was crucial for helping Gazans.

Carson, who sponsored the bill, portrayed a dire situation in Gaza, calling current conditions ""absolutely deplorable"" and ""inhumane.""

""One million. That's the number of estimated Gazans who will not have enough food this month. 700,000. That's the number of women and girls in Gaza who do not have access to menstrual products or even running water and toilet paper. 100,000. That is the number of Palestinians who have been seriously injured without access to functioning hospitals. 41,000. That's the number of Palestinians killed by Israel since Oct. 7th,"" Carson said.

ISRAEL STRIKES HEZBOLLAH TARGETS IN LEBANON AFTER TWO ROUNDS OF DEVICE EXPLOSIONS

Jayapal said the UNRWA has, for decades, ""played an integral role in supporting the welfare of Palestinian refugees to ensure that they can live with dignity.""

""Unfortunately, UNWRA has been under constant attack by those who want to put a stop to this lifesaving work. The stoppage of funding was an unnecessary and dangerous interruption to continue to provide the humanitarian assistant that is so necessary,"" she said.

The United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East, or UNRWA, has been one of the central agencies distributing aid to Palestinians in Gaza over the course of Israel's ongoing war with Hamas. It has around 30,000 employees.

In January, U.N. Secretary General António Guterres tasked the U.N.'s investigative arm, the Office of Internal Oversight Services, to investigate allegations by Israel that UNRWA staff took part in the Oct. 7 massacre.

Nearly 20 UNRWA staff members were investigated, but the U.N. only found enough evidence to dismiss nine people.

Still, Israel's allegations initially led top donor countries -- most notably, the U.S. -- to suspend funding for UNRWA, causing a cash crunch of $450 million. Since then, all donor countries -- except for the U.S. -- have resumed funding.

IRANIAN NETANYAHU ASSASSINATION PLOT FOILED, ISRAELI MAN CHARGED

Schakowsky said it was ""shameful"" that the U.S. decided to cut funding to UNRWA because only a ""tiny number"" of the agency's roughly 30,000 employees were alleged to have been involved in terrorist activities.

""Every other country, among those of our allies that had decided to stop funding UNRWA, have changed their mind. So now it is the United States alone,"" Schakowsky said. ""And the fact that the United States has decided that it's not going to be there means a danger to the people who are dying, in danger of dying every single day, including children and women and families and everyone for basic needs that they have. And that is shameful. We cannot allow that.""

H.R. 9649 has 65 co-sponsors and support from more than 100 human rights organizations. But not everyone is supportive of restoring funding.

Anne Bayefsky, Director of the Touro Institute on Human Rights and the Holocaust and President of Human Rights Voices, said lawmakers' support of H.R. 9649 whitewashes the UNRWA's alleged ""connections to terrorism"" and sends ""the wrong message to Israel and America's enemies at the wrong time.""

""Let's get the facts straight: UNRWA employees directly participated in October 7 atrocities; 10% of UNRWA employees are reported to have ties to multiple Palestinian terror organizations; a significant percentage of UNRWA's senior education leadership are members of Hamas or Palestinian Islamic Jihad,"" Bayefsky said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

Bayefsky also noted that ""UNRWA facilities -- including schools -- have been used as Hamas command and control centers and weapons depots [and] UNRWA's Gaza headquarters powered a Hamas data center directly beneath it.""

Bayefsky slammed the UNRWA for not having taken, in her view, ""serious steps towards accountability or prevention... while at the same time demanding more funding.""

""This is not a small drop in a fictional ocean of humanitarianism,"" Bayefsky said. ""UNRWA's ties to Palestinian terrorism emanate from raising a generation of Palestinian Arabs on the hatred of Jews in its schools, upending the meaning of a 'refugee' to serve as a vehicle to eviscerate the Jewish state. And spreading slanderous lies guaranteed to undermine peaceful coexistence between Palestinians and Israelis to the detriment of all.""

Fox News Digital has reached out to the UNRWA for comment on H.R. 9649. The U.N., meanwhile, told Fox News Digital it does ""not comment on legislations in countries. But we've been clear that UNRWA is the backbone of humanitarian support for Palestinian people and should be supported."""
Opinion |  The Uncommitted Movement just made a smart move that will please nobody.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/uncommitted-movement-harris-endorsement-trump-israel-gaza-rcna171833,2024-09-19T22:54:07Z,"The Uncommitted Movement just made a smart move that will please nobody.

The Uncommitted Movement, the group that helped organize the casting of hundreds of thousands of uncommitted ballots in the Democratic presidential primaries to pressure the party to change its position on supporting Israel, announced Thursday that it will not be endorsing Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. In the same announcement, however, the group also called for the movement to vote against former President Donald Trump and to avoid third parties.

In other words, Uncommitted effectively criticized Harris as fundamentally problematic on Israel policy while simultaneously encouraging people to vote for her.

The seemingly contradictory recommendations are bound to anger plenty of progressives upset by the Biden administration's policies on Israel. But it adds up to a largely coherent strategic position, based on an assessment of the limited power of the pro-Palestinian movement at this juncture and the correct appraisal that Trump would make the situation in Gaza even worse. I'd say the announcement marks a concession that the group is weak -- but also that it wants to stay in the game in the long run in the hope to one day shape the Democratic Party's policies on the issue.

In its announcement of its non-endorsement, the Uncommitted Movement cited its dissatisfaction over Harris' declining its request to meet with Palestinian Americans in Michigan who have lost loved ones in the Gaza Strip and discuss their demands for an arms embargo on Israel and how to pursue a cease-fire deal. This came after the Democrats refused to invite any Palestinian Americans to speak at the main stage at the Democratic National Convention about the war in Gaza, despite the presence of dozens of Democratic delegates affiliated with the Uncommitted Movement and their vigorous lobbying for a speaker on the issue. (By contrast, the DNC gave a speaking slot to the parents of an Israeli American hostage, who was tragically killed after the convention.) Harris did briefly meet with two members of the Uncommitted Movement in early August but reportedly declined to commit to a longer meeting about arms restrictions on Israel. Alongside all of this, Harris has deployed rhetoric about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict that signals a continuation of the policy status quo and sternly reprimanded pro-Palestinian protesters who disrupted one of her events.

""Vice President Harris's unwillingness to shift on unconditional weapons policy or to even make a clear campaign statement in support of upholding existing U.S. and international human rights law has made it impossible for us to endorse her,"" the group said in a new statement.

At the same time, the statement argued, Trump would be worse for Palestinians in the Gaza Strip because he would ""accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organizing."" For this reason, the group states, Uncommitted supporters should vote against Republicans ""up and down the ballot"" and avoid third-party candidates who could ""inadvertently boost"" Trump's chances.

The Uncommitted Movement's attempt to thread a needle here is awkward. Its statement is, all in the same breath, a complaint about Democrats and also a de facto soft endorsement of them. Some activists will object to the Uncommitted Movement voluntarily giving up its leverage over the Democratic Party, out of the belief that holding out on an endorsement announcement might've resulted in some concessions from Harris with another month and a half to go until Election Day. Still others -- some of them likely out of the belief that Harris probably won't signal any policy changes on a hot button issue unless she wins office -- will say the Uncommitted Movement's mealy-mouthed quasi-endorsement is riskier than articulating a clear position that Trump is the biggest imminent threat to Palestinian life.

But the Uncommitted Movement's overall posture should be familiar to anyone on the left who thinks about the hard reality of voting in America: Even on issues on which Democrats are not good, or are even downright terrible, Republicans are often worse. That's certainly true in this case. The Biden administration's effectively unconditional aid to Israel has been morally indefensible and catastrophic for Palestinian civilian life. But Trump would in all likelihood embolden Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu even more than President Joe Biden, intensify Israel's brutal domination of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, and revel in brutal repression of protesters at home.

I do think the Uncommitted Movement could have waited longer to issue a statement -- perhaps until some time in October, to test Harris more and capitalize on a potential upswing in protests over the issue. But ultimately I'm sympathetic to its attempt to balance values with strategic efficacy. The non-endorsement allows the group to credibly identify potential positive policy changes in the future, since an endorsement would've squandered that claim to specific judgment of politicians' policy positions. At the same time, the voting guidance correctly counsels the movement to think about minimizing harm for Palestinians, seeking the best possible activist terrain in the medium- to long-term future, and choosing to organize against politicians who could conceivably be influenced. It also marks a recognition that the Democratic Party has made it clear that its strategy is to ignore the pro-Palestinian movement, knowing that the movement has lost significant momentum with Harris' nomination and data indicating the war in Gaza is not a top tier issue even for most young voters.

In its statement, the Uncommitted Movement argues that the antiwar movement must try make inroads into the Democratic Party and develop coalitions that contest the American Israel Public Affairs Committee's significant influence on the party on Israel policy. That's an important long-term goal. For the time being, the best hope the antiwar movement has is to keep up the pressure on the party through a fierce protest movement that demands that Democrats put and end to their abominable disregard for life in the Gaza Strip."
"Uncommitted movement doesn't endorse Harris, but asks supporters to vote against Trump",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/19/g-s1-23736/uncommitted-movement-no-endorsement-harris-trump-2024,2024-09-19T17:39:44Z,"The leaders of the ""uncommitted"" movement, which grew out of Democratic opposition to President Biden's policy towards Israel and Gaza, will not endorse Vice President Harris for president, but urged supporters to ""vote against"" former President Donald Trump and ""avoid"" third party candidates.

""Harris's unwillingness to shift on unconditional weapons policy or to even make a clear campaign statement in support of upholding existing U.S. and international human rights law has made it impossible for us to endorse her,"" organizers of the Uncommitted National Movement said in a statement.

""At this time, our movement 1) cannot endorse Vice President Harris; 2) opposes a Donald Trump presidency, whose agenda includes plans to accelerate the killing in Gaza while intensifying the suppression of anti-war organizing; and 3) is not recommending a third-party vote in the Presidential election, especially as third party votes in key swing states could help inadvertently deliver a Trump presidency given our country's broken electoral college system,"" the statement continued.

The uncommitted movement grew out of the ""Listen to Michigan"" campaign ahead of that state's February presidential primary. Its goal was to send a message to Biden that he needed to do more to prevent civilian deaths in Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of voters eventually cast uncommitted ballots throughout the Democratic primary in several states.

Organizers' key demands are for an immediate cease-fire in Gaza and an end to U.S. weapons transfers to Israel. When Harris replaced Biden at the top of the ticket, they initially expressed optimism that Harris would be more open to their demands, providing a ""window of opportunity.""

But the group was angered when their request to have a Palestinian-American speak at the Democratic National Convention was denied. Organizers had also given the Harris campaign a Sept. 15 deadline to respond to requests to meet with Palestinian-American families in Michigan who had lost loved ones in Gaza. Abbas Alawieh, a co-founder of the movement, said the campaign's response was ""not satisfactory.""

In a press conference after the announcement, leaders stressed that they are urging voters to ""block"" a second Trump term. But telling voters who have lost loved ones in Gaza to support Harris, Alawieh said, would be ""inappropriate.""

Alawieh called the non-endorsement ""something we have to do.""

""We know how dangerous Donald Trump is,"" he said. ""There was no way, ever, that our movement...would recommend a vote that would specifically help Donald Trump.""

""We said to [disenchanted voters] that the way that we would endorse vice president Harris is if she moved her policy, or if she turned the page to a new approach, and she just hasn't done that yet,"" Alaweih said.

A Harris campaign spokesperson said in a statement, ""The vice president is committed to work to earn every vote, unite our country, and to be a President for all Americans. She will continue working to bring the war in Gaza to an end in a way where Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom and self-determination."""
"AOC, Bernie Sanders lead action against Israel after shocking pager attacks on Hezbollah",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/aoc-condemns-israels-pager-attack,2024-09-18T20:42:07Z,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-NY., explains why Vice President Kamala Harris is a 'leader' at the Democratic National Convention.

Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., is demanding an investigation into whether any U.S. resources went toward Israel's coordinated explosion of Hezbollah pagers.

""Israel's pager attack in Lebanon detonated thousands of handheld devices across of a [sic] slew of public spaces, seriously injuring and killing innocent civilians,"" the progressive New Yorker wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

""This attack clearly and unequivocally violates international humanitarian law and undermines US efforts to prevent a wider conflict. Congress needs a full accounting of the attack, including an answer from the State Department as to whether any US assistance went into the development or deployment of this technology.""

Israel's foreign intelligence agency, Mossad, planted explosives inside of 5,000 pagers imported by Hezbollah months before Tuesday's and Wednesday's detonations, a senior defense official confirmed to Fox News.

ISRAEL BEHIND LEBANON PAGER ATTACK TARGETING HEZBOLLAH, SENIOR US OFFICIAL SAYS

""The United States, did not know about, nor was it involved in, these incidents,"" Secretary of State Antony Blinken told reporters of the pager attacks on Wednesday.

He then warned Israel against escalating conflict.

""We've been very clear and we remain very clear about the importance of all parties avoiding any steps that could further escalate the conflict that we're trying to resolve in Gaza,"" Blinken went on. ""To see it spread to other fronts, it's clearly not in the interest of anyone involved to see that happen.""

Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., meanwhile, dropped a pair of joint resolutions that would block U.S. arms sales to Israel.

The Biden administration in August approved a series of arms sales totaling $20 billion to Israel, including ""several systems that are directly tied to tens of thousands of civilian deaths in Gaza,"" according to Sanders.

HEZBOLLAH PAGERS THAT EXPLODED WERE MADE IN HUNGARY, TAIWANESE COMPANY SAYS

""Congress must act to save lives, uphold U.S. and international law, and stand up for U.S. interests. We must end our complicity in Israel's illegal and indiscriminate military campaign, which has caused mass civilian death and suffering.""

Under Senate rules, Sanders can force a vote on the resolutions as soon as next week. They would need 51 votes to be approved.

The Iranian regime-backed Hezbollah organization switched from mobile phones to pagers to prevent Israeli interception of their communications. Hezbollah joined Hamas' war against Israel a day after the Gaza-based terrorist movement invaded the Jewish state on Oct. 7.

Some 2,500 people were wounded and 12 killed in the coordinated pager explosions on Tuesday. Then on Wednesday, 14 people were killed and hundreds more injured when walkie-talkies owned by Hezbollah members exploded across Lebanon on Wednesday afternoon.

Of the 26 who have died in the two attacks, Hezbollah confirmed eight were its members.

Hezbollah is estimated to have more than 150,000 missiles aimed at Israel. The de facto ruler of Lebanon, Hezbollah, has amassed new sophisticated missiles, rockets and drones since its 2006 war against Israel. Hezbollah has launched more than 7,500 missiles, rockets, and drones into Israel since Oct. 8.

One Hezbollah official said the detonation of the pagers was the group's ""biggest security breach"" since the Gaza conflict began.

Hezbollah said in a statement on Wednesday that ""the resistance will continue today, like any other day, its operations to support Gaza, its people and its resistance, which is a separate path from the harsh punishment that the criminal enemy (Israel) should await in response to Tuesday's massacre.""

This is the first resolution proposed by the Palestinians after gaining additional powers as a member following a vote in May, including granting them the ability to propose resolutions.

The Palestinian territories pushed for the resolution on the back of a July advisory opinion by the United Nations' International Court of Justice (ICJ) that determined Israel's occupation of the Palestinian territories and settlements is illegal and should be withdrawn.

Andrew Tucker, the director general of The Hague Initiative for International Cooperation, told Fox News Digital ahead of the resolution vote that the proposal would essentially seek to implement the ICJ advisory opinion with a hard timeline, whereas the ICJ merely said it should be done ""immediately.""

""The court came out with an opinion in July,"" Tucker explained. ""It's an opinion: It's not a ruling, it's not a criminal case. They're not deciding a dispute. It's a legal opinion that the court is being asked to give by the General Assembly.""

""But it goes to the heart of the Israel-Palestinian conflict,"" Tucker said. ""In essence, the court is being asked to give its opinion on really the key issues that have been disputes between Israel and the Palestinians for decades, and the General Assembly is now implementing that opinion.""

""The court [is] saying: [It] doesn't matter what Israel's security concerns are, doesn't matter [that] there's a war going on in Gaza,"" Tucker continued. ""It doesn't matter that Hezbollah is threatening to attack from the north. All of these things are irrelevant.""

""The Palestinians have a kind of absolute right to self-determination, and that means that Israel's presence in the territories has become illegal,"" he added. ""Now, legally... there's a lot to be said about this. For example... never before has the right to self-determination been given this level of priority.""

Tucker argued that the implications of such a decision could lead to ""greater conflict"" because Israel's expedited exit could leave open the chance for Iran to dig into the West Bank the same way it did with Hamas in the Gaza Strip.

""If Israel withdraws from these territories... It's only 10 kilometers from there at the smallest [point] between the West Bank and Tel Aviv,"" Tucker said.

Opinion | Sen. John Kennedy used a Senate hearing on hate crimes to spew hate,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/john-kennedy-arab-american-maya-berry-hamas-bag-rcna171564,2024-09-18T19:49:08Z,"A senator's racist attack on a witness in a hearing was appalling even by Trump era standards.

On Tuesday, the executive director of the Arab American Institute, Maya Berry, appeared as a witness before the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify on an issue that should garner concern across the political spectrum: hate crimes. In both her prepared statement and her testimony, Berry apprised lawmakers of the need for stronger enforcement of the law to tackle the country's growing ""hate crime crisis.""

She acknowledged both Jewish and Arab American victims of hate crimes, and shared statistics on those crimes' effects on all kinds of demographic groups, including Black Americans, Asian Americans and members of the LBGTQ community.

It's difficult to imagine how a reasonable person could take issue with Berry's comments, other than to interrogate how effective the hate crime enforcement model is. But in a shocking display, Sen. John Kennedy, R-La., demonstrated that he is not a reasonable person.

Instead, Kennedy used the hearing as an opportunity to launch a series of racist attacks on Berry, centered around accusations that she supports terrorism. His repugnant broadsides were a stunning illustration both of why the panel was being held in the first place and how politicians use ad hominem attacks to try to silence criticism of Israel.

Shortly after beginning to question Berry, Kennedy abruptly asked her: ""You support Hamas, do you not?""

""Senator, oddly enough, I'm going to say thank you for that question, because it demonstrates the purpose of our hearing today in a very effective way,"" Berry replied.

Kennedy interjected: ""Let's start first with a yes or no.""

""Hamas is a foreign terrorist organization that I do not support,"" Berry responded, ""but you asking the executive director of the Arab American Institute that question very much puts the focus on the issue of hate in our country.""

""You support Hezbollah, too, don't you?"" Kennedy then asked -- implying that he didn't believe her answer on Hamas.

Berry replied, ""I find this line of questioning extraordinarily disappointing.""

""Is that a no?"" Kennedy demanded.

""I don't support violence, whether it's Hezbollah or Hamas or any other entity that invokes it, so no, sir,"" she said.

""You just can't bring yourself to say no, can you? Kennedy said, even though Berry's answer could not have been clearer. He continued his absurd line of questioning, asking her if she supports or opposes Iran ""and their hatred of Jews?""

After Berry said she didn't support Iran, Kennedy questioned why she criticized the U.S. decision to cut funding to the U.N. agency that aids Palestinian civilians as a moral failure (a correct position, but one that should be irrelevant to a hearing on hate crimes) and then used that to circle back to deeming her a terrorist sympathizer. ""You can't bring yourself to say you don't support UNRWA, you don't support Hamas, you don't support Hezbollah and you don't support Iran,"" Kennedy shouted. ""You should hide your head in a bag.""

His declaration elicited gasps and cries of disapproval from the crowd in the room.

What a shameful display. Berry was called in as an expert from a civil rights organization to talk about the domestic issue of hate crimes. But the Kennedy was only interested in smearing an Arab American witness as a supporter of foreign American adversaries. He did so not by referring to her past conduct or positions, but simply putting words in her mouth, and then refusing to accept any of her statements as true.

In an interview with NBC News after the hearing, Kennedy said that he was correct to question Berry's positions because he claims that ""her website says"" she's a Democratic activist, that she believes Israel is committing genocide, and that Congress should fund UNRWA. True or not, none of those things have any bearing on whether she supports Hamas, Hezbollah or Iran. He also claimed -- again, falsely -- that she ""never would answer"" whether the supported those entities.

The only reasonable explanation for Kennedy's behavior is that he believes that her identity as Arab American is sufficient to define her as a supporter of terrorism.

Kennedy's grotesque bigotry undermines the very concept of democratic discourse, in which citizens' interests are defined by their actions and their words, not their ethnic background or their gender or sexual orientation. Whether sincere or not, Kennedy's refusal to take Berry at her word is a refusal to accept her as a legitimate citizen. And as Berry pointed out, Kennedy's behavior underscored exactly why hate crimes are a problem in America -- too many Americans fall prey to the fallacy of generalizing about marginalized identities and vilifying them.

Lastly, Kennedy's rhetoric was a reminder of how many supporters of Israel in Washington will conflate any kind of support for Palestinians' dignity -- in this case, funding for UNRWA -- with antisemitism. These smear campaigns are intended to discourage criticism of Israel through ad hominem attacks.

Berry went before the Senate to discuss the important issue of hate crimes, only to receive a torrent of abuse. She should be commended for her sensitivity to how those crimes take a toll on people from all kinds of marginalized communities. And it is Kennedy, not Berry, who should hide his head for such a vile expression of hate."
Anti-Trump columnist says Harris hasn't earned his support yet: 'Widespread perception of unseriousness',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/anti-trump-columnist-harris-hasnt-earned-support-widespread-perception-unseriousness,2024-09-18T16:05:56Z,"Will Pierce, former senior adviser to Bernie Sanders, joins 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the National Association of Black Journalists' questioning of Vice President Kamala Harris.

New York Times columnist Bret Stephens is staunchly anti-Trump but said he isn't sold on voting for Vice President Kamala Harris yet, saying she can no longer afford to dodge giving specific answers to media questions.

""If, as president, she had intelligence that Iran was on the cusp of assembling a nuclear weapon, would she use force to stop it? Are there limits to American support for Ukraine, and what are they?"" Stephens asked in an opinion piece from Tuesday, also listing difficult questions about the creation of a ""Palestinian state,"" the housing crisis, and the possible role of ""nuclear power in her energy and climate plans.""

Stephens criticized Harris for her ""lighter than air"" answers to questions in interviews with CNN reporter Dana Bash and 6ABC's Brian Taff, in his piece headlined, ""What Harris must do to win over skeptics (like me).""

HARRIS TELLS NABJ SHE EXPECTS TO 'EARN' THE BLACK VOTE THIS NOVEMBER

""It may be that Harris has thoughtful answers to these sorts of questions,"" Stephens wrote. ""If so, she isn't letting on.""

Harris has gone 59 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference. She's started to step up her interviews, sitting with the National Association of Black Journalists on Tuesday in Philadelphia.

""All this helps explain my unease with the thought of voting for Harris -- an unease I never felt, despite policy differences, when Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden were on the ballot against Trump,"" Stephens wrote. ""If Harris can answer the sorts of questions I posed above, she should be quick to do so, if only to dispel a widespread perception of unseriousness. If she can't, then what was she doing over nearly eight years as a senator and vice president?""

""Illiberal populism has taken root in response to well-founded perceptions of elite incompetence, highhandedness and self-dealing,"" Stephens continued. ""Does Harris have anything to offer disaffected voters, or does she merely embody the elitist perspective that they despise?""

LAST MAJOR UNION YET TO ENDORSE IN HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN NEARS FINAL DECISION

The columnist said that Harris cannot hide behind the ""all-purpose response"" that former President Trump is an ""existential threat"" to democratic institutions that her campaign has often relied on.

""But: Trump,"" he wrote. ""That's the all-purpose response for many voters to any doubts about Harris's qualifications.""

""It should not be hard for Harris to demonstrate that she can give detailed answers to urgent policy questions,"" Stephens wrote. ""Or to express a sense, beyond a few canned phrases, of how she sees the American interest in a darkening world. Or to articulate a politics of genuine inclusion that reaches out to tens of millions of distrustful voters. Or to prove that she's more than another factory-settings liberal Democrat whose greatest virtue, like her greatest fault, is that she won't step too far from the conventional wisdom.""

Book Review: George Gilder's Excellent and Crucial 'The Israel Test',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/09/18/book-review-george-gilders-excellent-and-crucial-the-israel-test/,2024-09-18T16:03:56Z,"Without defending some (or a lot) of its anti-growth economic policies, the easily-forgotten truth is that California is by far the most enterprising, entrepreneurial state in the most enterprising, entrepreneurial country in the world. Evidence supporting the previous claim can be found in the fact that 60% of the world's venture capital investment annually flows to startups based in California, not to mention that if the Golden State were a country, it could lay claim to being the world's 4 largest economy. When conservatives oddly politicize what booms as a ""basket case"" (and other pejoratives like it), they shrink themselves.

The great George Gilder has long recognized the herculean genius of California's entrepreneurs, along with that of the remarkable investors who match west coast genius with capital. As he observed in his spectacular 2023 book Life After Capitalism, it's not just the economic activity taking place within California that people should marvel at, it's the surges in productivity that California-based innovation has long made possible outside the state. California is decidedly not an economic basket case, but the world economy would most certainly be a basket case without California.

Gilder's past insights came to mind quite a bit while reading his highly informative, excellent and crucial new book, The Israel Test: How Israel's Genius Enriches and Challenges the World. This essential read gives life to Gilder's assertions about California's economic impact on the world, an impact that is very much informed by technology and financial sectors well populated by Jews.

For those who don't know why California thrives despite certain policies normally inimical to success, they'll understand better from The Israel Test. As Gilder makes plain on the book's very first page, ""we Americans still face our Israel Test, our humbling need to not only recognize our dependence on the genius of the Jews in the United States, but also to acknowledge our reliance not only for innovation but even for our national security on this diminutive and embattled Middle Eastern ally."" While the focus of The Israel Test is not California, what's apparent is that Israel, like California with its sizable Jewish population, is similarly instrumental to global economic health and security. Yes, it's increasingly true that the world economy would be a basket case without Israel.

In Gilder's words, ""Planetary prosperity depends on the outsized genius of a tiny minority of human beings."" More and more of this ""vital few"" (HT: Reuven Brenner) talent resides in Israel. Which is the purpose of Gilder's book, one that should (and hopefully will) attain a large global audience. Particularly as Israel's enemies spew hideous rhetoric of the ""river to the sea"" variety, those who know better need to understand that the words aren't just ugly, not just sickeningly inhumane if acted upon, they would also be globally disastrous economically.

Looked at through a U.S. economic prism alone, Gilder writes that ""most of America's preeminent technology companies"" along with its healthcare giants ""still depend on crucial inventors, engineers, intellectual prosperity, and laboratories in Israel."" Considering our military planes like the F-16, numerous inputs for the latter are crafted in Israel. Assuming an all-out missile attack on the United States, Gilder asserts that ""Israeli technology will be the reason we likely survive it."" Despite this, the country suffers an ""insidious spate of abusive nonsense detailing the alleged flaws - indeed the sins - of Israel.""

What's odd is that the abusive nonsense directed at Israel frequently originates in the United States. Odder still, as Gilder conveys through brilliant Israeli entrepreneurs like Shaul Olmert (son of Ehud, former prime minister), is how much of the criticism of the country comes from Israelis themselves. Gilder laments that Jewish outperformance isn't just financial, technological and cultural, that the Jews ""outperform all rivals even in the arena of anti-Semitism.""

Looking at the U.S. alone, Gilder is of the view that ""the United States has all too often failed the Israel Test"" through its perception of ""Israeli power, prosperity, culture, genius, and self-defense as a problem rather than a supreme global asset."" And a global asset it is. At the same time, it requires stress just how much of a local asset Israel is.

Gilder writes that before the Jews returned to Israel (1/6 of 1 percent of the total Middle East land mass), the land ""scarcely counted as a desirable asset or a prize to be awarded to anyone before the Jews reclaimed it and made its economy valuable and its land capable of supporting life."" And it was surely not desired by Arabs who now make pushing the Jews into the sea from this tiny bit of land their modern raison d'etre. Major evidence required to make this claim can be found in what the land surrounding Israel looks like now, not to mention what Israel would look like if the Jews departed or were pushed out.

Which explains Gilder's assertion that contra all the rhetoric about ""occupation"" and forced ""settlements,"" the ""Jews were not occupying a nation,"" rather ""they were building one."" What they built has proven rather appealing to non-Jews, including Arabs. Gilder notes that ""Arabs flourish in Israel as they do nowhere else.""At present, ""Israel, Gaza, and the West Bank accommodate some 5.5 million Arabs, with a population density ten times that of Jordan."" Human migration is the purest market signal of them all, and the migration of Arabs into and around Israel signals the soaring economic opportunity that reveals itself wherever the commercially skillful take their talents. Genius, per Gilder, is ""a source of wealth and opportunity for all.""

Which raises obvious responses to the frequent critiques of Jews and their ""settlements."" To say these movements are negatives is like saying it would harm a limping U.S. neighborhood if well-to-do, upright neighbors moved in, or that a business district would be harmed if a McDonald's, Whole Foods, or Apple Store showed up. Obviously not. Where prosperous people and businesses go, other thriving businesses and people frequently follow. Where the Jews go, vast improvement follows. Gilder writes this in more of a protective sense for Israel from guns and bombs, but when he writes that ""Israel is not too large but too small,"" it's easy to apply the previous assertion to the wellbeing of the non-Jews in the region not fortunate enough to live in Israel.

Sadly, this view is not shared by Hamas, Hezbollah, the PA, and a myriad of other entities that have directed so much ugly rhetoric, violence and murder at Israel and its people. Even though the Jews have made enormously desirable what formerly wasn't, Hamas et al obviously want the land back. Or do they? Considering the look of the lands abutting Israel, what a disaster for the various terrorists groups if the Israelis were to pull an Atlas Shrugged of sorts and leave.

For now, Hamas and other terrorist organizations like it somehow frame Israel's prosperous, world-enhancing existence as the problem for the region. Worse, they get help not just from Israel's critics, but also its defenders. Gilder writes that ""the central error of Israel's defenders is to accept the framing of the debate by its enemies, whose idea is that peace depends on some marginal but perpetually elusive improvement in Israel's behavior."" Which is something to think about given the Arab population within Israel itself.

While the Israelis live next to Arabs and Christians within Israel, while Arabs and Christians serve in the Knesset, Gilder notes that ""the dispute over the settlements is an argument over whether Jews may reasonably expect to be permitted to live among Arabs anywhere."" Not now, it seems. It's accepted as a ""natural right"" of Palestinians ""to be squeamish about living anywhere near Jews.""

It brings us to the why (or the presumed why) behind the hatred. Religion doesn't seem to suffice, which means it's difficult to countenance the belief of some that ""The Jew carries the burden of God in history [and] for this has never been forgiven."" Gilder references the latter as a good summation of what Joseph Telushkin and Dennis Prager (Prager writes the foreword to The Israel Test) believe, but it didn't ring true and Gilder says as much. Such a view ascribes thought that's hard to find behind all the hatred.

More compelling is the explanation offered by Russian writer Maxim Gorky (and cited by Gilder) that anti-semites ""dislike the Jew only because he is obviously better, more adroit, and more capable of work than they are."" Gilder seems to agree with Gorky. He writes that ""The source of anti-Semitism is Jewish superiority and excellence."" Gilder and Gorky are difficult to argue with, but as Gilder himself notes, Israeli prosperity within Israel has been a magnet for Arabs. Which is important to stop and think about.

Bringing California back into the discussion, it's an undeniable fact that the Jews largely created a film industry that has lured millions west over the decades. More modernly, the technology industry that is heavily populated by Jews similarly exists as a major lure for non-Jews. Perhaps oddest of all, consider how Iranians and Jews live peacefully around each other in Beverly Hills at the same time that Iran the country is very public about its desire to destroy Israel.

It's all a long way of saying it reads as perhaps a little too simplistic to say as Israeli journalist (cited by Gilder) Caroline Glick does, that ""The enviers hate Israel."" There's got to be something more? The view here is that it's rooted in a lack of freedom. Where people are free to live and work as they wish, all the while broadly free of the excessive tax, regulatory, trade, and monetary barriers to production, they prosper alongside the Jews all the while recognizing how much they gain from getting to work alongside such remarkable talent. Again, Jewish prosperity is a magnet for much bigger populations that aren't Jewish.

It brings to mind a question once asked of an old boss: why was Hollywood giant Lew Wasserman so greatly revered? What was it about him? The reply was that Wasserman was ""Michael Jordan"" in the film industry. He made everyone better around him. The desire to be better resides within us all, but when government gets in the way with policy errors that limit the human ability to prosper, those most capable of outrunning government error are scapegoated.

Considering the above argument through the prism of the United States, no doubt there's anti-Semitism in the U.S. But arguably a major reason it's not nearly as evident in the U.S. has to do with all the immense economic opportunity that exists stateside. Contrast this with Germany and the Holocaust. It's seriously hard to imagine that Hitler ever attains power absent the gruesome devaluation of the mark in the aftermath of WWI that robbed so many of all that they'd worked for.

Where people are prospering, they don't have time nor the inclination for racist or murderous thoughts, nor do they seek scapegoats. As in, if the world were freer and by extension more unequal (in a free society genius is rewarded the most) and prosperous, the bet here is that anti-Semitism and its frequently murderous offshoots would be much less evident. This viewpoint shouldn't be construed as an attempt to excuse hideous, frequently gruesome behavior, but it is to say that prospering people are happier and less violent. Freedom is the fix for so much in the world, including anti-Semitism.

Conversely, opportunity suffocated unleashes anger and the desire for scapegoats. History is clear that Jews are routinely the scapegoated, and particularly because they've proven more capable of overcoming barriers to prosperity erected by governments. Gilder references Jewish fortitude with his discussion of what happened to the former Soviet Union under Gorbachev when ""the bulk of Soviet Jews"" were released. He describes what subsequently unfolded as the economic equivalent of ""a frontal lobotomy"" for the U.S.S.R. Yes, even where there was little to no freedom to prosper, Soviet Jews managed to prosper in a relative sense as Anya Gillinson anecdotally notes in her excellent new memoir, Dreaming In Russian.

It further speaks to the economic boom taking place in Israel now. The Soviet Union's loss was the world's gain; that, or parts of the world gained immeasurably from the unshackling of so much talent. Gilder writes that ""the most precious resource in the world economy is human genius,"" and a substantial portion of the Soviet Jews found their way to Israel once freed from the Soviet Union. Getting more specific, Gilder writes that ""immigrants from the Soviet Union constitute fully half of Israel's high-tech workers,"" and that VC outlays in Israel soared ""nearly sixty-fold from $58 million to $3.3 billion"" between 1991 and 2000 subsequent to their arrival. This looms large in consideration of the fact that ""Israel has become a center of innovation second in absolute achievement only to the United States."" Stop and think about it.

In thinking about what the Soviet Union (or Russia) lost in concert with Israel's gain, think back to the needless Cold War. Leaving aside the U.S.'s arms buildup, Ronald Reagan's much greater insight, one that Gilder doubtless helped Reagan arrive at, was that economically, culturally and personally unfree people would be no match for free people and the fruits of their freedom. No argument there, but stop and contemplate if Gorbachev (and those who came before him) had recognized the towering genius that was within the U.S.S.R./Russia all along. Russia quite simply had the people to be a global economic (and military) powerhouse if they'd just set the genius residing with Russia's borders free. It staggers the mind.

Lest we forget, Gilder believes deeply in a tee-shirt slogan spotted by his editor (Richard Vigilante) during an Israel visit, and which said ""Don't Worry America, Israel Is Behind You."" As he sees it, both the U.S. economy and its military would be substantially reduced without the existence of the same Israel that's been so profoundly lifted economically and militarily by Jews from the former Soviet Union. It's a long way of saying that when Vladimir Putin claims the collapse of the Soviet empire ""was the greatest geopolitical catastrophe of the century,"" he's engaging in non sequitur. More realistically, the Soviet Union's or Russia's failure of its own Israel Test was right up there among the biggest Russian tragedies.

As for greatest catastrophe of the century, geopolitical or economic, it would have to be World War II whereby so much of the world's genius was tragically exterminated. About this mass slaughter of Jews, Gilder is so very correct with his assertion that ""the rest of the world has suffered even more in absolute terms by the loss of the vast potential of the six million Jewish victims whose only sin was being Jewish on the European continent in the twentieth century."" About Gilder's oh-so-correct statement, one that he in no way wrote to minimize the suffering of Jews, let's please allow it to exist as yet another indictment of a profession (economics) that makes astrology appear serious by comparison, and whose PhDs assert near-monolithically that the upside of World War II was that it ended the Great Depression.

It would be difficult to find a sicker and more ferociously obtuse viewpoint than the one held by the vast majority of ""trained economists"" about WWII's (and war in general) allegedly positive growth implications. Nothing could be further from the truth, or more dangerous. As Gilder makes plain, ""no one can be rich alone."" Oh well, according to economists Gilder is incorrect. So deluded are they by the GDP ""gains ""achieved via killing, maiming, wealth destruction, and the rebuilding of wealth destroyed, that they've somehow come to the conclusion that the latter ended the Great Depression, after which American producers were allegedly rendered better off by a supine Europe suddenly bereft of its vital few. Worse is that economists have spread their tragic misunderstanding of prosperity to high-level thinkers like Yuval Levin and Edward Conard at American Enterprise Institute who claim that what makes the 1950s so attractive to nostalgic Americans is that so much of the rest of the was destroyed. Adam Smith is no doubt looking down mystified.

What happened in Europe alone doesn't just indict an economics profession that embarrasses itself in all sorts of ways all day and every day (those same economists also believe economic growth causes inflation), it also to some degree exposes American conservatism as less serious than its practitioners would like to believe. Think ""Eurosclerosis"" and the various pejoratives lobbed at Europe by conservatives in similar fashion to how they denigrate California. According to conservatives, the biggest driver of ""Eurosclerosis"" is excessive rates of taxation that deaden the incentive to work.

About the good of lowering taxes all and every way possible, no argument against will be made here. Taxes are a price, or a penalty placed on work and investment. At the same time, conservatives shrink themselves yet again when they ascribe Europe's relative lack of prosperity to ""tax rates."" What has Europe less prosperous was anti-Semitism that revealed itself in the most murderous of ways. Absent it, stop and think how rich Europe would be today, and by extension how much better off the world would be.

Quoting Gilder the same way but a second time, ""the most precious resources in the world economy is human genius."" It lifts us all, only for sickening envy (Gilder, Gorky, Glick) or a lack of freedom (Tamny, surely many others) to reveal itself occasionally in the form of anti-Semitism that shrinks the portion of the population most crucial to cultural, health, and economic progress.

What Gilder believes about the importance of the individually brilliant brought to mind quibbles on occasion. In particular, his chapter about Benjamin Netanyahu as the man that propelled Israel ""into the modern world of finance"" wasn't as compelling as the book's many other arguments. For one, capital always and everywhere finds genius as Gilder's own VC stats for Israel (a sixty-fold increase between 1991 and 2000) indicate. For two, the previous surge was per Gilder himself a function of the arrival of brilliant Soviet Jewry.

This isn't to say that Nethanyahu didn't bring better, more pro-growth policies to Israel. If Gilder says he did, than he did. At the same time, and as overtaxed and over-governed locales like California and New York remind us, talent trumps policy by many miles.

More on Netanyahu, the book plainly went to print before the tragedy of October 7, 2023. No expert on Israel (I've never even visited), isn't the primary job of the prime minister in Israel to protect the people from the many terrorists who mean it the worst of harm? If Netanyahu is so heroic, doesn't he deserve the slings and arrows of the present, and much, much more?

Which leads to another quibble with Gilder's analysis. He writes that anti-Zionists view Israel as a mistake because of ""discrimination against Arabs, sorely maldistributed wealth and income, a runaway engine of west bank settlements that represent an imperial 'occupation,'"" etc. Maybe that's the consensus view, but my problem with Israel is that as presently constituted, it places the most brilliant people on earth directly in harm's way.

The above had me wanting to ask Gilder while reading his spectacular book if Israel itself passes the Israel Test? By Gilder's own estimation, many of the best and brightest within Israel share the negative views of the country held by some of its most ardent critics. That being the case, how can it survive? This is important precisely given Gilder's own assertion that ""no nation is more important to the survival of the United States and the world than Israel."" If true, or even if not true, is Israel itself passing the Israel Test?

About this question, in the aftermath of 10/7 I found myself arguing with Jewish friends that Israel must cease wasting Israeli lives on these wars. What is gained? Gilder argues that ""conspicuous weakness is a prime cause of war,"" and that's long been the right's consensus, but what good did the latter do the U.S. in Iraq and Afghanistan, and seriously, what good has it done Israel? Its military superiority well established time after time (think 1948, 1967, 1973, and many times since), the killers keep coming.

Back to the argument made, I wanted Netanyahu to not respond, to let the hideous videos of heinous Hamas acts travel around the world in concert with intense quiet from Israel. I then wanted Netanyahu to announce that there would be no invasion of Gaza given an aversion to wasting even one more precious Israeli life on a war that never ends. That instead, Israel had hired the Wagner Group to man the country's borders. If the Arabs can't be asked to live among Jews, they would henceforth no longer be allowed to work with Jews inside Israel. In concert with the arrival of Wagner, a wall would be built with the money saved by not going to war yet again with people who value life much less than the Jews do.

None of what's been written is meant as yet another apology for Israel's alleged mis-behavior. Not at all. At the same time, it's a stab at what your reviewer imagines to be realism: the Arabs will never give up. Since they won't, it's time to put to bed the right's mantra about ""conspicuous weakness"" as the ""prime cause of war."" Let's replace it with government is always and everywhere incompetent, and governments are populated with too many people too eager to go to war. It's not working.

Beyond that, by Gilder's own admission Israel is heavily populated with Shaul Olmert-types who are remarkably brilliant, but who are uncomfortable with Israel vis-à-vis those who surround it and who mean it harm. The mention of Olmert once again isn't an expression of agreement with him, but it's a comment that he arguably represents a growing portion of the Israeli population eager to innovate over engage in endless war. Though militarily quite skillful, the Jews aren't a warring people, period. Worse, they're up against people with less to live for, and who are seemingly willing to wait them out.

Three quarters of the way through The Israel Test, Gilder cites a speech given by Nobel Prize winning Israeli game theorist, Robert Aumann. At a presentation of his that Gilder attended in Toronto, Aumann observed that, ""over history many peoples have been expelled from their homes. Only the Jews have been expelling themselves, their own people. From their own homes and synagogues, towns and farms. From Sinai, from Gaza, from the West Bank, from Jerusalem, only the Jews."" Aumann's observation is the counter to the assertion that the Israelis should just take their genius elsewhere, and far away from the Arabs. Aumann makes a hard-to-argue-with case that the Jews have been compromising for way too long, and it's beyond wrong to ask them to move again.

At the same time, and per Gilder, ""if the Arabas or Iranians desired peace, they would have long ago achieved it."" Absolutely. Which is telling. Peace isn't the goal, and it's something to keep well in mind in concert with Gilder's correct assertion that ""the survival of the Jews is vital to the triumph of free economies."" In that very real sense, it's difficult to conclude from this remarkable book anything other than that the United States and Israel are failing The Israel Test, and that their ongoing failure threatens the rest of the free world."

Ted Cruz, R-Texas, while he spoke about antisemitism on college campuses.

Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, was interrupted during a congressional hearing dedicated to discussing ""hate"" on Tuesday by an anti-Israel agitator who stood up shouting ""F---ing Jews.""

During the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing titled, ""A Threat to Justice Everywhere: Stemming the Tide of Hate Crimes in America,"" Cruz discussed soaring antisemitism on college campuses in the wake of Oct. 7.

""Antisemitism is a unique, historic form of evil, and over millennia, it is manifested in violence, mass murder and genocide,"" Cruz said. ""October 7th was one of the darkest days in human history when terrorists murdered over 1,200 Israelis and took 251 hostages. Women and girls were raped. It was the single largest mass murder of Jews in a day since the Holocaust. In the wake of October 7th, we have seen antisemitism explode across the United States and across the world, but especially on college campuses.""

After listing examples of antisemitic and pro-Hamas messages hurled toward Jewish students, Cruz called out the Biden-Harris administration.

COLUMBIA ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS TO REACH 'CRESCENDO OF INTIMIDATION' AS SCHOOL SUFFERS LATEST BLACK EYE

""Throughout all of this, the Biden-Harris administration has been utterly absent. Does anyone doubt if the Klan were on college campuses terrorizing African American students, threatening African American students, that we would see the FBI there, that we would see prosecutors there, that we would see federal funding cut off to universities? Of course we would. And we should,"" Cruz said. ""But when it comes to antisemitism, the Democrats have a problem. I would note this is occurring in blue states with blue governors, because the Democrat Party is terrified of the pro-Hamas wing of their party.""

""In states like Texas and Florida, we don't allow this. At the University of Texas, when violent protests threatened Jewish students, police officers arrived and arrested them. That's what happened when you enforce the law,"" Cruz continued. ""Every Republican member of this committee asked the chairman to hold a hearing on antisemitism in February. And yet we don't get a hearing on antisemitism. We get a hearing generically on hate.""

Cruz was about to explain why he believes the Biden administration is to blame for this, when a man in the audience stood up and interjected, shouting profanities including ""F---ing Jews,"" according to video on social media. The anti-Israel agitator was then escorted out.

""And this is the kind of anger and hate that is encouraged. You're now seeing the hate manifesting right here,"" Cruz said, referencing the protester.

""So we now have a demonstration of antisemitism. We have a demonstration of the hate,"" he added.

Cruz proceeded to ask one of the witnesses, Mark Goldfeder, director of the National Jewish Advocacy Center, ""Has the Biden administration cut off the funding of any of the colleges that have allowed this hate? Have they indicted anyone for funding these violent protests? Have they indicted the people paying for the matching tents, or have they sat there silently and have the universities, sat there silently while their students are terrified to go to class?""

Goldfeder responded, ""They have not indicted anyone.""

""Has any university had their funding cut off for allowing this sort of violent intimidation?"" Cruz asked.

""Not a single university,"" Goldfeder said.

The senator earlier referenced how the Anti-Defamation League has illustrated how the number of antisemitic incidents in the United States more than doubled from 2022 to 2023.

Cruz said that ""college campuses in particular have become vile incubators of hatred of Jews,"" citing examples of how one Cornell University student made threats after Oct. 7, including statements such as ""if I see a pig, male Jew, I will stab you and slit your throat. If I see another pig female Jew, I will drag you away and rape you and throw you off a cliff.""

The Republican senator displayed a flier circulated by a student organization at California State University, Long Beach, calling for a ""Day of Resistance"" celebrating Oct. 7, noting how the flier included an image of a person parachuting with a fan attached, ""a direct reference to and a glorification of Hamas terrorists that used gliders to descend upon a music festival and murder 260 innocent people and take many more hostages.""

Cruz recalled that in the days after now-former Columbia University President Minouche Shafik was confronted about soaring antisemitism on campus before the House Education and the Workforce Committee in April, Rabbi Elie Buechler issued a warning to Jewish students that Columbia ""cannot guarantee Jewish students' safety in the face of extreme antisemitism and anarchy,"" and that he ""would strongly recommend"" that Jewish students leave campus and go back to their homes.

Cruz said the rabbi ""had every reason to be concerned,"" as at Columbia's campus, individuals yelled, ""We're all Hamas! Long live Hamas!""

The senator continued to list examples of antisemitism on campuses across the U.S., including the granddaughter of a Holocaust survivor who was told to ""go back to the gas chambers,"" and displayed a photo of a student at Columbia University holding a sign reading ""al-Qassam's next targets,"" in front of a group of students holding American and Israeli flags in counter-protest.

""Al-Qassam is the military arm of Hamas. According to social media, this particular student is a wealthy student from Georgia. She's not Palestinian, but she has been taught lies and hatred, and she feels perfectly comfortable advocating the murder of her fellow students at Columbia,"" Cruz said."

Hundreds of pagers that exploded in Lebanon and Syria in an apparent operation targeting members of Hezbollah bore the brand of a Taiwanese company, though the firm's chair told reporters Wednesday that another company in Budapest manufactured the devices.

Near-simultaneous detonations of pagers used by members of the Iran-backed Hezbollah terror group killed at least 12 people, including two children, and wounded nearly 3,000 on Tuesday.

Taiwanese pager firm Gold Apollo said in a statement that the firm had licensed its AR-924 brand of pager to BAC Consulting KFT, based in Hungary's capital, and was not involved in the production.

""According to the cooperation agreement, we authorize BAC to use our brand trademark for product sales in designated regions, but the design and manufacturing of the products are solely the responsibility of BAC,"" the statement read.

Gold Apollo chair Hsu Ching-kuang told reporters Wednesday that his company has had a licensing agreement with BAC for the past three years, though he provided no evidence of the contract.

The pagers started heating up and exploding around 3:30 p.m. Tuesday. The blasts were concentrated in areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence, particularly a southern Beirut suburb and in the Beqaa region of eastern Lebanon and in Damascus, Lebanese security officials and a Hezbollah official told the Associated Press.

Lebanon Health Minister Firas Abiad told reporters Wednesday morning that many of the wounded had severe injuries to the eyes, and others had limbs amputated.

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

Hezbollah and the Lebanese government blamed Israel for what appeared to be a sophisticated remote attack. The Israeli government has not commented.

Experts believe a sophisticated supply chain infiltration occurred, during which explosive material was secreted into the pagers prior to their delivery and use.

While it appeared that members of Hezbollah possessed many of the pagers that exploded, it was not immediately clear if non-Hezbollah members also carried any of the pagers.

Hezbollah, which has pointed the blame at Israel, said in a statement Wednesday morning that it would continue its normal strikes against Israel ""as in all the past days"" as part of what it describes as a support front for its ally Hamas, and Palestinians in Gaza.

'An absolute disgrace': Senate Republicans condemn Palestinian Authority's UN bid to undermine Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/an-absolute-disgrace-senate-republicans-condemn-palestinian-authoritys-un-bid-undermine-israel,2024-09-17T21:20:28Z,"FIRST ON FOX: Senate Republicans condemned a forthcoming United Nations General Assembly vote that, if successful, would label the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) posture in Gaza and the West Bank as an ""unlawful presence"" and demand that the country leave the territories within six months.

""This proposal introduced by the Palestinian delegation, ahead of the United Nations' General Assembly, is an absolute disgrace that rewards terrorism.

A UN General Assembly vote is expected on the resolution on Wednesday, according to reports.

Since then, Israeli and Hamas forces have continued to fire on one another, and the former has launched several targeted strikes against targets as well as hostage recovery missions. Attempts by the U.S. and neighboring Middle Eastern countries to facilitate a ceasefire agreement have yet to result in an end to the war.

""Instead of proposing biased and counter-productive initiatives, which will do nothing to advance a lasting peace between Israelis and Palestinians, the international community must focus its energy and resources on ensuring Hamas and other terrorist groups are completely destroyed,"" the GOP statement continued. ""We must remain firm to ensure every single hostage held by these terrorists is safely returned to their loved ones.""

Fetterman reams NY Times for platforming terrorist propaganda after interview with senior Hamas official,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/fetterman-reams-ny-times-platforming-terrorist-propaganda-after-interview-senior-hamas-official,2024-09-17T20:12:28Z,"Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., discusses the recent strike in Rafah on MSNBC.

Sen. John Fetterman, D-Penn., accused the New York Times of spreading Hamas propaganda after the paper quoted Khaled Meshal, one of the terror group's most senior officials, in a new report Tuesday.

The Times story, headlined ""Hamas is surviving war in Israel. Now it hopes to thrive in Gaza again,"" centers around an interview with Meshal, who insisted Hamas ""is winning the war and will play a decisive role in Gaza's future"" despite Israel's commitment to eradicate the terror group responsible for killing 1,200 people on October 7.

The Times interviewed Meshal for two-hours in his living room in Doha, Qatar, where he ""offered rare insights into the thinking of Hamas officials,"" the report reads.

REP. RITCHIE TORRES CALLS OUT NY TIMES 'BIAS' FOR NOT INTERVIEWING HIM FOR STORY ABOUT HIS ANTI-ISRAEL CRITICS

""In the interview, Mr. Meshal made clear that Hamas officials are not in a rush to conclude a cease-fire with Israel at any price, and will not give up on their main demands for an end to the war and an Israeli withdrawal,"" the Times wrote.

Fetterman posted a screenshot of the story's headline on X, rebuking the outlet for giving one of Hamas' most senior leaders a platform to promote the group's message.

""No idea why NYT would platform this propaganda from a terrorist. Undoubtedly, Israel will hold him accountable,"" the lawmaker wrote. ""Hamas is no different than WWII Nazis and I fully support Israel's commitment to neutralize them.""

The Times report notes that the U.S. accused Meshal and other Hamas leaders of playing ""a central role in planning and carrying out the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel."" Hamas has been designated a terrorist organization by the United States and Israel.

Still, the paper features quotes from Meshal insisting that the terror group ""has the upper hand,"" and ""has remained steadfast"" while bringing the Israeli military into 'a state of attrition.""

""Hamas's reasoning is simple -- winning simply means surviving and, at least for now, the group has managed to do that, even if it is severely weakened,"" the Times writes.

NETANYAHU TRASHES NY TIMES REPORTING CITING ANONYMOUS OFFICIALS WHO SAY ISRAELI MILITARY WANTS CEASE-FIRE IN GAZA

Meshal told the paper that President Biden's seemingly changed position - from initially supporting Hamas eradication to demanding a cease fire in the region, sends a message that the U.S. is ""practically recognizing"" the terror group.

""Despite Hamas's immense losses, including many senior commanders killed by Israel, Mr. Meshal said he was confident that the group would play a dominant role in Gaza following the war. He dismissed alternative American and Israeli proposals for administering the territory without Hamas,"" the Times report reads.

""All their illusions about filling the vacuum are behind us,"" Mashal said.

The Times report states that many in Gaza are upset at Hamas for the October 7 massacre, which launched a full-scale war in the region. But Meshal ""dismissed criticism of Hamas's decision. Palestinian critics of Hamas represented a minority, he said,"" according to the Times report.

""He acknowledged that the assault had caused enormous destruction but said it was a 'price' Palestinians must pay for freedom.""

Fighting between Hezbollah and Israel has been escalating for months as Israel continues its war against Hezbollah's ally, Hamas. On Oct. 8, 2023 -- the day after Hamas attacked Israel -- Hezbollah attacked Israel to show it was ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people. On Monday, the United States warned Israel against escalating its war with Hezbollah as concern continues that a war in the Middle East could expand beyond Gaza. The warning came as Israel's security cabinet voted to update its goals of its war with Hamas to include the safe return of Israelis who have been displaced from their homes on the northern border with Lebanon. Despite warnings from the U.S., Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said in a statement that ""while Israel appreciates and respects the support of the US, it will - ultimately - do what is necessary to safeguard its security and return the residents of the north securely to their homes.""

Some Israelis are leaving the country due to the war in Gaza,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/17/g-s1-22080/israel-emigration-gaza-war,2024-09-17T14:27:18Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel -- The Green household was taken over by piles of clothing, books, and kid's toys this summer, as 40-year old Inbal Green and her husband Shlomy Green, 37, packed up their lives. Along with their dog, cat and four-year-old daughter Riley, the Israeli couple were leaving suburban life outside Tel Aviv and moving to Thailand. Since the war in Gaza began last October, they'd felt too unsafe to stay.

Shlomy opened a kitchen cabinet filled to the brim with stacks of canned goods, cereal and teabags.

""Now we have to sort through the entire house and decide only what we want to take with us,"" he said. ""That's why the house is in complete shambles.""

The Greens, born and raised in Israel, are among a growing number of Jewish Israelis looking for jobs abroad and leaving since last Oct. 7. Israeli media reported figures from Israel's Central Bureau of Statistics showing a spike in the number of Israelis -- more than 12,000 -- who left the country last October and had not returned by June.

The war in Gaza, which has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to health officials there, was triggered when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, killing some 1,200 people and taking 250 others hostage.

The vast majority of Jewish Israelis support the defeat of Hamas as essential to the country's future security. But the toll of this war -- for both Israelis and Palestinians -- is also driving some Jewish Israelis to choose to leave the country. Some, like the Greens, say they're leaving for good.

The Greens said that with their country's shaky political and security situation, they've previously toyed with the idea of leaving. But after last October's Hamas-led attack, they just didn't feel safe in Israel, Shlomy said. They believed the Israeli government wasn't doing -- or going to do -- enough to protect them from future attacks.

""The thing is we want to feel safe and secure in our home,"" he said. ""And we're not willing to compromise on that.""

The Greens said that in the early morning of Oct. 7, they were awoken by air raid sirens warning residents of incoming rockets from Hamas or Hezbollah. Most homes in Israel have a safe room that people will shelter in when these sirens go off.

All three ran into their safe room, and that's when they started getting text messages from family and friends telling them the news of the Hamas-led attacks in the south.

Inbal said they grew concerned that the attacks might spread further into Israel. Tel Aviv is only about 40 miles from the Gaza Strip. So they packed up some essentials and made their way to the airport, getting on one of the last flights to Cyprus by noon that day

""We felt like we were fleeing,"" Shlomy said. ""We were basically just thankful that we left in time.""

The Greens spent two months abroad but had to make their way back to Israel for practical reasons -- their Israeli health insurance stopped paying their medical bills because they were abroad, Shlomy broke his leg and his employer wanted him back in Israel.

But by then, Inbal said, leaving Israel for good had become their shared goal. Shlomy, a software developer, applied for jobs all over the world and landed one in Thailand. He said they did their research and felt they would be able to lead a comfortable life there.

""There are very low or nonexistent antisemitism rates there right now,"" he explained. ""Almost no pro-Palestinian protests, life is calm there, which is what we were looking for.""

Shlomy said he used to believe that peace was possible with Palestinians, but after the Hamas attack, he's unsure.

Labor and corporate immigration lawyer Liam Schwartz works at one of Israel's largest law firms. From a meeting room at his firm, there's a magnificent view of Tel Aviv, the sea on one side, skyscrapers on the other.

Schwartz helps Israeli businesses relocate their employees to parent companies in the U.S., and works with families who want to move there. He normally sees hundreds of cases a year, but says his workload has increased by at least 40% in the past few months. What makes this year unique is Oct. 7, he said.

""I've never been this busy ever in my career,"" Shwartz said. ""This is way beyond expectations.""

Schwartz said that Israeli companies are worried about a possible all-out war in northern Israel with Hezbollah. The two sides have been trading fire across the Israel-Lebanon border since the conflict in Gaza started. Because of this, companies, especially those in high tech, are relocating entire teams to the United States.

He's also seeing Israeli employees pressure their companies to sponsor them for work visas to the U.S. Many of these employees just don't feel safe or comfortable in Israel anymore, he said.

""Companies are interested in not losing talent, so many of them are just saying yes,"" Schwartz said.

Schwartz acknowledged that these are privileged Israelis. Many others don't have the luxury of applying for work visas or even a regular visa, because they are unskilled or don't have the means. ""For the woman who sweeps the floor where I work, there's basically nothing there,"" he said, because she is unskilled and her employer would most probably not sponsor her.

Some Israelis say they want to leave because they are disillusioned with how their government is handling the war in Gaza. The families of the hostages kidnapped from Israel on Oct. 7 have been protesting, along with thousands of other Israelis, to pressure Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to accept the peace deal presented by President Biden in May.

At a weekly anti-government protest in May in Tel Aviv, Hadar Behrendt held up a sign saying ""Nine Months Already,"" referring to the length of the war in Gaza at the time and how hostages are still there.

She said she doesn't want to be ashamed of what Israel has become. She'd rather go elsewhere.

""It's like being foreign in my own country,"" said Behrendt. ""We are kidnapped by this government.""

Behrendt, who said her family escaped Germany in 1936, said she will be using her German passport to move to Greece with her husband.

""It's very hard for us,"" she said. ""All our family is here, but I can't be part of this.""

Inbal Green, packing for her own family's departure, said she grew up in a Zionist family, believing that she had a duty to protect and serve Israel. She was a reservist for 14 years, volunteered with the Israeli police and the Israeli national medical emergency organization.

""And then here comes October 7th, and after all that, I still have to pack my things,"" she said.

Her grandmother survived the Holocaust and settled in Israel, she said. But she doesn't want what she calls the instability and chaos of today's Israel to be her daughter's responsibility.

""The country suffers from PTSD. I don't want her to carry that on her tiny shoulders,"" Inbal said.

She admitted that she is also tired of carrying what she says is the burden of feeling insecure and uncertain about the future in her own country.

""I don't want to carry that anymore,"" she said. ""I think it's OK to say ... I want to breathe.""

Inbal insisted she was sure she didn't want to come back to live in Israel ever again. Only one thing would bring her back -- if her daughter chooses to serve in the Israeli military.

""I still think it is important,"" Inbal said about the compulsory Israeli military service. ""It is a character builder."""

They also react to campus protests.

The United States' Ambassador to the United Nations is expressing frustration with the Israeli military following strikes that killed multiple UN-aligned personnel in the region.

Amb. Linda Thomas-Greenfield spoke out at the U.N. Security Council meeting on Monday, where she lamented the ""preventable"" loss of life caused by the conflict.

""We will continue to raise the need for Israel to facilitate humanitarian operations, and protect humanitarian workers and facilities, such as the UNRWA school targeted by the IDF last week in Nusseirat,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER TELLS US ONLY 'MILITARY ACTION' CAN RETURN PEOPLE TO HOMES AMID HEZBOLLAH THREAT

UNRWA refers to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East.

She continued, ""We have also been unequivocal in communicating to Israel that there is no basis - absolutely none - for its forces to be opening fire on clearly marked UN vehicles, as recently occurred on numerous occasions.""

A former school converted into a UNRWA civilian shelter was struck last week by the Israeli Defense Forces, killing 18 people. Six of those killed were UNRWA personnel.

The Israeli Ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, previously rebuked criticism of the strike on the UNRWA shelter, asserting that the entire agency has become overrun with terrorists and terrorist sympathizers -- including personnel at the destroyed shelter.

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY HAMAS TERRORISTS IN GAZA

""How long will the U.N. continue to bury its head in the sand and ignore the fact that Hamas terrorists have taken over UNRWA?"" Danon asked this week. ""Those who were killed yesterday (Wednesday) in the IDF strike were nine terrorists with blood on their hands, and some of them participated in the barbaric massacre on October 7.""

Danon provided a list of names ostensibly connecting known Hamas terrorists to the civilian shelter.

When approached by Fox News Digital, Juliette Touma, a UNRWA spokesperson, claimed that ""Israeli authorities have not requested UNRWA officially to provide them with the list of staff killed in yesterday's attack on the UNRWA school."" She added, ""The names that appear on today's statement from the Israeli Army have not been flagged to us before by the Israeli authorities in previous occasions prior to today.""

The U.S. ambassador did note on Monday the ongoing threat of Hamas embedding its members within civilian agencies.

""At the same time, we continue to see Hamas hiding in, and taking over, and otherwise using civilian sites to conduct operations and pose an ongoing threat,"" said Thomas-Greenfield. ""There's no clearer evidence of Hamas' total indifference to Palestinian civilians in Gaza. For their sake, and the sake of innocent people on all sides of this conflict - this must stop.""

Nine individuals were fired by UNRWA last month after it was found they likely participated in the Hamas slaughter of 1,200 people, including more than 30 Americans, on Oct. 7 in southern Israel.

""For nine people, the evidence was sufficient to conclude that they may have been involved in the 7th of October attacks,"" Farhan Haq, spokesperson for the U.N. secretary general said during a press briefing.

Danon's remarks came after last week's Israeli air strike that hit the UNRWA al-Jaouni school in a Gaza refugee camp. Danon questioned, ""How long will the U.N. continue to bury its head in the sand and ignore the fact that Hamas terrorists have taken over UNRWA? Those who were killed yesterday (Wednesday) in the IDF strike were nine terrorists with blood on their hands, and some of them participated in the barbaric massacre on October 7. In case there are still any doubts, there are the names of the Hamas terrorists who were at the school compound disguised as 'local UNRWA employees.""

The school, which was not operational, was being used as a Hamas command and control center, according to the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF).

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER: 'DOZENS' OF UNRWA STAFF TOOK PART IN HAMAS' OCT 7 MASSACRE

Danon listed the names of the Hamas terrorists who were affiliated with UNRWA on his X post, while noting ""UNRWA-Gaza is a terrorist organization whose members participated in the October 7 massacre, and whose members abducted and murdered innocent Israeli civilians. It is time to shut down UNRWA.""

Just last month, Fox News Digital reported that UNRWA was forced to fire nine employees because of their likely involvement in Hamas's slaughter of nearly 1,200 people on Oct. 7 in southern Israel.

When approached by Fox News Digital, Juliette Touma, a UNRWA spokesperson, claimed ""The Israeli authorities have not requested UNRWA officially to provide them with the list of staff killed in yesterday's attack on the UNRWA school."" She added, ""The names that appear on today's statement from the Israeli Army have not been flagged to us before by the Israeli authorities in previous occasions prior to today.""

She complained, ""We always find out about these very serious allegations in the media. After the event."" Schools in Gaza have not been in session since shortly after Israel waged war on Hamas in reaction to the Oct. 7 massacre in southern Israel.

DOSSIER REVEALS INFORMATION USED TO EXPLAIN UN AGENCY'S DEEP TIES TO HAMAS IN GAZA

Fox News Digital asked the Israel Defense Forces about Touma's statement. An IDF spokesman said ""From what I understood, it's pretty clear in Gaza who belongs to who. I don't think this is a surprise at all to anyone in UNRWA, just an attempt to shift the discussion and blame."" The IDF spokesman stressed that the UNRWA spokeswoman's comment ""Sounds like a diversion from talking about the important issue - terrorists working for the organization and using UNRWA as a cover.""

Hillel Neuer, executive director of U.N. Watch, told Fox News Digital. ""This was a precision strike targeting terrorists who embedded a command and control center within a compound that had previously served as a school. The U.N. should be condemning Hamas for using civilian buildings for military purposes, which is a war crime under the Geneva Conventions. Instead, they rushed to condemn Israel.""

Neuer, who has testified to Congress about the controversial agency, claimed, ""UNRWA is deeply complicit with the Hamas terrorist organization. Their staff routinely celebrate terrorist attacks against Israelis and Jews, as we have identified in numerous of our reports, listing some 200 names. Next, we identified heads of UNRWA teachers unions, who are senior officials within Hamas. Suhail al-Hindi, who for many years headed the UNRWA teachers union in Gaza, is sitting on the Hamas political bureau with Yahya Sinwar. Likewise, the head of the UNRWA teachers' union in Lebanon, Fathi al-Sharif, is a senior Hamas terrorist, documented on our website, unwatch.org.""

He called on foreign governments to stop funding UNRWA. ""It is high time for all western states who are giving more than a billion dollars to UNRWA to stop funding a terror-infested agency. The Swiss parliament rightly called to stop funding it, and to end UNRWA altogether. We urge all other democracies, the U.S., UK, France, Germany, and Japan, to do the same.""

UNRWA's Touma decried the Swiss decision. ""Switzerland's lower parliament votes to suspend funding to UNRWA. It is beyond comprehension that this happens in circumstances where the Agency is at the forefront of lifesaving humanitarian work in Gaza. Switzerland has been known for championing humanitarian aid and playing a leading role in promoting international humanitarian law.""

Touma added, ""Parliamentarians voting to phase out a U.N. General Assembly mandated Agency without offering a political alternative to Palestinians under occupation are again on the wrong side of history.""

The U.S. suspended funding to UNRWA because of the role some of its employees played in the Oct. 7 massacre.

Disabled veteran arrested at Rutgers after posting anti-Hamas flyers: 'Not going to let anyone censor me',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/disabled-veteran-arrested-rutgers-posting-anti-hamas-flyers-not-going-let-anyone-censor-me,2024-09-16T09:08:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A Rutgers Law School student who mounted a counter-protest against anti-Israel demonstrators on campus was arrested by police after he refused to stop posting flyers that labeled Hamas as ""savages.""

Yiorgos ""George"" Maravelias, a disabled veteran who previously served as a United States Army First Lieutenant and deployed to Afghanistan, first engaged in campus activism in November 2023. He told Fox News Digital that after October 7, a vocal minority of law school students erected tables and hung flyers that criticized Israel's actions in Gaza.

""I set up a table right next to them with my beliefs, which is that Hamas are rapists, that they are monsters, savages. That October 7 was a terrorist attack. You know, basically, I believe that a lot of the statements that they apply towards Israel, I think they fully hold against America,"" he said.

Maravelias said he then began hanging his flyers on walls and spaces that were riddled with anti-Israel and pro-Palestinian content. Soon after, a woman began ripping down his posters.

RUTGERS STUDENTS WHO STOOD UP TO ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTS WITH USA CHANT SPEAK OUT: 'FED UP WITH ANTI-AMERICANISM'

""I addressed this person. I said, what are you doing? Like, why are you ripping down my flyers? And she told me that it was against the policy to put flyers where I had my flyers, which were right next to where these -- there were these bulletin boards that the whole entire bulletin board was one speech and one viewpoint,"" he told Fox News Digital.

The woman, who was later identified as distinguished professor of law and Chancellor's Social Justice Scholar Sahar Aziz, escorted Maravelias up to Dean Cate Lysionek's office with his crumpled papers in hand. Maravelias claimed that Aziz was informed that no such policy prevented him from engaging in political speech.

Speaking in her individual capacity and not as a representative of Rutgers, Aziz refuted Maravelias' claim that she was informed no policy against his actions existed. She told Fox News Digital that at the time the flyers were posted, the law school had a signage policy prohibiting students from posting flyers on the bare walls of the law school atrium. Flyers could only be posted on the bulletin boards.

Aziz stated that Maravelias violated this policy when he posted numerous signs on the walls and claimed that no other flyers were taped on the atrium walls at the time.

Maravelias said Lysionek told him to report the incident to Dean Johanna Bond as there were consistent reports of Aziz interfering with the free speech of students opposed to the pro-Palestinian activists.

Aziz said she has not interfered with the free speech of students on campus, regardless of their viewpoints, and suggested there is no evidence of Maravelias' ""false claim.""

RUTGERS UNIVERSITY PROFESSOR SAYS WITHOUT DEI OFFICES, THERE IS 'NO ABILITY TO MAKE MEANINGFUL PROGRESS'

She noted that other faculty have hosted at least two pro-Israeli events featuring the Zionist Organization of America and Stand With Us. To her knowledge, the events occurred without interference.

""In stark contrast, there are external self-described Zionist organizations who have sought to censor Palestine-related programming hosted by the Center for Security, Race and Rights - which is an academic center focused on the civil rights of Muslims, Arabs, and South Asians. Fortunately, Rutgers University has an academic freedom policy that applies to all faculty regardless of viewpoint or identity,"" she added.

Maravelias said he brought the incident to the attention of Dean Johanna Bond and Dean Sarah K. Regina.

Bond allegedly declined to repudiate Aziz's actions and refused to meet with Maravelias to discuss the matter.

He also emailed Rutgers President Jonathan Holloway, alleging the school had violated his First Amendment rights.

""In the Army it's an open-door policy. You send it up the chain of command. I heard nothing,"" Maravelias said.

Dean Bond, Dean Regina, Lysionek, and President Holloway did not reply to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

He would again engage in a counter-protest in May when protesters set up an encampment on Rutgers' Newark grounds. Protesters hung signs with phrases like ""From the river to the sea"" and ""Globalize the Intifada."" They also created a list of demands -- one of which stipulated that no military recruiters could be allowed on Rutgers campuses.

JEWISH STUDENTS AT RUTGERS SPEAK OUT IN WAKE OF LATEST ANTI-ISRAEL INCIDENT ON CAMPUS: 'HORRIFYING EXPERIENCE'

""I found that to be grotesque, disgusting, offensive. So, I decided to go down to Rutgers and participate with, once again, the speech that I had in the fall. Same, same exact point of view. Nothing that I would deem to be offensive. Nothing against Palestinian people, nothing racist, Islamophobic or bigoted otherwise,"" he said.

That night, several individuals ripped down his flyers. Campus security instructed him to file a complaint with the police.

""I go to the police. They say, 'Oh, we can't do anything about this.' So, I'm like, where's the accountability? Like, why is my speech being ripped down?"" he told Fox News Digital.

The following day, Maravelias visited Dean Regina's office and asked what the rules were for posting around the school and how he could get accountability if anyone obstructed his speech. Leadership, according to Maravelias, had no answer.

""I said, 'I'm going to go participate in my speech. I'm letting you know right now that if anybody touches my flyers, it's tit for tat. They rip down mine; I'm gonna rip down theirs. I'm not gonna let anybody censor me while I'm participating in free speech,'"" Maravelias recalled.

He then went outside and taped up flyers that criticized Hamas and tied small Israeli and American flags together. Maravelias said he was verbally excoriated by the pro-Palestinian crowd calling him a ""baby killer, genocidal maniac, Zionist"" and more. While he left the encampment's messages in place, activists tore them down as soon as he posted his flyers.

A large group of Rutgers University police officers then surrounded Maravelias. They allegedly asked to speak with him privately.

""I'm like, I'm going to post my flyers where their flyers are posted. If you want to talk to me, I'll talk right here. They kept on trying to, you know, reason with me or try to stop me from posting my flyers,"" he said.

One police officer instructed another to rip down his flyers that said, ""Stand with Israel"" and ""Stand with America."" Maravelias said he was told his speech was ""inflammatory.""

""I go, what happens if I continue to post my speech? Am I going to be arrested? Because if you're ripping down my flyers and I keep posting flyers like, where does this go? What's going to happen? He's like, yes, you'll be arrested,"" Maravelias said.

When he refused to stop posting flyers in the same area where the protest encampment had placed hundreds of signs, the police asked Maravelias to put his hands behind his back.

The Rutgers Police Department then arrested Maravelias, detained him at their station, fingerprinted and photographed him. He was in custody for several hours before being released.

Rutgers University Police Department did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Maravelias had charges filed against him for a petty disorderly persons offense.

The summons issued to Maravelias said, ""Within the jurisdiction of this court, purposely cause or recklessly create the risk of public inconvenience, annoyance or alarm by, specifically by creating a hazardous or physically dangerous condition by an act which serves no legitimate purpose of himself.""

He graduated from Rutgers Law School soon after.

Maravelias said he does not believe there is anything wrong with Rutgers as an institution. Still, he said there needs to be an evaluation to see if people in leadership positions at the school are living up to university standards.

""I think we need to have a real leadership reckoning with the Rutgers institution, especially the law school,"" he said.

Charges against Maravelias were dismissed in July 2024 at the first substantive court date. Rutgers also filed student conduct administrative charges against him and refused to expunge them, according to his lawyer, Christopher J. D'Alessandro.

D'Alessandro was in the Army in the early 1990s. He went to college on a GI Bill and started working for the New Jersey State Parole Board in 1997. He re-enlisted in the New Jersey Army National Guard in 2005 and deployed to Afghanistan and Iraq, citing the impact of the 9/11 attacks. D'Alessandro continues to serve as a logistics officer and retired from parole in 2015.

He later attended Rutgers Law School and did a fellowship at Rutgers Law Associates. D'Alessandro is also the former VP of Veteran Alumni at Rutgers University.

""This is an issue not just for [Maravelias], but for any veteran that would go to Rutgers, and I've encouraged many veterans to go to Rutgers Law School. In fact, I try to talk every veteran into going to Rutgers Law School,"" D'Alessandro told Fox News Digital.

""So, this is a problem that needs to be fixed because I want to be proud of the school I went to and I want to be able to tell a veteran in good conscience, this is a law school that you want to go to because they'll teach you how to obtain justice,"" he continued.

D'Alessandro said that the manner in which Rutgers addressed the Newark anti-Israel encampment was wildly divergent from the way they treated his client.

Citing a Rutgers statement, D'Alessandro, in his personal opinion, said that the school negotiated with the ""pro-Hamas encampment,"" many of whom were non-students, and instead of applying laws, rules, and regulations, allowed the encampment residents to act with impunity.

Maravelias revealed that Newark Mayor Ras Baraka issued 10 housing stipends to encampment protesters because they were homeless.

He also noted that Rutgers had expressed no interest in settling the matter.

Baraka's office did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Maravelias said he received a letter directly from the school stating that while the conduct charges would not be pursued (as he had since graduated), should he ever re-enroll at Rutgers, the charges would be reinstated.

RUTGERS STUDENTS COUNTER ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS ON CAMPUS BY WAVING AMERICAN FLAG, CHANTING 'USA! USA!'

D'Alessandro said that to obtain the Body Worn Camera footage of Maravelias' arrest, Rutgers is requiring them to pay an $804 fee. In addition, they claim Rutgers has refused to produce CCTV surveillance footage of the event, claiming it would jeopardize campus security.

""I did not take the bar exam because I have been too distracted by fighting the criminal charges to study effectively. The actions of Rutgers taken against me also affect my being barred, as I have to pass Character and Fitness, disclosing all that has transpired to the Bar,"" Maravelias said.

D'Alessandro said Maravelias' situation reminds him of an old police adage he recalled from his time in law enforcement: ""You might beat the rap, you won't beat the ride.""

While Maravelias had his charges dismissed, D'Alessandro said he was still arrested, publicly humiliated, made to feel like a criminal, taken down to the station, stuck in a cell, fingerprinted, and photographed. That booking will go into the system that anybody who looks up his client will be able to see.

Maravelias had no legal fees for the Defense. He was represented pro bono by a defense attorney.

D'Alessandro said the case is disappointing because, as a veteran who often represents other veterans in employment cases, they are a group who routinely have their rights violated.

""I learned how to be a lawyer at Rutgers. They taught me to do what I'm doing now. That's a school where I learned to seek justice for my clients. So, it's extremely disappointing that I have to go up against the place I graduated from because they denied a law student First Amendment rights. You can't even make that up,"" he said.

Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A long-range missile fired from Yemen early Sunday landed in central Israel, according to the Israeli military.

The attack prompted air raid sirens in the region and local media aired photos of what appeared to be a fragment from a missile or interceptor that landed on a train station in the central town of Modiin.

There were no reports of casualties or damage from the missile but authorities observed a fire in the rural area.

In addition to the attack from Yemen, the Israeli military said around 40 projectiles were fired from Lebanon early Sunday. Some were intercepted while the rest fell in open areas, the military said.

Nobody immediately claimed responsibility for Sunday's missile strike from Yemen.

Local media reported sounds of explosions resulting from the missile but Israel's military said later the sound came from the interceptors.

Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have repeatedly fired drones and missiles toward Israel since the start of Israel's war with Hamas in Gaza, which started after the terror group launched an attack on the Jewish State on Oct. 7.

Nearly all the attacks have been intercepted over the Red Sea.

No injuries were reported from the projectiles. Israel Fire and Rescue Services are working to extinguish fires that were caused by fallen projectiles in open areas.

PARENTS OF 22-YEAR-OLD AMERICAN HELD BY HAMAS SPEAK OUT: 'THEY'RE HOLDING OUR CHILDREN'

Since the Israel-Hamas war began nearly a year ago, Iran and rits financed terror groups have attacked Israeli and U.S. targets, which has led to retaliatory strikes from Israel and its Western allies.

Iran supports terror groups across the region -- Hamas, the Houthis and Lebanon's Hezbollah -- which have exchanged fire with Israel nearly every day since the war in Gaza began more than 11 months ago. Iran and its allies have said their actions come as a show of solidarity for the Palestinians.

In July, an Iranian-made drone launched by the Houthis struck Tel Aviv, killing one person and wounding 10 others. In response to that attack, Israel launched a wave of airstrikes on Houthi-held areas of Yemen.

The Houthis have also repeatedly attacked commercial shipping in the Red Sea in what they claim to be a blockade on Israel in support of the Palestinians. However, most of the ships that have been targeted have no connection to Israel."

Omer Neutra, a 22-year-old American, has been held hostage by Hamas for more than 330 days.

His parents, Orna and Ronen Neutra, residents of Long Island, told Fox News Digital their son is a friend to everyone.

""He sees people. He pays attention. He has this great sense of humor. So, he touches so many,"" said Orna Neutra.

Ronen Neutra said his son loves the New York Knicks.

""He knows all their stats, whether they win or lose. We hope that those numbers and the stats in his head are keeping him busy,"" he added. ""Because we are 11 months in, and that's far too long.""

The parents wear a piece of duct tape on their shirts, changing it each day, to mark how long their son has been in captivity.

Omer Neutra turns 23 next month.

SURVIVOR OF HAMAS TERROR ATTACK ON ISRAEL RECOUNTS PAIN, GRIEF OF LOSING 'ANGEL' BOYFRIEND ON OCT. 7

He and others have remained in captivity since Oct. 7, 2023, including Israeli American Hersh Goldberg-Polin.

Goldberg-Polin's family confirmed Hersh's death Sunday after he was murdered by Hamas. The Neutra family expressed devastation about the loss.

""They are practically our family now. And knowing that Hersh managed to survive 11 months in the most terrible conditions, including his injury and everything else. And to be executed the way he was with [the] other five hostages is just appalling and shows us who we're dealing with. Hamas is a bunch of monsters,"" Ronen said.

Goldberg-Polin's body was among the remains of six hostages recovered by the Israel Defense Forces.

""This intensifies the sense of urgency to get them out, actually. It's been way too long. Their lives are at risk every single day. ... It's a terror organization. We realize that, and that only makes it even more urgent to get them out because we see that, as time goes by, the risk only increases,"" Orna said.

At least seven American citizen hostages are believed to be in Gaza.

""Unfortunately, making a deal with a terrorist organization like Hamas, it's that impossible. It's not like we're negotiating with them. It's what they want. They're holding our children. You can't negotiate with them. You know, it's almost like losing in advance because they're holding our precious ones so that, you know, they are putting the rules of the game,"" Ronen said.

Orna and Ronen are dual American Israeli citizens with Holocaust survivors on both sides of the family.

Ronen's grandfather was in Yugoslavia and joined the Jewish Partisans after he was let go from a factory to save his family and fight the Nazis.

After the war, he moved to Israel and was one of the few who survived.

Orna's grandfather saved his family multiple times from the Nazis and hid on the Polish border with Slovakia, she said.

""Due to resiliency and taking action and not waiting for things to just resolve themselves -- these are the qualities that saved both of our families. And we're really praying and hoping that Omer embodies these qualities and is surviving,"" she added.

Orna and Ronen addressed the Republican National Convention last month to bring awareness to the situation.

Before the two spoke, people at the convention erupted in a ""bring them home"" chant.

""We were very touched, and we're really touched, by the support of the public. And we feel it,"" said Orna.

The Neutras said they have been speaking with the White House on a regular basis, but until their son is back, not enough has been done.

Vice President Kamala Harris spoke for around a half hour to a packed crowd at the McHale Athletic Center of Wilkes University in Pennsylvania on Friday, where she was interrupted at least twice by pro-Palestinian protesters.

""You're supporting a war criminal,"" one protester shouted about two-thirds of the way into her speech.

A second appeared shortly after the first was ushered out, and shouted for several minutes until he also was removed, crying out ""Free Palestine"" as he was led past the press cordon.

In response, Harris said, ""I respect your voice, but right now, I am speaking,"" before moving on with the rest of her address over the interjector's din.

PRO-PALESTINIAN PROTESTERS TAUNT HARRIS RALLYGOERS AS VEEP SUPPORTER HITS BACK: 'WHAT ABOUT HAMAS?'

Harris had been introduced by Mary Grace, a local nurse who said she was a longtime Republican who could not support former President Trump.

After thanking Sen. Robert P. Casey Jr., D-Pa., Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro and Wilkes-Barre Democratic mayor George Brown, all of whom preceded her remarks, she began the crux of her remarks by referencing the ABC News debate from earlier in the week.

""I take it many people here watched it,"" she said, as the reference drew applause.

""You'll remember that night I talked about issues that matter to families across America, like bringing down the cost of living, investing in America's small businesses, protecting reproductive freedom. And keeping our nation safe and secure. But that is not what we heard from Donald Trump. Instead, it was the same old show, the same tired playbook we've heard for years with no plan, no plan on how he would address the needs of the American people. Well, folks, it's time to turn the page.""

Harris claimed Trump will give billionaires and large corporations ""massive"" tax cuts while also taking a scalpel to entitlements.

She also said the Republican wants to impose a ""Trump sales tax,"" which some observers claim to be a reference to the former president's foreign tariff plans.

Harris also spoke about national division, saying ""we are not going back"" to past years, and instead called for a ""new way forward.""

""We need a President of the United States who works for all the American people and that just stops with all the trying to divide us,"" she said.

""People are exhausted with that stuff.""

She also called herself the ""underdog"" in the race, predicting it will be tight in the crucial Commonwealth in which she spoke.

""So Pennsylvania, today I ask you, are you ready to make your voices heard? Do we believe in freedom?"" Harris asked

Making the trek north on I-81 from Harrisburg, Shapiro - who many believed was the proverbial runner-up to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in Harris' running mate consideration - offered a booming endorsement shortly before the candidate came onstage.

""We have proved ... that we can 'get sh -- done'!"" Shapiro shouted, referencing his gubernatorial administration's edgy slogan of sorts.

""[We've invested] a historic amount in our public schools... when those kids go to and from schools, they deserve to live in safe communities,"" he added.

""We want everyone to know that you are valued here, whether you choose to be a lawyer or a laborer, we want you to know you belong here [in Pennsylvania].""

""Where you come from, who you love, and who you pray to - you belong and I got your back,"" Shapiro went on, adding Harris' campaign offers a similar vision.

""She and I have both been prosecutors,"" said Shapiro, who served as the separately-elected attorney general during the governorship of predecessor Tom Wolf.

""Kamala Harris has always been for the people... She stood up for our union sisters and brothers.

This time borrowing a line instead from Harris, Shapiro added of Trump's tenure in the White House, ""we are not going back to that.""

""When you go back and look at his record, it was ... less jobs and a whole lot less freedom when Donald Trump was in charge,"" he said, invoking the abortion issue and claiming women lost ""basic freedom to make decisions about their own bodies.""

Shapiro went on to point to Philadelphia, just 100 miles on the other end of the Northeast Extension from where he spoke, saying that Americans ""declared our independence from a king [there, once] and we are not going back.""

At the debate in Philadelphia, Harris made reference to the approximate 800,000 Polish-Americans who reside in Pennsylvania. Outside Port Richmond and the Philadelphia area, the counties in and around where Harris rallied Friday have a sizeable such population.

In Wilkes-Barre's Luzerne County, about one-sixth of the population is Polish American, and cities like Nanticoke, Hazleton and Shamokin - in nearby Northumberland County - also host sizable communities.

In that regard, when asked, Desai said Trump is an ""especially easy choice"" for Pennsylvania's Polish-Americans, noting his ""blossoming friendship"" with Polish President Andrzej Duda and his work with Warsaw to build a stronger alliance, including within their shared NATO status.

At the debate, Harris appeared to draw a connection between the Polish-American electorate and her criticisms of how Trump would end the war in Ukraine - which borders Poland:

""Why don't you tell the 800,000 Polish Americans right here in Pennsylvania how quickly you would give up for the sake of favor and what you think is a friendship with what is known to be a dictator who would eat you for lunch,"" Harris said, referring to Russian leader Vladimir Putin."

""You are a bull---- spreader,"" the male pro-Palestinian protester shot back. ""You are the cowardly one here. Come show your muscle... Let the people live; that's what we want.""

KAMALA HARRIS: WE NEED A 'CEASE-FIRE' AND CHART A COURSE FOR A 'TWO-STATE SOLUTION'

Frank told Fox News Digital after the kerfuffle that he effectively had had enough of the protesters' invective and had to say something.

""Everybody agrees that the war [in Gaza] is horrible... but they're complaining about Kamala, who has called for a cease fire.

""[The protesters] are representing the Palestinians, which is fine, but they say nothing about Hamas and the horror that started this whole thing,"" Frank added.

""And they don't say anything about how Hamas uses the Palestinians as human shields. So, you know, United States has been trying to negotiate a cease fire here for months and months. And the problem is Netanyahu and the right wing of the Israeli government -- they don't even want a two-state solution.""

Frank criticize Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has and will continue engage in indiscriminate bombings of Gazan territory - while underlining additionally that the U.S. made a promise to Israel and should uphold it:

""[America] has a commitment, a long-standing commitment since the year I was born to defend Israel's right to exist. Hamas's stated purpose is to end Israel as a state,"" he said.

""Kamala Harris is on record as advocating for a cease fire. So, you know, aim your anger where it might do some good.""

After speaking with Frank, Fox News Digital also caught up with Loai, the male protester who had been jawing with the Harris supporter.

Loai said he was born in Palestinian territory but now lives locally in the Wyoming Valley.

When asked why he and his group are protesting the Harris rally, Loai said the vice president supports ""Zionists [and is] supporting Israel.""

Loai added that both Harris and Trump are ""essentially"" the same on the matter. When asked who he prefers if he had to choose, Loai quipped, ""let's see who is less smelly.""

""We want to see the genocide stop,"" he added.

Loai said he also ""doesn't care"" about Israel - and personally is not calling for its demise, as other protesters have shouted ""from the river to the sea"" - a phrase connected to calls for the destruction of Israel.

""We don't care about Israel; that they exist or not. That's not our business. We are American here. We want this genocide to be stopped. - Wherever they go, they just [need] to get the Hell out of [the Palestinian territory]."""

The World Health Organization says that in less than two weeks, they've helped administer more than 550,000 polio vaccines to children across the enclave. Now they're gearing up for the second dose. Eyad Baba/AFP/Getty hide caption

The first wave of a massive vaccination campaign against polio is wrapping up in Gaza.

The World Health Organization (WHO) says that in less than two weeks, they've helped administer more than 550,000 polio vaccines to children across the enclave. But the work is only half done.

""We start the race against time for the second stage of the campaign,"" says Juliette Touma with the U.N. Relief and Works Agency, the group that's administering the vaccines. ""We have to do all of this all over again to give the children the second doses of vaccines against polio.""

Polio is a highly infectious virus that can lead to paralysis and even death. It often spreads through fecal matter. This is a problem in Gaza, which has suffered destruction of much of its water treatment infrastructure.

""Solid waste everywhere,"" says Dr. Majdi Duhair, a retired epidemiologist in Gaza. ""No clean drinking water, no hygiene.""

This has all led to plenty of sewage in the streets -- the perfect recipe for the spread of polio. So when the virus turned up in wastewater samples in the enclave, alarm bells went off, especially because vaccination programs in Gaza have collapsed since the war began.

Sure enough, last month, a little boy not quite one year old became paralyzed in both of his legs. He is Gaza's first confirmed case of polio in a quarter century.

""Scientifically, one confirmed case of polio -- it is considered as an outbreak,"" says Duhair. That's because a single case points to roughly 200 more people who are infected but not showing symptoms. No other cases have surfaced in Gaza so far, but ""we are expecting the circulation of this virus is very high in the community,"" he says.

Health officials sequenced the polio virus that appeared in Gaza and traced it to a strain last seen in Egypt in 2023. ""There are obviously interactions between people in Egypt and in Gaza,"" says Raul Andino, an immunologist at the University of California, San Francisco. ""And this virus is very infectious, very easy to transmit.""

Andino explains that the oral vaccine -- which is comprised of a weakened form of the polio virus -- is ""extremely safe"" to get and that it protects the recipient from polio. It's also easy to administer, requiring just two drops in the mouth and no needles. Rarely, however, when that weakened virus is shed in a person's stool, it can mutate and regain its ability to cause disease.

This is what happened with the strain now in Gaza. People were vaccinated orally in Egypt and at some point, the virus that they shed in their fecal matter became virulent again.

But here's where the real problem lies: ""When you reduce the regular vaccinations in a given population,"" says Andino, ""you end up having a number of individuals that are susceptible to be infected.""

This is the reason that public health officials moved quickly to launch a mass campaign of polio vaccination.

Duhair worked as the director of public health in Gaza's Ministry of Health for three decades. Since he retired two years ago, he's been asked for advice on various matters. Then, in mid-July, he got a call from the Ministry to head up the committee overseeing the planning and rollout of the vaccination effort.

""Without hesitation, I cannot refuse serving my population,"" says Duhair. ""I am a Palestinian, and they are our children. Immediately, I accept[ed] the job.""

Andino helped develop the novel oral polio vaccine that was used in the campaign. Unlike the previous version (used in Egypt among many other places worldwide) that only needed one mutation to recapture the capacity to cause disease, this new vaccine requires three. ""That makes the virus safer,"" Andino says. ""It's not perfect, but it's safer.""

The goal of the vaccination effort was to reach at least 90% of the kids in Gaza under ten. (The risk for adults is much lower.) There was a lot to do in very little time.

Duhair and his colleagues coordinated with groups like UNICEF to deliver the vaccine to Gaza and WHO to bring in the refrigeration to keep the vaccine cool.

Right off the bat, the team faced challenges. Chief among them was running the campaign in the middle of a war zone. ""It's impossible to undertake a vaccination campaign of such volume and scale under a sky full of airstrikes,"" says Touma. ""Impossible.""

That's why it was crucial that the Israeli army and Hamas agree to briefly pause the fighting in different areas specially for the immunization effort. These respites allowed the vaccination teams to disperse throughout the enclave.

They also had to figure out how to drive the vaccine and the vaccinators around Gaza, a little territory crammed full of people displaced from months of Israeli air strikes.

""It is a matter of overcrowding of a small area,"" explains Duhair. ""And of course, the streets are damaged.""

So Duhair and his team planned accordingly. They started early at 6 a.m every day. And they put extra vehicles on the roads in case any were delayed.

Usually, a campaign like this would move house to house to vaccinate as many children as possible. But in Gaza, they couldn't since there are so few houses left and people are often moving hour by hour.

""That presented an immense level of challenge in terms of mapping the population and also correctly estimating the population sizes in each location,"" WHO's Deepak Kumar said at a press briefing.

He says more than 200 teams have been involved with the vaccination effort, tracking the numbers of children in Gaza and how many have been vaccinated. ""The data was watched over very closely until we were confident that we have reached more than 95% of coverage,"" says Kumar.

""We go from shelter to shelter and tent to tent,"" says Touma. ""People are literally everywhere. I mean, in the middle of the street, you have people living by the beach. So the idea is to reach every child wherever they are.""

WHO reports that families were enthusiastic about having their children vaccinated.

""We are happy with this polio campaign,"" says Dr. Richard Peeperkorn, WHO Representative for the West Bank and Gaza. ""And I think we are also quite confident that we reached an enormous amount of children in this short time.""

It was a considerable undertaking. ""I don't think a polio campaign has ever been done like this globally, constrained by time and security as we're currently undergoing in Gaza,"" says Scott Anderson, deputy humanitarian coordinator with the U.N.

Anderson is stationed in Gaza, and he likens the vaccination effort to putting a band aid on a much deeper wound -- a territory whose people and infrastructure have been bombarded for over 11 months by Israeli air strikes after the war that started after the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel on October 7.

""We're really just hoping and praying that there's not a larger outbreak of disease,"" he says.

Vaccination is just a piece of the polio response. For the next six months, officials will need to be vigilant to ensure there's no virus circulating in either the people or the wastewater of Gaza. That's when they'll know if the outbreak is over.

Still, this territory is but one place in the world where the virus is present. These spots have things in common, like insecurity, poor hygiene and reduced access to health care and routine vaccination programs.

Zubair Wawood is an epidemiologist and polio expert with WHO, one of several groups that comprise the Global Polio Eradication Initiative.

""There's a 99.9% reduction in the number of polio cases since the start of this initiative more than three decades back,"" says Wawood, ""and we are at the very, very last mile of this.""

And yet, Wawood says that upheavals like the one in Gaza and elsewhere in the world -- involving war, displacement, chronic disruption -- make that last mile a lot longer."

CREDIT: Daily Wire

A pro-Israel demonstrator in Massachusetts has been charged after prosecutors say he shot a man sporting a Palestinian flag pin who ran across the street through traffic and tackled the defendant Thursday during a heated dispute about the war in Gaza in which the man accused protesters of ""defending genocide"" and calling them ""sick.""

Scott Hayes, 47, of Framingham, has been charged with assault and battery with a dangerous weapon, as well as violation of a constitutional right causing injury, after he shot his attacker in the stomach as they tussled on the ground in Newton at around 6:40 p.m., Middlesex County District Attorney Marian Ryan said at a late night press briefing.

Hayes fired his gun after the man made a beeline from across the street, tackled Hayes and knocked him to the ground before grabbing him around the neck on a sidewalk, video shows.

AMERICAN KILLED IN WEST BANK, STATE DEPARTMENT SAYS

After the shot rang out, two other pro-Israel demonstrators could be seen stomping on the pro-Palestinian supporter, who has not been identified, and then dragging him off Hayes.

In another video posted online, Hayes can be seen administering aid to the man seconds after the shooting and telling an onlooker to call 911. The shooting victim suffered life-threatening injuries and was being treated at a local hospital, according to Ryan.

The incident was sparked while Hayes and a group of other pro-Israel supporters were protesting at the intersection of Washington Street and Harvard Street, which is about seven and a half miles west of Boston. Newton, a city of around 90,000 people, has a large Jewish population.

""There was a small group of individuals, pro-Israeli demonstrators who were demonstrating on one side of the street. There was an individual, apparently completely randomly walking down the other side of the street,"" Ryan said. ""Words were exchanged back and forth across the street.""

""You are sick, you are sick,"" the man, wearing a purple T-shirt and shorts with a face mask around his neck, can be heard saying, according to the video footage.

""We are sick?"" a woman can be heard clapping back at him and laughing.

""Yes, you are defending genocide,"" the man shouts back.

Then, in the next clip, the man can be seen running across a busy pedestrian crossing through traffic and lunging at Hayes.

""Ultimately, that individual came very rapidly across the street and tackled one of the demonstrators,"" Ryan said.

""There was a scuffle that was going on, on the street, and at some point Mr. Hayes used a gun and fired a shot that struck the individual who had come across the street.""

Ryan said that Hayes legally owns the firearm.

A GoFundMe page has been launched to support Hayes, and the fundraiser has already raised more than $55,000.

The page states that Hayes is an Iraq War veteran, and even though he is not Jewish, has been taking part in demonstrations across Boston defending the Jewish people and their right to self-determination and governance all across Boston.

Hayes is expected to be arraigned Friday at Newton District Court.

Newton Mayor Ruthanne Fuller said it was a ""frightening incident"" and called for patience as investigators look into what took place.

""Let the Newton police do their work and get the facts straight,"" Fuller said. It is the really early stages of an active investigation.

Meanwhile, Acting Newton Police Chief George McMains asked the public who have information or video of the incident to come forward.

He also said that extra police will patrol houses of worship over the next several days."
Top Biden adviser has been employed for decades at church that gave platform to antisemites: 'Devil by nature',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-biden-adviser-employed-decades-church-gave-platform-antisemites-devil-by-nature,2024-09-12T20:59:05Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A top Biden White House adviser has been employed for decades as a minister at a Washington, D.C., church that has hosted several activists and religious leaders with long histories of antisemitism, including one Black activist who, during a 2002 speech, called for ""Zionists"" in Israel, including their babies, to be murdered.

Rev. Thomas Bowen, who is listed on Shiloh Baptist Church's website as a minister of social justice and has been employed at the church since 2002 in several leadership roles, joined the White House in February to serve as the senior adviser for the White House Office of Public Engagement, which ""works at the local, state, and national levels to ensure community leaders, diverse perspectives, and new voices all have the opportunity to inform the work of the President.""

Shiloh Baptist Church, a historic Black church that Vice President Kamala Harris and her husband visited on Christmas Day in 2022, is led by Reverend Doctor Wallace Charles Smith, Shiloh's senior minister and a longtime mentor of Bowen. During a sermon before Shiloh's congregation last month, Bowen called Smith his ""hero,"" ""friend,"" and ""mentor ... to whom I owe a debt that I could never ever repay.""

Bowen's social media is also littered with praise of Rev. Smith, who invited multiple activists with long histories of antisemitism into their church.

LEFT-WING ACTIVIST WHO HIRED ONE OF FARRAKHAN'S 'TOP SOLDIERS' HAS VISITED BIDEN WHITE HOUSE 7 TIMES

In April 2018, Rev. Smith hosted the National Black Men's Convention at Shiloh Baptist Church, which was billed as a five-day summit for ""mobilizing and organizing brothers for a better future for our community"" and opposing President Trump. Each day had a different theme, which included reparations, and several of the speakers involved with the summit had a problematic history of antisemitism and vile rhetoric against White people.

In the months before the convention, Rev. Smith met at Shiloh Baptist Church with the convention's co-host Malik Shabazz, the founder of Black Lawyers for Justice and former chairman of the New Black Panther Party. Shabazz, who has been labeled by the Southern Poverty Law Center (SPLC) as a ""racist black nationalist with a long, well-documented history of violently anti-Semitic remarks and accusations about the inherent evil of white people,"" posted a photo of him and Smith hugging on his Facebook and said they had a ""great meeting"" together. Shabazz also added that ""Pastor Smith and other pro-Black Christian preachers will be speaking"" at the convention.

Shabazz, who posted a photo with notorious antisemite Louis Farrakhan in 2020 with the caption, ""I HAVE WALKED WITH THE BEST"" and called the Nation of Islam leader ""one of the great influences in my life"" last year, made several other posts in the months leading up to the 2018 convention touting Shiloh Baptist Church as the host of the convention, including videos that showed he was in attendance at church events while Bowen was on the church's payroll.

SPLC's website lists several vile quotes uttered by Shabazz, including remarks from a 2002 speech in Washington, D.C., where he reportedly said, ""Kill every goddamn Zionist in Israel! Goddamn little babies, goddamn old ladies! Blow up Zionist supermarkets!"" In another speech from the early 2000s, he also pushed antisemitic tropes about ""Zionists"" controlling the media and foreign policy.

DNC SPEAKER TIED TO FARRAKHAN TELLS DEMS TO 'ACT RIGHT' UNTIL ELECTION, THEN CAN 'GO BACK TO ACTING CRAZY'

Earlier this year, Shabazz posted a photo of him and former Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad from 2012 and said his ""views are shaped by my experiences."" He said he was invited by a now-deceased journalist for the Nation of Islam's publication and said Farrakhan was in attendance with dozens of imams. Ahmadinejad has repeatedly called Israel an ""illegitimate regime"" and has called for its ""elimination.""

When pressed by Fox News Digital on his ties to Farrakhan and his long history of antisemitic remarks, he responded, ""Have no associations with Louis Farrakhan. Am not anti semetic (sic)."" Fox followed up with a social media post showing him and Farrakhan, prompting him to say, ""Meaning I have no current associations with him.""

The other co-host of the convention was Minister Hashim Nzinga, who has since died and was serving as the chief of staff for the New Black Panther Party when he died in 2020. He also made several controversial statements, according to SPLC, including saying, ""Every White man and every Jew is the devil by nature."" During a 2016 interview with the Los Angeles Times, he was asked to respond to Shabazz's comment about killing Zionists, prompting him to admit, ""I still say that all the time now. You've gotta kill them before they kill you. ... If someone brings harm to us, we're gonna kill them.""

BIDEN CABINET OFFICIAL POSES FOR PHOTO WITH ONE OF FARRAKHAN'S 'TOP SOLDIERS' AT DNC

""In addition, Nzinga said in the interview that homosexuality is evil, that Jews control the media and are responsible for the Sept. 11 attacks and that blacks are God's 'chosen people,' Jesus himself being black,"" the LA Times reported at the time.

An archived itinerary of the convention revealed that House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries' controversial uncle, Leonard Jeffries, was also a speaker at the event. The elder Jeffries, who has a long history of antisemitism, is described on the convention's website as a ""political scientist"" who ""achieved national prominence in the early 1990s for his historical statements about Jews"" and highlighted how Jeffries ""stated that Jews financed the slave trade, used the movie industry to hurt Black people, and that whytes [sic] are 'ice people' while Africans are 'sun people.'""

Shabazz posted Jeffries' speech on his Facebook page, where he opened his remarks by saying ""Black power"" before asking the crowd to give a round of applause for Shabazz and Nzinga for organizing the convention. He also gave a shoutout to Farrakhan during his remarks.

Another speaker at the convention was Dr. Boyce Watkins, who wrote the book ""The 10 Commandments of Black Economic Power"" and is a staunch defender of Farrakhan. In a 2018 tweet, Watkins defended Farrakhan comparing Jews to termites, saying, ""Anyone attacking [Louis Farrakhan] for his statement about being 'anti-termite' is probably a termite themselves."" He has also used antisemitic tropes like saying Jews control Hollywood and the music industry.

In September 2023, Watkins said, ""I love Farrakhan. Period."" And in a 2022 video, he boasted about being invited to the Nation of Islam's annual Saviour's Day event and said the Nation of Islam ""are like brothers to me. When I go in there, when I roll up there, I get so much love from all the NOI brothers and the sisters. I just want to give them a shoutout right now.""

It is unclear whether Bowen, who previously served as director of African American strategic engagement in the executive office of DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, was involved with the planning for the convention or was in attendance. But an archived version of Shiloh's website says he was one of the five ""assistant pastors"" at the time of the convention. He did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

A few years earlier, in 2015, Rev. Smith hosted Farrakhan and dozens of Black community leaders at his church for an invitation-only meeting to discuss the upcoming 20th anniversary of the ""Million Man March."" Farrakhan, who was surrounded by several Nation of Islam members in addition to Rev. Smith and Cora Masters Barry, who faced backlash earlier this summer for an unearthed clip saying, ""F -- the White women,"" spoke at the private event.

An article from the Washington Informer, a ""woman-owned multimedia news organization serving the African-Americans"" in the DC area, reported at the time that Farrakhan, while speaking at Shiloh, said he believed it was time for Blacks to ""distribute the pain"" so they aren't the only ones suffering.

Shiloh also hosted former President Obama's controversial pastor Jeremiah Wright that year, according to a tweet from Bowen saying he was ""preaching"" the ""Miseducation of the Palestinians."" Wright previously delivered the viral ""God damn America"" sermon and used an antisemitic trope to blame Jews for keeping him from talking with Obama after Obama won the 2008 presidential election. The comments ignited backlash from the Anti-Defamation League at the time, calling Wright's comments ""inflammatory and false.""

""The notions of Jewish control of the White House in Reverend Wright's statement express classic anti-Semitism in its most vile form,"" an ADL spokesperson said in 2009. ""In a short succinct sentence, Reverend Wright manages to both label some of the President's closest advisors solely by their religious beliefs and give them powers superior to the President himself.""

The White House and Shiloh Baptist Church did not respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment."
Top Washington Dems push White House to investigate U.S. citizen's killing in West Bank,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/aysenur-eygi-israel-independent-investigation-west-bank-biden-harris-rcna170828,2024-09-12T19:44:13Z,"Aysenur Eygi's family has demanded an independent probe into her death. But Biden and Harris are leaning on Israel's investigation for answers instead.

Three top Democrats from Washington state have urged the Biden administration to investigate the killing of Aysenur Eygi, an American citizen, in the West Bank, as the White House continues to resist her family's calls for an independent probe.

In a letter to Secretary of State Anthony Blinken on Wednesday, Sen. Patty Murray and Rep. Pramila Jayapal requested ""an immediate, transparent, credible, and thorough independent U.S. investigation"" by the FBI into her death. Sen. Maria Cantwell also urged Blinken and President Joe Biden for an independent review into Eygi's death in a separate letter.

Eygi, a 26-year-old from Seattle, was volunteering with the International Solidarity Movement, a group that supports Palestinian resistance against Israeli oppression, in the West Bank when she was killed on Sept. 6 during a protest against the expansion of settlements. The Israeli military has said its forces had likely ""unintentionally"" killed Eygi when ""responding with fire toward a main instigator"" who was hurling rocks -- a claim that Eygi's family and ISM have wholly rejected, saying it contradicts multiple eyewitness accounts.

A Washington Post investigation published Wednesday also found dozens of videos and witness accounts that reportedly refute Israel's claim. According to the Post, Eygi was shot more than half an hour after confrontations between protesters and the military had peaked, and after protesters had moved away from Israeli forces. The IDF declined to respond to the Post's questions. Neither MSNBC nor NBC News has confirmed the Post's reporting.

Eygi's family, like those of other American citizens killed by Israeli forces in the past, has demanded an independent investigation into her death. Although top White House officials -- including Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, who only issued statements about her death this week -- have expressed outrage over Eygi's killing, they have not acknowledged her family's calls for a U.S. probe, saying instead that they are leaning on Israel's investigation for answers.

Jayapal and Murray wrote that Eygi's family and community ""deserve to know their government has done everything it can to fully understand what led to her killing, pursue accountability for those involved, and seek to ensure this does not happen again.""

They pointed to a ""pattern"" of American citizens being killed by Israeli forces in the occupied West Bank with impunity: Tawfic Abdel Jabbar, a 17-year-old Louisiana native who was shot in the head while driving in February 2024; Mohammed Khdour, another 17-year-old American citizen who killed under very similar circumstances just weeks later; Omar Assad, a 78-year-old Palestinian American who died after being taken into custody at a checkpoint in 2022; and Shireen Abu Akleh, a Palestinian American journalist who was shot in the head by an Israeli soldier while on assignment.

Israel has said it would look into Abdel Jabbar and Khdour's deaths, but it's unclear where those investigations stand or if they are even currently underway. Investigators from the U.S. embassy visited the homes of Abdel Jabbar and Khdour's families, The Associated Press reported in February, but the White House has not announced any further action since. Assad's family has repeatedly demanded that the U.S. launch an independent investigation into his death to no avail, and the Israeli military last year declined to bring criminal charges against the soldiers involved in his death.

The IDF has acknowledged that its forces killed Abu Akleh, but declined to open a criminal investigation. The FBI launched a review into Abu Akleh's killing that Israel refused to cooperate with, calling it an ""interference in Israel's internal affairs."" The agency has, until now, not released any findings or issued any arrests."
"In Jordan's elections, anger at Israel over the Gaza war fuels Islamist gains",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/12/g-s1-22336/jordan-elections-islamists-israel-gaza-war,2024-09-12T19:33:29Z,"AMMAN, Jordan -- Jordan's Islamist opposition made the biggest gains of any opposition party in parliamentary elections held this week, winning one-fifth of the seats amid increasing anger against Israel over the war in Gaza.

The Islamic Action Front, the political wing of the Muslim Brotherhood, is now the single biggest opposition bloc in the 138-member parliament. The legislative body has limited power, and will continue to be dominated by pro-government and tribal political groups.

The IAF's showing in the election has been widely watched as a gauge of whether the increased support for Hamas, which is at war with Israel, would translate into more seats for the Brotherhood-linked party in Jordan and more influence for Islamist parties in other countries.

Voting turnout was relatively low -- an average of 32% across the country. The percentage of voters going to the polls was much higher in tribal areas and much lower in the capital Amman.

Jordanian Muslim Brotherhood leader Murad Adailah told Reuters the IAF victory was a ""popular referendum"" endorsing support for Hamas and its allies and rejection of the 1994 peace treaty between Jordan and Israel.

Jordan's highest court dissolved the Muslim Brotherhood organization four years ago, citing failure to comply with registration laws. The Brotherhood stills operates in Jordan but is not allowed to directly field parliamentary candidates. Many Arab rulers have banned the Brotherhood, fearing threats to their hereditary power and to more secular political agendas.

Jordan's monarchy has tried to balance legislative and judicial moves to limit the power of the Brotherhood while allowing its supporters some free expression. At protests after Friday prayers, Brotherhood speakers regularly lead chants of ""we are all Hamas"" and call for Jordan to break its peace treaty with Israel.

The United States, Jordan's main foreign donor, has designated Hamas a terrorist organization.

Jordan signed its 1994 peace treaty with neighboring Israel under the late King Hussein, becoming the second country to do so after Egypt. A majority of Jordan's population is originally Palestinian, descendants of families who fled or were forced from their homes in the war in 1948, the year Israel was created -- and in subsequent wars, and were never allowed back.

Anger has grown along with the death toll in Gaza, where the health ministry says more than 40,000 people, many of them women and children, have been killed in Israeli attacks. Israel says it needs to destroy Hamas after Hamas militants led a cross-border attack last October that Israeli authorities say killed roughly 1,200 people.

Along with appealing to Jordanians enraged over Israeli attacks in Gaza and the West Bank, the IAF managed to form alliances to appeal to a wider group of voters than its traditional urban conservative Muslim base and successfully fielded candidates including tribal leaders and Christians.

Jordan is a constitutional monarchy and King Abdullah II implemented electoral reforms two years ago aimed at encouraging the role of political parties as a step toward greater democratization. The new laws also increased the number of seats for women and lowered the age at which candidates can run from 30 to 25.

The king still appoints government leaders and can dissolve parliament, which introduces and passes laws and has the ability to force a government resignation through a no-confidence vote.

Jordan, a resource-poor country, has been hit particularly hard by the economic fallout of the Gaza war. Tourism, one of the country's main sectors, has plummeted and unemployment, while officially about 22% of the working population, is believed to be much higher.

The head of European Union election mission, Željana Zovko, praised Jordan for succeeding in holding elections as scheduled, despite the ongoing turmoil in the region."
The U.N. says 6 staff were killed in an Israeli strike on a Gaza school,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/12/nx-s1-5109856/unrwa-israel-strike-school-gaza-hamas-war,2024-09-12T15:24:46Z,"NUSEIRAT REFUGEE CAMP, Gaza Strip -- The United Nations relief agency for Palestinian refugees in the Gaza Strip says Israeli airstrikes hit a school that was sheltering families in central Gaza, killing six of its employees.

The U.N. agency, UNRWA, says this is the fifth time the al-Jaouni school has been hit since the start of the war. It says that some 12,000 people -- mostly women and children -- are taking shelter there and the manager of the UNWRA team helping people was killed in Wednesday's strike.

First responders say 18 people died in the attack that caused the roof of a shelter to cave in. Families were left scrambling to find their loved ones amid the wreckage.

""No one is safe in Gaza,"" the agency said in a statement. ""No one is spared.""

António Guterres, the U.N. Secretary General, called the strikes ""dramatic violations of international humanitarian law.""

""What's happening in Gaza is totally unacceptable,"" he wrote on X, formerly Twitter.

The Israeli military said Hamas was using the school as a ""command and control center.""

Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, responded to Guterres' criticism by writing on X: ""It is unconscionable that the UN continues to condemn Israel in its just war against terrorists, while Hamas continues to use women and children as human shields.""

UNWRA called on all parties in the conflict to ""never use schools or the areas around them for military or fighting purposes"" and said that ""schools and other civilian infrastructure must be protected at all times.""

Sixteen people were reported killed in a previous Israeli attack on several structures in the Al-Jaouni school compound in July, which Israel said was being used by Hamas fighters.

UNRWA says Wednesday's attack caused the highest number of staff killed in a single incident. At least 220 agency staff have lost their lives since the war began. Philippe Lazzarini, the UNRWA Commissioner-General, said humanitarian staff are being ""disregarded"" in the Gaza war.

""The longer impunity prevails, the more international humanitarian law and the Geneva conventions will become irrelevant,"" he wrote on social media.

Gaza's Health Ministry says more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed and 95,125 injured in Israel's military offensive on Gaza since Oct. 7, the day that Hamas-led militants attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking 250 hostages.

Millions of Gaza residents have been displaced in the war, many of them multiple times. The population is blighted by hunger and the spread of disease.

The World Health Organization said on Wednesday it carried out its largest medical evacuation from Gaza since the start of the war, taking 97 sick and severely injured patients and 155 companions to the United Arab Emirates for treatment. The patients were 45 children and 52 adults with a wide range of conditions, including cancer and other diseases and injuries from the conflict.

Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO's director-general, said the evacuation was a ""highly complex operation"" that was ""completed under immense time pressure to bring all patients together.""

A WHO report published Thursday found that some 22,500 people -- about a quarter of those wounded in the war in Gaza -- have injuries that will require rehabilitation now and for years to come. According to the report, some 3,105 and 4,050 limbs have been amputated as a result of the conflict. Many, including thousands of women and children, suffer from injured spinal cords, traumatic brain injuries or major burns.

""The huge surge in rehabilitation needs occurs in parallel with the ongoing decimation of the health system,"" said Dr. Richard Peeperkorn, a WHO representative for the West Bank and Gaza. ""Patients can't get the care they need. Acute rehabilitation services are severely disrupted and specialized care for complex injuries is not available, placing patients' lives at risk. Immediate and long-term support is urgently needed to address the enormous rehabilitation needs.""

Gaza's only limb reconstruction and rehabilitation center, supported by WHO, stopped functioning in December 2023 because of lack of supplies, and because specialized health workers were themselves being forced to leave the area in search of safety. The report says 39 physiotherapists have been killed.

The WHO says its latest report highlights how vast the unmet medical needs are in Gaza today."
"NYC cultural institutions split with staff over wearing keffiyehs, Palestine solidarity",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/12/nx-s1-5108683/palestine-keffiyeh-noguchi-museum-92ny,2024-09-12T15:21:35Z,"Two workers at the Noguchi Museum told NPR they were among three who said they were fired last week for wearing keffiyehs, the scarf that has come to symbolize Palestinian identity in much of the world. A fourth also left the institution. James Leynse/Corbis via Getty Images hide caption

Nearly a dozen arts workers in New York City have recently left their jobs or been fired over conflict with their employers about expressing solidarity with Palestinian suffering.

Two workers at the Noguchi Museum told NPR they were among three who said they were fired last week for wearing keffiyehs, the scarf that has come to symbolize Palestinian identity in much of the world. A fourth also left the institution. And a spokesperson for the 92nd Street Y confirmed to NPR that six employees have left the museum since July as a result of a new policy that restricts public-facing employees from expressing personal views about politics and social issues while at work.

The news was first reported in two articles by the online art world magazine Hyperallergic.

Natalie Cappellini is among the gallery attendants at the Noguchi Museum in Queens, New York, who said she was terminated for wearing the keffiyeh.

""The three of us who've been fired have been wearing our keffiyehs for months,"" she told NPR. ""It had never been an issue, had never been brought up to us, and technically fell within our dress code of wearing black, white or gray and abstract patterned accessories.""

Cappellini said she was unaware of any written policy banning the keffiyehs until a co-worker was told to remove her scarf and go home one day in August. After that, Cappellini said, museum workers received an email from the HR department banning ""political dress."" She continued to wear the keffiyeh to work, she said, to promote her belief that such a widely-worn garment cannot be reduced to politics.

""It's just really upsetting to be at a cultural institution which is banning a cultural garment,"" she said. Another employee who was terminated, Tresonia Abbot, told NPR that they had been warned by a supervisor that a visitor to the museum photographed them wearing a keffiyeh, and that image had been used in what they described as an organized campaign of complaint to managers by pro-Israel supporters. The Noguchi Museum was the site of protests last weekend as a result of the firings. It has not responded to NPR's request for comment.

Meanwhile, internal tensions at the 92NY in Manhattan have run high since last October, when soon after the Hamas-led attack in Israel on Oct. 7, it halted a talk by Pulitzer Prize-winning author Viet Thanh Nguyen, who has drawn parallels between the killings of Palestinians and Vietnamese civilians during conflict. That decision resulted in staff resignations. According to Hyperallergic, some employees this summer protested a new internal policy that banned personal displays of politics even as an Israeli flag hung prominently in the building. Workers said they were disciplined for showing symbols of solidarity with Palestinians, such as stickers of watermelons (which share the same colors as the Palestinian flag) and a poster that read ""Ceasefire Now, End the Genocide, Free Palestine.""

In a statement sent to NPR, 92NY said it is a community center that serves a very diverse patron base.

""There are some questions that are for lawyers and not for me,"" said Amy Werbel, a professor who studies museums and censorship and was a recent fellow at the University of California National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement. But generally, she said, and especially during fraught political moments, cultural institutions should look to their mission statements for guidance. They often contain positive language about freedom of expression, creativity, taking risks and being innovative, she said.

Cultural institutions tend to be unique places where people push against constraints on their expression, she added. ""So if you ban the keffiyeh, then what if someone brings in or wears a scarf that kind of looks like a keffiyeh but is not quite a keffiyeh. Is that going to be banned?""

Werbel said cultural institutions should be places where individuals and communities can have difficult conversations. The ideals of the First Amendment and freedom of artistic expression may mean it's impossible for everyone to feel safe everywhere, she said. ""But, you know, if we just give in to the idea that we are going to censor our way out of this, we are really doing so much damage to the possibility for finding common ground."""
"Harris' support for Palestinian state rewards terrorism, experts warn",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/harris-support-palestinian-state-rewards-terrorism-experts-warn,2024-09-12T08:16:17Z,"JERUSALEM -- Vice President Harris' endorsement of a Palestinian state during and prior to her debate with former President Trump would further destabilize the Middle East and bring about additional terrorism, according to Israeli and American experts.

During Tuesday's presidential debate on ABC, the Democrat presidential candidate reiterated her support for a two-state solution: ""I will always give Israel the ability to defend itself, in particular as it relates ... to Iran and any threat that Iran and its proxies pose to Israel. But we must have a two-state solution where we can rebuild Gaza, where the Palestinians have security, self-determination and the dignity they so rightly deserve.""

The two-state solution means an independent Palestinian state on Israel's borders that encompasses the West Bank territory (known in Israel by its biblical name of Judea and Samaria) and the Gaza Strip. Biden faced intense criticism in February for ignoring the outbreak of Palestinian terrorism in Judea and Samaria while singling out Israeli residents of the region for sanctions.

WITNESS TO TERRORISM: HOW HAMAS RADICALIZED PALESTINIANS FOR THEIR GENOCIDAL ATTACK ON ISRAEL

Trump's former ambassador to Israel, David Friedman, told Fox News Digital, ""After Oct. 7th, the two-state became a dead letter. A Palestinian state between Israel and Jordan will destabilize both countries and bring only additional terror and misery.""

Friedman, who authored the new book, ""One Jewish State: The Last, Best Hope to Resolve the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict,"" added, ""Vice President Harris should stop parroting failed theories and trying to force a square peg into a round hole. She should empower Israel to reach a just and workable solution on its own and not interfere in matters where she is neither competent nor well-informed.""

In early September, Friedman blasted Biden on Fox News' ""Your World"" for creating rifts within Israeli society.

Jonathan Conricus, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies who served in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) for 24 years as a combat commander and spokesperson, told Fox News Digital, ""The so-called two-state solution may have been possible to implement 31 years ago, but four straight Palestinian rejections of Israeli peace offers have made it clear that the current Palestinian leadership does not aspire to end the conflict and achieve peace. Palestinian rejectionism has also eroded the political support for the peace process in Israel, since it has become abundantly clear that the Palestinian leadership does not seek peace.""

EXTREMISTS RISE IN NEW PALESTINIAN AUTHORITY GOVERNMENT AS BIDEN THREATENS ISRAEL OVER GAZA WAR

According to Conricus, ""Polling of the Palestinian population in Gaza and Palestinian Authority-controlled areas shows clear popular Palestinian support for Hamas, signaling that the Palestinian population supports the genocidal vision of annihilating Israel through jihad, as demonstrated by Hamas on Oct. 7. Global leaders would do well to listen to the two parties to the conflict to understand how the situation has changed and adapt diplomatic solutions to current possibilities. And whatever the outcome of the Oct. 7 war that Hamas waged against Israel, giving Hamas the ultimate prize of statehood would be devastating for regional stability and peace and for American global standing. Terror must not be awarded with statehood.""

Joel Rubin, former deputy assistant secretary of state and Democrat strategist, told Fox News Digital, ""The two-state solution is on life support right now, but just because this is a difficult moment to envision a peaceful endgame between Israel and the Palestinians that's rooted in diplomatic compromise, that does not mean it should not be the goal. After all, Israel fought multiple existential wars with Egypt and then, only years after the Yom Kippur War, concluded a peace deal that has held and provided Israel with deep security along its southern border for more than four decades. That is what a two-state solution is all about: Ending the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians in a manner that provides stability and security for the long haul.""

NETANYAHU HITS BACK OVER GLOBAL PRESSURE TO MAKE CEASE-FIRE CONCESSSIONS, SAYS DEMANDS ARE 'IMMORAL', 'INSANE'

Rubin, who is a longtime Jewish community activist, added, ""We have seen it achieved with Arab states. There is no reason that it can't be done with the Palestinians as long as the political will is there, extremism is rooted out and security arrangements are solid. So, for Vice President Harris to make this a priority is an inherently pro-Israel position, one that seeks to provide Israel with the long-term security and stability that it still clearly does not have.""

In late August, Harris noted her endorsement of a Palestinian state in an interview with CNN. She said, ""I remain committed since I've been on Oct. 8 to what we must do to work toward a two-state solution where Israel is secure and in equal measure the Palestinians have security and self-determination and dignity.""

ZIONISM EXPLAINED FROM ITS BIBLICAL ORIGINS TO THE REBIRTH OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL

The Harris campaign did not respond to multiple Fox News Digital press queries.

Harris and Biden have provided significant funding for the Palestinian Authority (PA), which is led by Mahmoud Abbas. The PA president is considered by some to be a moderate when compared to the Iranian regime-backed Hamas leadership. Abbas, however, supports stipends for convicted Palestinian terrorists and their families regarding the infamous ""pay for slay"" system that might mean the PA compensates Hamas terrorists.

Fox News Digital reported in November that many of the newly released convicted Palestinian terrorists who were part of a swap that secured the freedom of some Israeli and foreign hostages held by the terrorist movement Hamas could receive U.S. funds via the PA.

Itamar Marcus, director of Palestinian Media Watch, an Israeli-based organization researching Palestinian society, told Fox News Digital at the time, ""The American and European funding boosts the Palestinian Authority budget by $600 million. The Palestinian Authority pays the salaries of imprisoned terrorists and the family members of the martyrs, and the amount comes to $300 million a year.""

Last month, Abbas, according to a translation by the Middle East Media Research Institute, told the Turkish Parliament that ""America is the plague, and the plague is America"" and ""We implement Shari'a law: victory or martyrdom.""

The 88-year-old Abbas, who has clung to power since he took over the presidency of the PA in 2008, has been embroiled in antisemitism and Holocaust-distortion scandals over the years.

In 2022, Fox News Digital reported that Abbas delivered a tirade against Israel in Berlin, where the Holocaust - the mass extermination of European Jewry - was organized, claiming the Jewish state carried out ""50 holocausts."""
"House GOP majority would block Iran peace deal efforts under a President Harris, top Republican vows",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-gop-majority-would-block-iran-peace-deal-efforts-under-harris-top-republican-vows,2024-09-11T20:57:06Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Republicans would pull out every stop to block a Harris administration from negotiating another Iran deal, according to the House's No. 3 Republican, Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York.

""We would block that at every turn,"" the GOP Conference chairwoman vowed in an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital.

""Biden and Kamala Harris have given hundreds of billions of dollars straight to Iran, the greatest sponsor of terror, and the dollars are going to support proxies like Hamas and Hezbollah, which are attacking Israel every single day.""

Two separate agreements last fall that included a prisoner swap allowed Iran to access up to $16 billion of its previously frozen assets.

STEFANIK FILES ETHICS COMPLAINT AGAINST TRUMP TRIAL JUDGE

Middle East watchers have predicted that Vice President Kamala Harris would be much more likely to take to the negotiating table to try to prevent Iran from creating a nuclear weapon than using military deterrence and financial sanctions.

In 2019, Harris said she favored rejoining the 2015 Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) aimed at limiting Iran's nuclear programs.

""President Trump's unilateral withdrawal from an agreement that was verifiably preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon -- against the warnings of our closest allies and without any plan for what comes next -- was beyond reckless,"" she said.

She said she would seek to rejoin the deal ""so long as Iran also returned to verifiable compliance.""

Iran has a growing stockpile of uranium enriched to just below weapons-grade, and some fear it could create a nuclear weapon before the end of the year.

Trump recently warned that sanctions should be used ""as little as possible"" to ""continue to have [the U.S. dollar] be the world currency.""

""I use sanctions very powerfully against countries that deserve it, and then I take them off because, look, you're losing Iran, you're losing Russia. China is out there trying to get their currency to be the dominant currency.""

In a wide-ranging interview on the House GOP's national security priorities, Stefanik, a member of the Intelligence and Armed Services committees, said if the GOP keeps control of the House next Congress, it would continue to work to defund the U.N. Palestinian refugee agency (UNRWA) and ""address these foreign dollars going into universities, put a stop to that.""

President Biden signed an appropriations package in March that banned funding to UNRWA for one year after some of its employees were found to have ties to Hamas.

STEFANIK: HARRIS UNFIT TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF

The chairwoman declined to say whether the House would authorize more funding for Ukraine or Taiwan once this year's foreign aid packages dry up but noted concerns about oversight of U.S. aid in Ukraine.

""I have major concerns about the lack of accountability for the billions of dollars that have gone to Ukraine,"" she said. ""We are continuing to get more reports from the Pentagon that they can't account for -- to the tune of billions of dollars.

""The only person who can solve that conflict is Trump,"" Stefanik added. ""If you look at modern-day presidents, [Russian President Vladimir] Putin invaded other countries during every modern president except for President Trump.""

And on the anniversary of the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Stefanik revealed she is not confident the U.S. is equipped to prevent another similar tragedy.

""If you look at the attack against Israel, the Iranians [are] on the march. The same terrorists that are chanting 'Death to Israel' are also chanting 'Death to America,'"" she said. ""We have individuals on the terrorist watch list who have crossed our open borders. ... That is a national security threat."""
"Jewish Democrat suing Harvard over antisemitism chastises his party for inaction, endorses Trump",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/jewish-democrat-suing-harvard-over-antisemitism-chastises-his-party-inaction-endorses-trump,2024-09-11T18:35:46Z,"Jewish activist and recent Harvard graduate Shabbos Kestenbaum, a registered Democrat, tells Fox News Digital he's decided to endorse former President Trump in 2024 because Kamala Harris ""does not deserve our support.""

A Jewish Democrat who is suing Harvard over antisemitism on campus following the Oct. 7 terrorist attacks in Israel explained to Fox News Digital his decision to endorse former President Donald Trump.

Shabbos Kestenbaum, who's testified before Congress and addressed the Republican National Convention in recent months about antisemitic threats on American college campuses, waited until Sept. 5 to announce that he was endorsing Trump during a speech at the Republican Jewish Coalition Annual Leadership Summit. In an interview with Fox News Digital this week, Kestenbaum, who registered as a Democrat when he turned 18 and has voted for Democratic candidates, including President Biden, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Rep. Jamaal Bowman, D-N.Y., and former Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said he could not support Vice President Kamala Harris in 2024.

""To sort of paraphrase Ronald Reagan, I don't feel that I've abandoned the Democratic Party. I do feel that the Democratic Party abandoned me,"" Kestenbaum said, explaining that he still supports progressive polices, including a $15 minimum wage, ""reproductive choices for women,"" and ""progressive taxation."" ""But at the end of the day, when American Jewry is facing an existential crisis, we are faced with a binary choice. And I think in the electoral zero-sum game, the binary choice would be President Trump. I think he would just be better for the core issues that are affecting me, that are affecting the American Jewish community.""

FEDERAL JUDGE RULES HARVARD UNIVERSITY MUST FACE ANTISEMITISM LAWSUIT FROM JEWISH STUDENTS

After many months of trying to work with the Harris campaign, the White House and Democratic leadership in the House and the Senate, Kestenbaum said he came to the conclusion that even though he did not vote for Trump in the 2016 or 2020 elections - or even five months ago - he would support him in 2024 because Trump is the ""only realistic and viable option for American Jewry.""

Kestenbaum argued Trump has outlined specific, ""practical policy solutions,"" including withholding federal funds to universities that violate the civil rights of Jewish students and ""giving Israel whatever tools they need to dismantle Hamas and release the hostages,"" while the Biden-Harris administration and Harris' presidential campaign ""have done nothing.""

""They haven't earned our vote. They've ignored our questions or they've given us plainly contradictory answers. And they're taking our votes for granted,"" he said of the Harris campaign. ""So American Jewry, listen up. We will be the deciding factor in this election. There are enough of us in Michigan, in Arizona, in Georgia, in Nevada to really sway this election.""

Because Biden won states like Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by small margins of between 13,000 to 30,000 votes in the 2020 election, and Jewish Americans make up anywhere from 1 to 3% of the population in those states, Kestenbaum said Jewish voters ""will be the crucial deciding factor"" in 2024. According to Kestenbaum, Trump is on track to receive the most Jewish votes for any Republican presidential nominee since President Dwight Eisenhower, which he credits to the Trump campaign as having ""really been courting the Jewish vote in a way that the Harris campaign just never has.""

JEWISH COLLEGE STUDENT: TOO OFTEN STUDENTS AT HARVARD ARE TAUGHT NOT HOW TO THINK, BUT WHAT TO THINK

""Jewish Americans will be pivotal in this election,"" Kestenbaum said. ""What I would urge the Jewish communities across the country, what I would urge my community, is we know what our issues are.""

""And I urge you, if you care about those policy prescriptions, if you care about the releasing of the hostages, you care about the strengthening of the U.S.-Israel relationship, you care about combating antisemitism on our college campuses, just look at the facts. Look at the data,"" he said. ""Harris has not outlined anything she would do specifically to alleviate those concerns. President Trump has. I get we don't like his persona. I get we don't like many of his policies. But at the end of the day, we are facing an existential issue. And I think there's only one viable choice, and that's President Trump.""

Kestenbaum said when he spoke to the RNC in July, he ad-libbed significant portions of his speech from the teleprompter to omit the parts explicitly endorsing Trump because he wanted to show he was ""bipartisan"" and keep an open mind before attending the Democratic National Convention in Chicago the next month. It took him two hours to get back to his seat after addressing the RNC because so many people came up to him with messages of support and prayers for the hostages who remained held in Gaza, he said.

Kestenbaum said he told DNC leadership that if they didn't want to amplify him at the convention, then at least consider amplifying other Jewish students ""who are fighting for their civil rights on college campuses, who are experiencing unprecedented antisemitism, and we never got a response.""

When he first testified before the House Education and the Workforce Committee about his experiences of antisemitism on Harvard's campus after Oct. 7, Kestenbaum said ""it was pretty remarkable that the majority of the Democratic leadership didn't even show up, and then the ranking Democratic member, Bobby Scott, he used his opening remarks to criticize Republicans for focusing on antisemitism. 'We need to be combating Islamophobia. We need to be combatting sexism,' which is true in theory, but had nothing to do with the reality on the ground and what we were there to testify on.""

""And I didn't want to say anything. I want it to be bipartisan or even nonpartisan. But these incidents just kept on happening. And whether it was the House Judiciary Committee ranking member, Democrat Jerry Nadler, falling asleep when I was giving testimony, it was deeply hurtful and offensive,"" Kestenbaum said. ""And again, I didn't want to say these things because I'm a Democrat and I went to the Democratic convention with an open mind and also with a mission to sort of change my party, to steer them into it, into a direction that would be more palpable for me and American Jewry. And it was very clear that at least for this election in 2024, they're either unable or unwilling to make serious inroads with the American Jewish community. And that's a direct result of them taking us for granted for decades.""

He said he is still a registered Democrat and ""is not ready to throw in the towel yet,"" but he can't decide why the Democratic Party is increasingly shifting toward more anti-Israel rhetoric.

""The state of Israel is a progressive issue. I mean, this is a place where not only can LGBTQ individuals be full members of society, but they serve in Israeli parliament,"" he said. ""This is a hotbed of democracy in an otherwise volatile, regressive region of the world. Israel is a vital ally that provides intelligence gathering to the United States. So why are we de-legitimizing? Why are we demoting a staunchly progressive ally? And I can't understand why my Democratic Party insist that this is proper politics.""

He also took issue with Harris for skipping Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's speech to Congress earlier this year, and for what he categorized as inadequate policy proposals on the Israel-Hamas war that the Democratic nominee finally added to her campaign website this week 50 days after entering the race.

""If Kamala Harris is working around the clock to secure a cease-fire deal and the return of the hostages, then I would shudder to think what four more years would do because she is not working around the clock. And if she is, she's doing a pretty crappy job at that,"" Kestenbaum told Fox News Digital. ""She does not deserve our support. She does not deserve our votes. It's also telling that after 50 days of having zero policies, she doesn't outline policy. She outlines aspirations and goals. Nothing. Nothing that she said on her website, in the one interview she has given, talks about the dismantling of Hamas as a terrorist organization.""

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

""If a cease fire was agreed to, Hamas would still be in power,"" he continued. ""It is laughable to say that she is working around the clock when we know that President Biden has been eating ice cream on the beaches of Delaware for almost the entirety of the summer. And if she is working around the clock, then as I said, she's doing a bad job. And why would we want her to continue to work around the clock for four years when she can't even get the job done now? So we don't need what I like to call the Beatle-Juicing of a cease fire, simply stating it three times and hoping that it'll appear. We need bold action. Under her leadership, under her watch, 45 Americans were killed in the Middle East, eight American hostages are still being held, and she talks nothing about dismantling this terrorist organization to prevent this from ever happening again.""

Harris' website mentions Israel under a subsection titled, ""Stand With Our Allies, Stand Up to Dictators, and Lead on the World Stage,"" where the campaign promises Harris ""will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to protect U.S. forces and interests from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups."" It goes on to say Harris ""will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself, and she will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself"" and she and Biden ""are working to end the war in Gaza, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination."" The campaign vows the vice president and Biden ""are working around the clock to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done."""
"The risk of another 9/11 is greater than ever, thanks to these Biden-Harris policies",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/the-risk-of-another-9-11-greater-than-ever-thanks-biden-harris-policies,2024-09-11T11:12:30Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Last December, FBI Director Wray told Congress he'd never in his career seen so many threats against the United States as he did then. There were ""blinking lights everywhere,"" he said, a reference to a chapter in the 9/11 Commission Report's titled ""The System Was Blinking Red.""

Nine months later, as we mark the 23rd anniversary of the horrific terrorist strike that left 2,977 American dead, the chances of a repeat attack are just as high - if not higher.

This is a direct result of the Biden-Harris administration's actions and inactions, which have left America less secure at home and at grave risk abroad.

For example, as the president and vice president took office in 2021, Iran-backed actors found they could launch attacks with near impunity. According to U.S. Central Command, from 2021 until March 2023, Iran-backed proxies launched ""about 78"" attacks on U.S. force in Iraq and Syria, and faced a response only three times.

BIDEN-HARRIS CAN'T LEAD AND IT EMBOLDENS OUR ENEMIES

Since then, attacks by Iranian proxies on U.S. forces have only escalated further, with more than 230 attacks on U.S. personnel in Iraq, Syria and Jordan in 2023 alone, more than any year during the Trump administration.

Similar policy results are evident in the Red Sea, where the oil tanker Sounion is currently leaking oil as a result of undeterred Houthi attacks, constituting a grave environmental disaster and raising global energy prices. And it could get worse - the Houthi attack on the Sounion may cause the largest-ever ship-sourced oil spill.

The policies of the Biden-Harris administration have provided unprecedented resources to terrorist organizations and to Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism. Despite the collective counsel of military leaders and his Cabinet, President Biden and Vice President Harris directed the disastrous withdrawal from Afghanistan.

KAMALA HARRIS PRESIDENCY WOULD UNDERMINE US IN THIS KEY REGION

The result: 13 American service members died and control of the country reverted to the Taliban, along with tens of billions of dollars of abandoned equipment and infrastructure. It was the first of 11 diplomatic facilities - a record - abandoned by the Biden-Harris administration.

On the 20th anniversary of the 9/11 attacks, we handed the world's largest terrorist sanctuary back to those we wrested it from. Worse, the Biden-Harris administration continues to fund the terrorist Taliban regime to whom al Qaeda has pledged its fealty. As one of the many who participated in the initial response to 9/11, it is especially grievous, knowing the price paid and appreciating that others may be called to respond against an adversary we equipped.

Today, ISIS is resurgent in Afghanistan and Africa and has claimed external attacks in Russia and France. Taylor Swift's European concert tour was abruptly curtailed as a result of credible threats. Al Qaeda's leader, Saif al-Adl, who fled Kabul after our invasion in October 2001, now resides in Iran as a guest of the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism.

KAMALA HARRIS LACKS THE MINIMUM SKILLS SET TO BE PRESIDENT

Iran itself has been the greatest beneficiary of Biden-Harris largesse. The administration has provided the regime unprecedented access to resources, nearly $100 billion since 2021. This has fueled its nuclear program, regional terrorism, and assassination attempts against former President Trump and former administration officials responsible for bankrupting them and confronting the threats of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps. And it has accelerated Iran's ballistic missile and drone programs.

In April 2021, the Biden-Harris administration reversed Trump's decision to cease funding the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, ignoring the evidence that UNWRA provided support to Hamas.

The Biden-Harris policies of appeasement have led Iran and its Axis of Resistance to engage in non-stop attacks against U.S., Israeli and partners interests, which spiked beginning in 2021 and accelerated after the horrific attacks of Oct. 7, 2023, when 32 Americans were killed - the deadliest terrorist attacks against the U.S. since 9/11.

BIDEN'S MORAL EQUIVALENCY BETWEEN ISRAEL AND THE PALESTINIANS WILL RESULT IN FAILURE -- AGAIN

Three U.S. soldiers were killed in Jordan by Iranian-sponsored proxies in January 2024. After the death of Hamas leader Ismail Hanieyah in Tehran, U.S. forces were attacked in Iraq and Syria, resulting in seven casualties without a response. American Hersh Goldberg-Polin's body was recovered on Aug. 31 after his brutal execution by Hamas. Seven Americans remain Hamas hostages.

That's not all, sadly. The Biden-Harris administration has also systemically dismantled our border security, resulting in the entry of some 12 million illegal immigrants, 1,800 individuals listed on the terrorist watchlist (that we know of), and 70,000 to 80,000 Special Interest Aliens each year from dangerous countries.

In May, two were arrested after attempting to breach the Marine Corps Base in Quantico. In June, eight Tajiks affiliated with ISIS were detained in Los Angeles, Philadelphia and New York City. In August, the FBI indicted a Pakistani man attempting to assassinate the former president and other former American officials.

Decades of neglect and the current administration's dismantling of global deterrence invites aggression and courts disaster. The recent Congressional Commission on the National Defense Strategy reaffirmed the conclusions of Heritage's 10th Annual Index of U.S. Military Strength, concluding our military's capability and capacity is insufficient to deter and respond to the growing threats arrayed against us.

Twenty-three years ago, systemic structural issues, along with the fact that we ignored abundant warning signs, led to the worst terrorist attack in our history. Today it's clear that we're at greater risk at home and abroad. Yet the threats we face have been appeased, ignored, resourced, and allowed unprecedented access to our homeland via an open border under the Biden-Harris administration.

Trump's administration confronted the threat of ISIS by defeating its caliphate and killing its leader. He stood up to Tehran, bankrupting its military and eliminating its most capable leader, Qassem Soleimani. He also closed our border and prevented terrorist infiltration.

The contrast between the two administrations' records could not be more clear."

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

DONALD TRUMP (R), FORMER U.S. PRESIDENT & 2024 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: She was in charge of the border. It's the worst border in the history of the world. There's never been a country that allowed 21 million people to come in over a three-year period.

BREAM (on camera): Hello from FOX News in Washington.

Here's a look at some of your headlines:

A manhunt underway this morning in southeastern Kentucky after several people were hurt in a shooting and a crash on I-75. The sheriff's office says five people were shot, all are in stable condition, two other people were injured in a vehicle crash during all the confusion. Authorities do not think the gunfire was sparked by road rage. The search for the shooter resumed at daybreak.

Hundreds of thousands of protesters took to the streets in Tel Aviv this weekend, calling for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to reach an agreement with Hamas to release the rest of the Israeli hostages.

And former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are gearing up for the ABC presidential debate on Tuesday. In a moment, we'll bring in two senators to discuss the stakes, Texas Republican John Cornyn and Connecticut Democrat Chris Murphy.

But, first, we're going to give you some live team coverage of the campaign. Alexis McAdams live in Pittsburgh following the Harris team, but we begin with Rich Edson live in Hudson, Wisconsin with the Trump team.

Hey, Rich.

RICH EDSON, FOX NEWS SENIOR NATIONAL CORRESPONDENT: Hi, Shannon.

Former President Donald Trump's final campaign event before Tuesday's debate, at least that's on his schedule, it was a rally here in Wisconsin part of the northern Midwest blue wall the Democrats will likely have to defend if they want to maintain control of the White House.

The president began the rally. His airplane flew a few hundred feet above the tarmac at Mosinee, Wisconsin, a conservative area, about 90-minute drive west of Green Bay. In a speech lasting 100 minutes, the former president said he'd raise tariffs, secure the border and have the war in Ukraine finished, done and settled before Inauguration Day.

He touted his VP pick, Senator J.D. Vance, and Robert F. Kennedy Jr. who suspended his campaign to endorse Trump.

He called the current administration stupid and corrupt.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: He is the worst president in history. She will be worse than him. She will be worse than him, and Trump is never wrong. I am never ever wrong.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

EDSON: Trump's been outlining plans for the economy. On top of tariffs, he's pushing a new commission on government efficiency led by Elon Musk. He says he also wants to cut regulations, in taxes. Democrats say his proposals are little more than a giveaway to the rich.

Now, we asked the Trump campaign how the former president is preparing for Tuesday's debate, campaign official responded, what's debate prep? Shannon?

BREAM: Okay, we'll see how that pans out.

Rich Edson, reporting from Hudson, Wisconsin, thank you.

Joining us now, Alexis McAdams, live in Pittsburgh where the prep is a little bit different.

Hello, Alexis.

ALEXIS MCADAMS, FOX NEWS CORRESPONDENT: That's right, Shannon. Trump might not be preparing and locked away in a room. He might be at rallies, but that's not the case here in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where Kamala Harris, the vice president, has been in a hotel for a few days, really hunkering down and trying to prep to get ready to take on Donald Trump on the debate stage on Tuesday.

She basically said it's like cramming for finals, right? Where you can't wait to get out and the getting out part was the best part. Watch.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: Being at this spice store I finally got out of the debate prep, to look at these spices, best part of debate prep so far.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCADAMS: But it was not just a visit to any spice store, Shannon. The vice president stopped at Penzeys Spices in downtown Pittsburgh. Penzeys is known for posting attacks about the GOP. The nationwide chain even offered a discount the other month to celebrate Trump's indictments, sending this out in an email, saying: Re-indicted and it feels so good, and calling that spice ""Justice"".

The Trump team firing back about that stop, saying: Sorry, Kamala, scary spice is already taken.

Despite being at that shop Harris says America is ready to move on from political attacks.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: Look, it's time to turn the page on the divisiveness. It's time to bring our country together, charting a new way forward.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCADAMS: Harris also thanking Vice President Dick Cheney and his daughter Liz Cheney for their endorsement.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: I think that what they both as leaders who are well respected are making an important statement that it's okay and if not important to put country above party, and I'm honored to have their support.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

MCADAMS: Ahead of the debate, the Harris campaign says they're not happy with some of ABC's rules, including muted microphones, which it claims will benefit Donald Trump, saying this, quote: We understand that Donald Trump is at risk to skip the debate altogether if we don't do this preferred format. We don't want to jeopardize this debate, so for that reason, we accept this full set of rules.

But they don't seem too happy about it.

Back out here live in Pittsburgh, Shannon, Trump won the coin flip, so he'll get the final word at the debate. We'll have to see what happens -- Shannon.

BREAM: All right. Alexis McAdams from Pittsburgh, thank you so much.

Joining us now, Texas Republican Senator John Cornyn.

Welcome to ""FOX News Sunday"".

SEN. JOHN CORNYN (R-TX): Great to be with you.

BREAM: So I know last year during the primary season, you had some concerns about whether President Trump was the right way forward for the party. You wanted to know whether he can expand beyond his fervent base which is clearly sticking with him.

Do you think he's done enough to build a coalition outside of that? What does he need to do Tuesday night?

CORNYN: Well, I think he needs to let Kamala Harris talk, something she's been reluctant to do unless she's reading a teleprompter. And I think -- you know, we've seen the polls very close, but mainly, she's coming off of this -- as James Carville called it -- a sugar high, after the coup d'etat that was committed against Joe Biden, and then, of course, the convention.

So I'm looking forward to a repetition of the good debate performance that President Trump had with President Biden and I think -- I think he's up to it.

BREAM: So after that change at the top of the ticket, there's been a lot of new enthusiasm, new fundraising and there is talk about how that's impacting down ballot.

""Politico"" says that Republicans are starting to get a little concerned about the fundraising gap, saying this: Panic is starting to set in. The only thing preventing us from having a great night in November is the massive financial disparity our party currently faces. That's from the executive director of the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

He says: Unless something changes drastically in the next weeks, we will lose winnable seats.

Are you worried about this down ballot impact on efforts by the GOP to retake the Senate?

CORNYN: Well, fundraising is important, but so are the issues, so are the quality of the candidates. And I think we have an outstanding group of candidates running for the Senate. I'm optimistic about our chances to regain the majority, and I hope they have enough money to defend themselves and to talk about what they are for, what they would do if elected and I'm confident they will.

But, yeah, the money is just astronomical. It just blows my mind.

BREAM: It really is. I mean, when you watch she's taking in, the millions that have come in just at the presidential race, hundreds of millions just the last few weeks.

Of course, you were in the running to replace Mitch McConnell as the Senate's top Republican. What will your priorities be should you achieve that post and how might that differ if you're dearing (ph) -- dealing with a Harris-Walz administration versus a Trump-Vance administration?

CORNYN: Well, when President Trump is reelected along with my colleague J.D. Vance, I expect we'll be helping the administration pass their agenda and I don't see a lot of daylight between what Republicans in the Senate want to do or know we need to do, things like reauthorize the expiring provisions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. We need to reestablish ourself, our nation, as the preeminent leader in the world when it comes to national security matters under President Biden. Our friends don't trust us and our enemies don't fear us. It was the opposite under President Trump.

So we'll be working very closely with the administration to accomplish their priorities, and I don't really see, as I said, a lot of daylight between what my colleagues in the Senate want to do next year.

We're going to have to also though look at the -- look at the debt. We're now spending more money on interest on the national debt than we are on defense.

And, right now, the world has gotten more dangerous, and most dangerous since World War II. So we have a lot of heavy lifting to do and it'll help the more -- the bigger our majority is.

BREAM: So let's talk about a couple things you mentioned there, the tax cuts. You know, Democrats from the vice president on down say that they are -- President Trump, a rich guy, giving cuts to rich people. And when you talk about the debt that those kinds of tax cuts actually leave a revenue lag for the federal government and contribute to things like the debt.

CORNYN: Well, the American people are not under taxed. The federal government spends too much.

BREAM: Do you mean (ph) both parties do that?

CORNYN: Well, there's some complicity there. Certainly during COVID-19, there was a lot of bipartisan efforts to keep our economy afloat and to help deal with this pandemic.

But there's been a lot of partisan spending, gasoline really on the inflation fire, $2.7 trillion in partisan spending bills post-COVID. But I think we're at an inflection point.

Part of the problem is we spend money in ways that are not just appropriations. We spend $1.8 trillion in the tax code. There's about $200 billion alone that's spent through the child tax credit and the earned income tax credit.

I'm for those but I do think they need to be offset. They need to be paid for. And so, we need to look at all of that $6 trillion in federal spending and determine what our priorities are as a nation. I think that's our job.

BREAM: Well, and we also are about to get to the end of government funding facing another continuing resolution sort of that short-term financial band-aid. It looks like the House is going to send it over with the SAVE Act attached, which basically says if you're going to go register to vote in federal elections, you have to show proof that you're a U.S. citizen.

A number of Senate Democrats have said that's dead on arrival. It's not going to happen.

How worried are you about this thing pinging back and forth and facing a shutdown? Is that going to hurt Republicans in, you know, this final stretch of an election?

CORNYN: Well, Shannon, in a sane world, the SAVE Act would be non- controversial. It essentially is a national voter ID, and I would think both parties and everybody would be interested in protecting the integrity of the ballot, making sure that people only legally qualified to vote do so.

But it's become a partisan issue which is amazing to me, and -- but I don't think there's going to be a shutdown. We'll see -- the House will have to move first and they got to get to 218. And then it comes to the Senate, I hope we'll have a debate and an opportunity to vote on it.

And I can't imagine that Senator Schumer is excited about having his incumbents who were running tough Senate races voting against a bill that just says you have to be an American citizen to vote.

BREAM: That'll be in the next couple of weeks we think.

But I want to touch down the border because, clearly, Texas bears a huge brunt of this and what's going on there. The vice president though has been touting her work. She says she -- she was tough on cartels and gangs and she's litigated against these people, held them accountable.

She also said this in her DNC speech:

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

HARRIS: Last year, Joe and I brought together Democrats and conservative Republicans to write the strongest border bill in decades, the Border Patrol endorsed it. But Donald Trump believes a border deal would hurt his campaign. So he ordered his allies in Congress to kill the deal.

(BOOING)

HARRIS: Well, I refuse to play politics with our security.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: I won't be surprised if your colleague, Senator Chris Murphy, brings this up when we talk to him next. It has been a messaging talking point that has stuck for Democrats, this idea that President Trump is the one who kept the border problem alive because he told you guys not to vote for it.

CORNYN: Well, that's just false is a short answer to that. And the truth is that the Biden-Harris administration has spent three and a half years dismantling all of the Trump border security policies that produced a far better outcome at the border.

I was just down in the Rio Grande Valley a couple weeks ago with Senator John Boozman from Arkansas, and the way the Border Patrol explained it to me, they said, this is a shell game.

Now, the federal government if you use the CBP One app, Customs and Border Protection One app, you can schedule an appointment at a port of entry, and the Biden administration -- the Biden-Harris administration will simply usher you into the United States and give you a work permit.

That is a huge magnet on continued illegal immigration. So we need to return to the policies of the previous administration. Remain in Mexico just is one of them, but this is all a shell game in my view.

BREAM: We will see and whoever wins White House, House, Senate, whether it's divided or together, there hasn't been much progress on the issue of immigration. So, we'll see.

Thank you for stopping by. Always good to see you, Senator.

CORNYN: Thanks, Shannon.

BREAM: All right. Up next, less than 60 days until Election Day, both Vice President Harris and former President Trump revealing new details about their economic plans this week. We're going to bring in Harris-Walz campaign surrogate, Senator Chris Murphy, to discuss what Harris is proposing and whether she's actually breaking from President Biden. He's next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

BREAM: Ahead of Tuesday's showdown, Vice President Kamala Harris is in practice sessions sharpening her attack lines against the former president as a brand new ""New York Times/Siena"" poll shows the race in a dead heat.

Joining me now, Harris-Walz Campaign Surrogate, Connecticut Senator Chris Murphy, member of the Harris-Walz Campaign's National Advisory Board. Welcome back. Good to see you.

SEN. CHRIS MURPHY (D-CT): Yeah, great to be here.

BREAM: OK. So we're all looking at this debate. There is a lot at stake for both of these candidates, given how tight this race is. Mark Penn, longtime Democratic strategist, worked for both the Clintons, has this to say. He says, ""One interview. One debate. Some rah rah stump speech you read over and over. And voila, you have a 50% chance of being president."" He goes on to say, ""No two years of primaries, coalition building, no detailed policy development, and no daily press briefings or tests of leadership. It's only the most important job in the world, with a $6 trillion budget and thousands of nuclear weapons."" He says, ""real democracy calls for more debates, more interviews.""

Listen, the policy section of the website remains blank last I checked. So when are we going to get more from the Vice President?

MURPHY: Well, I think you have heard the Vice President roll out several very important detailed policy proposals. She just proposed a massive tax cut for small businesses. She's proposed a massive investment in housing to bring the cost of rent and mortgages down for Americans. She's going to go after price gougers to try to make sure that we continue to drive inflation down. She wants an expansion of the child tax credit. She's investing in the middle class.

She's talking about an opportunity agenda where everybody has the chance to succeed, which is very different than Donald Trump's agenda. Donald Trump has made it very clear, if you put him back in power, he's going to think about only one group of people, and that's his friends at Mar-a-Lago, another massive tax cut for the richest people in America.

So I don't doubt that Kamala Harris will continue to roll out proposals to invest in small businesses, to invest in the middle class. I think the contrast is pretty striking between a candidate on the Democratic side who wants to make sure that we grow the economy from the middle out. And Donald Trump, who still believes in this magical thinking of trickle-down economics, where if you give him and his friends billions of dollars, eventually that'll find its way down to everybody else. That's just not how it works.

BREAM: Well, you know there's analysis. These are IRS numbers, so we assume that's neutral data, and they say that every class of taxpayer benefited from the round of tax cuts that came under the Trump administration, that it wasn't just the top 1%, that it really did benefit everybody who pays taxes in any way.

We've also got, this week, in talking about the Vice President's economic rollout, one of the skeptics of her plans wrote this over the ""Washington Free Beacon,"" listening to Harris extol the virtues of enterprise, you'd have no idea that she cast the deciding vote on the spending splurge that drove historic inflation, that her administration has imposed almost $1.4 trillion in regulations, and that she wants to weaken right-to-work laws and wants Congress to pass $5 trillion of new taxes over 10 years.

MURPHY: Well, listen, let's compare the economic record of Donald Trump against the economic record of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Under this administration, we have seen record job growth in this country. We have manufacturing booming, unemployment at a record low.

When Donald Trump left office, we had unemployment at a record high. He told us if --

BREAM: We were in the middle of the pandemic, to be fair.

MURPHY: We were going to rebuild the manufacturing sector under Donald Trump. We lost manufacturers' jobs. So there is a clear contrast between Donald Trump's record as president where our economy fell to pieces and Kamala Harris and Joe Biden --

BREAM: In the middle of the pandemic.

MURPHY: -- who have rebuilt the economy. And by the way, driven down inflation at a rate faster than all of our other high-income nation competitors.

BREAM: But, again, President Trump handed off, he will argue I'm sure Tuesday night, an inflation rate of 1.4% in the middle of a pandemic, the majority of jobs lost during the pandemic had come back. We spiked to 9, more than 9%. I mean 40 years we haven't seen those kinds of numbers.

MURPHY: Correct and that happened in every single high-income economy because coming out of the pandemic no country had the supply chains sufficient to be able to withstand the surge in demand, but it is also true that over the last four years, inflation has come down faster in the United States than those other countries.

GDP has grown at a faster rate than those other countries and today we are sitting in an economy where anybody who wants a job can get one because we have record low unemployment.

Donald Trump is advertising that he is going to bring back the same kind of chaotic economic policies the same investment in the top 1% in corporations that helped drive our economy into a ditch during his time in office.

BREAM: OK, again, what he's going to say is poverty was down, home ownership was up, inflation was at 1.4, gas was at 230 something a gallon. I mean he's going to maybe be happy to stand on his policies. And when we poll people they tell us they were doing better under President Trump than they've done under this administration. So they do have a head-to-head comparison.

And on this issue of inflation and where we go from here, there was a study out this summer from a bunch of folks including some MIT professors who said, the research shows that mathematically the overwhelming driver of a burst of inflation in 2022 was federal spending not the supply chain.

I mean, I'm no MIT scholar so I'll defer to them. But he says it was the massive spending that as I talked about with Senator Cornyn, people on both sides of the aisle voted for under this administration. But there were tough things where the Vice President was the tie-breaking vote. She says proudly on the Inflation Reduction Act which President Biden said this week they shouldn't have named it that because that's not what it was.

MURPHY: Although, look at the chart, the minute we pass the Inflation Reduction Act, inflation started to decrease at stunning levels in this country. And by the way, that piece of legislation is growing manufacturing jobs all over the country, is cutting prescription drug costs for senior citizens.

I'm proud of the fact that we are doing our part to try to clean up the environment. I'm proud of the fact that that legislation finally took on the drug industry and said we're not going to put seniors in a position where they go bankrupt because of their prescription drug costs.

Donald Trump was in office for four years he did nothing to take power away from the drug industry. Prescription drug prices skyrocketed under Donald Trump. The Inflation Reduction Act for the first time did something about transferring power from the drug industry to regular people. That's the difference between these two candidates.

Donald Trump is going to put power in the hands of the big corporations. He's promised the big oil industry that he will do anything they want as long as they donate a billion dollars to his reelection campaign.

Kamala Harris says that he's going to continue to take power away from the big oil companies, the big drug companies, the big insurance companies and put that power back in the hands of regular people.

BREAM: Well, one of his -- his arguing points about the economy is he does want to enable, you know, the industry oil and gas industry to do more production. He says we shouldn't be dependent on places that don't have our best interests at heart.

MURPHY: So ask yourself this, were we producing more domestic oil and gas under Donald Trump or under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris? We're producing more domestic oil and gas today under Joe Biden and Kamala Harris than under Donald Trump.

What we are also doing is making historic new investments in renewable energy so we're also bringing much more wind power and solar power onto the grid. What Kamala Harris and Joe Biden have shown is that you can do both. You can continue to develop and explore for oil here in the United States and you can do our part to solve climate change.

Under Donald Trump, we weren't doing either. We were drilling for less oil. We were exploring less gas and we weren't doing anything about the climate crisis.

BREAM: OK let's talk about something else the Vice President put out this week which was raising the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%. The Joint Committee on Taxation bipartisan congressional entity says that actually would mean even the lowest income Americans, I mean, they would be paying higher taxes. Because of that they say, in reason, puts it this way:

""Higher corporate taxes are passed along to consumers, employees, and investors in the form of high prices, lower wages and lower investment returns. If you buy things, have a job or save for retirement, higher corporate income taxes will fall on you no matter how many times Biden or Harris try to pretend otherwise.""

MURPHY: Yeah, I mean, this -- this is obviously the argument made by the billionaire class and the corporate class --

BREAM: OK but by the Joint Committee on Taxation.

MURPHY: If you raise taxes on us, ultimately we will just pass those down to other people. Some people want tax fairness in this country. They are sick and tired of these massive American companies paying 0% tax rates. That's what some of the biggest companies in the country were paying, zero under Donald Trump.

There's nobody in this country Republicans or Democrats that thinks that's fair except for Donald Trump. So yes Kamala Harris believes that if you're a corporation in this country you should pay some taxes. Yes, she believes that if you're making a billion dollars in this economy, you should help pay for our schools. You should help try to make our communities safer.

I don't think Americans believe this argument that by raising taxes by a couple percentage points on a handful of billionaires that, that ultimately is going to ruin the economy.

Kamala Harris also says that she's going to cut taxes on small businesses. She's going to use the money that we raise in higher taxes for billionaires and transfer that to tax cuts for small businesses and low-income taxpayers.

BREAM: All of that's got -- it's got to work out somewhere on the ledger and so that's going to mean more taxes and Joint Taxation Committee says that falls to everyone. So, we will watch to see, if she wins, what you guys do in Congress and how you handle it. But thank you for coming in.

MURPHY: Thanks.

BREAM: Always good to see you.

MURPHY: Appreciate it.

BREAM: All right with the race so tight, Tuesday's debate could be make or break for these candidates. Next up, we've got two debate prep experts who've got some final words of advice for these two. And our panel is here to break down what we're learning about the Trump and Harris economic plans and how they're actually going to impact your wallets. Next.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

TRUMP: It's a disgrace. And honestly, you ought to be ashamed of yourself.

UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE: Secretary Clinton.

HILLARY CLINTON, FORMER FIRST LADY OF THE UNITED STATES AND FORMER PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE: It's just awfully good that someone with the temperament of Donald Trump is not in charge of the law in our country.

TRUMP: Because you'd be in jail.

HARRIS: To hear you talk about the reputations of two United States Senators who have built their reputations and career on the segregation of race in this country.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: Just sampling of how this year's White House contenders have tackled their debate opponents in the past. So will Tuesday be more about substance or style?

I sat down earlier with two campaign veterans who've prepped presidential candidates for this, the debate stage.

(BEGIN VIDEOTAPE)

BREAM: Joining me now, former Obama campaign manager, Jim Messina. And GOP communications consultant, Brett O'Donnell, who has prepped several presidential candidates for their debates.

All right. It comes down to this week. This may be the only meeting between these two we get on the stage.

""New York Times"" puts it this way. ""The debate in Philadelphia on Tuesday will be, by far, the longest unscripted setting for Ms. Harris of her candidacy. A high-risk encounter against an opponent with little regard for decorum.""

Jim, who's got more at stake on Tuesday?

JIM MESSINA, FORMER OBAMA CAMPAIGN MANAGER: Oh, she does. I mean, let's be honest, you know, Donald Trump is the best counterpuncher in the history of American politics.

This is his seventh presidential debate over three cycles, and this is her first. And so we're in a tight race. It was -- it was under 60 days by the time we get to the debate. And she has still a bunch of swing voters who don't have an opinion of her or waiting to see who she is and what she's going to stand for. So, you know, I think the advantage is to Trump going into this. But, you know, as we all know, all strategy goes out the moment you get on that debate stage.

BREAM: Well, and I think it's fascinating. These two have never met face to face. Going to a presidential debate for your first meeting is a little bit intimidating. They've got different prep strategies. The vice president holding up in Pittsburgh for several days to hone what she's been working on.

President Trump and his team saying, he does debate prep every day simply by engaging in hostile interviews and doing these press conferences.

But, Brett, I want to play something about what he said he plans to do. Here's President Trump.

TRUMP: When I had Biden, you and I had the same discussion. And I let him talk. I'm going to let her talk because, you know.

BREAM: So, do you think he will be able to just simply sit back and let her explain her positions, get herself maybe into a hole she's got to dig out of?

BRETT O'DONNELL, GOP COMMUNICATIONS CONSULTANT: Well, he did in the first debate, especially for the first 30 minutes. That's where Biden done did himself. I mean, Biden actually fulfilled the one principle of presidential debates.

You can't win an election in one, but you can lose it. Joe Biden did it and it was because the president was more disciplined, particularly in those first 30 minutes.

BREAM: Well, and as for her debate, NBC News reports this about her strategy. They say, ""Harris and her team are focusing on homing in on how to needle Trump to rattle him. Another source said the Harris team plans to emphasize what it views as Trump's advanced age and lack of details on policy proposals.""

And, Jim, that's -- obviously, we've got different optics than we did about the June debate where President Trump and his team had spent, you know, tens of millions of dollars and invested in this strategy that President Biden was too old and unable to move forward in his campaign. Are the tables turned now?

MESSINA: Well, look, let me make you one guarantee, your first guarantee of this T.V. appearance. There's no way Donald Trump is going to sit back and let her just talk to country about what she wants and what she wants to do.

And the reason is, you know, we're in a tight race. He is -- he is stuck. He can't move over 47 percent. And so he's got to bring her down to him. And so what she wants to do is exactly that.

Her job -- she has two jobs. One is to look at the American public and be presidential. And the second is to draw a very clear contrast between him and her.

I used to say to Obama, if it's a referendum on you, we'll lose. If it's a choice between you and Romney or you and McCain, we will win. And so I think she's going into that exactly.

And Donald Trump, I promise you, is not going to sit there and let her have at it.

BREAM: All right. We'll see. Because it's 90 minutes. It's hard to resist the urge when both of these, you know, are, I would say, have known how to be combative fighter. She's been a federal prosecutor. You see him each time that he gets out there and defends his position.

Here's what we know about the rules. Obviously, no live audience, no opening statements, no props allowed. And candidates' microphones will be muted when their opponent is on the clock, a stipulation that's created controversy in recent days. The two teams fighting about this.

In fact, the Harris campaign, one of the senior advisors sent a letter to ABC which is hosting the event saying this. ""Vice President Harris, a former prosecutor will be fundamentally disadvantaged by this format which will serve to shield Donald Trump from direct exchanges with the vice president. We suspect this is the primary reason for his campaign's insistence on muted microphones.""

But, Brett, a lot of people who support President Trump actually felt it worked for him this particular rule in that Biden debate.

O'DONNELL: It did work for him from the first debate, but I do think that that message from the Harris campaign is nothing more than a head fake. It's meant to, again, bait the president into a personal debate.

I mean, I think the Harris campaign would love nothing more than if this debate was all about personality and persona and not about policy. Because as long as the debates focused on policy, that means Kamala Harris has to explain the differences between Kamala Harris four years ago and Kamala Harris now, which I think is an opportunity for President Trump to attack her on.

If the debate is about personality, and she can get under his skin, I think that is much better territory for the -- for the Harris campaign.

BREAM: OK. Real quick because we're almost out of time. I want to ask you both the same question. What's your, one, best piece of advice for, Brett, for you, for the Trump campaign?

O'DONNELL: Keep the debate focused on policy, not about persona.

BREAM: And, Jim, your piece of advice to the Harris team.

MESSINA: It's all about future. I would write future above my little white pad on there. And I would never stop putting her in the future and him in the past. And if she does that, she'll be the president of the United States.

BREAM: All right. Jim and Brett, we know you are both be watching as we all will on Tuesday night. Thanks for your insights.

MESSINA: Thank you.

O'DONNELL: Thanks for having us.

(END VIDEOTAPE)

BREAM: All right. Let's see what our Sunday group thinks. ""USA Today"" Washington Bureau Chief, Susan Page. You'll remember, she moderated the 2020 vice presidential debates. Mary Katharine Ham, Fox News contributor and OutKick columnist. Fox News senior political analyst, Juan Williams. And Guy Benson Townhall.com political editor, Fox News contributor, and host of The Guy Benson Show. Welcome, everybody.

All right. Susan, you have a piece out about this this morning. I mean, you were the last person to moderate a debate that Kamala Harris took part in.

SUSAN PAGE, WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF, USA TODAY: That's right. Can you imagine she hasn't debated in four years? That might be a little bit of concern for them that she's rusty.

You know, in that debate, she hadn't been universally good in the primary debates that in -- that in 20 -- in the 2020 cycle, but she was good in the vice presidential debate. She was prepared and she made especially effective use of a putdown of Pence when he interrupted her. This may be one reason they wanted mics to be live.

She said, Mr. Vice President, I'm speaking. And the ""Mr. Vice President"" sounded very respectful and the, ""I'm speaking,"" made him risk looking disrespectful, if he kept talking over her.

BREAM: Well, we know how much is at stake. ""The New York Times"" today has brand-new polling saying this. The national poll of likely voters found Mr. Trump leading Miss Harris, 48 to 47 percent. The new poll underscores the risks and potential rewards particularly facing Miss Harris on Tuesday night when she and Trump face off.

I mean, Guy, it couldn't be any closer.

GUY BENSON, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Tight race. Trump now slightly back in the lead to that big bounce she got in ""The New York Times"" poll from the month-long euphoria fueled by the media seems to have dissipated significantly.

And, Shannon, I think the most significant data point within that poll is a question about Jim Messina who was just talking about the future, the change question. A vast majority of Americans in this poll say they want change.

And in this survey, a majority see Donald Trump as an agent of change, and a majority see her as more of the same. That should be Trump's overarching hammered point on Tuesday night.

BREAM: And we saw at the DNC, there was very good messaging casting her as the challenger and him as the incumbent, but it sounds like within this poll, people are starting to have a reality check on that particular issue.

Now, they both rolled out economic plans this week. Reuters says this, citing a Goldman Sachs report. Under a Republican sweep, or even with a divided government led by Donald Trump, economic output would take a hit next year, mostly from increased tariffs on imports and tighter immigration policies, according to Goldman. They say he's not the one for your economy.

MARY KATHARINE HAM, FOX NEWS CONTRIBUTOR: Yes. I think the tariffs are something that I personally disagree with and have some policy issues with. I think he needs to point out, look, I have a vision, she has nothing on her website.

She's giving you a hand -- a sprinkling of proposals that have been frankly widely panned, including this idea of giving individual homeowners this 25K that would up housing prices and end up hurting people.

I think that he can say, look, to the extent that he can connect the reality on the ground of what is happening right now and what people are feeling, people who are not Goldman Sachs, by the way. You can make that point about that division. He wins in the reality on the ground because he says, look what your life was like four years ago and look at it now. Compare the two. And I think that's what he has to drill down on.

BREAM: Well, and that's what this ""Hill"" opinion piece this week gets to. It says, ""If Trump's policies were so terrible, why do so many people think they were better off during his presidency? Why were small-business owners and consumers consistently more upbeat than they have been during the Biden-Harris years?""

I mean, Juan, how does she navigate that reality check that people get every day when they buy groceries?

JUAN WILLIAMS, FOX NEWS SENIOR POLITICAL ANALYST: Well, I think people have a certain nostalgia about the past.

Joe Biden's numbers have gone way up since he decided --

BREAM: Well, now that he's off the ticket.

WILLIAMS: That's what I'm saying. I think people's -- but, you know, the reality is, if you look at the numbers, the economy is better now than it was then.

So you're dealing with this kind of memory sense of things.

BREAM: OK. But what context? Just to -- just to give us a --

WILLIAMS: What the -- what the context is, Goldman Sachs, they're no left- wing organization. They're saying the economy will be better under Kamala Harris.

HAM: They're also not mom buying groceries.

WILLIAMS: And also, I think you also look at -- I think this week there was 88 top executives who came out and said, we think that the economy will spur, will boost under Kamala Harris.

And this week, Trump went before the New York Economic Club to give a speech. And it should have been, you know, given the perception that he wants to say the economy was better, it should have been a knock out for him in front of all those rich men. Instead, he delivered word salad on a question about childcare.

And my sense is, look, the job numbers are good, the stock market is good. And right now, the Federal Reserve is in a position where they're likely to raise -- I'm sorry, lower interest rates.

BREAM: Yes. Please don't say raise.

WILLIAMS: I'm sorry. Right.

Lower interest rates, which will raise, I think, opportunities for Kamala Harris to say, we have a future that's better coming under my administration.

BREAM: Well, Mary Katharine, you mentioned moms out buying groceries. You're a mom of four. That's certainly the circle that you often run in, is to hear from them about what they think.

HAM: Well, and my perspective is, if it's hurting us, I know it's hurting other people much, much more.

And it's hard to argue that the inflation, although the rate of it is falling, you're not getting back to the 1.9 that we had in January 2017, 2016, when Trump was in office, right? And this hurts people.

And your -- and when you talk about the jobs market, yet, we're adding jobs, but it's mediocre at best. And we're revising down every single month to a cumulative number that's taken a pretty big hit on those numbers.

PAGE: You know, nothing more frustrating to the Democrats than the fact that they feel that Biden and Harris do not get the credit they really deserve on the economy we have. We see a little bit of brightening of views.

But the fact is in the New York Times/Siena poll and in the USA Today/Suffolk poll, Trump continues to be preferred when it comes to handling the economy.

The change question is important. The who do you trust more to handle the economy, that is a crucial, basic question.

BENSON: Prices are up 20 percent under Biden and Harris. That's why the frustration is there because the frustration is deserved. Prices are up 20 percent. People feel that.

BREAM: All right. Just --

WILLIAMS: I think people know that we went to a coronavirus. This is what you were stressing earlier with the Senator. And that things had to be done and that this economy is the envy of the world. There's no better economy in the entire world after the virus.

BREAM: And just a quick note here, there are two cases that are out there pending. I just want to make sure, because this race is so tight, RFK Jr. trying to get off the ballots in a number of states, both Michigan and North Carolina appeals courts, they are ruled. He comes off the ballot.

Those have been now appealed to their state's supreme courts. So we stand by this week to see in these critical states where if his name is offer on that ballot, after he fought so hard to get on, now fighting to get off.

OK. Panel, don't go anywhere.

When we come back, college students back on campus and so are those anti- Israel protests. Hear from students who say the problem starts at the top. You'll hear from them next.

And we'll discuss the implications, as tensions escalate in the Middle East and here at home.

(COMMERCIAL BREAK)

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

KATIE ARYEH, BARNARD COLLEGE GRADUATE: These are protesters who are being influenced by outside organizations. The Islamic Republic of Iran is thanking them for their work. They are giving permission to these terrorists to continue their horrific acts, like murdering the American hostage, Hersh Goldberg-Polin, after he survived 11 months in captivity and torture.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: That was Barnard College graduate from our Fox Nation special ""Anti- Semitism on Campus: Back to School.""

Anti-Israel protests are starting to pop up again on college campuses as students head back to place - places like Columbia University in New York City this week. Police clashing with protesters and making arrests.

We are back now with our panel.

NBC News says this. ""Students are barely back on campus, but pro- Palestinian protests have already returned, putting a divisive issue back in the spotlight that Democrats had hoped the nomination of Vice President Kamala Harris might allow them to move beyond.""

Juan, it's not a good look.

WILLIAMS: Well, no. I mean, look, free speech is a right in our country, but there's no place for threats and intimidation and violence.

So, the thing about it is the politics, as you spotlight, Shannon, because the politics is big protests, pro-Palestinian protests, really are being used against the Harris campaign. The suggestion is that, oh, these people are more Democrats. Democrats embrace this chaos and all that.

But the Republicans have a problem with anti-Semitism. I mean this week, to see that Tucker Carlson, who spoke at the GOP convention, is giving a platform to a man who is saying that, you know, Winston Churchill was to blame for the Holocaust and the troubles during World War II, I mean that's just pathetic. That's sick! That's historical revisionism on a scale that's troubling. And I think that lots of people are starting to ask questions about this.

But in terms of the optics, if it's a big pro-Palestinian demonstration, the Republicans hope that, you know, it will be somehow a weight on the Democrats.

BREAM: Well, Mary Katharine, is it more of a problem for Democrats or Republicans, as Juan tries to make the point (ph)?

HAM: Well, one of the reasons that it can be connected to Democrats is because Tim Walz said just this week that the protesters are speaking out for all the right reasons. If you watch tape of these gatherings, yes, free speech is in action here. And the problem with colleges is they haven't been able to find the line between speech and vandalism and threats and violence. And at UCLA, blocking Jewish students from going to certain parts of campus. That was on a right-wing action happening there. But that's what I can be connected to them.

It can be connected to them also because they seem to be making, because of Walz's statement, they seem to be making political calculations about Michigan voters based upon how much they're able to come out and condemn these kind of things.

WILLIAMS: But I don't think - I think -

HAM: Although, I think Kamala Harris has had moments where she's gone there and been clear about these protesters.

WILLIAMS: I was just going to say to you that I think Walz's statement was a statement that if you look at the devastation in Gaza and the - a number of people who are dead. I don't think you have to be Republican or Democrat. You say, something is wrong here. You have a human instinct to say, can we get a deal? And you see thousands of Israelis in the street saying, let's get a deal. Let's bring the hostages home.

HAM: But if you say all the right reasons about a group of people who are carrying Hezbollah and Hamas flags and wearing masks, that is a problem. All the right reasons?

WILLIAMS: Stop the - stop the devastation!

BREAM: OK, well, Guy, we talked about the - during the commercial too, that Tim Walz is out there on the campaign trail and he did get a direct question about the death of Hersh Goldberg-Polin and said, OK, thanks, everyone, time to go. I am trying to figure out whether he didn't hear it or whether he does not want to touch that subject.

BENSON: Or any subject, right? They don't do a lot of interviews. They don't answer a lot of questions. And if you watch that particular video that you just referenced, it's - it's weird. He - he stands there. He absolutely clocks the question. You see his brain say, I'm not going to answer it. And he says, all right, thanks, everybody, and walks off with his ice cream. That's a strange response when you're asked about six hostages who have just been killed, including an American.

So, we'll see how he handles that question, if he gets something about that at the vice presidential debate, which I think we're still having. I think it's still on.

BREAM: I think it is. Yes, I hope so. We're looking forward to that one.

In the meantime, there have been protests in the streets in Tel Aviv. I mean thousands and thousands of people gathering as, Juan, you reference this, they want to deal done.

Here's a little bit of what Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is under a ton of pressure, said about trying to get there.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU, ISRAELI PRIME MINISTER: It's clear Gaza must be demilitarized. And it can only be demilitarized if the Philadelphi Corridor remains under firm control and is not a - a supply line for armaments and for terror equipment. I think that's clear to most Israelis, to all Israelis.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: Susan, this is not an easy problem or - there are no easy solutions or we'd have that cease-fire. Are - are we getting further away or closer to one of those plans (ph)?

PAGE: Here's what's clear, we're not going to have a ceasefire. We're not going to have the kind of deal that the administration has - has been hoping to deliver for some time and some points said we were very close, within days of reaching. And that's because of - of actions on both sides.

Hamas has put new conditions on Israel, and Netanyahu has not been willing to make some of the compromises that the Biden administration wanted them to do. And this is an issue that divides Democrats more than Republicans. You've seen Kamala Harris continue to endorse U.S. support for Israel, not making threats about not continuing arm shipments here, but a kind of tonal shift with Harris in which she expresses more sympathy and concern about the plight of Palestinians. So, I don't know if that's enough to bridge the gap that Democrats have on this issue.

BREAM: I want to play something too from Secretary Blinken who's been traveling in the region again as they try to push towards some kind of ceasefire. Here's what he says about everyone not getting on the same page.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ANTONY BLINKEN, SECRETARY OF STATE: Every day that goes by where it is not finalized, and the parties don't say, yes, period, is a day in which something else happens. And there is an intervening event, which simply pushes things off and runs the risk of derailing what is a - a pretty fragile apple cart.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

BREAM: Guy, do you agree, that the hopes for a ceasefire are over at this point?

BENSON: Probably because one side doesn't want one. One side wants the other side to be completely obliterated and dead. And they don't just say that, they do it. They did it on October 7th, and they just murdered some more of those hostages that they stole. So, it's really hard to talk about peace or even a temporary peace when one side overtly, explicitly doesn't want one. They're not even Hamas. They're not even at the negotiating table.

We've had this series of offers that Israelis have said yes to, and Hamas had said no every time. And I saw an ""Axios"" pieces this week saying that the administration, Biden-Harris, might finally be realizing that maybe Hamas doesn't want and deal and is not acting in good faith and it's like, well, if they're coming around to that, it's - it's very late to the party.

WILLIAMS: You know, when you started speaking, I thought you were talking about Israel when you said don't want to deal. I mean, to me, the United States, and the Israelis who are in the streets in Tel Aviv, are putting pressure on the Netanyahu government and saying, we need a deal here. We want to bring our hostages home. They're not aiming their protest at Hamas.

And what we've heard from Netanyahu, in the clip that was just played is, we are intent on keeping troops on this line there with Egypt and Israel in the Gaza. And that is the absolute must, not making a deal. And I think Netanyahu doesn't want a deal because he doesn't want to any - do any favors for the Biden administration.

HAM: Existence is an absolute must, which is why they want to hold that line.

WILLIAMS: Well, they - they will exist. Yes.

BREAM: OK, panel, thank you very much. We'll see you next Sunday.

Up next, those massive demonstrations on the streets of Tel Aviv overnight demanding the Israeli government get a deal done to get the hostages out. And three Israelis shot and killed at a key border crossing overnight. We're going to take you live to Israel, next.

BREAM: The Israeli government facing mounting pressure as called for a hostage deal intensify, as the country marks 11 months since Hamas' deadly attacks.

Joining us from Tel Aviv, Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst with the latest.

Hello, Trey.

TREY YINGST, FOX NEWS CHIEF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT: Shannon, good morning.

Organizer estimate half a million protesters gathered in the streets of Tel Aviv overnight demanding the release of Israeli hostages. The demonstration marked weekly calls for a ceasefire and hostage release deal, while putting pressure on Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Some of the protesters clashed with police and blocked the main highway that runs through Israel's second-largest city. Similar demonstrations unfolded in Jerusalem and at other locations.

(BEGIN VIDEO CLIP)

ZAHIRO SHAHAR MOR, NEPHEW OF ISRAELI HOSTAGE ABRAHAM MUNDER: As long as Netanyahu remains in power, we will keep getting hostages back in body bags. Netanyahu must be removed from power in order to save the lives of the hostages and the country itself.

(END VIDEO CLIP)

YINGST: While chances of an agreement to end the war and bring the hostages home remain low, American negotiators are drafting a new proposal this weekend, trying to close the gaps between the two sides. The latest taking point reportedly has to do with Hamas demanding the release of higher-level Palestinian prisoners in the expected exchange for Israeli captives.

While diplomatic efforts continue, Israel conducted multiple air strikes against Gaza since Friday killing at least a dozen people.

While the southern front remains active, Israel's northern front is still heating up. Dozens of rockets were fired by the Iran-backed group Hezbollah, as daily exchanges of fire are ongoing along the Israel-Lebanon border. No casualties were reported from the attack.

As if the current fronts weren't active enough, today three people were killed when a gunman crossed from Jordan along Israel's eastern border.

An Israeli strike on a Gaza humanitarian zone kills at least 19,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/g-s1-21885/israel-gaza-strike-mawasi-khan-younis,2024-09-10T19:17:22Z,"Palestinians look at the destruction following an Israeli airstrike in al-Muwasi, a designated humanitarian zone in Khan Younis, southern Gaza, on Tuesday. The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas command and control center and killed three Hamas commanders in the strike. Hamas did not confirm the deaths.

KHAN YOUNIS, Gaza Strip, and TEL AVIV, Israel -- An Israeli airstrike early Tuesday morning on an Israeli-designated humanitarian zone in southern Gaza killed 19 Palestinians and wounded 60 others, according to Gaza's ministry of health.

The Israeli military said it was targeting a Hamas command and control center in al-Muwasi, west of Khan Younis, and killed three Hamas commanders. Hamas did not confirm the deaths.

First responders told NPR it took them hours to pull dead bodies from beneath the rubble, and the health ministry said dozens were still stuck, which would contribute to a higher casualty toll.

Palestinians in Muwasi said the attack occurred between midnight and 1:00 am local time. Those in the camp said they didn't receive an evacuation order to leave before the strike. In an official statement posted on WhatsApp on Tuesday, the Israeli military did not mention giving an evacuation order. It normally says when it has ordered Palestinians to leave.

Muwasi was a chaotic scene after the strikes. Dust and rubble covered tents and cars. Personal belongings like blankets, a deflated basketball, kitchen supplies and clothing were strewn across the camp. Parents looked for their children among the rubble, and a massive crater was left by an explosion in the middle of the camp.

This isn't the first time Muwasi has been struck. In July, 90 Palestinians were killed in a strike that the Israeli military said targeted and killed top Hamas commander Mohammed Deif. Hamas denied that Deif was killed.

Palestinians were told by Israel's military in December that Muwasi was relatively safe, and that they would be able to find some resources like water and shelter. An area that was once hardly inhabited, today Muwasi is packed with hundreds of tents and tens of thousands of displaced Palestinians.

They live in squalid conditions, with little humanitarian aid reaching them because of the war.

""Nowhere is safe in Gaza,"" said 52-year old Maha al-Sha'er, whose tent was destroyed in Tuesday's strike. She said her family went to bed at 11 p.m. on Monday and were startled awake by loud booms. Sha'er said she was disoriented from the dust and explosions.

""'Where was I sleeping? Where am I?' I asked myself,"" Sha'er told NPR.

After making sure her children were safe, she looked around to find her husband, Ahmad. After searching, she saw him still alive stuck under the rubble. Sha'er said she used her bare hands to dig him out.

""I just kept screaming, 'Ahmad! Ahmad!' and digging until he got out alive,"" she said.

Fatima al-Ganna, 30, said her tent was just a few yards away from the crater in the middle of the camp.

""We were so surprised at this huge crater. We were so scared,"" she said. ""They told us to come here to be safe, but we just aren't.""

The spokesman of the Gaza civil defense said that entire families were wiped out and that between 20 to 40 tents were destroyed."
Israel Says 'Highly Likely' Its Troops Fatally Shot U.S. Citizen In West Bank,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tylerroush/2024/09/10/israel-says-highly-likely-its-troops-fatally-shot-us-citizen-in-west-bank/,2024-09-10T14:26:45Z,"Israel's military said on Tuesday it is ""highly likely"" American Aysenur Eygi was ""indirectly and unintentionally"" shot and killed by the Israel Defense Force during a protest in the West Bank last week, according to an initial probe, following criticism of Israel's response by Eygi's family and U.S. officials.

Eygi's family released a statement on Saturday saying Eygi -- also a Turkish citizen -- was ""peacefully standing for justice"" before she was shot by Israel's military. Her family argued that ""given the circumstances"" of Eygi's death, ""an Israeli investigation is not adequate."" Several Turkish and U.S. officials have condemned Israel's response to the Beita protest, including Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who called the IDF's shooting a ""barbaric intervention."" Sean Savett, a National Security Council spokesperson, said the White House was ""deeply disturbed"" by the incident, adding the U.S. had requested an investigation and more information.

Eygi is a recent graduate of the University of Washington and was raised in Seattle, her family said. Aria Fani, a professor of Middle Eastern languages and cultures at the university, told the Associated Press Eygi had previously participated in pro-Palestinian protests before traveling to the West Bank, which Fani tried to convince her not to do. International organizations have cautioned against traveling to the region since Hamas -- which controlled the Gaza Strip and is separate from the Palestinian Authority, which administers parts of the West Bank -- attacked Israel in October. As of Aug. 21, the United Nations estimated more than 600 people have been killed in the West Bank since Oct. 7, mostly by Israeli forces and settlers in the occupied territory. Other civilians have been killed before the attack in recent years, however, including Al Jazeera journalist and U.S. citizen Shireen Abu Akleh, who was fatally shot while covering an Israeli operation in 2022. The IDF apologized for her death in 2023.

Two other activists with the International Solidarity Movement have been killed in Gaza since 2000. In 2003, American Rachel Corrie was crushed to death as she tried to block an IDF bulldozer from demolishing a Palestinian home, the Associated Press reported. A month later, British citizen Tom Hurndall was shot in the head by an IDF soldier. The IDF ruled Corrie's death as an accident, despite condemnation by human rights groups, and the soldier who killed Hurndall was sentenced to over 11 years in prison."
What We Know About Kamala Harris' Policy Agenda Before Tonight's Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/10/what-we-know-about-kamala-harris-policy-agenda-before-tonights-debate/,2024-09-10T14:01:47Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris will face off against former President Donald Trump at Tuesday's debate, where she's expected to be asked about a range of policy views -- and while the Harris campaign updated its website Sunday to elaborate on her platform, she still has not given many concrete policy proposals outside of economic issues.

Harris has broadly said she wants to support the middle class as president, proposing what she has dubbed an ""opportunity economy."" Tax-wise, that includes expanding the child tax credit -- including $6,000 for newborns in their first year and $3,600 per child in middle and lower-income families -- along with restoring the Earned Income Tax Credit for citizens who earn less than $63,398 and a pledge not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 per year. The vice president also wants to go after price gouging for grocery store prices -- a proposal that economists have had mixed feelings about -- and target housing affordability. She has proposed giving $25,000 in assistance to first-time homebuyers and establishing tax credits for developers to build starter homes and affordable rental units, with a plan for a $40 billion ""innovation fund"" to address the housing crisis. Her administration would also boost small businesses by expanding a startup tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000. After the Biden administration imposed a $35 monthly insulin cap for seniors, Harris has also called for expanding that to all Americans, along with a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription costs. She said she will also work with states to abolish medical debt and expand Affordable Care Act subsidies. Harris said at the Democratic National Convention her administration would ""protect Social Security and Medicare,"" and her website notes it will ""strengthen"" those programs by raising taxes on high-income earners.

In addition to economic policies dedicated to boosting the middle class, Harris is also targeting higher taxes for the richest Americans, saying on her website the wealthy and large corporations will ""pay their fair share."" The campaign website outlines proposals to accomplish that including rolling back Trump-era tax cuts on the wealthy and implementing a ""billionaire minimum tax"" that imposes a 25% tax rate and taxes unrealized gains. She also proposes ""quadrupling"" the tax on stock buybacks and imposing a 28% long-term capital gains tax for people earning $1 million or more annually. That proposal is actually lower than the 39.6% rate that Biden has previously proposed, however, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has called for the vice president to ""go higher.""

Harris told CNN she does not support a ban on fracking, reversing an earlier position she held prior to 2020. The vice president did back climate change initiatives, telling CNN the ""climate crisis is real"" and ""it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time."" That being said, Harris explained she has learned that ""we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking."" The vice president's website otherwise points to the Biden administration's work on climate change and states Harris' platform ""advances environmental justice, protects public lands and public health, increases resilience to climate disasters, lowers household energy costs, creates millions of new jobs, and continues to hold polluters accountable to secure clean air and water for all"" -- but does not provide any concrete proposals.

While critics on the right have tried to paint Harris as Biden's ""border czar"" -- a position she never actually held -- Harris has faced pressure to outline her views on immigration. She told CNN she still wants to pass the bipartisan border bill that she blames former President Donald Trump for helping to kill earlier this year. Harris walked back earlier statements she made during the 2020 primary suggesting she wanted to decriminalize border crossings, telling CNN, ""We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally. And there should be consequences."" On its website, the Harris campaign said the vice president ""knows that our immigration system is broken,"" calling for ""comprehensive reform"" including bolstering border security measures and an ""earned pathway to citizenship.""

Harris told CNN she is ""unequivocal"" and ""unwavering in my commitment to Israel's defense and its ability to defend itself. And that's not going to change."" She pushed for a ceasefire deal with a two-state solution, saying any resolution must also ensure ""the Palestinians have security and self-determination and dignity,"" and her website suggests she would not make any changes to the Biden administration's approach to addressing the conflict. Harris also made comments in support of Ukraine during her convention speech and on her website, though she did not give specifics about any policies or level of aid she would support. The vice president has touted her work in helping Ukraine under Biden and said, ""As president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.""

Harris has made her support for reproductive rights a key part of her candidacy after advocating on the issue as vice president, and has heavily opposed attacks on the procedure by Trump and Project 2025 -- a right-wing agenda not formally affiliated with his campaign. She said at the convention and on her website she will sign a bill legalizing abortion into law if elected, which most abortion rights activists have interpreted as her calling for a return to the standard set under Roe v. Wade, in which abortion is allowed nationwide until the fetus is viable. Harris will ""never"" sign an abortion ban into law, her website states.

Harris called at the convention for passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act builds on the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and addresses parts of that bill that have been struck down by the Supreme Court, strengthening voting rights protections and restoring a requirement for states to get approval from the Justice Department to enact voting rules. The Freedom to Vote Act would impose sweeping measures like universal early voting, no-excuse voting by mail and automatic voter registration, along with adding protections against gerrymandering and reforming campaign finance laws to strengthen transparency and tighten rules around super PACs. Beyond voting, Harris' website also points to her longtime support for LGBTQ rights and said she will fight to pass the Equality Act that would codify anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity into law.

Harris' website emphasizes she will work so that ""Americans have the freedom to live safe from gun violence,"" specifically backing proposals including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, universal background checks and red flag laws. She also backs funding for law enforcement and said she would strengthen ""proven gun violence prevention programs."" Her calls to invest in law enforcement come after the Trump campaign has attacked Harris by claiming she wanted to ""defund the police,"" pointing to statements she made during the 2020 racial justice movement expressing some support for that movement -- though she never explicitly said she wanted to defund law enforcement.

In light of a series of controversial rulings by the conservative-leaning Supreme Court, Harris followed Biden in backing a series of reforms to the court, with her website singling out term limits and a binding code of ethics like lower federal judges have to follow. The candidate also expressed support for a federal measure that would undo the Supreme Court's ruling giving Trump and other ex-presidents some immunity from criminal charges, but her website did not specify whether Harris backs negating that ruling through a new constitutional amendment, as Biden supports, or via legislation.

Harris -- whose running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, is a veteran of the Army National Guard -- said on her campaign website that she will take increased steps to support veterans and their families. The website singles out steps like trying to end homelessness among veterans by investing in mental health and suicide prevention programs and eliminating barriers to employment for veterans. The Harris campaign said she will also ""[expand] economic opportunities"" for active duty military families and veterans, but did not specify any concrete proposals.

While her website does now mention a range of issues, she has not released the kind of detailed policy proposals on other issues that she did with the economy, and her website only briefly mentions any more concrete plans on each topic. The Democratic Party has released a platform that includes more detailed proposals, but it was drafted while Biden was still the nominee, so it's unclear if Harris would change those policies were she in office. The vice president has been willing to go beyond Biden's proposals with some issues she's released proposals on so far, such as supporting law enforcement's ability to go after companies for price gouging and raising the amount of assistance first-time home buyers should receive from $10,000 to $25,000.

Whether any of Harris' proposals will change before November. The New York Times reported in August that some of the vice president's big-money donors have asked her to tone down her proposal on taxing the ultra-rich, after she said she supported policies that would tax wealthy Americans on their ""unrealized gains"" -- meaning money that investors have made through assets like stocks, but haven't yet sold for a profit. Donors have reportedly brought their concerns up to Harris' campaign advisors and the candidate herself, and have claimed they do see some room for flexibility in her specific proposals. ""In my interactions with [the campaign], the key is she focuses on her values and is not an ideologue about any particular program,"" billionaire Mark Cuban told the Times. Harris defended changes in her specific policy views over the years to CNN, saying that while specifics of policies she supports may evolve, ""the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed.""

Trump and his campaign have slammed Harris' policies as being too far-left and ""radical."" ""If Kamala's goal was to confirm she's a Radical Left lunatic -- mission accomplished,"" the Trump campaign said in an email to press after Harris' CNN interview aired.

Harris took over as the Democratic nominee in July after Biden suddenly dropped out of the race, with the president endorsing Harris minutes after he announced he was stepping down and Democratic leaders quickly coalescing around the vice president. She had no challengers for the nomination. Harris' policy platform has become a key question her campaign has faced in the weeks since she became the nominee, and while the candidate released her economic agenda and highlighted it in an August 16 speech, those remarks are still the only substantive speech on her policy proposals she has given thus far. The vice president and running mate Gov. Tim Walz sat down with CNN in August following weeks of pressure for Harris to speak with the press, with the Trump campaign claiming the Democrat was ""ducking the media"" by refusing to do a one-on-one interview. Harris had previously only answered shouted questions from reporters and spoke with social media influencers at the convention. Her website had also not had an ""issues"" section previously, further inflaming criticism of not being upfront about her policies."

Tonight is the first chance Americans have to see Vice President Harris and former President Donald Trump face off, in the same place, at the same time. A new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll shows that 70% of respondents will be watching what could be the one-and-only scheduled debate between the presidential hopefuls. And 30% say it will help them decide who to vote for. This comes as polls show a very close contest between the candidates.

An Israeli strike on a crowded tent camp housing displaced Palestinians in the south of Gaza killed 40 people, officials said. Tens of thousands of Palestinians were told they'd find relative safety from Israeli airstrikes in the neighborhood outside Khan Younis called al-Muwasi. That's where the Israeli military struck today saying it was targeting a Hamas operations center.

The Miami-Dade Police Department released body camera footage showing the dramatic encounter between officers and Miami Dolphins wide receiver Tyreek Hill. It shows officers forcibly remove him from his car less than a minute after pulling him over. The officers ultimately detained him in handcuffs for nearly 20 minutes. It started after police spotted a black sports car zip by, and Hill was pulled over. He rolled down his window, handed over his license and then rolled up his window. A verbal disagreement sparked over the closed window and an officer then yelled at Hill to get out of the vehicle. The incident escalated from there. One officer has been placed on administrative duty over the incident, and Hill's lawyer says they'll be pursuing legal action.

Jordanian voters go to polls amid fears of a wider war,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/g-s1-21747/jordanian-voters-go-to-polls-amid-fears-of-a-wider-war,2024-09-10T11:10:55Z,"AMMAN -- Jordanian voters are going to the polls Tuesday in the kingdom's first parliamentary elections since a new election law two years ago paved the way for greater participation by political parties in the country's political system.

About 5 million Jordanians are eligible to vote - almost half of Jordan's roughly 11 million population. More than 600,000 of them turned 18 since the last elections and are eligible to vote for the first time.

Jordan, a key security ally of the United States and one of the few Arab countries to have signed a peace treaty with Israel, is a constitutional monarchy and the parliament has limited power.

But the election is seen as a key gauge of democratization efforts and the effect of public anger over Israeli attacks in Gaza.

The war in Gaza has overshadowed almost all aspects of life in the kingdom, where a majority of citizens are of Palestinian origin - those who fled or were expelled from their homes with the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and subsequent wars. Daily Israeli attacks in Gaza, and increasingly, the occupied West Bank, have sparked intense anger in the small kingdom. The war has also devastated Jordan's economy, where tourism is a major sector.

Jordan is the only other Arab country apart from Egypt to have signed a full peace-treaty with Israel. The treaty resulted in security cooperation and economic ties between Jordan and neighboring Israel but has done little over the years to tamp down anger among Jordanians over Israeli occupation of Palestinian territories.

That anger has grown into rage over the war in Gaza, where the health ministry says more than 40,000 people, many of them women and children, have been killed in Israeli air strikes since the militant group Hamas attacked Israel last October. Israel says about 1200 civilians and soldiers were killed in that attack.

Jordanian leaders are particularly worried about increasing Israeli attacks recently in the occupied West Bank. Israel says it is targeting armed militants while many in Jordan believe that the military action and an increase in illegal Israeli settlement are meant to push Palestinians across the river and into Jordan.

The election law two years ago is meant to promote the establishment of political parties in a political system dominated by tribal ties. Forty-one of the 138-seat parliament have been set aside for political party candidates in this election. Analysts say The move paved the way for greater participation by liberal and secular parties in Jordan's conservative society.

""The political parties have not really dug in roots in terms of political organization,"" says Mustafa Hamarneh, a senior member of the Jordanian Social Democratic Party and a Jordanian senator.

He said, however, this election marks the first time that political parties are running on platforms rather than appealing to voters' sense of identity, such as religious or tribal links, he told NPR after casting his vote. ""Let's hope that this experiment will succeed at least a little and it will be a beginning for future development.""

Despite the changes in election law, the new parliament is expected to be roughly similar in outlook to previous ones - made up mostly of pro-government and tribal members. This election raises a quota for women's representation to 18 members from 15 in the last election.

It also lowered the age of eligibility for candidates to 25 from 30 years of age - a potentially significant development in a country where roughly half of citizens are under age 25.

Jordan, a small country lacking natural resources with a large population of Syrian and other refugees, is highly dependent on US and other foreign aid. Much of that aid is tied to Jordan's contribution to helping secure Israeli borders, including hosting a large U.S. military presence on bases outside the Jordanian capital.

Under King Abdullah II, the country has tried to balance its need to maintain relations with Israel while recognizing public anger over Israeli attacks in Gaza and the West Bank.

The militant Palestinian group Hamas sprung from Muslim Brotherhood ideology in the late 1980s after the first Palestinian uprising against Israeli occupation. The Brotherhood is banned in many Arab countries as a potential threat to hereditary rulers and autocratic leaders such as Egyptian president Abdul Fatah al-Sisi.

Jordan has allowed a Brotherhood-affiliated party, the Islamic Action Front, to operate but under relatively strict controls -- including approving mosque sermons and limits on public protests.

Hamarneh, a former head of Jordan's Center for Strategic Studies and the government-appointed Economic and Social Council, said all parties support the Palestinians in the war in Gaza and were unlikely to be able to differentiate themselves to voters on that issue.

""However, organization here matters and the Islamists or the Muslim Brotherhood, they have the best political organization in the country. So that could be effective,"" he said."
"Dozens killed from an Israeli strike in a Gaza humanitarian zone, Palestinians say",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/10/g-s1-21731/israel-strike-gaza-deaths,2024-09-10T06:20:01Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike on a crowded tent camp housing Palestinians displaced by the war in Gaza killed at least 40 people and wounded 60 others early Tuesday, Palestinian officials said. Israel said it targeted ""significant"" Hamas militants, allegations denied by the militant group.

It was among the deadliest strikes yet in Muwasi, a sprawl of crowded tent camps along the Gaza coast that Israel designated as a humanitarian zone for hundreds of thousands of civilians to seek shelter from the Israel-Hamas war.

The Civil Defense, first responders operating under the Hamas-run government, said it recovered 40 bodies from the strike and was still looking for people. It said entire families were killed in their tents.

An Associated Press camera operator saw three large craters at the scene, where first responders and displaced people were sifting through the sand and rubble with garden tools and their bare hands by the light of mobile phones. They pulled body parts from the sand, including what appeared to be a human leg.

Attaf al-Shaar, who was displaced from the southern city of Rafah, said the strike happened just after midnight and caused a fire.

""The people were buried in the sand. They were retrieved as body parts,"" she told an Associated Press reporter at the scene.

Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis, one of three hospitals to receive casualties, said around two dozen bodies were brought in from the strike.

The Israeli military said it had struck Hamas militants who were operating in a command-and-control center. It said its forces used precise munitions, aerial surveillance and other means to avoid civilian casualties.

Israel says it tries to avoid harming civilians throughout the war, which was ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack. It blames Hamas for their deaths because the militants often operate in residential areas and are known to position tunnels, rocket launchers and other infrastructure near homes, schools and mosques.

Hamas released a statement denying any militants were in the area. Neither Israel nor Hamas provided evidence to substantiate their claims.

The war has caused vast destruction and displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, often multiple times. Israeli evacuation orders, which now cover around 90% of the territory, have pushed hundreds of thousands of people into Muwasi, a sprawling line of squalid tent camps along the coast.

Aid groups have struggled to provide even basic services in Muwasi, and Israel has occasionally struck targets there despite designating it as a humanitarian zone.

Gaza's Health Ministry says over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their Oct. 7 attack. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding around 100 after releasing most of the rest in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire last November. Around a third of the remaining hostages are believed to be dead.

The United States, Egypt and Qatar have spent much of this year trying to broker an agreement for a cease-fire and the release of the hostages, but the talks have repeatedly bogged down as Israel and Hamas have accused each other of making new and unacceptable demands.

The war has plunged Gaza into a humanitarian crisis, and humanitarian groups have struggled to provide aid because of ongoing fighting, Israeli restrictions, and the breakdown of law and order. The international authority on the severity of hunger crises said in June that the territory is at high risk of famine.

The main United Nations agency providing aid to Palestinians said Israeli troops stopped a convoy taking part in a polio vaccination campaign for more than eight hours on Monday, despite it coordinating with the military. UNRWA head Philippe Lazzarini said the staffers who were held had been taking part in the campaign in northern Gaza and Gaza City.

""The convoy was stopped at gun point just after the Wadi Gaza checkpoint with threats to detain UN staff,"" he wrote on the social platform X. ""Heavy damage was caused by bulldozers to the UN armoured vehicles.""

He said the staff and the convoy later returned to a U.N. base, but it was unclear if a polio vaccination campaign would take place Tuesday in northern Gaza.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The vaccination drive, launched after doctors discovered the first polio case in the Palestinian enclave in 25 years, aims to vaccinate 640,000 children during a war that has destroyed the health care system."
The U.S. urges Israel to investigate the killing of an American woman in the West Bank,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/09/nx-s1-5106819/us-israel-american-woman-shooting-west-bank,2024-09-09T21:34:53Z,"Editor's note: This story contains descriptions of violence.

The State Department on Monday urged Israel to move quickly to investigate the fatal shooting of an American woman during a protest against Israeli settlements in the West Bank last week. Eyewitnesses said she was shot in the head by Israeli forces policing the protest. Israeli authorities have said they are investigating the incident.

Aysenur Eygi, 26, was killed last Friday while attending a protest as part of a pro-Palestinian activist organization called the International Solidarity Movement, or ISM. For the past two months, ISM volunteers and other international activists have been demonstrating against a settlement outpost called Evyatar, which was initially unauthorized offshoot of the more established settlement of Beita.

While the international community considers all Jewish settlements in the Israeli-occupied West Bank to be a violation of international law, such unauthorized outposts are illegal even under Israeli law. But in July, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich -- himself an ultranationalist settler -- legalized Evyatar and several other outposts.

U.S. State Department spokesman Vedant Patel told reporters Monday that Israel has promised to share its findings with the United States first. ""We expect that to happen as swiftly as possible. We expect that process to be thorough. We expect that process to be transparent,"" Patel said.

That is likely not to be enough to satisfy Eygi's family, who are calling for the Biden administration to push for an independent investigation into the killing ""to ensure full accountability for the guilty parties,"" according to the family's statement Friday.

Eygi, a dual American and Turkish citizen, had recently graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle and had traveled to the West Bank to protest in solidarity with Palestinians. They have been demonstrating against the expansion of Israeli settlements across the West Bank -- a process they say has expanded since the Palestinian militant group Hamas attacked Israel last October. The attack in Israel killed 1,200 people, according to Israel. In response, the Israeli military campaign in Gaza has killed almost 41,000 people, according to Palestinian health officials.

Eygi had arrived in Israel only two days before she was killed and joined prayers with Palestinians from local communities on top of a hill overlooking the Evyatar outpost before the demonstration began, ISM activists told NPR.

Vivi Chen, an activist who was at the scene, said the Israeli military showed up right after the prayers.

""They pushed us to the bottom of the hill, basically. The army, at this point, had been throwing tear gas. They had fired a few live rounds,"" she said.

The witnesses said there were some clashes and rock-throwing. Activist Jay Harrison hid behind a dumpster and started to run when a shot hit his cover. He said that's when he heard another shot about 15 feet away. ""I saw someone crumble and fall backward,"" he said. He realized it was Eygi. He ran to take her pulse but it was very weak.

""I could see blood coming out their nose. Eyes weren't quite fully shut. You could see her eyes rolled back,"" he said.

An ambulance took Eygi to the Rafidia Hospital in Nablus, the main city in the northern West Bank, where she was shortly pronounced dead. The hospital head, Dr. Fouad Nafaa, said she arrived with fixed, dilated pupils and no heartbeat. She wasn't breathing, and parts of her brain had spilled out. He said doctors performed six cycles of CPR but couldn't save her.

The Israeli military said in a statement that troops fired toward ""a main instigator"" who was throwing rocks at them.

But Harrison disputed that assertion. ""There was no way for anyone to be able to hit them with rocks,"" he said.

Chen, the other activist there that day, claimed it was a deliberate shot. ""It wasn't like there was hundreds of bullets flying in the air and she got struck by accident,"" Chen said. ""She was just moving down the hill, and then she was standing next to an olive tree.""

Israeli military raids and settler violence have risen since Oct. 7, including a major Israeli army raid on Jenin and two other towns in the northern occupied West Bank in recent weeks. Altogether, the attacks have killed more than 650 Palestinians, according to the United Nations.

The ISM says at least three of its activists have been killed since 2000. American ISM activist Rachel Corrie was crushed to death by an Israeli military bulldozer in Gaza in 2003.

Eygi's death was met with shock and grief at the University of Washington.

""I'm absolutely devastated. The whole community is,"" Aria Fani, Eygi's former translation studies teacher, told The Seattle Times. He described Eygi as ""one of the most brilliant students"" he had ever taught.

The Associated Press reported that the Palestinian Authority held a funeral procession Monday for Eygi in the West Bank city of Nablus, but Turkey wants the body transferred there for burial."
What We Know About Kamala Harris' Policy Agenda Before Tomorrow's Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/09/09/what-we-know-about-kamala-harris-policy-agenda-before-tomorrows-debate/,2024-09-09T14:28:37Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris updated her campaign website Sunday night to elaborate on her policy views ahead of Tuesday's debate against former President Donald Trump, giving a more fleshed-out picture of her views on issues like gun violence, immigration and abortion, though she still has not given many concrete policy proposals outside of economic issues.

Harris has broadly said she wants to support the middle class as president, proposing what she has dubbed an ""opportunity economy."" Tax-wise, that includes expanding the child tax credit -- including $6,000 for newborns in their first year and $3,600 per child in middle and lower-income families -- along with restoring the Earned Income Tax Credit for citizens who earn less than $63,398 and a pledge not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400,000 per year. The vice president also wants to go after price gouging for grocery store prices -- a proposal that economists have had mixed feelings about -- and target housing affordability. She has proposed giving $25,000 in assistance to first-time homebuyers and establishing tax credits for developers to build starter homes and affordable rental units, with a plan for a $40 billion ""innovation fund"" to address the housing crisis. Her administration would also boost small businesses by expanding a startup tax deduction from $5,000 to $50,000. After the Biden administration imposed a $35 monthly insulin cap for seniors, Harris has also called for expanding that to all Americans, along with a $2,000 cap on out-of-pocket prescription costs. She said she will also work with states to abolish medical debt and expand Affordable Care Act subsidies. Harris said at the Democratic National Convention her administration would ""protect Social Security and Medicare,"" and her website notes it will ""strengthen"" those programs by raising taxes on high-income earners.

In addition to economic policies dedicated to boosting the middle class, Harris is also targeting higher taxes for the richest Americans, saying on her website the wealthy and large corporations will ""pay their fair share."" The campaign website outlines proposals to accomplish that including rolling back Trump-era tax cuts on the wealthy and implementing a ""billionaire minimum tax"" that imposes a 25% tax rate and taxes unrealized gains. She also proposes ""quadrupling"" the tax on stock buybacks and imposing a 28% long-term capital gains tax for people earning $1 million or more annually. That proposal is actually lower than the 39.6% rate that Biden has previously proposed, however, and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., has called for the vice president to ""go higher.""

Harris told CNN she does not support a ban on fracking, reversing an earlier position she held prior to 2020. The vice president did back climate change initiatives, telling CNN the ""climate crisis is real"" and ""it is an urgent matter to which we should apply metrics that include holding ourselves to deadlines around time."" That being said, Harris explained she has learned that ""we can grow and we can increase a thriving clean energy economy without banning fracking."" The vice president's website otherwise points to the Biden administration's work on climate change and states Harris' platform ""advances environmental justice, protects public lands and public health, increases resilience to climate disasters, lowers household energy costs, creates millions of new jobs, and continues to hold polluters accountable to secure clean air and water for all"" -- but does not provide any concrete proposals.

While critics on the right have tried to paint Harris as Biden's ""border czar"" -- a position she never actually held -- Harris has faced pressure to outline her views on immigration. She told CNN she still wants to pass the bipartisan border bill that she blames former President Donald Trump for helping to kill earlier this year. Harris walked back earlier statements she made during the 2020 primary suggesting she wanted to decriminalize border crossings, telling CNN, ""We have laws that have to be followed and enforced that address and deal with people who cross our border illegally. And there should be consequences."" On its website, the Harris campaign said the vice president ""knows that our immigration system is broken,"" calling for ""comprehensive reform"" including bolstering border security measures and an ""earned pathway to citizenship.""

Harris told CNN she is ""unequivocal"" and ""unwavering in my commitment to Israel's defense and its ability to defend itself. And that's not going to change."" She pushed for a ceasefire deal with a two-state solution, saying any resolution must also ensure ""the Palestinians have security and self-determination and dignity,"" and her website suggests she would not make any changes to the Biden administration's approach to addressing the conflict. Harris also made comments in support of Ukraine during her convention speech and on her website, though she did not give specifics about any policies or level of aid she would support. The vice president has touted her work in helping Ukraine under Biden and said, ""As president, I will stand strong with Ukraine and our NATO allies.""

Harris has made her support for reproductive rights a key part of her candidacy after advocating on the issue as vice president, and has heavily opposed attacks on the procedure by Trump and Project 2025 -- a right-wing agenda not formally affiliated with his campaign. She said at the convention and on her website she will sign a bill legalizing abortion into law if elected, which most abortion rights activists have interpreted as her calling for a return to the standard set under Roe v. Wade, in which abortion is allowed nationwide until the fetus is viable. Harris will ""never"" sign an abortion ban into law, her website states.

Harris called at the convention for passing the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Freedom to Vote Act. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act builds on the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and addresses parts of that bill that have been struck down by the Supreme Court, strengthening voting rights protections and restoring a requirement for states to get approval from the Justice Department to enact voting rules. The Freedom to Vote Act would impose sweeping measures like universal early voting, no-excuse voting by mail and automatic voter registration, along with adding protections against gerrymandering and reforming campaign finance laws to strengthen transparency and tighten rules around super PACs. Beyond voting, Harris' website also points to her longtime support for LGBTQ rights and said she will fight to pass the Equality Act that would codify anti-discrimination protections based on sexual orientation and gender identity into law.

Harris' website emphasizes she will work so that ""Americans have the freedom to live safe from gun violence,"" specifically backing proposals including bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines, universal background checks and red flag laws. She also backs funding for law enforcement and said she would strengthen ""proven gun violence prevention programs."" Her calls to invest in law enforcement come after the Trump campaign has attacked Harris by claiming she wanted to ""defund the police,"" pointing to statements she made during the 2020 racial justice movement expressing some support for that movement -- though she never explicitly said she wanted to defund law enforcement.

In light of a series of controversial rulings by the conservative-leaning Supreme Court, Harris followed Biden in backing a series of reforms to the court, with her website singling out term limits and a binding code of ethics like lower federal judges have to follow. The candidate also expressed support for a federal measure that would undo the Supreme Court's ruling giving Trump and other ex-presidents some immunity from criminal charges, but her website did not specify whether Harris backs negating that ruling through a new constitutional amendment, as Biden supports, or via legislation.

Harris -- whose running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, is a veteran of the Army National Guard -- said on her campaign website that she will take increased steps to support veterans and their families. The website singles out steps like trying to end homelessness among veterans by investing in mental health and suicide prevention programs and eliminating barriers to employment for veterans. The Harris campaign said she will also ""[expand] economic opportunities"" for active duty military families and veterans, but did not specify any concrete proposals.

While her website does now mention a range of issues, she has not released the kind of detailed policy proposals on other issues that she did with the economy, and her website only briefly mentions any more concrete plans on each topic. The Democratic Party has released a platform that includes more detailed proposals, but it was drafted while Biden was still the nominee, so it's unclear if Harris would change those policies were she in office. The vice president has been willing to go beyond Biden's proposals with some issues she's released proposals on so far, such as supporting law enforcement's ability to go after companies for price gouging and raising the amount of assistance first-time home buyers should receive from $10,000 to $25,000.

Whether any of Harris' proposals will change before November. The New York Times reported in August that some of the vice president's big-money donors have asked her to tone down her proposal on taxing the ultra-rich, after she said she supported policies that would tax wealthy Americans on their ""unrealized gains"" -- meaning money that investors have made through assets like stocks, but haven't yet sold for a profit. Donors have reportedly brought their concerns up to Harris' campaign advisors and the candidate herself, and have claimed they do see some room for flexibility in her specific proposals. ""In my interactions with [the campaign], the key is she focuses on her values and is not an ideologue about any particular program,"" billionaire Mark Cuban told the Times. Harris defended changes in her specific policy views over the years to CNN, saying that while specifics of policies she supports may evolve, ""the most important and most significant aspect of my policy perspective and decisions is my values have not changed.""

Trump and his campaign have slammed Harris' policies as being too far-left and ""radical."" ""If Kamala's goal was to confirm she's a Radical Left lunatic -- mission accomplished,"" the Trump campaign said in an email to press after Harris' CNN interview aired.

Harris took over as the Democratic nominee in July after Biden suddenly dropped out of the race, with the president endorsing Harris minutes after he announced he was stepping down and Democratic leaders quickly coalescing around the vice president. She had no challengers for the nomination. Harris' policy platform has become a key question her campaign has faced in the weeks since she became the nominee, and while the candidate released her economic agenda and highlighted it in an August 16 speech, those remarks are still the only substantive speech on her policy proposals she has given thus far. The vice president and running mate Gov. Tim Walz sat down with CNN in August following weeks of pressure for Harris to speak with the press, with the Trump campaign claiming the Democrat was ""ducking the media"" by refusing to do a one-on-one interview. Harris had previously only answered shouted questions from reporters and spoke with social media influencers at the convention. Her website had also not had an ""issues"" section previously, further inflaming criticism of not being upfront about her policies."
"Harris finally adds policy page to campaign website, devotes several sections to Trump",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-finally-adds-policy-page-campaign-website-devotes-several-sections-trump,2024-09-09T12:58:30Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Vice President Harris finally added policies to her campaign website for the first time since President Biden dropped out of the race and endorsed her in the presidential race 50 days ago.

The website breaks Harris and her vice-presidential running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz' policy proposals into four sections: ""Build an Opportunity Economy and Lower Costs for Families,"" ""Safeguard Our Fundamental Freedoms,"" ""Ensure Safety and Justice For All,"" and ""Keep America Safe, Secure, and Prosperous.""

Before the new addition, Harris' campaign website had pages to buy merchandise, donate and get to know the candidate's background, but was devoid of any policy plans for weeks even after she formally accepted the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago 17 days ago.

Harris's website now includes a promise to cut taxes for middle class families by ""ensuring no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in taxes."" The website promises that Harris and Walz ""will ensure the wealthiest Americans and the largest corporations pay their fair share, so we can take action to build up the middle class while reducing the deficit,"" including by ""rolling back Trump's tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, enacting a billionaire minimum tax, quadrupling the tax on stock buybacks, and other reforms to ensure the very wealthy are playing by the same rules as the middle class.""

HARRIS TEAM MOVES TO SOFTEN POTENTIAL DEBATE IMPACT 'BEFORE IT EVEN HAPPENS' AND MORE TOP HEADLINES

The website touts a plan to give more than 100 million working and middle-class families a tax cut by restoring the Child Tax Credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit. It says Harris and Walz will also expand the Child Tax Credit to provide a $6,000 credit to families with newborn children.

""Under her plan, the tax rate on long-term capital gains for those earning a million dollars a year or more will be 28 percent, because when the government encourages investment, it leads to broad-based economic growth and creates jobs, which makes our economy stronger,"" the website says.

The website also claims that Harris' ""lowering costs agenda is a stark contrast to Donald Trump's plans to jack up prices, weaken the middle class, cut Social Security and Medicare, eliminate the Department of Education and preschool programs like Head Start, and end the Affordable Care Act.""

Much of the Harris website's policy section focuses on attacking her opponent. Under each policy section, Harris includes a subsection on what she calls ""Trump's Project 2025 Agenda.""

Former President Trump and his campaign have repeatedly said they are not affiliated with Project 2025, which was created by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation as policy recommendations for the next Republican administration. Harris' website also claims Trump would ban abortion and restrict in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment, despite the Republican nominee stating the opposite. Trump has said he would not enact a federal abortion ban and recently said he would consider making sure the government or insurance companies cover the fertility treatment.

Regarding the economy, Harris claims that Trump's ""plans would increase costs for families by at least $3,900 a year by slapping a Trump sales tax on imported everyday goods that American families rely on, like gas, food, clothing, and medicine"" and would raise rents and add $1,200 a year to the typical American mortgage.

HERITAGE RIPS HARRIS' 'DANGEROUSLY LIBERAL' POLICY RECORD WITH NEW WEBSITE, 6-FIGURE OUTREACH TO INDEPENDENTS

""Trump's economic plans would also trigger a recession by mid-2025, cost America over 3 million jobs, threaten hundreds of thousands of clean energy jobs, increase the debt by over $5 trillion, send inflation skyrocketing, and hurt everyone but the richest Americans,"" according to Harris' website.

Under what is intended to be policy proposals to ""ensure safety and justice for all,"" Harris' website slams Trump as ""a convicted criminal who only cares about himself,"" claiming the Republican nominee has ""proven that time and time again - from caving to the gun lobby and doing nothing to address gun violence to killing the bipartisan border security deal that would secure our border and keep America safe, just to help himself politically."" It also says Trump will implement the Project 2025 agenda if elected ""to consolidate power, bring the Department of Justice and the FBI under his direct control so he can give himself unchecked legal power and go after his opponents, and rule as a dictator on 'day one.'""

Fox News Digital reached out to the Trump campaign for comment, but they did not immediately respond.

Regarding foreign affairs, the website claims that Harris ""has been a tireless and effective diplomat on the world stage"" and ""will never hesitate to take whatever action is necessary to protect U.S. forces and interests from Iran and Iran-backed terrorist groups."" Despite Harris boycotting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress in Washington, D.C., earlier this year, her website states Harris ""will always stand up for Israel's right to defend itself and she will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself.""

""She and President Biden are working to end the war in Gaza, such that Israel is secure, the hostages are released, the suffering in Gaza ends, and the Palestinian people can realize their right to dignity, security, freedom, and self-determination,"" the website says. ""She and President Biden are working around the clock to get a hostage deal and a ceasefire deal done."""
Columbia anti-Israel agitators to reach 'crescendo of intimidation' as school suffers latest black eye,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/columbia-anti-israel-agitators-reach-crescendo-intimidation-school-suffers-latest-black-eye,2024-09-09T08:08:50Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

As Columbia University began its new semester on Tuesday, the tense anti-Israel demonstrations that have divided its campus showed no sign of slowing.

On the first day of the New York City Ivy League's term this week, demonstrators gathered at the school's gates as an NYPD police drone hovered over their heads - although there were at least two arrests, according to the agency, police categorized the gatherings as ""peaceful.""

Cornell Law Professor William Jacobson, president of the Legal Insurrection Foundation and of EqualProtect.org, told Fox News Digital that he did not foresee campus relations improving soon.

""I think we're going to see a crescendo of intimidation and hostility as we approach October 7,"" he said, referring to the anniversary of Hamas' attack on southern Israel, during which Palestinian fighters took hostages, killed civilians and committed other war crimes.

""[Protesters have] already announced plans to hold celebrations [that day].""

""We're dealing with a cult on campus, and that's dangerous and difficult,"" he said.

GOP LEADERS VOW 'ACTION' AS COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY SWARMED BY ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS

Columbia's former president, Nemat Shafik, resigned last month after her handling of protesters on campus ""[took] a considerable toll on [her] family."" Sparks had flown after Shafik, the school's third president over an eight-month period, called in hundreds of armed police officers to arrest over 30 protesters who had barricaded themselves inside an academic building.

Now, interim president Katrina Armstrong is tasked with maintaining order on the embattled campus. Since she took her position, new restrictions and changes have been made on campus in an attempt to control the conflict, according to the school's updated code of conduct.

Camping is now banned on the school's campus, with new signs and guards dotting the school's south lawns, according to Reuters. Gates to the campus that were kept open to surrounding streets for decades have been closed under a new system that restricts access to students, with guards only allowing those with Columbia IDs and preregistered guests to enter. Officials have set up fences and gates on wheels around campus, which will be used to cordon off small areas.

The changes come as the non-profit Foundation of Individual Rights and Expression ranked Columbia in 250th place - second to last - in its annual College Free Speech Rankings.

JEWISH STUDENTS DESCRIBE GOING TO COLLEGE IN NYC AMID INTENSE ANTI-ISRAELI PROTESTS: 'TARGET ON MY BACK'

For every conservative student on campus, there are five liberal students, according to the group's survey. Sixty-six percent of survey respondents reported that they had self-censored on campus at least once or twice a month.

""Surrounding my campus has been a 'doxxing truck' since October 2023, wherein students who express any criticism of Israel are identified by their full name and a giant picture under the label 'Antisemite of the Week' on a large truck with a digital screen,"" one rising junior told the surveyors.

""Students have reported this to the administration multiple times, and they did nothing for months. Friends of mine have also lost jobs and internship opportunities because of their political beliefs,"" the student said.

Another student said that ""most professors and classes assume progressive ideas as matters of fact"" and that ""most of the curriculum is curated to fit this narrative . . . students in agreement are catered to.""

MASKED ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS AT COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY DEMONSTRATE AS STUDENTS CHECK IN FOR FIRST DAY OF CLASSES

Jacobson said that in his experience at Cornell and based on what he has been told by Columbia students, a large part of protest culture is ""faculty driven,"" with professors ""liv[ing] out a fantasy that they're very revolutionary.""

""In fact, they're very careerist, very bourgeouis. They don't sacrifice themselves at all, but they're happy to have the students sacrifice themselves,"" he said.

In an effort to combat hostility on campus, Columbia's Antisemitism Task Force published its second report, which details complaints from students who were harassed for their Jewish faith on campus.

""On campus, my friends have been spit on, been called like terrible, terrible names. A very close friend of mine was called a lover of genocide and then a lover of baby killing,"" one student, who wears a traditional head covering, told the task force. ""This was only a couple of days after October seventh.""

Scores more students reported ""painful experiences of hostility"" in the 91-page report.

""You have denialism, just like you have denialism about October 7,"" Jacobson said of the report and abysmal free expression ranking. ""I think that's a good thing. It may not result in positive change, but at least people can no longer deny what's happening.""

""It would not surprise me that schools with the most activism have the least free expression. The activism is intended to be intimidating,"" Jacobson said. ""These are not protests where people are hoping to have a debate, they are protests meant to stifle a debate.""

When asked for comment by Fox News Digital on the purported lack of free expression on campus, interim president Armstrong reiterated a portion of a recent message sent to students.

""Everyone needs to feel engaged, that their voices matter and that they belong here,"" Armstrong wrote. ""Protests need to be managed effectively and fairly. That requires holding two truths at once. The truth is that our mission depends upon free speech and open debate. And the truth that our mission equally depends upon an environment free of harassment and discrimination, where our students can learn. There is no doubt that holding those two truths requires understanding and effectively implementing our policies, rules and procedures, just as it does in the society around us."""
"Hezbollah relies on 'sophisticated' tunnel system backed by Iran, North Korea in fight against Israel",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-relies-sophisticated-tunnel-system-backed-iran-north-korea-fight-against-israel,2024-09-09T08:08:09Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Despite Israel's nearly one-year-long war with Hamas in Gaza after the Oct. 7 attacks, security experts continue to sound the alarm that Jerusalem's greatest threat actually lies to the north in Lebanon, where Hezbollah has developed a sophisticated tunnel system.

Hezbollah, an Islamic terrorist organization that has long had the backing of Iran, has over the last two decades developed a network of tunnels that stretch more than 100 miles in cumulative length throughout southern Lebanon.

Though the existence of the tunnels has been known for decades, the significant role they play in arming Hezbollah has once again come to light during the Israeli-Hamas war in Gaza, where terrorists have not only relied on tunnels for operational rearmament and maneuvering capabilities but also to house hostages taken by Hamas nearly a year ago.

While it is estimated that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have eradicated roughly 80% of Hamas' tunnels, Hezbollah's tunnels, which have largely remained untouched since the war in Gaza began, are believed to be far more sophisticated and ""significantly larger,"" according to a report by the Alma Research and Education Center, a nonprofit organization that researches Israeli security challenges along its northern border.

NETANYAHU HITS BACK OVER GLOBAL PRESSURE TO MAKE CEASE-FIRE CONCESSIONS, SAYS DEMANDS ARE 'IMMORAL', 'INSANE'

Hezbollah is believed to have begun mining its tunnels after the Second Lebanon War in 2006 in close coordination between Iran and North Korea after Tehran reportedly derived ""inspiration"" from Pyongyang and the tunnels that it developed in the aftermath of the Korean War.

Iran deemed North Korea a ""professional authority on the subject of tunneling"" due to its experience in digging tunnels for military use when it attempted to drill tunnels across the Korean Demilitarized Zone in an attempt to militarily invade areas just north of Seoul, the capital of South Korea.

While the tunnels and their intended use were never realized by the authoritarian nation, two of the four neutralized tunnels uncovered were reportedly capable of accommodating up to 30,000 troops per hour along with armaments like armored personnel carriers, tanks and field artillery - an operational blueprint Hezbollah has turned to in its fight against Israel.

The report found that Hezbollah under the advisership of North Korea - a relationship that may have begun as far back as the 1980s - built two types of tunnels across southern Lebanon, ""offensive tunnels and infrastructure tunnels.""

The offensive tunnels were intended for similar operational use as North Korea's, and at least six tunnels were discovered by IDF forces that led into Israeli territory during Operation Northern Shield, which began in December 2018.

Alma's research found that some of Hezbollah's tunnels are also capable of transporting ATVs, motorcycles and other ""small vehicles,"" though it did not specify the number of terrorists that they could accommodate.

The tunnels are equipped with ""underground command and control rooms, weapons and supply depots, field clinics and specified designated shafts used to fire missiles of all types,"" the report said, noting that arms like rockets, surface-to-surface missiles, anti-tank missiles and anti-aircraft missiles can be fired from ""shafts"" in the tunnels. ""These shafts are hidden and camouflaged and cannot be detected above ground.""

DOJ CHARGES HAMAS LEADERS OVER 'TERRORIST ATROCITIES' IN OCT 7 ISRAEL ATTACK

The tunnels are believed to connect the capital of Beirut, where Hezbollah's central headquarters is located and its logistical base in the Beqaa Valley near the Syrian border, to southern Lebanon.

""We call this inter-regional tunnel network 'Hezbollah's Land of the Tunnels,'"" the Alma report first released in 2021 detailed, noting the tunnel system is more akin to a ""metro"" of tunnels rather than one long tunnel.

The second series of tunnels Hezbollah mined, known as the infrastructure tunnels, form an underground network in and near southern Lebanese villages that establishes the first and second ""lines of defense"" against an Israeli invasion - a project of ""enormous magnitude,"" according to the Alma report.

One such tunnel is estimated to be nearly 28 miles long, prompting the question as to how the terrorist organization was able to get away with building such a sophisticated system without opposition from the Lebanese government.

""Hezbollah does try to keep the locations, routes, internal structure, etc., of these tunnels a secret. [It] does this by expropriating territories, by preventing civilians from entering into certain areas and by taking advantage of [its] presence and influence in the government,"" Boaz Shapira, a researcher with Alma, told Fox News Digital.

Shapira said Hezbollah not only has the support of roughly 40%-50% of the Lebanese population, it is ""much better funded, organized, trained and armed"" than the Lebanese government, army, police or even the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, which has a force of some 10,500 peacekeeping troops in Lebanon and that were put in place after the 2006 war.

Hezbollah's cooperation with authoritarian nations like Iran and North Korea has long made it a major threat to Israel.

But its growing power within Lebanon has moved it to the top of the list when it comes to Israeli security threats, according to not only Shapira but also former IDF Major Gen. Yaakov Amidror.

""Lebanon's government is too weak to counter Hezbollah,"" Amidror told Fox News Digital. ""Everything important is decided by Hezbollah, not by the government.""

HEZBOLLAH OPERATIVES KILLED IN ISRAELI AIRSTRIKES AS TERROR GROUP FIRES 100 ROCKETS AT JEWISH STATE

Hezbollah is believed to have as many as 50,000 terrorists and, according to Shapira, its sphere of influence has extended to nearly every branch of Lebanon's security apparatus.

""Taking action against Hezbollah would be perceived as cooperation with Israel and basically as treason in Lebanon, and in the past year also against the Palestinians,"" he said. ""That means that no one in the army has any incentive for challenging Hezbollah.""

Shapira said demographics inside the once predominately Christian nation have shifted over the last several decades, and it now has a majority Muslim population - though the U.S. State Department analyzes the breakdown in Muslim populations in Lebanon as nearly equally divided between Shiite and Sunni groups.

""This trend is happening in the army as well. That means that almost every Shiite soldier in the army has a brother, cousin, friend that is a Hezbollah terrorist,"" Shapira said.

Amidror, a distinguished fellow at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America after serving as Israel's former national security adviser to the prime minister and a 36-year veteran of the IDF, told Fox News Digital he believes Israel needs to take a proactive approach when it comes to countering Hezbollah.

""We should initiate the war against Hezbollah,"" he said, noting that the timing of its operation is the main variable that needs to be determined.

""It will not be an easy job. It will be a very, very devastating war for us and for Lebanon,"" the retired major general said. ""Remember that at least 50% of their missiles had been hidden within populated areas.

""The casualties will be huge, [a] devastating war for us and for them,"" Amidror continued. ""This is why it is so problematic to fight these organizations, because they are fighting from within their own population, [and their] targets are the Israeli population.

""When you fight from within civilians and your targets are civilians, it's very complicated to fight it,"" he added."

A new report found the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) guilty of violating its own editorial guidelines over a thousand times in its coverage of the Israel-Hamas war.

According to The Telegraph, the report analyzed four months of BBC output on television, radio, online, podcasts and on social media during the height of the conflict and found a ""deeply worrying pattern of bias"" against Israel.

British lawyer Trevor Asserson and a team of about 20 lawyers and 20 data scientists used artificial intelligence to analyze nine million words from the news outlet, starting the day of the October 7, 2023, terror attack.

The researchers allegedly identified 1,553 instances where the BBC violated its own editorial guidelines on impartiality, accuracy, editorial values and public interest.

BBC CHAIR DENIES PLEA FROM 200 JEWISH STAFFERS CALLING FOR FORMAL PROBE INTO ANTISEMITISM AT THE NEWSROOM

The report accuses the BBC of downplaying Hamas terrorism and painting Israel as the aggressor in dozens of instances.

Israel was associated with ""war crimes"" four times more frequently than Hamas (127 vs. 30); genocide 14 times more often (283 vs. 19), and breaching international law six times more often than Hamas (167 vs. 27).

BBC reporters who had shown hostility toward Israel on social media were also featured in the network's war coverage, the report claimed.

Researchers reportedly found 11 instances on the BBC's Arabic channel, where it featured reporters who had previously made public statements in support of terrorism and Hamas.

""The findings reveal a deeply worrying pattern of bias and multiple breaches by the BBC of its own editorial guidelines on impartiality, fairness and establishing the truth,"" the report said, according to the Telegraph.

BBC ANCHOR ASKS IF ISRAELI FORCES WARNED PALESTINIANS AHEAD OF HOSTAGE RESCUE MISSION: DEFEATS 'THE PURPOSE'

A spokesperson for the BBC questioned the report's methodology and said they would ""carefully consider"" the report's findings after reviewing it, in a statement to Fox News Digital.

""We have serious questions about the methodology of this report, particularly its heavy reliance on AI to analyze impartiality, and its interpretation of the BBC's editorial guidelines. We don't think coverage can be assessed solely by counting particular words divorced from context. We are required to achieve due impartiality, rather than the 'balance of sympathy' proposed in the report, and we believe our knowledgeable and dedicated correspondents are achieving this, despite the highly complex, challenging and polarizing nature of the conflict,"" the spokesperson said.

""However, we will consider the report carefully and respond directly to the authors once we have had time to study it in detail,"" the spokesperson added.

The BBC also staunchly rejected the report's claims that its reporters ""celebrated acts of terror.""

Watchdog group Campaign Against Antisemitism claimed the report exposed the BBC's ideological bias.

""Despite its persistent claims of impartiality and stubbornness in the face of complaints, the BBC's ideological bias is now shamefully clear. This report vindicates with empirical data what we have said -- and the Jewish community has known -- for a long time,"" the group said with a link to The Telegraph report.

""Our polling shows that an overwhelming majority of British Jews -- 86% -- consider that anti-Israel bias in our media fuels antisemitism. The BBC should apologize for its biased and inflammatory reporting, but since the BBC has so stubbornly closed ranks and denied that there is a problem over the decades, the fundamental reform that is plainly necessary must come from outside. The answer to this report must begin with a transparent and unconstrained independent inquiry,"" the post continued.

The BBC has been criticized for refusing to label Hamas a terrorist group in the October 7 aftermath. In a previous statement to Fox News Digital, the BBC said they use the terrorist label when it's attributed to others, such as the UK Government."

A recent undercover video showing a United Nations legal affairs employee saying the world body is scared of a Trump presidency is shining a new spotlight on Trump's policy toward many of the U.N.'s scandal-plagued agencies.

The U.N. Office of Legal Affairs official was recorded on an undercover video stating, ""I'm not sure the United Nations as an institution is going to survive a second term by Trump."" The Louder with Crowder podcast conducted the undercover recording and first disclosed it.

While the Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment, as president he was viewed as being very tough on the world body by taking an aggressive posture against U.N. corruption, anti-Americanism and antisemitism while pushing American interests.

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER: 'DOZENS' OF UNRWA STAFF TOOK PART IN HAMAS' OCT 7 MASSACRE

Trump stopped funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Fox News Digital reported in August that the U.N. had been forced to fire nine UNRWA employees over likely involvement in the Hamas massacre on October 7 of nearly 1,200 people in southern Israel, including over 30 Americans.

Trump withdrew from the U.N. Human Rights Council; the U.N.'s World Health Organization; the U.N.'s cultural organization UNESCO; and the Paris climate agreement.

A U.S. State Department spokesperson for Trump said at the time the decision ""reflects U.S. concerns with mounting arrears at UNESCO, the need for fundamental reform in the organization and continuing anti-Israel bias at UNESCO.""

Biden quickly rejoined the U.N. bodies, including the Paris climate deal, that Trump walked away from during his term. However, Biden suspended funds for UNRWA after its role in the Hamas terrorist attack was exposed by Israel.

DOSSIER REVEALS INFORMATION USED TO EXPLAIN UN AGENCY'S DEEP TIES TO HAMAS IN GAZA

In 2021, former Trump U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley warned the White House about rejoining the Human Rights Council, because it is influenced by communist totalitarian regimes like China and Cuba, to name just a few.

""If President Biden truly cared about human rights, he would keep us far away from the cesspool that is the U.N. Human Rights Council,"" said Haley at the time.

A senior Republican Congressional staffer who works on international affairs told Fox News Digital, ""There are a list of things that are standard Republican positions now, which will happen immediately after President Trump reenters the White House, along with policies that he pursued in his first term which he will re-implement.""

The staffer continued that ""First and foremost, they will withdraw the U.S. from participating in the anti-American, antisemitic organizations across the United Nations that the Biden-Harris administration has been engaging and funding. They will also order our diplomats to start pushing back against international policies that undermine our interests, instead of trying to implement them the way the Biden-Harris have been doing.""

He said, ""The gentleman you refer to is not a senior U.N. official. He is a junior staffer. From looking at the video, his comments were recorded in what seemed to be in a restaurant private setting without his knowledge. He was not speaking on behalf of the Organization in any way, shape or form.""

He added, ""But I will just state for a fact that this is not-you know, when someone is recorded without their knowledge in a private setting, I don't think any good journalist could interpret it as being the official position of the United Nations.""

Anne Bayefsky, president of Human Rights Voices, told Fox News Digital, ""So the U.N. gets caught weighing in on the U.S. election vehemently against Trump and the response is, ""Who, me?"" she added, ""Today's U.N. has forsaken its original purpose and threatens American fundamental rights and freedoms. One side of the American political spectrum tolerates America-bashing and Israel-hating under the guise of a phantom global messiah, and the other side gets it. Of course, the U.N. is afraid that Americans will get it, too.""

Bayefsky concluded, ""Obviously the U.N. has a mutual love affair with Democrats: Obama went to the Security Council to adopt the far-reaching and catastrophic Iran deal before bothering to ask Congress; Obama-Harris-Biden joined and legitimized the U.N. 'Human Rights' Council - home base for despots and antisemites looking to burnish their human rights credentials while Trump withdrew from it; Obama-Harris-Biden support UNRWA while Trump said no more money for the fake Palestinian U.N. 'refugee' agency perpetuating the Arab-Israeli conflict; Obama-Harris-Biden have used the Security Council to bludgeon Israel with resolutions that have never condemned Hamas while Trump repeatedly rejected U.N. ploys to do an end run around American and Israeli sovereignty.""

Netanyahu blasts 'Iran's axis of evil' after Jordan border terror attack kill 3 Israelis,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-blasts-irans-axis-evil-after-jordan-border-terror-attack-kills-3-israelis,2024-09-08T12:27:05Z,"Former President Trump vowed to ""end chaos in the Middle East"" during a rally on Saturday, warning that Israel will be ""doomed"" if Kamala Harris is elected president.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu blasted what he called Iran's ""axis of evil"" in remarks Sunday after a terrorist attack at the West Bank-Jordan border crossing killed three Israelis.

""It's a hard day. A despicable terrorist murdered three of our citizens in cold blood at the Allenby Bridge. On behalf of the government, I send my condolences to the families of the victims,"" Netanyahu said at the beginning of his cabinet meeting Sunday. ""We are surrounded by a murderous ideology led by Iran's axis of evil. In recent days, despicable terrorists have murdered six of our hostages in cold blood and three Israeli police officers. The killers do not distinguish between us, they want to murder us all, until the last one; right and left, secular and religious, Jews and non-Jews.""

The Israeli military said a gunman approached the Allenby Bridge Crossing from the Jordanian side in a truck and opened fire at Israeli security forces, who killed the assailant in a shootout. It said the three people killed were Israeli civilians. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said they were all men in their 50s.

Jordan, a Western-allied Arab country with a large Palestinian population, is investigating the shooting, its state-run Petra News Agency reported.

TRUMP CLAIMS ISRAEL WILL BE 'GONE' WITHIN TWO YEARS IF HARRIS IS ELECTED PRESIDENT: VIDEO

Hamas official Sami Abu Zuhri celebrated the attack, connecting the shooting to Israel's offensive in Gaza.

""We expect many more similar actions,"" he said, according to Reuters.

It marked the first attack of its kind along the West Bank-Jordan border crossing since Hamas terrorists killed approximately 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. Another 250 were taken as hostages into Gaza, and Hamas are still holding approximately 100 of them. Around a third of the remaining hostages inside Gaza are believed to be dead.

""What prevents the elimination of our people as in the past is the strength of the State of Israel and the strength of the Israel Defense Forces,"" Netanyahu continued Sunday. ""The heroic spirit of the soldiers, the policemen, the men and women of our security forces, the supreme sacrifice of our fallen heroes and the resilience of our people - that's all the difference. When we stand together - our enemies cannot, so their main goal is to divide us, to sow division within us.""

Over the weekend, Netanyahu noted, ""the German newspaper Bild published an official Hamas document that reveals its plan of action: to sow division within us, to wage psychological warfare on the families of the hostages, to exert internal and external political pressure on the Israeli government, to tear us apart from the inside, and to continue the war until further notice, until the defeat of Israel.""

""The vast majority of Israeli citizens do not fall into this trap of Hamas,"" the prime minister said. ""They know that we are committed with all our might to achieve the goals of the war - to eliminate Hamas, to return all our hostages, to ensure that Gaza will no longer pose a threat to Israel and to safely return our residents in the north and south to their homes.""

NETANYAHU SAYS SECURITY IN GAZA IS CRITICAL TO STOP HAMAS SMUGGLING HOSTAGES INTO IRAN: 'LOST FOREVER'

""We will stand together, we will hold on to David's link together, and with God's help we will win,"" Netanyahu said. ""And lastly, some ask - 'Will you forever hold a sword?' In the Middle East, without a sword there is no eternity.""

The Allenby crossing over the Jordan River, also known as the King Hussein Bridge, is mainly used by Palestinians and international tourists, as well as for cargo shipments. The crossing has seen very few security incidents over the years, but in 2014 Israeli security guards shot and killed a Jordanian judge who they said had attacked them, the Associated Press reported.

Authorities in Israel and Jordan said the crossing was closed until further notice, and Israel later announced the closure of both of its land crossings with Jordan, near Beit Shean in the north and Eilat in the south."
Opinion | Why the DOJ just filed charges against Hamas leaders it is unlikely to ever arrest,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/doj-charges-hamas-leaders-arrest-israel-rcna169910,2024-09-08T11:54:00Z,"As Attorney General Merrick Garland noted in his press remarks this week, ""the Justice Department has a long memory.""

Those were the first questions that sprang to mind Tuesday, when the Justice Department unsealed a criminal complaint charging six leaders of Hamas for their roles in the Oct. 7, 2023, terrorist attack in Israel that killed around 1,200 people, including 40 U.S. citizens. A DOJ press statement said the attack was the ""culmination of Hamas's decades-long campaign of terrorism and violence against Israel and its allies, including American citizens.""

According to the complaint filed in the Southern District of New York, Hamas was founded ""to create an Islamic Palestinian state throughout Israel by eliminating the State of Israel through violent holy war."" The complaint further states that ""Hamas has murdered and injured dozens of Americans as part of its campaign of violence and terror,"" and has done so ""in retaliation for and in an effort to weaken American support for Israel's right to exist and defense of that right."" The 38-page document details decades of brutal attacks and atrocities going back to 1997 that were allegedly committed by a group the U.S. government has designated a foreign terrorist organization since.

Let's start with the first question. Why would the DOJ file charges against Hamas leaders it is unlikely to ever arrest and bring to trial, particularly when three of those leaders have been already been killed?

First, the Justice Department has long been in the business of using criminal prosecution to hold terrorists who kill American citizens accountable, even when the conduct occurs overseas. For example, in 2002, the Justice Department announced charges against Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh for his role in the brutal killing of journalist Daniel Pearl, despite the defendant's pending charges in Pakistan. In 2017, Ahmed Abu Khatallah was convicted in a U.S. court for helping to plan and carry out the 2012 attack on the U.S. Mission in Benghazi that resulted in the death of U.S. Ambassador Christopher Stevens and three other Americans posted in Libya.

In some instances, it can take years or even decades to bring defendants to justice, but the DOJ has pursued terrorists relentlessly across administrations. In 2020, the Justice Department unsealed charges against the accused maker of the bomb that destroyed Pan Am 103 and killed 190 Americans over Lockerbie, Scotland, 34 years earlier. In 2021, the U.S. attorney for the Southern District of New York announced charges against Taliban commander Haji Najibullah for his alleged role in the killing of three American service members in 2008. In 2011, prosecution of the 1998 bombings of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and Tanzania was completed with the life sentence of the fifth defendant, Ahmad Ghailani.

As Attorney General Merrick Garland noted in his press remarks this week, ""the Justice Department has a long memory,"" vowing to pursue terrorists responsible for murdering Americans ""for the rest of their lives.""

The second reason to file criminal charges is to achieve what the DOJ and other experts sometimes refer to as ""naming and shaming."" Even when charges do not result in a criminal conviction and penalty, they can serve as a sort of moral condemnation on the world stage, in this case forcing foreign governments to take note of Hamas' record of terrorism.

To the extent Hamas portrays itself as a legitimate political entity or one engaged in humanitarian efforts, the indictment paints a starkly different picture of a group that engages in vicious violence. The complaint describes the October 7 attack as a ""massacre,"" detailing abductions, the burning of homes, shootings with machine guns at point-blank range and sexual violence against women, including rape and genital mutilation. It details brutality against grandparents and young children.

The complaint also calls out Iran for allegedly supporting, supplying and training Hamas to achieve its own objectives of ""damaging, weakening, and ultimately destroying both the United States and Israel."" Hezbollah, another group the U.S. government designates a terrorist organization, is also named in the complaint as an ally of Hamas that assisted in the Oct. 7 attack. Calling Iran, Hezbollah and Hamas the ""axis of resistance,"" the complaint lays out a damning account of their conduct against the United States and its citizens.

A third reason to file a criminal complaint against Hamas may be to curtail its fundraising capabilities. The complaint specifies in great detail how the organization solicited and received $7.7 million in funds to promote terrorist activities through cryptocurrency payments, ostensibly to protect donor anonymity. By disclosing that the U.S. government is capable of tracking payments, prosecutors may hope to deter donors from contributing further.

But even if the reasons for filing the complaint may be compelling, the question remains as to why now. The announcement of charges comes at a time when cease-fire negotiations between Israel and Gaza seem especially fragile. During the weekend, Israeli authorities recovered in a tunnel beneath Gaza the bodies of six hostages who had recently been killed. On Monday, Benjamin Netanyahu responded to massive protests seemed to double down on his demands. His remarks made the odds of a resolution soon feel even less likely.

The complaint offers some tells about its timing. The last page of the complaint asks the court to seal the document except as needed ""to secure the defendants' arrest, extradition, or expulsion, or as otherwise required for purposes of national security."" That page also indicates that the complaint was filed in February, before the three deceased defendants were killed. To the extent authorities had hoped to find and arrest them in a country that permits extradition, their deaths reduce the complaint's need for secrecy.

This is not the DOJ going rogue. I know from my own experience as a federal prosecutor that policy prohibits charging decisions on the basis of politics. When a case may affect national security or foreign policy, it always involves interagency coordination. The White House and the State Department most certainly would have been briefed and asked to assess this case in light of the United States' objectives in the Middle East. Garland himself hinted at this coordination when he referred to ""the whole-of-government effort to bring the Americans still being held hostage home."" Similarly, State Department spokesman Matt Miller said Tuesday, ""when it comes to U.S. policy, we have long made clear that our first priority when it comes to terrorists is to see terrorists apprehended and brought the United States to stand trial for their crimes.""

It's also possible recent events actually prompted the DOJ's decision to unseal the complaint. Hamas' refusal to release hostages will remain a sticking point to any cease-fire resolution. This may be DOJ's way of reminding Hamas that the U.S. is in the fight for the long haul.

As Miller said Tuesday, ""It is time to finalize that deal. The people of Israel cannot afford to wait any longer. The Palestinian people, who are also suffering the terrible effects of this war, cannot afford to wait any longer. The world cannot afford to wait any longer."""
"3 Israelis killed in attack at West Bank-Jordan border crossing, Israeli military says",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/08/g-s1-21433/3-israelis-killed-shooting-west-bank-jordan-border-crossing,2024-09-08T09:08:58Z,"JERUSALEM -- Three people were shot and killed Sunday at the border crossing between the West Bank and Jordan, Israeli officials said, in what appeared to be an attack linked to the 11-month-old war in Gaza.

The military said the gunman approached the Allenby Bridge Crossing from the Jordanian side in a truck and opened fire at Israeli security forces, who killed the assailant in a shootout. It said the three people killed were Israeli civilians. Israel's Magen David Adom rescue service said they were all men in their 50s.

Jordan is investigating the shooting, its state-run Petra News Agency reported. The Western-allied Arab country made peace with Israel in 1994 but is deeply critical of its policies toward the Palestinians. Jordan has a large Palestinian population and has seen mass protests against Israel over the war in Gaza.

The Allenby crossing over the Jordan River is mainly used by Israelis, Palestinians and international tourists.

The Israeli-occupied West Bank has seen a surge of violence since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack out of Gaza triggered the war there. Israel has launched near-daily military arrest raids into dense Palestinian residential areas, and there has also been a rise in settler violence and Palestinian attacks on Israelis.

In Gaza, meanwhile, an Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed five people, including two women, two children and a senior official in the Civil Defense -- first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government.

The Civil Defense said the strike targeted the home of its deputy director for north Gaza, Mohammed Morsi, in the urban Jabaliya refugee camp.

There was no immediate comment from the Israeli military. The army says it tries to avoid harming civilians and only targets militants.

Gaza's Health Ministry says over 40,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the war began. It does not differentiate between fighters and civilians in its count. The war has caused vast destruction and displaced around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million, often multiple times.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in their Oct. 7 attack into southern Israel. They abducted another 250, and are still holding around 100 of them after releasing most of the rest in exchange for Palestinians imprisoned by Israel during a weeklong cease-fire last November. Around a third of the remaining hostages inside Gaza are believed to be dead.

The United States, Qatar and Egypt have spent months trying to broker a cease-fire and the return of the hostages, but the negotiations have repeatedly bogged down.

Israel captured the West Bank, Gaza and east Jerusalem -- territories the Palestinians want for a future state -- in the 1967 Mideast war. Israel withdrew soldiers and settlers from Gaza in 2005 but maintained control over its airspace, coastline and most of its land crossings. Along with Egypt, it imposed a blockade on Gaza after Hamas seized power from rival Palestinian forces in 2007."
Man arrested over alleged plot to kill Jewish people in NYC around Oct. 7,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/oct-7-nyc-terror-plot-arrest-rcna170040,2024-09-07T16:27:36Z,"A 20-year-old Pakistani citizen planned a mass shooting at a Jewish center in Brooklyn in support of ISIS, the Justice Department said.

A Pakistani man who resides in Canada was arrested this week for planning to carry out a mass shooting at a Jewish center in New York City around Oct. 7, the first anniversary of Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel, the Justice Department said on Friday.

Muhammad Shahzeb Khan, 20, had allegedly planned to attack a Jewish center in Brooklyn in support of the Islamic State group, or ISIS. He also considered carrying out a shooting on Oct. 11, which is Yom Kippur, the holiest day in Judaism, federal officials said.

Khan, also known as Shahzeb Jadoon, was arrested on Wednesday in or around Ormstown, Canada, which is about 12 miles from the U.S. border, the Justice Department said. The U.S. government said it will seek to extradite him from Canada.

Khan has been charged with one count of attempting to provide material support and resources to a designated foreign terrorist organization, which carries up to 20 years in prison. It's unclear if he has obtained legal representation. The Federal Defenders of New York did not immediately respond to NBC News' request for comment on Friday.

According to the criminal complaint, Khan began expressing his support for ISIS and his desire to carry out terrorist attacks in support of the group as early as November 2023 by way of social media and in communications with an FBI informant.

From late July 2024 on, Khan started communicating with two undercover law enforcement officers, telling them through encrypted messages that he was planning an attack on Jewish Chabads in a U.S. city with AR-style rifles and claiming that he had found a smuggler to take him across the border from Canada into the U.S., the complaint states. He then allegedly changed his location target to New York City, citing its large Jewish population.

""The defendant is alleged to have planned a terrorist attack in New York City around October 7th of this year with the stated goal of slaughtering, in the name of ISIS, as many Jewish people as possible,"" Attorney General Merrick Garland said in a statement. ""Jewish communities -- like all communities in this country -- should not have to fear that they will be targeted by a hate-fueled terrorist attack,"" he added.

There has been a sharp increase in reports of antisemitism and anti-Muslim hate in the U.S. since Oct. 7, when Hamas launched its attacks on Israel, killing over 1,200 people. Israel responded with a mass assault on Gaza that has killed more than 40,000 people to date, Palestinian health officials say. The war has also sparked multiple violent -- even deadly -- incidents against Jewish and Muslim people in the U.S."

JENIN, Israeli-occupied West Bank -- Israeli forces have withdrawn from the Jenin urban refugee camp in the northern Israeli-occupied West Bank, according to Jenin's mayor. This comes after a major military raid into Palestinian towns, as the Israeli army vows to root out militant groups.

Mayor Nidal Ebeidy said the troops left a trail of destruction, bulldozing roads under which the Israeli military says Palestinians hide improvised explosives, and destroying homes and mosques where they say militants operate from.

The operation on Jenin, Tulkarem and al-Faraa urban camps is the largest since the start of the war against Hamas in Gaza almost a year ago, and has so far killed 39 Palestinians, according to Palestinian health officials, and three Israeli police officers, according to the Israeli military.

The Israeli military said it launched the raids on Aug. 28 to root out fighters who operate within these towns to stave off an attack similar to the one on Oct. 7, when Hamas-led militants attacked Israel, killing some 1,200 people, according to Israeli officials. The attack triggered the war in Gaza which the Gaza health ministry says has killed over 40,800 Palestinians.

""The Israeli forces have destroyed 70% of infrastructure of Jenin,"" Ebeidy told NPR. ""It encircled the hospitals and killed civilians, and destroyed our power grid. Now we are starting to rebuild Jenin one more time.""

The heart of Palestinian armed resistance

The Israeli government built the Jenin refugee camp outside Jenin city in the northern West Bank for displaced Palestinians after the 1948 war, when Israel was created. It's home to about 24,000 residents, according to the United Nations.

Like most refugee camps across the West Bank, Jenin's began as a collection of temporary housing for Palestinians to shelter in, but over time, residents built concrete buildings, schools and shops, turning it into an urban town.

Israeli troops have raided the Jenin refugee camp many times since the beginning of the war in Gaza. Once bustling with residents in markets and schools, its roads are now piles of rubble from Israeli military bulldozers, and mosques and homes are blown up, with people's belongings strewn everywhere.

For decades Jenin has been a stronghold for many militants who say they are fighting the Israeli occupation.

One of those men is 30-year-old Tareq Abu Mohammed, who is part of the militant group Islamic Jihad. When NPR met him in July, before the current fighting, he was standing guard on the side of a street outside a supermarket with another fighter. Both were carrying an automatic weapon.

Nearby was the Damaj neighborhood. It's normally where the fighters can be found, but on the day of NPR's visit it was eerily quiet. A drone faintly hummed overhead. Someone had spray-painted the words ""The Alley of Death"" in Arabic on the walls of buildings. The fighters normally sleep here during the day in preparation for potential Israeli military night raids.

Jenin was a flashpoint even before the Hamas attack from Gaza on Oct. 7.

It was the site of several battles during the Palestinian uprising in the early 2000s known as the Second Intifada, and while the Palestinian Authority is meant to be policing the camps, it's really the fighters who control things around here.

In July 2023, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he was launching a new crackdown on militants from these camps.

""If Jenin will return to terrorism, then we will return to Jenin,"" Netanyahu said.

Since the Oct. 7 attacks by Hamas, the Israeli military has stepped up its incursions into the West Bank's refugee camps.

Israel says they are breeding grounds for new militants.

A fighter's purpose

After agreeing to an interview with NPR, Abu Mohammed sat on a stack of soda cans in a grocery store, cradling his gun.

He said he was in and out of Israeli prisons for about five years.

After Oct. 7, he got a call from Israeli security to turn himself in. Instead he picked up his weapon.

""Whoever sees the injustice we go through in those prisons, comes out and continues fighting,"" Abu Mohammed said.

He described getting little food in prison and prisoners being beaten and humiliated by Israeli forces.

Abu Mohammed said there was no use trying to wipe out the militants.

""Kill one of us, a thousand will pop up, our morale is high,"" he said.

Abu Mohammed said he was ready to die for the sake of his land, but it's not what he actually wishes he was doing with his life.

A farmer by trade, he said he's always wanted a wife, children and a job, but there was hopelessness under occupation.

""We all want to live,"" he said. ""We are fighting so we can live, not just for the sake of dying.""

Youth with a death wish

On the outskirts of the West Bank's largest city, Ramallah, is another urban refugee camp called Qalandiya. The Israeli military has raided Qalandiya almost nightly since the war in Gaza began.

Ahmad Aslan, 24, lived in Qalandiya until his death on July 24. His family told NPR that on that day, the Israeli military entered their town and soldiers started breaking into homes, searching them. Aslan's parents said Israeli soldiers surrounded the camp, and he was stuck in his uncle's house with his cousins. They ran to the roof to look down, and that's when, they said, Ahmad was shot.

The Israeli military told NPR the raid was to demolish the home of a man who had killed two Israelis at a gas station in the West Bank.

It said that during the raid, soldiers opened fire at people gathered on rooftops to throw rocks and Molotov cocktails at them.

A day after his death, Aslan's cousin released a video Aslan sent him days earlier. In it, Aslan shyly introduces himself as ""the martyr Ahmad Aslan"" and says he wishes to die fighting the Israeli occupation. He points to an empty grave in the Qalandiya cemetery.

""God willing, I want my grave to be here,"" he says. ""Here is Yasser, and here is Ahmad Aslan's.""

Yasser was his best friend, whose family says also died in an Israeli military raid a few months earlier.

A week later, the Aslan family was still receiving mourners paying their condolences. His mother, Amina Aslan, wore all black and maintained a brave face. She said he would always talk about hoping to die fighting the occupation, a topic that would make her mad. She pulled out a text message exchange they had a few days before he died.

""I told him: I swear if you keep talking like this, I will stop speaking to you!"" she read out loud. ""Go die! I'll stop speaking to you!""

Aslan is one of a rising number of young men in the West Bank with such a death wish, according to Palestinians in the camp.

The war in Gaza, and Israel's expanding settlements in the West Bank, have made the prospect of a Palestinian state ever more distant.

Unemployment is high, and with no future in sight, hopes are even lower.

Like Aslan, many young men say that their only choice is to fight the Israeli occupation.

Some take up arms and join militant groups, others throw rocks at Israeli soldiers during raids.

Aslan's mother said that every time there was an Israeli military incursion, her son would rush to join the youths on the streets.

In Aslan's bedroom, his father, Nidal, pointed to items laid out neatly on his son's bunk bed -- a baseball cap, cigarette lighters, a piece of clothing blotted with blood.

He said these are all mementos his son collected and kept from his friends who were killed in Israeli raids. He said his son's ultimate wish was to join his friends in heaven.

""Ahmed used to say, 'sure I have friends, but those who have gone are dear to me,' "" said Nidal Aslan."
How Harris will distinguish her foreign policy from Biden  --  and Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/07/nx-s1-5074203/kamala-harris-foreign-policy,2024-09-07T10:07:31Z,"For the past 3½ years, Vice President Harris has carried out President Biden's agenda around the globe, traveling to 21 countries, working with allies to combat authoritarianism.

But now, as the Democratic presidential nominee, there are questions about how Harris herself sees the world and the United States' role in it -- and what her foreign policy would look like if she wins the election in November.

It's an issue likely to be front and center in Tuesday's debate with former President Donald Trump. Republicans have sought to blame Harris for what they cast as the foreign policy failures of the Biden administration -- from the chaotic withdrawal in Afghanistan to the number of migrants at the southern border

""If Kamala wins, foreign leaders will treat America's president as a joke,"" Trump said at a rally in Montana last month. ""They already do.""

Harris has tried to present a contrast with Trump

Harris, for her part, is trying to contrast her vision for the world with Trump, while offering ever-so-subtle distinctions with Biden. Her speech at the Democratic convention last month was aimed at showing how she would lead as commander in chief.

""As president, I will never waver in defense of America's security and ideals, because in the enduring struggle between democracy and tyranny, I know where I stand and I know where the United States belongs,"" Harris said.

Earlier this year at the Munich Security Conference, before she was the nominee, Harris told European leaders that ""isolation is not insulation."" It was a reference to Trump's world view. During his time in office, the former president slapped tariffs on allies and threatened to pull out of NATO.

In contrast, the day after she was inaugurated, Harris made her first international call as vice president to the head of the World Health Organization to discuss the administration's decision to rejoin the group. Trump had pulled out of the WHO during the pandemic.

How Harris differs from Biden

As vice president, Harris made a point of visiting Africa -- something Biden promised to do, but has not yet done. A senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe Harris' work behind the scenes said she has had an emphasis on the Global South in her work.

Harris has endorsed and echoed Biden's emphasis on managing competition with China and supporting Ukraine in its fight against Russia.

When it comes to the war in Gaza -- one of the biggest foreign policy challenges for whoever wins the election in November -- Harris has said Israel has a right to defend itself and that she will ensure it has the ""ability"" to do so.

At the same time, she was among the first voices in the administration to emphasize the humanitarian suffering of Palestinians in Gaza. But to date she has offered little indication of how her rhetorical empathy may translate into policy.

While their world views largely align, Harris and Biden have different personal and professional experiences that inform their decisions, aides said.

Harris is the daughter of immigrants -- an Indian mother and a Jamaican father. ""She is not of the Cold War generation,"" said Nancy McEldowney, who served as Harris' national security adviser during the early part of the Biden administration.

""She is very mindful of the fact that the world has changed in fundamental ways over the course, not just of the last 50 years, but of the last five years,"" McEldowney said.

Harris came to Washington in 2017 as a politician who had built her career domestically as a prosecutor.

The then-newly minted senator for California joined the Intelligence Committee, and that experience was critical in shaping her thinking. The committee launched a multiyear investigation looking into Russia's interference in the 2016 election.

""She was really kind of thrown into what was the most critical national security issue at that time, which was defending against Russia's threat to our democracy,"" said Halie Soifer, who worked as Harris' national security adviser at the time and is now the CEO of the Jewish Democratic Council of America.

Harris' prosecutorial background informs her world view

Harris' foreign policy developed through her work on intelligence and cyber security. And she became particularly focused on international rules and norms, said Rebecca Bill Chavez, co-director of foreign policy for Harris' 2020 presidential bid.

It's a throughline Chavez, now CEO of the Inter-American Dialogue, says she has seen with the vice president's work in Central America.

""She's been very active in working with the countries of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras in pushing for the rule of law and for judicial security,"" Chavez said.

Her prosecutorial background is a factor in how she thinks about international issues. McEldowney recalls that on international trips, Harris wanted to see the highest court ""to see where it was located, how it was presented, and to get a frame of how countries dealt with the laws that govern society.""

She says Harris also thinks a lot about technology and how that intersects with foreign policy.

""She has spent much of her time as vice president focused on issues that she knows are going to be significant going forward, such as cyber and AI and space,"" McEldowney said."
