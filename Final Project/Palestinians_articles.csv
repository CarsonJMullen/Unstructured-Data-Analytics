One boy's story shows the impact of rising Israeli settler violence in the West Bank,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/the-picture-show/2024/10/08/g-s1-22630/photos-palestinian-family-impact-israeli-settler-violence-occupied-west-bank,2024-10-08T11:33:53Z,"Noor Assi, 15, sits on his bed while watched by his 5-year-old sister Jenna in the village of Qarawat Bani Hassan, Israeli-occupied West Bank, on Feb. 23. Ayman Oghanna for NPR hide caption

In a carpentry shop in the village of Qarawat Bani Hassan, in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, Noor Assi is at work packaging a wooden table. He tears off strips of tape, tying it to padded cardboard, before flipping the table on its side.

He says he is 15 ""and a half,"" a measurement in age split between the innocence of youth and a desire for manhood.

The war in Gaza has caused tensions to flare across the Middle East, especially in places like the West Bank. The Israeli-occupied territory is the most violent it has been in decades. United Nations figures say that almost 700 Palestinians in the area have been killed, either by Israeli forces or settlers, in the past year. Noor's father was among those fatally shot.

""My childhood is gone,"" Noor says. He was forced to grow up by a grim rite of passage.

On Dec. 2, Israeli settlers raided his village in the central West Bank and shot his father, Ahmed Assi, dead, according to the family, residents and local officials.

The Israeli military told NPR that they responded to a physical confrontation between Palestinians and Israeli citizens in Qarawat Bani Hassan with riot disposal means and live fire and that the circumstances of Assi's death were still under review.

Ahmed Assi's mother, Noor's grandmother, shows bloodied clothes and a sweatshirt with a single bullet hole in the back. Assi's 5-year-old daughter, Jenna, looks on, wearing a necklace with a picture of her dead dad.

""When my father was martyred, I started to work, I took over my father's profession, I started working and spending on the house. I was smart and managed things, meaning I became responsible for the house,"" Noor says.

Noor dropped out of school, working full time in the family's carpentry warehouse, sometimes for 13 hours a day, to provide for his five siblings.

""I am responsible for them now. I take care of them and whatever they want, I get them. I don't let them want for anything.""

Noor looks young, is shy and has a boyish haircut -- long on top, a fade on the sides and back. He maintains his look with regular visits to the village barbershop.

In the Middle East, the barbershop is not just a place to cut your hair. It's also a place to socialize, hang out and talk about everything from family to sports and politics. Not long after Noor gets his trim, the village's mayor, Ibrahim Assi, enters. He is a distant relative of Noor's. It's a small community and family ties are strong. A poster of Noor's deceased father is plastered outside.

The mayor explains that Qarawat Bani Hassan is surrounded by an ever-expanding network of Israeli settlements and outposts. About 500,000 Israeli settlers live in the occupied West Bank, according to the United Nations. The settlements they live in are deemed illegal by the international community. Israeli politicians like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, however, have promoted their expansion, and they're growing through a web of smaller outposts.

The mayor says that violence from the settlers is terrorizing the Palestinians who live here.

""The West Bank is currently living in a nightmare, a nightmare that has lost its security and safety due to the violence of the Ministry of Settlers, who are -- on a daily basis -- assaulting, killing and harassing and stealing. They are committing real crimes against citizens and farmers that are present on their own land,"" the mayor says.

On Dec. 2, he says, settlers entered the village, damaging property, burning cars, wounding one man and shooting Noor's father dead. His lifeless body was found hours later in an olive grove on the outskirts of Qarawat Bani Hassan.

Noor may maintain his teenage haircut. But he has the hardened hands of an older working man, no longer hanging out with friends, devoting himself, instead, to work, faith and family.

At home, he helps out with the household chores, learning to cook from his mother. He sometimes feels pangs of envy for other teenagers.

""I do get jealous, I sometimes feel like playing, like them, but it doesn't work. I have a family to take care of,"" Noor says.

On Friday, the holiest day of the week in Islam, Noor prays at the village mosque before his weekly ritual of visiting his father's grave, draped in a Palestinian flag.

Prayer is important to Noor, from morning to night. Fighting back tears, he says the Islamic funeral prayer for his father on the porch outside his home.

""O God, forgive him and have mercy on him, and heal him, and pardon him, and grant him an honorable reception.""

Noor says that each night, after prayer, he speaks to his father.

""I tell him what is happening, what we are doing, and who is coming over, for example,"" he says. ""Last time, he came to me in a dream and told me, 'Take care of your family and your brothers.' """
Harris and Trump marked 1 year since the Oct. 7 attacks with tributes to the victims,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144699/kamala-harris-donald-trump-october-7,2024-10-07T22:25:41Z,"One year after Hamas attacked Israel, both major-party presidential candidates marked the date on Monday with promises of continued support for the Jewish state.

Vice President Harris remembered the victims of the Oct. 7 attack by planting a memorial tree at her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., while former President Trump visited a sacred site for Hasidic Jews in Queens, N.Y.

""I will never forget October 7, and the world must never forget,"" Harris said during a tree-planting ceremony on the grounds of the vice president's residence. ""We must work to ensure nothing like the horrors of October 7 can ever happen again.""

Hamas, which controls Gaza, killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7 and took some 250 hostage in Gaza, according to Israel. A year later, more than 100 hostages are still unaccounted for. Israel's response to the attack has killed at least 41,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials.

Harris reiterated her support for Israel's defense, and promised the Biden administration would continue working to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. She then read the names of seven missing American citizens.

Harris also called for efforts to ""relieve the immense suffering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza who have experienced so much pain and loss over the year.""

She appeared alongside her husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish and and who has led White House efforts to fight antisemitism.

Trump met with members of an Orthodox Jewish community in New York on Monday morning, and visited the grave of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, an influential orthodox rabbi who died in 1994. Trump was then scheduled to attend an Oct. 7 remembrance event Monday evening with Jewish leaders, according to Trump campaign officials.

Hamas' stated goal is the elimination of Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel says the objective of the war in Gaza is to eliminate Hamas.

The war has exposed rifts within the Democratic Party over the Biden-Harris administration's support for Israel. Those divides are particularly pronounced among younger voters -- a key voting bloc for Democrats and a group more likely than older voters to express sympathy for the Palestinian people. According to the Pew Research Center, voters ages 18-29 also are less supportive of U.S. military aid to Israel.

Trump has sought to capitalize on those tensions within his rival's party, saying recently that any Jewish voter who supports a Democrat is a ""fool."" Those remarks drew widespread criticism from Jewish organizations across the ideological spectrum.

He continued emphasizing the message in an interview Monday with radio host Hugh Hewitt. ""I did more for Israel than anybody, I did more for the Jewish people than anybody, and it's not a reciprocal, as they say,"" Trump said."
"'All this blood, all this death': Palestinians protest Israel war with no end in sight",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144289/israel-hamas-gaza-war-palestinians-protest-west-bank,2024-10-07T21:43:45Z,"A year after the Hamas attack, Israel continues its military campaign in Gaza, while its operations in the occupied West Bank have expanded significantly.

For Palestinian civilians caught in the middle of the ongoing conflict between Israeli forces and the Hamas militant group, the consequences have been unremittingly difficult, and deadly.

The death toll from Israel's offensive in Gaza is now approaching 42,000 Palestinians, with another 39 deaths recorded Monday at local hospitals, according to Gaza's health authorities.

Hamas, designated a terrorist group by the United States and several other nations, has seen its control over territory in Gaza diminish over the past 12 months, leaving a political and logistical vacuum that international aid groups have struggled to fill.

Cease-fire talks between Hamas and Israel, brokered by the United States, Qatar and Egypt, are on hold, so for civilians in Gaza, the forced displacement that for many began last October, still has no end in sight.

In the Deir al-Balah region of central Gaza, 58-year-old Abu Nidal Musleh lives in a makeshift tent, wearing mismatched shoes.

The father of seven comes from the same area of northern Gaza were civilians were once again ordered to evacuate Monday, and he's been displaced four times in the last year.

When Hamas-led fighters attacked communities in southern Israel a year ago, they killed more than 1,200 and seized about 250 hostages, according to Israeli officials. Musleh was a teacher on his way to school that day.

He told NPR on Monday he feels empathy for the Israeli hostages held by Hamas -- but he blames Israel's prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu for the suffering both sides have endured, and he insists peace will only be possible if Israeli citizens oust their premier.

""Rise up against Netanyahu,"" he said. ""Rise up -- so we can have normal relations.""

Meanwhile, in the West Bank, violence has worsened in the past year between Palestinian militants belonging to Hamas and other armed groups, and Israeli settlers and the Israeli military, which oversees the occupied territory with a vast network of checkpoints and military outposts.

Over the past few months, some of the heaviest Israeli airstrikes in decades have rocked Palestinian communities in the West Bank, killing dozens, alongside large-scale raids into cities including Jenin.

In Ramallah, the Israeli-occupied West Bank's biggest city, dozens of Palestinians gathered in the main square Monday, waving Palestinian flags and carrying anti-occupation signs.

Basma Abu Sway said she had come to mark one year since the war in Gaza began, and called last Oct. 7 one of the most important days in Palestinian history.

She said she hopes the sacrifices made by Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank will not be for nothing.

""All this blood, all this death is bringing peace to Palestine,"" she said. ""We deserve as Palestinian people to live in complete liberation.""

Settler violence and Israeli military raids into towns and villages in the West Bank have killed more than 730 Palestinians since the beginning of the war, according to a combined count of data from the United Nations and Palestinian health authorities.

On Monday the Palestinian advocacy group, Palestinian Prisoners' Club,, announced that Israeli military forces had arrested 45 people through Sunday night into Monday morning across the West Bank.

Rima Nazzal was also in Ramallah's Manara Square Monday, and said she felt concern and fear -- worried that Israel's occupation of Palestinians would grow stronger as a result of the its military's actions after Oct. 7 last year.

""The world says Israel has a right to defend itself,"" she said. ""As if it says Israel has a right to defend its occupation."""

This story is a part of an NPR series reflecting on Oct. 7, a year of war and how it has changed life across Israel, the Gaza Strip, the region and the world.

NPR journalists have spent the past year witnessing, capturing and documenting the suffering and pain that war has inflicted on people in the Gaza Strip, Israel, the occupied West Bank and Lebanon.

For Israelis, it began when Hamas militants stormed out of the Gaza Strip on Oct. 7 last year, attacking soldiers, families in their homes and a rave packed with young people. The attacks killed around 1,200 people and took 250 hostage, according to Israeli authorities.

Israelis have been divided since: Many have spent the past year in rallies demanding a cease-fire that frees the hostages. Others have pressed their government to continue fighting Hamas, even blocking aid crossing into Gaza.

In Gaza, nothing looks the same a year into the war. Among the more than 41,000 Palestinians killed by Israeli fire this past year are hundreds of families, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. More than half of those killed are women and children. Around 100,000 others in Gaza have been wounded, thousands of them children who have lost limbs.

A year on, nearly everyone in Gaza is displaced, huddling in bombed out schools and under makeshift tents without electricity, running water or safety.

Below is a collection of moments from the past 365 days of this war, captured by NPR photographers and others across the region."
"'If You Can Keep It': The War In Gaza, One Year Later : 1A",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/1210935852/1a-10-07-2024,2024-10-07T19:10:16Z,"Israeli army soldiers stand by as a yellow ribbon along with the number 365, signifying the number of days since the October 7, 2023 attacks.

Today is Oct. 7, marking one year since the Hamas-led attacks in southern Israel.

Hamas fighters killed over 1,200 people. In response, the Israeli government launched airstrikes and a ground invasion in Gaza, killing almost 42,000 people so far according to Palestinian health authorities.

Despite repeated attempts, the United States has failed to broker a ceasefire - in both Gaza and now at Israel's northern border as its military targets the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Last week, Israel said it secured $8.7 billion from the U.S. for its ongoing military efforts.

Typically, each week leading up to Nov. 5, we focus on the stakes of this election, for people, our country and our democracy.

Today's ""If You Can Keep It"" discussion will sound a little different.

What are the stakes of the U.S. election for the people of a Middle East in conflict?"
"1 year after Hamas attacked Israel, the conflict grows more dangerous than ever",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/g-s1-26381/hamas-israel-hezbollah-gaza-lebanon,2024-10-07T16:07:28Z,"A girl walks through the rubble of a collapsed building in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Oct. 2, amid the war in the Palestinian territory between Israel and Hamas.

Thousands breached a border fence. Others arrived in speedboats. Some even came by paraglider in a dawn attack by Hamas fighters a year ago that caught Israel by surprise, leaving 1,200 people dead and another 250 as hostages. It also set in motion events that now threaten to turn Israel's long-running conflict with Iran's proxies into a direct and dangerous war with Tehran.

Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023, marked the deadliest day in the history of modern Israel, triggering a devastating attack on Palestinians. The result has been a humanitarian catastrophe for Gaza. Beginning in the days after the Hamas attack, Israeli warplanes began punishing airstrikes inside the narrow strip of Palestinian territory that also lies adjacent to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. By the end of the month, Israeli forces had launched a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza.

At the one-year mark in the Israel-Hamas war, here are four things that are key to where things stand today.

In the aftermath of the Hamas attack, as Israelis mourned those killed, they also feared for the safety of the hostages. A central plaza in downtown Tel Aviv, unofficially dubbed Hostages Square, was quickly transformed into a gathering place for the families, friends and supporters of the captives. ""Bring them home now!"" emerged as a potent rallying cry, and posters showing the faces and names of the hostages became ubiquitous. Many Israelis began wearing special necklaces, bracelets and T-shirts to show their support for the captives. Daily vigils in Hostages Square drew large crowds.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- already weathering intense criticism for intelligence failures in the lead-up to the surprise attack -- came under intense pressure to halt the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages.

Although Israel and Hamas managed a brief cease-fire in November that allowed for the exchange of more than 100 hostages for nearly 250 Palestinian prisoners, the truce lasted just a week. Hamas did unilaterally release four hostages, and eight others were rescued by Israeli forces. Israel's military also recovered the bodies of several hostages.

The fate of the remaining captives in Gaza has remained an open wound for many Israelis. Netanyahu's office believes that of the 101 hostages still unaccounted for in Gaza, about a third are likely dead.

The hostages question continues to shape Israel's public response to the conflict.

Since the start of Israel's military response, the country's attacks have killed at least 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 16,500 children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Another 95,000 people have been injured, the ministry says.

Israel's military began its assault on Hamas in the north of Gaza, and as Palestinian civilians sought to escape the fighting, most of them fled southward, displacing them from their homes and cutting them off from critical infrastructure needed for daily survival.

Recent data from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization and Palestinian officials in Gaza indicate the attacks have damaged or destroyed more than half of Gaza's homes, 80% of its commercial facilities and 85% of the territory's schools.

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has called the humanitarian situation in Gaza a ""moral stain on us all,"" and the aid group Refugees International has said that Israel's military response ""has wrought disproportionate death and suffering among civilians in Gaza, generating famine-like conditions while obstructing and undermining the humanitarian response.""

Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, which Israeli authorities considered to be a Hamas stronghold, experienced some of the most intense bombardment of the conflict.

In the first few months of fighting, Rafah, near the border with Egypt in southern Gaza, was designated as a ""safe zone"" by the Israeli military -- meant as a place where civilians could shelter and get access to desperately needed international humanitarian aid. Even so, Israel continued to carry out airstrikes on Rafah, some targeted at Hamas fighters or facilities, while others aimed to free Israeli hostages, according to the Israeli military. Some of those airstrikes hit homes, killing and injuring dozens of civilians, and others destroyed food distribution sites. More than half of Gaza's prewar population of 2.2 million was believed to be sheltering in Rafah. In May, Israel issued evacuation orders for the city and launched an offensive that sealed the border with Egypt, which until then was one of the main entry points for humanitarian aid.

Food, drinking water and materials for temporary shelters are in short supply and are being carried in by trucks operated by international relief organizations. People in Gaza are down to one meal every other day, and an estimated 50,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are in urgent need of treatment for malnutrition.

U.S. efforts to speed aid to Gaza have also floundered. A special $230 million temporary floating pier known as the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore system (JLOTS) operated only intermittently as damage from high winds and rough seas in the eastern Mediterranean repeatedly rendered it inoperable.

Besides the brief cease-fire to facilitate a hostages-for-prisoners swap, repeated rounds of peace talks -- some mediated by Qatar -- have failed to make much progress. Deep-seated animosities and the fragmented nature of the Palestinian leadership have played a part in preventing any lasting peace deal.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has tried to walk a fine line between diplomatic and military support for its long-term ally, Israel, and a desire to mitigate the suffering in Gaza while trying to contain a wider war that increasingly has dragged Iran and Israel into direct conflict and could engulf the rest of the Middle East.

For the moment, cease-fire talks that at times sparked optimism have fallen silent.

In late September, Secretary of State Antony Blinken summed up the U.S. position, saying, ""Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorism. The way it does so matters.""

Meanwhile, public opinion in the U.S. has been split largely along partisan lines, with conservatives showing support for Israel, but some people, younger and more liberal, turning out for pro-Palestinian rallies on college campuses.

Among Democrats, more than half say that Israel bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war in Gaza, while only about 4 in 10 Republicans do, according to a Pearson Institute/AP-NORC poll published last week.

That political dichotomy could influence the outcome of a likely tight U.S. presidential race, with some Democrats suggesting that Netanyahu is ignoring the Biden administration's peace entreaties in an effort to tip the election toward former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, voters in key battleground states give Trump higher marks than his opponent, Vice President Harris, on foreign policy matters, according to a recent poll by the New York-based Institute for Global Affairs.

From the opening days of the conflict in Gaza, the Biden administration warned against allowing the Hamas attack to morph into a war that could bring in Hezbollah -- the Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant group -- as a primary combatant and could eventually lead to a direct conflict with Tehran.

But increasingly in recent weeks, that's exactly what seems to be happening.

On Oct. 8, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets against Israel in support of the Palestinian militants fighting in Gaza. Israel hit back, and for months, low-level conflict simmered along the Lebanon-Israel border. Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, mostly stayed out of the conflict. But an Israeli attack in April against an Iranian diplomatic base in Syria that killed several of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers changed the dynamic. Less than two weeks later, Iran retaliated with a large-scale drone and missile strike on Israel. The attack, heavily telegraphed by Tehran in an apparent effort to contain the fallout, was easily repulsed by Israeli air defenses, assisted by the United States.

Fast-forward to last month: In an operation credited to Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, in synchronized attacks over two days, electronic pagers belonging to members of Hezbollah suddenly exploded across Lebanon, killing more than a dozen people -- including two children -- and wounding thousands more, according to Lebanese health authorities.

Soon after, Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes against southern Lebanon that it said were aimed at Hezbollah targets. One that hit a residential building in downtown Beirut killed a top Hezbollah commander.

As Israeli airstrikes continued days later, multiple residential buildings in southern Beirut were demolished. On Sept. 27, Israel announced that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who led the militant group for more than three decades, was killed in one of the strikes. Hezbollah later confirmed his death.

Israel also hit ports and power stations in Yemen operated by another Iran-backed group, the Houthis.

The United Nations says about 1 million Lebanese have fled their homes amid the Israeli airstrikes. Israeli authorities say about 63,000 Israelis remain displaced from the border area with Lebanon due to Hezbollah rocket fire.

On Oct. 1, Israel opened a ground offensive in southern Lebanon, a move that hearkened back to a similar 1982 invasion of the country's south by Israeli forces, which led to an 18-year occupation and to a monthlong war that Israel fought against Hezbollah in 2006. Less than 24 hours later, Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack on Israel. The country's extensive defenses -- bolstered by two U.S. destroyers deployed in the region -- intercepted most of the Iranian missiles. However, Israeli officials acknowledge that some of the Iranian missiles did hit an air base."

The war in the Middle East is personal in the swing state of Michigan. The GOP and Democrats are focused on the Arab and Muslim American voting bloc, and the state has the largest Lebanese American population in the country. Many in the state have families living in the areas of Lebanon that are being bombed right now.

A new report has found that both Harris' and Trump's economic plans would increase the national debt. According to the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, Trump's plan would add an estimated $7.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, while Harris' proposals would cost the government an estimated $3.5 trillion. The committee has cautioned that there could be a future fiscal crisis if politicians do not take more decisive action on the national debt. Let's take a closer look at the details of both economic plans.

This essay was written by Daniel Estrin, NPR's international correspondent in Jerusalem.

""The day still keeps surprising us,"" my colleague Anas Baba in Gaza texted me last Oct. 7, close to midnight.

I was at a hospital in southern Israel. The waiting room was full of parents in a daze, waiting for word about their children who had come under attack at an outdoor techno rave near the Gaza border. In Gaza, our producer Anas was taking photos of families fleeing their homes as Israeli airstrikes rained down.

It was the deadliest day in Israeli history. It sparked the deadliest war in Palestinian history. One year later, it has grown into a regional war. Every day keeps surprising us.

A year later, I find myself thinking about where the survivors and witnesses of this war draw strength.

I think about Batya Ofir, a woman my colleague Itay Stern and I met the other day at Kibbutz Be'eri, the Israeli village that suffered the greatest loss -- 102 people there were killed. Her brother was killed along with his family. She felt survivor's guilt, and she told us she asked herself whether she wanted to keep on living.

""I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she said. Today, she is learning how to kayak in the sea to help her face her fears. ""I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

Our colleague Anas Baba in Gaza has been reporting for NPR in Gaza all year. Again and again, he has videotaped bodies brought into the morgue after Israeli airstrikes. He always trains his camera on young children, sheltering near the morgue, standing alone and watching silently as bodies are laid out.

What gives him strength, he said, is collecting biscuits and fruit to give to the children he meets. ""I can help them survive,"" he told me.

He often meets a young girl named Habiba at the hospital in central Gaza. She's been colorblind since birth. One day, she told Anas she saw a man drowning with water coming out of his nose. It wasn't water; it was blood.

""This girl does not know the color of blood,"" Anas told me. ""I wish all the children in Gaza were colorblind now."""

Memorial services across Israel are taking place Monday, a year on since Hamas' attacks on communities close to the country's border with Gaza, and as the Israeli military extends its retaliation against the group in Gaza as well as on Hezbollah targets to the north in Lebanon.

Twelve months ago, fighters from Hamas, which is designated a terrorist organization by the United States and several other nations, killed around 1,200 people and seized more than 200 hostages from inside Israel, according to the Israeli government.

The ensuing war in Gaza has killed at least 41,900 Palestinians and wounded more than 97,300, according to Gaza's health ministry on Monday.

In Lebanon, where Hezbollah has fired thousands of rockets on Israel in support of Hamas and Palestinians in Gaza, the death toll has risen above 2,000, according to Lebanese officials. Israeli airstrikes continued to pound parts of the capital Beirut overnight into Monday, after rockets launched from Lebanon hit the Israeli port city of Haifa Sunday. The United Nations says more than 1 million Lebanese have been displaced from their homes, including tens of thousands who have fled across the border into neighboring Syria.

Across the world, candlelight vigils are taking place Monday to commemorate those killed in the surprise Hamas attacks one year ago, with thousands planning to gather, from Tel Aviv to Paris to New York, as well as marches and protests to demand a cease-fire, particularly in Gaza.

Talks to produce a cease-fire, which many Israelis hope would see the estimated remaining 101 hostages released by Hamas, are on hold.

Across Israel, memorial events will mark the deadliest day in the country's history. The government has organized one, another is being led by the family members of Israeli taken hostage or killed, and more are being held in locations close to Gaza where the attacks happened last year.

One of those is at the Nova music festival site, where Israelis gathered Monday to listen to the last track of music played there before Hamas fighters ambushed festival-goers.

A wail in the crowd pierced a moment of silence, as attendees remembered the more than 360 people killed at the site a year ago.

""We tried to wake up from this nightmare, but we cannot,"" said Ofir Duchovne, who was there to mourn his 26-year-old friend. ""I did not imagine that the war would be so long in Gaza. And now we have another front on the north and with Iran,"" Duchovne said. ""And we're stuck. Nothing has changed.""

Nearby, frequent Israeli artillery fire into Gaza was audible, and the Israeli military said it had responded with airstrikes to rockets had been launched out of Gaza at almost the same moment they had done a year ago, at the start of the current war.

At another rally in nearby Kibbutz Be'eri, a community close to Gaza where almost 100 residents were killed and more than two dozen hostages seized, the plight of those still held inside Gaza was central to the event.

""Wars do not end in absolute victory or a clear decision, wars end in agreements,"" said Merav Svirsky, whose brother Itay Svirsky was taken hostage and then killed in January in Gaza. ""The question is, with how many human lives will we pay by then? The lives of soldiers, the lives of civilians and the lives of civilians including our people who are currently hostage in Gaza and have been in immediate life-threatening danger for a year."""

This tight-knit Israeli community near the Gaza border is digging up its dead from temporary graves further away and reburying them back home, where it is safer to gather now, a year into the Gaza war.

""I'm so exhausted after every funeral that we have to deal with again,"" said Gal Cohen, the head of the kibbutz. ""Because it brings [back] everything, and we cry again.""

Israeli authorities say about 1,200 people were killed last Oct. 7, as Hamas led thousands of attackers bursting out of Gaza, ambushing Israeli towns and communities. Kibbutz Be'eri suffered the biggest loss of any single village: 102 people killed -- about one out of every 13 people living there.

The deadliest single attack in Israeli history led to the deadliest war in Palestinian history, with more than 41,000 Palestinians killed in the Gaza Strip this past year, according to health officials there.

This year, Kibbutz Be'eri has grappled with questions of death, memory, guilt and vengeance.

""Questions from [the] inferno, really,"" says Merav Roth, a prominent Israeli psychologist, and the sister of former Israeli prime minister Yair Lapid, who has counseled the kibbutz members all year long.

This is the story of some of their answers.

Silence is what helped keep the survivors of this small community alive the day of the attack. Silence is what they carried out of hiding from their safe rooms along the Gaza border to a hotel on the Dead Sea that took them in.

""It was the most quiet place I've ever seen,"" says Roth, who met them there. ""Everybody were quiet, defeated. Their bodies were, like, no air inside.""

She had heard their whispers on Oct. 7, carried live on the news.

""The Israelis, we all were on the radio, hearing them whispering to the radio people: 'Why doesn't anyone come? Where are everybody? Where's the army? They're in my house, they're shooting at me.' We will remember this for the rest of our lives, all of us,"" Roth says.

When the Israeli military eventually published its investigation into the attack on Kibbutz Be'eri, it found about 340 attackers had infiltrated the community and that it had taken about seven hours for significant numbers of Israeli forces to arrive to fight off the invasion there.

It took many weeks to account for everyone: who was dead, who was captive in Gaza. Roth sat with the survivors of Kibbutz Be'eri in the Dead Sea hotel basement as the village secretary read the names of 27 identified bodies and 108 people unaccounted for.

""It's just name by name by name,"" Roth said. ""Everybody are, again, quiet, dead quiet.""

This year, Roth has helped the kibbutz make agonizing decisions.

""For instance, there is a boy in the kibbutz who lost four members of his family, two parents and two siblings. So do we tell him about each separately or do we tell him about all of them together?"" she says.

Roth has also counseled former hostages who returned from Hamas captivity in Gaza, families whose loved ones were killed in captivity, and Israelis who didn't experience a personal loss but still suffer from sleeping difficulties, anxiety attacks and depression.

""They are extremely anxious about the future of this place. Many of them leave the country. Because their parents told them that in the Holocaust, those who didn't leave, died,"" she says. ""Hopelessness and helplessness are so strong. The trauma is national.""

From the very first days after the Oct. 7 attack, Roth coached other therapists how to respond.

""When I gave guidelines to the therapists in Be'eri at the beginning, I said, smile and say, how are you? Because these people don't know that it still matters. You have to show them that their wellbeing is still relevant. The life instinct wants to see that someone calls him back.""

At Kibbutz Be'eri, one recent afternoon, teens and parents walked quietly out of the neighborhood cemetery after a funeral for a mother and her 15-year-old son -- two of the many reburials of recent months.

Reburied with the boy was his surfboard: his dying wish as he bled out in his home Oct. 7.

Batya Ofir attended the funeral. She recently reburied her own brother and his family in the kibbutz cemetery, after viewing his partially decomposed body be exhumed from its temporary grave.

""It was not easy,"" she says, ""but I had to see him.""

She wanted to be with his body at the moment it was unearthed. She had not lived on the kibbutz any longer and felt guilty she wasn't with her brother and family in their worst moment on Oct. 7.

Ofir says she made a decision, after her brother was killed.

""I said to myself, what do you want? To continue living? I can also not. I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she says. ""I have a family, I have children, I have grandchildren. I draw. I'm learning to kayak, to deal with all my fears. I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

A couple hundred families have moved back to Kibbutz Be'eri. Cohen, the head of the community, is overseeing an ambitious project to bring the residents back within two and a half years.

The kibbutz has broken ground on a new neighborhood of 52 homes.

A short walk away, though, are the homes that were attacked last year. Bullet holes, shattered windows, a pair of children's shoes in the debris: Oct. 7 frozen in time.

There's a debate in the community about what to do with these broken homes. Cohen says it will be put up for a vote.

""Some of the people say, let's make it like Auschwitz. Okay? And it'll be open for people to come and see what happened here,"" he says.

But he says others who survived the attack are taking sleeping pills to cope with the trauma and cannot bear seeing the destroyed homes. ""I believe we'll have to take them all down in the end.""

He doesn't want one person moving back to the kibbutz to see the remnants and relive the nightmare.

Yasmin Raanan, 56, waters her new plants on her patio. She and her husband moved back home to the kibbutz from the Dead Sea hotel a few months ago.

On Oct. 7, she grabbed her personal firearm, and she and her husband locked themselves inside their reinforced shelter room at home. They survived the attack because they had installed a sliding bolt on the safe room. The attackers tried but failed to open the door. Her neighbors' safe rooms only had the standard locks and were breached.

When she was finally rescued that night, and led out of her safe room, she found her living room floor covered in rows of grenades, gas canisters, explosives, rocket-propelled grenades and rifles. She understood: Her home had been transformed into the attack headquarters. Neighbors all around her were gunned down.

Then she saw the man she had heard all day loading gun cartridges in her home. He was sitting outside, she says, stripped naked by orders of the military, and guarded by an Israeli soldier.

""I came with my gun to kill him,"" she recalls. ""A commando soldier said, 'Ma'am, we are a moral people.' I said, 'I have no more morals anymore.'""

The commando took away her weapon, and she says she took the attacker's face in her hands and demanded to know his name. He gave it.

One year later, the Israeli military has left much of Gaza in ruins. That gives her a measure of comfort.

And one year on, the passage of time has taken some of the edge off her anger.

""A year later, things sink in a bit,"" she says. ""Time heals."""
Israeli strike on Gaza mosque kills 19 as conflict widens in Lebanon,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5142440/israeli-gaza-lebanon-oct-7,2024-10-06T19:40:29Z,"Smoke billows from the site of an Israeli air strike that targeted a neighborhood in Beirut's southern suburbs on Oct. 6, 2024.

Israel has intensified its strikes in Gaza and Lebanon, as the expanding conflict in the Mideast approaches one full year since the Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7.

Israeli airstrikes this weekend have killed scores of people, according to health officials in Gaza and Lebanon, as Israel's government continues to mull a response to nearly 200 Iranian missiles targeting Israel last week.

In northern Gaza, the Israeli military dropped leaflets warning of a ""new phase of war,"" as commanders issued fresh evacuation orders for the several hundred thousand residents that remain in the northern part of the strip.

In the Jabaliya area of northern Gaza, Israeli ground troops have encircled a sizeable swathe of territory, where they say they have launched a large-scale assault against Hamas fighters for the first time in months, forcing civilians once more to flee.

Meanwhile, just days after sending soldiers into southern Lebanon, the Israeli military has struck buildings and other targets it links to Hezbollah across Lebanon overnight.

Israel says its recent operations inside Lebanon are part of an attempt to prevent Hezbollah rockets that have landed in northern Israel for the past year, forcing tens of thousands of Israeli civilians to evacuate towns and cities in the region.

At least 56 people have been killed in Gaza this weekend, according to the local health authorities there, prompting a seemingly endless series of funerals after a strike on a mosque Sunday. The building was so close to a nearby hospital morgue that no ambulances were required, with bodies of the at least 19 dead simply carried by hand from one compound to the next.

Israel said it had been a ""precision strike"" on the mosque, targeting Hamas militants inside, but mourners said the approaching one-year mark of the fighting in Gaza was a horrible reminder of the costs families there have faced, with more than 41,000 deaths recorded in the past 12 months.

""Enough, world, enough, tomorrow will be a complete year,"" said Hakima Al Jamal, as she watched her dying father be carried out of the mosque. ""We are tired. By God, we're so tired.""

More Israeli troops are being moved to the border with Gaza to protect one-year commemoration ceremonies in communities affected by Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks last year that killed some 1,200 people and saw more than 200 hostages taken into Gaza.

On the eve of those ceremonies, a knife and gun attack in the southern city of Beersheba has left one person dead and 10 others wounded, according to Israeli emergency services.

Police have not yet identified the attacker, who launched the rampage at the city's central bus station. But officials said they were treating it as a terror incident, with the country currently on high alert after several stabbing, shooting and ramming attacks in the past year, including one in Tel Aviv last week that saw seven shot inside and around a transportation hub.

In southern Lebanon, the Israeli military says it has lost as least nine of its troops and killed more than 400 Hezbollah fighters, as it ramped up destructive strikes on the capital Beirut. The strikes were concentrated in the city's southern suburbs that have historically served as a hub for Hebzollah, an Iran-backed militant group designated as a terrorist organization by the United States and other nations.

Israel says its latest strikes targeted ""weapons storage facilities and infrastructure sites,"" but in the past two weeks similar strikes have also killed civilians, including children. The total death toll in Lebanon has now topped 1,000, and the Israeli assault has displaced more than a million people -- around a fifth of the country's population.

In the northern Lebanese city of Tripoli, new arrivals from the country's south -- some of them refugees from Syria forced to move on once more by another round of conflict -- have seen their lives shattered in a short period of time.

While local residents sit on blue plastic benches -- young men sharing videos on their phones, older couples whiling away the time -- the Israeli airstrikes penetrate further north into the country, leaving few secure locations for civilians.

One man, Riqad, who only gave his first name out of concerns for his safety, had arrived four days ago with his family from the southern suburbs of Beirut, after earlier fleeing Israeli attacks near their home in the southern city of Tyre.

""There is no safe place"" Riqad said Saturday. ""The Israelis are bombing everywhere."" As he spoke, two young children in his family asked an adult relative if the bombs would reach them at the hotel where a politician affiliated with Hezbollah had granted shelter to them and other displaced families.

A few hours earlier, Israeli jets had fired on a nearby refugee camp for Palestinians, close to Tripoli. The attack targeted a commander linked to the militant group Hamas, as well as members of his family, and represented the most northerly attack by Israel since the conflict began in Gaza, 200 miles to the south.

The devastating impact on Lebanese society has been shockingly swift. One pre-med student, who gave only her first name Yasmin, had started college only a month earlier.

""I thought it would be one of the best years of my life. I've worked so much to get to the university I am in,"" she said. ""Now, all I miss is my university days ... the coffee there, my friends, studying in the library. That's all I want now."""
A strike on a mosque kills 19 as Israel bombards northern Gaza and southern Beirut,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/g-s1-26576/israel-bombards-northern-gaza-and-southern-beirut,2024-10-06T12:14:54Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An Israeli strike on a mosque in the Gaza Strip early Sunday killed at least 19 people, Palestinian officials said, as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Beirut in a widening war with Iran-allied militant groups across the region.

Displaced people were sheltering at the mosque that was struck near the main hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah. A further four people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering displaced people near the town.

The Israeli military said both strikes targeted militants, without providing evidence.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead from the strike on the mosque were all men.

Israel is still battling Hamas in Gaza a year after the group's attack on Israel, and has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has been trading fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel has also vowed to strike Iran itself after Tehran launched a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week.

The widening conflict risks drawing in the United States, which has provided crucial military and diplomatic support to Israel, as well as U.S.-allied Arab countries that host American forces. Iran-allied militant groups in Syria, Iraq and Yemen have already joined in with long-distance strikes on Israel.

The Israeli military, meanwhile, announced a new air and ground offensive in Jabaliya, in northern Gaza, home to a densely populated refugee camp dating back to the 1948 war surrounding Israel's creation. It circulated photos and video footage showing a column of tanks heading toward the area.

Israeli forces encircled Jabaliya as warplanes struck militant sites inside, the military said. Over the course of the war, Israel has carried out several large operations there, only to see militants regroup.

Israel reiterated its call, from the opening weeks of the war, for the complete evacuation of northern Gaza. Up to 300,000 people are estimated to have remained in the heavily destroyed north after earlier Israeli warnings that sent around a million fleeing to the south.

""We are in a new phase of the war,"" the military said in leaflets dropped over the area. ""These areas are considered dangerous combat zones.""

Palestinian residents reported heavy Israeli strikes across northern Gaza. The Civil Defense -- first responders who operate under the Hamas-run government -- said several homes and buildings had been hit and they were not able to reach them because of the bombardment.

Residents posted about the airstrikes and mourned their relatives on social media. Imad Alarabid said in a Facebook post that an airstrike on his home in Jabaliya killed a dozen family members, including his parents. Saeed Abu Elaish, a Health Ministry medic, said he was wounded and bleeding.

""Pray for us,"" he wrote on Facebook.

Hassan Hamd, a freelance TV journalist whose footage had aired on Al Jazeera and othr networks, was killed in artillery shelling on his home in Jabaliya. Anas al-Sharif, an Al Jazeera reporter in northern Gaza, confirmed his death.

The military says it has expanded the so-called humanitarian zone in southern Gaza, urging people to head there. Hundreds of thousands of people have already sought refuge in sprawling tent camps there with little in the way of food, water or toilets. Israel has carried out strikes in the humanitarian zone against what it says are militants hiding among civilians.

Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza since the start of the war, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says a little more than half were women and children.

Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people in the Oct. 7 attack and took another 250 hostage. They are still holding around 100 captives, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

In Beirut, airstrikes lit up the skyline and loud explosions echoed across the southern suburbs, known as the Dahiyeh, throughout the night, as Israel struck what it said were Hezbollah militant sites.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said the area was hit by more than 30 strikes overnight, the heaviest bombardment since Sept. 23 when Israel escalated its air campaign.

The targets included a gas station on the main highway leading to the Beirut airport and a warehouse for medical supplies, the agency said. Some of the overnight strikes set off a long series of explosions, suggesting that ammunition stores may have been hit.

Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted.

Hezbollah said it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers in northern Israel ""with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately."" It was not possible to confirm the claim.

At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from its border so that tens of thousands of Israeli citizens can return to their homes.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily.

Last week, Israel launched what it said was a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and most of his top commanders. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a monthlong war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters.

It is not possible to verify battlefield reports from either side."
Israel expands its bombardment in Lebanon as thousands flee widening war,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/g-s1-26567/israel-expands-its-bombardment-in-lebanon-as-thousands-flee-widening-war,2024-10-06T07:14:31Z,"MASNAA BORDER CROSSING, Lebanon -- Powerful new explosions rocked Beirut's southern suburbs late Saturday as Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon, also striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in the north for the first time as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters.

Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza.

The strong explosions began near midnight and continued into Sunday after Israel's military urged residents to evacuate areas in Dahiyeh, the predominantly Shiite collection of suburbs on Beirut's southern edge. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. They followed a day of sporadic strikes and the nearly continuous buzz of reconnaissance drones.

Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory, with some intercepted.

The strikes reportedly targeted a building near a road leading to Lebanon's only international airport, and another building formerly used by the Hezbollah-run broadcaster Al-Manar. Social media reports claimed that one of the strikes hit an oxygen tank storage facility, but this was later denied by the owner of the company Khaled Kaddouha.

Shortly thereafter, Hezbollah claimed in a statement that it successfully targeted a group of Israeli soldiers near the Manara settlement in northern Israel ""with a large rocket salvo, hitting them accurately.""

On Saturday, Israel's attack on the northern Beddawi camp killed an official with Hamas' military wing along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palestinian militant group said. Hamas later said another military wing member was killed in Israeli strikes in Lebanon's eastern Bekaa Valley. The aftermath showed smashed buildings, scattered bricks and stairways to nowhere.

Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began , in addition to most of the top leadership of the Lebanon-based Hezbollah as fighting has sharply escalated.

At least 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians, medics and Hezbollah fighters, have been killed and 1.2 million driven from their homes in less than two weeks. Israel says it aims to drive the militant group away from shared borders so displaced Israelis can return to their homes.

Iranian-backed Hezbollah, the strongest armed force in Lebanon, began firing rockets into Israel almost immediately after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, calling it a show of support for the Palestinians. Hezbollah and Israel's military have traded fire almost daily.

Last week, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon after a series of attacks killed longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah and others. The fighting is the worst since Israel and Hezbollah fought a brief war in 2006. Nine Israeli soldiers have been killed in the ground clashes that Israel says have killed 440 Hezbollah fighters.

Iran's foreign minister, Abbas Araghchi, told reporters in Damascus that ""we are trying to reach a cease-fire in Gaza and in Lebanon."" The minister said the unnamed countries putting forward initiatives include regional states and some outside the Middle East.

Araghchi spoke a day after the supreme leader of Iran praised its recent missile strikes on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary.

On Saturday evening, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said ""Israel has the duty and the right to defend itself and respond to these attacks, and it will do so."" On Lebanon, he said ""we are not done yet.""

Fleeing Lebanon on foot

Israel's military earlier Saturday said about 90 projectiles were fired from Lebanon into Israeli territory. Most were intercepted, but several fell in the northern Arab town of Deir al-Asad, where police said three people were lightly injured.

At least six people in Lebanon were killed in more than a dozen Israeli airstrikes overnight and into Saturday, according to the Lebanese state-run National News Agency.

Nearly 375,000 people have fled from Lebanon into Syria in less than two weeks, according to a Lebanese government committee.

Associated Press journalists saw hundreds continuing to cross the Masnaa Border Crossing on foot, crunching over the rubble after Israeli airstrikes left huge craters in the road leading to it on Thursday. Much of Hezbollah's weaponry is believed to come from Iran through Syria.

""We were on the road for two days,"" said Issa Hilal, one of many Syrian refugees in Lebanon who are now heading back. ""The roads were very crowded ... it was very difficult. We almost died getting here."" Some children whimpered or cried.

Other displaced families now shelter alongside Beirut's famous seaside Corniche, their wind-flapped tents just steps from luxury homes. ""We don't care if we die, but we don't want to die at the hands of Netanyahu,"" said Om Ali Mcheik.

The Israeli military said special forces were carrying out ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon. It said troops dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border.

More evacuation orders in Gaza

Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the war, according to the Health Ministry there, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths. Almost 90% of Gaza's residents are displaced, amid widespread destruction.

Palestinian medical officials said Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza on Saturday killed at least nine people. One in the northern town of Beit Hanoun killed at least five, including two children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Another hit a house in the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four, Awda hospital said.

Israel's military did not have any immediate comment but has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas.

An Israeli airstrike killed two children in Gaza City's Zaytoun neighborhood, according to the civil defense first responders' group that operates under the Hamas-run government.

Israel's military warned Palestinians to evacuate along the strategic Netzarim corridor in central Gaza that was at the heart of obstacles to a cease-fire deal. The military told people in parts of the Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps to evacuate to Muwasi, a coastal area it has designated a humanitarian zone.

It's unclear how many Palestinians are in those areas. Israeli forces have often returned to areas in Gaza to target Hamas fighters as they regroup."
Israeli airstrikes cut off a key crossing between Lebanon and Syria,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/g-s1-26287/israeli-airstrikes-lebanon-syria-crossing,2024-10-04T07:56:14Z,"BEIRUT -- Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria.

The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates.

Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The blasts overnight rocked Beirut's southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers (miles) away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday.

The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details.

The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon's Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing.

Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces.

Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous.

It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between Sept. 23 -- when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon -- and Sept. 30.

There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there.

Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence.

Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their Oct. 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry."
How Iran's missile strike on Israel appears to have hit some targets,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5135646/iran-missile-strike-israel-appears-to-hit-some-targets,2024-10-02T16:37:05Z,"Projectiles above Jerusalem, on October 1, 2024. Israel says Iran launched more than 180 missiles but that the assault did little damage. MENAHEM KAHANA/AFP via Getty Images/AFP hide caption

Iran's strike on Israel appears to have been more effective at reaching its targets than an attack in April of this year.

Videos posted to social media and geolocated by NPR and the online investigations group Bellingcat show multiple warheads landing around two Israeli air bases: Nevatim Airbase in the south of the country and Tel Nof Airbase in central Israel. One video filmed near Tel Nof also appeared to show possible secondary explosions, indicating that ammunition or fuel may have been struck by a missile.

Videos also showed warheads landing in northern Tel Aviv, near the headquarters of Israel's intelligence agency, Mossad. Those warheads appear to have missed their target, and did not inflict any real damage. One video showed a large crater around 500 yards from the spy agency's headquarters.

Experts say the attack was somewhat more successful than the one in April of this year, which was almost completely neutralized by Israeli and American air defenses.

""It looks like more missiles seem to be hitting targets in Israel this time around,"" says Jeffrey Lewis, a professor at the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. That could be in part because ""the Iranians seem to be using newer, more sophisticated missiles.""

US Calls Strikes ""Ineffective""

Both the U.S. and Israel downplayed the strikes. ""This attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective,"" National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said in a briefing Tuesday. The U.S. said it had fired about a dozen interceptors from warships in an effort to blunt the Iranian assault.

According to reports in the Israeli media, the military acknowledged that the strike had damaged ""several"" airbases. However it said that no aircraft had been destroyed. Israeli media reported that the attacks had mainly damaged maintenance areas and office buildings.

An Israel Defense Forces spokesperson declined to comment to NPR on casualties or damage resulting from the strike. The Israeli military spokesperson, Lt. Col. Peter Lerner, said in a briefing on the social media platform X that, ""We don't want to tip off Iran... Our air force and air force bases remain operational.""

Although the strike may have been limited in the damage it caused, it was a clear challenge to Israel's much-vaunted air defense systems. Israel's main system, called Iron Dome, has proven incredibly effective rockets from nearby adversaries like the militant groups Hamas and Hezbollah. Iron Dome uses relatively cheap interceptor missiles together with state-of-the-art radars and high-speed computing to quickly determine which incoming missiles pose a threat. It only takes shots at the ones it determines are falling in populated areas.

Better missiles and more of them

But ballistic missiles from Iran travel much higher and faster than those fired from nearby Lebanon and Gaza. The missiles fly briefly into space before coming down on their targets near or at hypersonic speeds. Israel has a separate missile defense system known as Arrow, which is capable of intercepting missiles near or in space, but Arrow has fewer interceptors than Iron Dome.

When Iran attacked Israel in April, it used around 100 ballistic missiles in conjunction with roughly 200 low flying drones and cruise missiles, according to Yehoshua Kalisky, a senior researcher at the Institute for National Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv, Israel. The drones and cruise missiles were shot down easily by fighter jets, leaving the missiles for Arrow, he says.

This time, Iran launched around 180 ballistic missiles, putting more strain on the Arrow system. ""The job for the Arrow was much easier [in April],"" he says.

Moreover, images of the missiles being fired out of Iran, together with pictures of debris that fell in Israel, suggests more sophisticated ballistic missiles were used, Lewis says.

In the April attack, Lewis says Iran used primarily liquid-fueled missiles that were relatively inaccurate. Half of the missiles fell more than a half mile from their targets. ""It's pretty hard to destroy something with that level of accuracy,"" he says.

In this latest attack, Iran used new solid-propellant missiles that are more accurate, he says. Lewis and other researchers say at least some of the missiles used appear to be Iran's newest design, the Fattah, a medium-range ballistic missile that may have a degree of maneuverability as it enters the atmosphere, allowing it to alter course and avoid interceptor missiles.

Lewis says he believes Iran's latest strike was designed to show some restraint. The warheads fell primarily on air bases which may have been used in last week's attacks on Hezbollah's leadership, he points out. ""It's very typical to see Iranians pick military targets that are linked to the military strike that they're responding to,"" he says.

The strike also appeared to largely avoid civilian areas. The only publicly acknowledged death from the attack so far was a Palestinian man in the West Bank who was apparently struck by a falling missile body. A school in central Israel was also hit, though no casualties were reported.

Despite the attempt to control escalation, Israel is likely to respond with force, says Tom Karako, director of the Missile Defense Project at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. Following the April attack, Israel knocked out an air defense radar near Iran's nuclear facilities in Natanz, he points out. That limited attack was designed to send a message: ""The Israelis can penetrate Iranian airspace, they've demonstrated that time and time again,"" he says. ""They can bring the hurt to Iran.""

Israel's military spokesperson Peter Lerner suggested that it would only be a matter of time before the nation struck back directly against Iran. ""One ballistic missile is an unacceptable reality for any sovereign state,"" he told reporters. ""One hundred and eighty means there will be consequences."""
Israel sends more troops to Lebanon as it vows a 'painful' response to Iran's missiles,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5136592/israel-lebanon-iran-missile-attack-hezbollah,2024-10-02T14:00:21Z,"Smoke rises from the site of an Israeli airstrike in Dahiyeh, Beirut, Lebanon, Wednesday.

Israel says it is sending more troops into southern Lebanon to fight Hezbollah, as Israel also promised a ""painful"" response after Iran fired nearly 200 missiles at Israel Tuesday night.

The Israeli military said it is deploying more soldiers and an armored tank brigade to assist in what it called a ""limited, localized"" ground offensive against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah in Lebanon.

On social media, the Israeli military's Arabic spokesperson, Avichay Adraee, warned residents of an additional 24 villages in southern Lebanon to evacuate immediately. ""For your safety, you must leave your homes immediately,"" he said, adding that any civilian near Hezbollah fighters, facilities or weapons risks their lives.

Residents were advised to evacuate north of the Awali River, about 30 miles from the Lebanese border with Israel.

Also on Wednesday, sirens went off across Israel's north after the Israeli military said around 100 rockets were fired from Lebanon. The military issues alerts to communities around the port city of Haifa and Western Galilee, both near the Israel-Lebanon border.

The Israeli military announced a soldier killed in combat in Lebanon, according to The Associated Press, which said Hezbollah claimed to have killed and wounded an unspecified number of Israeli troops.

Iran fired about 180 ballistic missiles toward Israel late Tuesday. The Israeli military said most were intercepted, but there were several hits.

The Pentagon said two U.S. destroyers also fired a dozen interceptors at the Iranian missiles headed to Israel.

The only confirmed death from the Iranian attack was in the Israeli-occupied West Bank, where a 38-year-old Palestinian man was killed after a missile fell on the city of Jericho, according to Palestinian civil defense.

Video footage shared on social media showed a large crater where a missile had landed near Israel's Mossad spy agency headquarters.

Officials in Jordan said two people were lightly injured from falling shrapnel.

Now, the region is bracing for Israel's response and the risk of a wider war.

""This evening, Iran made a big mistake -- and it will pay for it,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said hours after the attack.

Israeli military spokesperson Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari called Iran's attack ""a severe and dangerous escalation,"" and promised, ""We will respond wherever, whenever and however we choose.""

And on Wednesday, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations, Danny Danon, said Israel's response will be ""decisive and painful.""

Iran's Revolutionary Guard said late Tuesday that the missile attack was in response to several recent killings, including the assassination of Hezbollah's leader Hassan Nasrallah late Friday in Beirut; the death of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh, who was killed in Tehran in July in a strike widely assumed to be carried out by Israel; and an Iranian commander.

Iran's mission at the United Nations said the attack was a ""legal, rational, and legitimate response to the terrorist acts of the Zionist regime."""
October 7th anniversary weighs heavy as Jews enter the High Holy Days,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5108867/october-7th-anniversary-jewish-high-holy-days,2024-10-02T09:03:56Z,"A table covered with a cloth featuring the Loyola Marymount Hillel logo in the front, and six portraits of hostages who were killed sitting on top of it. Jason DeRose/NPR hide caption

On the table outside Rabbi Zachary Zysman's office at Loyola Marymount University in Los Angeles, six portraits of hostages killed by Hamas are weighed down by a small stone, placed there as an act of remembrance.

Nearby, a stack of brochures for a Krav Maga self-defense class leans against a pad of paper on which people can write prayers, eventually to be tucked into the Western Wall in Jerusalem.

Zysman, the chaplain for Jewish life at Loyola Marymount, has carefully prepared for the Jewish new year, Rosh Hashanah, which begins at sunset on Wednesday and Yom Kippur, the day of atonement, later this month. In the middle of the Jewish High Holy Days comes the anniversary of October 7, the deadliest attack against Jews since the Holocaust.

No matter when the one-year anniversary fell, it would have been difficult, but Zysman said it's particularly poignant ""at a time when we're thinking about repentance, renewal and hope.""

His flock is small but close-knit. Loyola Marymount is a Jesuit university with about 10,000 students, 375 of whom are Jewish.

""One of the messages I've repeated over and over to my students is: What is our responsibility to each other?""

Along with other chaplains on campus, Zysman has hosted speaker series, workshops and roundtables discussions on anti-Semitism and Islamophobia during this past year, but the days between Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur will be less about education and more about personal and communal religious devotion for students.

The motif of death is frequent during High Holy Days liturgies, and Zysman said The phrases ""Who shall live? and 'Who shall die?"" take on a deeper resonance this year.

More than 1,200 Israelis, not all of whom were Jewish, died in the Hamas attacks of October 7, and 100 Israelis remain held hostage by Hamas, according to the Israeli government. More than 41,500 people in Gaza have been killed during the Israeli bombardment that followed, according to Palestinian health authorities.

Loyola Marymount senior Maya Golban says she has been reflecting on the lives - and deaths - of so many people since October 7.

""I can't personally change the politics of the Middle East, but what I can do is honor the people who've lost their lives.""

Golban said she's become considerably more active in Jewish groups on campus over the last year, where she's sometimes felt on the defensive, having to repeatedly justify her beliefs.

As she enters the High Holy Days, she said she continues to pray for ""the peace and safety of everyone in the region: Israeli, Palestinian and Bedouin.""

During the weeks leading up to the High Holy Days, Rabbi Jocee Hudson has been teaching a lunchtime class on the University of Southern California campus in Los Angeles. She's the rabbi at the Hillel Jewish Center, just across the street.

""Welcome everyone. Let's put our feet on the ground,"" Hudson said as students finished the vegan enchiladas Hillel provides, while others snuck in at the last minute. ""As we gather, the question for today is 'What's on your heart?'""

Hudson opened the class by leading the group of about ten through a centering exercise.

""We root ourselves in presence."" she said, ""We root ourselves in the right here right now. As we say the blessing for Torah study.""

Together, the class recited the Hebrew prayer which translates, ""Blessed are you, oh Lord our God, King of the Universe, who hallows us and commands us to study the words of Torah.""

Among those taking this class is senior Dylan Julia Cooper.

""Right in the aftermath of October seventh,"" she said, ""we held a memorial on campus, which was so beautiful. And it was also really hard because people came to protest. And it was really difficult in my grief to hold my friends crying in my arms and know that people were protesting 20 feet away.""

Cooper, who's majoring in anthropology and theater, said it's been a year of perseverance and that October 7 coming in the middle of the High Holy Days ""serves as a reminder of how much we can endure as a community, as a universe.""

Cooper said he's used the weeks leading up to Rosh Hashanah to figure out how to let go of disillusionment over protests.

""My Jewish friends, my Muslim friends, my Palestinian Friends, my Israeli friends,"" says Cooper, ""I want them all to feel supported and loved by me. And I don't think that holding on to my anger or holding grudges is a good way to do that.""

Sitting next to Cooper in class was Matan Marder Friedgood, a junior at USC. He described this past year as one on edge.

""I have a friend who's not Jewish who's taking a Jewish studies course"" he said. ""She goes, 'Oh, Matan, you're Jewish!' And I feel myself tense up. I'm like 'What is this going to be about? What's going to happen?""

But in this story, it turns out he was more worried than he needed to be.

""She's like 'What's a Shabbat morning service?' It's the most benign question,"" he said. ""That was the year in a nutshell: 'You're Jewish.' Uh oh.""

But for Marder Friedgood, that intensity has meant the discovery of something about himself that he finds surprising.

""My connection to Judaism has grown stronger,"" he said, ""because of the pressure that's been put on it. And my connection to other Jews has grown stronger because of the pressure. And I am much more willing to embrace it publicly.""

Marder Friedgood's been asking himself how he and his community can put aside the fear and apprehension of the past year and welcome the Jewish New Year with sweetness.

""How do we bring back the Jewish Joy?"" he wondered. ""How do we just reincorporate all the positive -- all of what it means to be Jewish, all of the great things, all of the reasons we love it -- and hold the sadness and the grief at the same time?""

These are questions many Jews are asking themselves in the lead-up to both the High Holy Days and the October 7th anniversary. They're questions with no easy answers.

""It is only through experiences of very real grief that I have come to understand the capacity for very real joy,"" said Hillel Rabbi Jocee Hudson. ""It comes in the context of time, following Oct. 7th where all of us in the Jewish community have experienced deep anguish.""

""As we have seen tens of thousands of Palestinians also killed, we have ongoing anguish,"" she said. ""And there are students who have deep reactions to that -- deep moral outrage.""

That outrage is also why preparing for the High Holy Days this year has been so intense.

""When our hearts are broken open in grief,"" Hudson said, ""there are two possibilities: One is pulling back. The other is reaching out. And that's the spiritual work.""

It's spiritual work that asks a lot of 19 or 20 or 21-year-olds. But it's spiritual work that college junior Matan Marder Friedgood wants to help his community do together, even on October 7 itself. He and a housemate are planning a vigil on the University of Southern California campus that day.

""We're both musicians and so we're trying to uplift the space through creating -- I think we have a 10-piece band to try and play Israeli and Jewish music -- an atmosphere that is holding all the sadness and holding all the grief and all the anger. And we're looking toward the future.""

It's a future - a new year - marked by the hope for peace rather than the carnage of war. Marder Friedgood plans to end the vigil by teaching those gathered to sing in Hebrew a prayer for peace.

It's the closing line from the Medieval prayer known as the Kaddish. One translation reads, ""He who makes peace in the heavens -- may He bring peace to us and all the people of Israel. Let us say, 'Amen.'"""
Ta-Nehisi Coates explores how oppression can breed oppression in 'The Message',NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5131276/ta-nehisi-coates-the-message-senegal-israel-gaza,2024-10-01T18:36:00Z,"Ta-Nehisi Coates teaches at Howard University, where he's the Sterling Brown Endowed Chair in the English department. Carol Lee Rose/Getty Images hide caption

Writer Ta-Nehisi Coates says he long felt the pull to visit Africa -- and yet it was a trip he kept putting off.

""When you're Black in this country, Africa -- or the story that's told about Africa -- is a weight,"" Coates says. ""I always knew it was a trip that I had to take. But I think, in the back of my mind, I knew that I would have to confront some things, that it would not be a vacation.""

When Coates did finally travel to Senegal, he says it felt like a pilgrimage. As the plane descended into Dakar, he was so overcome with emotion that he uttered a profanity.

""It came out of nowhere, and I was shocked at myself,"" he says. ""But I think it was evidence of some things that I really had been burying that had to be confronted.""

While in Dakar, Coates visited the the island of Gorée, and the fort in which people were held before being forced onto ships that would take them to enslavement in the United States. There he says, ""What I imagined was my many, many, many, many, many grandmothers who were taken in that way. That was what I saw. ... That hit hard.""

Coates won the 2015 National Book Award for Between the World and Me, which was written in the form of a letter to his 15-year-old son about what it means to be a Black teenager and a Black man in America. In his new book, The Message, he reflects on his time in Senegal, as well as trips he took to South Carolina and to Israel and the Israeli-occupied West Bank. He describes it as a book about nationalism and belonging.

""It is about the nationalisms of people who are told that they are nothing, that they are not a nation, that they are not a people ... that the only place in the world that is fit for them is as an underclass or maybe not in the world at all,"" he says. ""And the stories that we construct to fight back against that.""

On staying on a beach in Senegal, contemplating the people who were taken to enslavement in America

There were people very clearly vacationing with their kids and frolicking in the water. And there was one of those really fancy pools that was kind of level with the ground and people serving drinks. And there was a DJ. And I went and I sat down in the restaurant ... and where I was seated, I could look out onto the Atlantic Ocean. And I knew that what I was feeling at that moment was not what everybody else there was feeling. It was like I was at a funeral. And everybody else was at a wedding. That's what it felt like.

On his parents naming him Ta-Nehisi as a way of connecting with their African roots

I think what my parents sought to do from the moment I was born was inure me against the racism of culture that pervades American life and really takes Africa and the story of Africa as its root. And what they sought to do was throw it back. And what they picked for me was an ancient Egyptian name that refers to the ancient kingdom of Nubia in the south, the place of ostensibly Black kings and Black kingdoms and Black queens and great deeds that were done by Black people. And to root me in that as a counter to the racist narrative that I would undoubtedly hear as I went through my life.

On being stopped by a guard while traveling to the old city of Hebron in the Israeli-occupied West Bank

There are both Palestinians who live in Hebron and also there are Jewish settlers on the West Bank who live in Hebron also. They are not accorded the same rights. And this was made viscerally clear to me as I walked through Hebron with the group that I was with. There were streets that we would encounter where we were allowed as non-Palestinians to walk and Palestinians were not allowed to walk. ...

I was on my way to support a vendor, and a guard came out and he stopped me and he said, ""What's your religion, bro?"" And I said, ""I don't really have a religion. I'm not a particularly religious person."" He said, ""Come on, don't play. What is your religion? ... What is your parents' religion? ... What was your grandmother's religion?"" I said, ""Well, my grandmother was a Christian."" And he said, ""Ok, you can go past."" And it was so blatant. It was so clear. ... I wouldn't have been allowed to pass [if I was Muslim]. That was clear.

On differences he observed between the ways that Palestinians and Israelis are treated in the Israeli-occupied West Bank

I was being made aware of the fact that if a Palestinian is arrested on the West Bank, they are subject to the military system of justice, whereas if a Jewish settler is arrested on the West Bank, they're subjected to the civil system. ... I was made aware of the differing water laws that govern [access] depending on who you are, an entire separate system of justice that was ... separate and unequal. As a descendant of someone who was, or peoples who are, born into a system of governance that was separate and unequal, it was very hard for me to not be struck by that emotionally.

On the ways in which victims can become victimizers

I am part of a community that fought in the Civil War to free themselves as members of the Union Army, and we praise that effort, and we talk about that effort. And some of those soldiers went West and fought wars against the indigenous people of this country. They became victimizers. I'm part of a community that in an effort to to free itself and liberate itself from white racism in this country, bought into the dream of Liberia, which meant going over to Africa and subjecting Africans to Western civilization ... and ""Christianizing"" them and ""civilizing"" them. That is victims becoming victimizers.

What is uncomfortable is for us to see that the victimization and oppression, even at its highest point, may not necessarily be ennobling. ... In the most cliché terms -- I'm sorry to use this -- but to be a hurt person who hurts people [is] certainly possible. And that's a dark thought, ... because I think we want to believe that having that oppression is some sort of card, you know, a moral high ground that is automatically conferred. But the fact of the matter is that sometimes that's true. Sometimes it's not. And I think as much as I saw the connection between Black people and Palestinians when I was over there, it was not so hard for me to see myself in the Israelis.

On the need for more Palestinian voices to be heard

We need more Palestinians to be enshrined to tell their story and to tell their perspective. ... The people who are enduring, from my perspective, this system of apartheid have not been enshrined to speak about what future they would envision. ... It would be as if we were trying to figure out segregation ... and we completely sidelined Black people and deprived them of the ability to articulate what they felt the world should look like. Imagine a world where there can't be an ""I Have a Dream"" speech because nobody will cover it, and nobody will give the opportunity for that message to get out in the first place."

The Israeli military has launched what it calls a ""limited"" incursion ground offensive in southern Lebanon against the Iran-backed militant group Hezbollah. This action comes almost a year after Israel and Hezbollah began exchanging fire, forcing Lebanese and Israeli people living along the border to flee their homes. It also follows Israeli airstrikes that killed a number of top Hezbollah officials in Beirut on Friday. Yesterday, Hezbollah's deputy Naim Kassem addressed supporters, stating they would continue the battle in support of Palestinians and defend Lebanon.

For the first and likely only time, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will face off in a vice presidential debate tonight. They both need to help their respective tickets win over undecided voters in crucial swing states, as voting is already underway in parts of the U.S. Here's everything you need to know about tonight's debate, from how to watch to what the rules are.

Union dockworkers along East Coast and Gulf Coast ports began striking early today, halting the movement of more than $2 billion worth of goods, including cars, clothing, paper, farm machinery and much more. Picketing started just after midnight after talks between the International Longshoremen's Association and the United States Maritime Alliance, representing ocean carriers and port operators, failed to result in a new contract. The strike, which impacts work at 14 ports, has two major sticking points: wages and automation. Trade groups warned President Biden that an extended strike would have dire consequences for the U.S. economy.

A new report from the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, has found that a disconnect between states and the federal government is leading to fragmented politics and risks to the public.

"Trump says Gaza 'could be better than Monaco,' but 'they never took advantage of it'",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-gaza-better-than-monaco-israel-hugh-hewitt-rcna174475,2024-10-08T20:25:45Z,"Trump also claimed he has been to Gaza. An aide later suggested that visiting Israel counted because ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Donald Trump said that Gaza ""could be one of the best places in the world"" -- better even, he said, ""than Monaco"" and lamented that people ""never took advantage of it.""

In an interview with conservative talk show host Hugh Hewitt on Monday, Trump said: ""It could be better than Monaco. It has the best location in the Middle East, the best water, the best everything,"" referring to the Palestinian territory, which has been bombarded relentlessly by the Israeli military for the past 12 months, creating a catastrophic humanitarian crisis.

""They never took advantage of it. You know, as a developer, it could be the most beautiful place -- the weather, the water, the whole thing, the climate,"" he said.

Trump, who has repeatedly criticized Jewish Democrats and denigrated Palestinians while claiming to be Israel's staunchest ally, said that Gaza was ""a rough place ... before all of the attacks and before the back-and-forth of what's happened over the last couple of years."" The Republican presidential nominee also claimed that he had visited Gaza, despite there being no record of him doing so, as president or otherwise.

Afterward, a Trump campaign official given anonymity by The New York Times said that Trump has been to Israel, stating incorrectly that ""Gaza is in Israel.""

Trump's estimation of the real estate potential of the Gaza Strip echoes that of his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who said in an interview with the faculty chair of Harvard's Middle East Initiative in February that ""Gaza's waterfront property could be very valuable."" Kushner also suggested that, if he were in charge, he would ""try to move people"" from Rafah, in the south of Gaza, into the Negev desert, ""so you can go in and finish the job"" of eliminating Hamas.

Trump's comments speak to how he might approach the fraught and widening tensions in the Middle East if he wins the election. They are also deeply disconnected from the realities of life in Gaza under Israel's extensive blockade and what human rights experts have called the illegal Israeli occupation of the West Bank. After Hamas assumed governance of Gaza in 2007, Israel removed its military presence and swiftly imposed an air, sea and land blockade. Israel has largely controlled who enters and leaves the Strip; severely limited the import and export of food, medical supplies, infrastructure materials and commercial goods; violently restricted access along the coast of Gaza; and cut off access to farmland. Before the current war, two-thirds of the population in Gaza was supported by food assistance.

Multiple conflicts between Hamas and Israel over the years have exacerbated those issues. Israel's current war in Gaza, launched after Hamas' attack killed 1,200 people in October 2023, has displaced more than 90% of the population in the Strip, according to the United Nations. Gaza health officials say at least 41,000 people have been killed."
Opinion | A tit-for-tat war with Israel will not turn out well for Iran,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/iran-regret-attack-israel-missiles-hezbollah-rcna174375,2024-10-08T18:37:58Z,"Last week, and for the second time this year, Iran launched a missile strike against Israel. This one, however, the military equivalent of poking a sleeping bear, is likely to provoke a fearsome Israeli response.

Iran's first direct attack in April, which targeted non-civilian areas and was telegraphed in advance, looked more like a demonstration project than a serious strike. It was Tehran's response to Israel assassinating a top Iranian general in Syria, but it appears to have been purposely narrowed to prevent a significant Israeli retaliation. Israel delivered a token response (attacking a single long-range air defense system) and, at least for a time, the threat of greater escalation diminished.

Last week's strike, a response to the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah (a close ally of Iran) in a southern suburb of Beirut was qualitatively different. Iran fired missiles directly at civilian areas of Tel Aviv -- and sent millions of terrified Israelis into their safe rooms.

From a military standpoint, the Iranian attack accomplished little. While it caused some damage to targeted intelligence and military bases, there were few civilian casualties (A Palestinian man in Jericho died in the attacks, and two people were injured in Tel Aviv). More important, it barely put a dent in Israel's military capabilities.

According to Yonatan Touval, a foreign policy analyst at Mitvim, an Israeli think tank, ""Iran might have thought this was a measured strike it could get away with, and that at worst would provoke a symbolic counter-strike. But Israel perceives this differently and will likely launch a major retaliatory strike.""

As a geographically small country, deterrence has long been an essential element of Israel's strategic mindset. It has generally responded with disproportionate military force to acts of war. The response to Iran's missile attack will likely be no different. Touval said, ""Israel cannot let this pass if it is to reestablish deterrence and convey the message that it is not a sitting duck waiting to be hit at will.""

As Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Tuesday, Oct. 8, ""Iran made a big mistake tonight -- and it will pay for it. The regime in Iran does not understand our determination to defend ourselves and to retaliate against our enemies.""

But there's another consideration for Israel's leaders. For years, Israel has wanted to launch a military strike on Iran to diminish or even out wipe out the country's nuclear program. Successive U.S. administrations have consistently discouraged Israel from doing so. Indeed, the attention devoted to the Iranian nuclear program -- and the signing of the Iran nuclear deal in 2015 by the Obama administration -- was motivated, in large measure, by a desire to avoid a conflict between Israel and Iran that could potentially drag in the United States.

But with last week's strike, Iran handed Israel a casus belli and legal basis for an attack, and the U.S. will be hard-pressed to stop Israel from responding. While it will be difficult for Israel to hit Iran's nuclear targets without direct U.S. involvement, one can imagine significant Israeli attacks on Iran's military and even economic infrastructure in an effort to humiliate the regime in Tehran.

So why did Iran do it?

Iran's decision-making seems to have been influenced not by military considerations but by reputational ones. Nayyera Haq noted last week in an MSNBC column that ""despite new leadership in Iran, there remains the long-standing need to appear strong in the Middle East and also on the world stage.""

To be sure, Iran was in a difficult situation, but it was one it created. For a year, Iran has supported Hezbollah as it, unprovoked, sent thousands of rockets and missiles into Northern Israel after the Oct. 7, 2023, attack by Hamas. Perhaps Hezbollah and its patrons in Iran believed that Israel would not aggressively respond (yet another deadly miscalculation). But once Israel launched a major military attack, taking out Nasrallah and most of Hezbollah's leadership, and employed an audacious attack in which it blew up pagers that killed and wounded thousands of Hezbollah fighters, Iran's choices went from bad to worse.

""Doing nothing"" in response to the killing of Nasrallah would send a message that Israel could bloody its nose with no repercussions. But ""doing something"" risked unleashing another Israeli military strike. Iran chose the latter course -- and by doing so likely made a huge strategic error. Provoking a much stronger military rival is never a good idea. Iran has now opened the door to a military retaliation that will likely cause significant physical damage and could, ironically, undermine the regime in the eyes of Iranian civilians. What has Iran's expansionist foreign policy, support for terrorist networks and nuclear program brought the country other than economic devastation -- and now likely physical pain?

Iran's leaders likely believed they had no choice but to ""do something,"" but their apparent failure to fully consider how the missile strike would be viewed in Israel -- and the potential ramifications -- has put a target squarely on the country's back.

The same is true of Israel, it must be said. Any military response to last week's attack will need to be calibrated in order to prevent significant escalation. Ever since then-President Donald Trump foolishly pulled the U.S. out of the Iran nuclear deal in 2018, there has been no international monitoring of Iran's nuclear program. So it's impossible to know how far along Iran is in producing the fissile material necessary to construct a nuclear weapon. While it's highly unlikely that Iran is close to having a nuke that it can actually deliver, Israel may still want to tread lightly for fear of pushing Iran's leader into a desperate position.

Still, that doesn't mean Israel will sit this one out. Iran has provoked a far stronger military rival that has been itching at the chance to attack them. The consquences will be dire."
"Opinion | Biden pledged to restore order as president. In the Middle East, he's failing.",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-iran-war-biden-hezbollah-election-rcna174262,2024-10-08T10:47:49Z,"The president's poor leadership has brought us closer to a regional war that could cause enormous suffering and hurt his own party.

One of Joe Biden's promises in his 2020 presidential campaign was that he would restore strong U.S. leadership abroad and rein in the chaos that Donald Trump had unleashed in the international order.

But if you take a look at the Middle East right now, Biden hasn't done a very good job of fulfilling that pledge.

Under Biden's watch, the Middle East is growing less stable. In the past few weeks, Israel has begun a new war with its invasion of Lebanon, against the public wishes of the Biden administration. Iran has fired around 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, the second time it has ever launched such a direct assault on Israel from its own land. Israel has since promised it will retaliate against Iran -- and that if the tit-for-tat continues for an additional round, strikes on Iran's nuclear sites are on the table. Meanwhile Israel's war in Gaza in response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks continues to rage with no end in sight. As a result of the instability, the price of oil is rising, and attacks on oil production in the region could cause it to surge more.

In other words, the Middle East is slowly inching toward breaking out into a full-scale regional war that could shake up the global economy, create a gigantic crisis in U.S. foreign policy and result in the deaths of countless civilians.

This is not good news for the Democrats as Election Day approaches: Just the rumblings of an imminent crisis or potentially surging gas prices could hurt the electoral appeal of Democrats, who are already suffering from their association with inflation.

The growing specter of wide-scale war in the Middle East is not some kind of approaching weather event or natural disaster. It is the product of choices. And our president has made some terrible ones that helped us get to this point. After Hamas killed around 1,200 Israelis on Oct. 7, 2023, it was inevitable that Israel was going to retaliate. What was not inevitable was that the Biden administration would give Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, a far-right leader with neocolonial extremists in his Cabinet, carte blanche to retaliate against the entire population of the Gaza Strip however he wished to.

The Biden administration has appeared to use leaks and statements to suggest that it believes Netanyahu has gone too far in his brutality toward the civilians of Gaza, but in practice it has greenlighted all of Israel's actions. The Biden administration has been a staunch defender of Israel at the United Nations, shielding it from legally binding Security Council resolutions. It has given Israel billions in military aid. Aside from a brief, temporary and ultimately symbolic pause in arms transfers, Biden has not threatened to cut off aid, or even condition aid on Israel's compliance with international or U.S. law. The Biden administration, to keep weapons shipments intact under U.S. law, has reportedly ignored findings from the State Department and USAID that Israel had blocked U.S. humanitarian aid to Gaza.

Netanyahu's takeaway from Biden's support is that he can take U.S. backing as unconditional and do whatever he wants not only toward Palestinian civilians, but in the region more broadly. Netanyahu has embraced a ""shoot first, notify Biden later"" attitude toward many high-stakes and escalatory actions against adversaries in the Middle East, such as when Israel struck the Syrian headquarters of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps in Damascus, or when Israel leveled several buildings in Beirut in a bombing that killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's operations in Lebanon -- against Biden's public wishes -- have already displaced close to a quarter of Lebanon's population and killed hundreds of civilians, according to PBS' NewsHour. And Netanyahu has demonstrated he feels no obligation to listen to U.S. calls to wind down the bloody military operation in Gaza, which is why Israel and Hezbollah have locked horns in the last year.

As Atlantic Council fellow Nicholas Blanford explained to me, Israel's escalation with its adversaries in the region increases the likelihood of a regional war. If, for example, Israel decides to entrench itself in a more wide-scale war in Lebanon, it could nudge Hezbollah to unleash its most destructive firepower, such as its precision-guided missiles that it has so far refrained from using. And if Iran were to fear that Israel is about to wipe out Hezbollah at some point, it could ""activate all [its] proxies across the region"" against Israel, dragging several other countries directly into the conflict.

We don't know exactly how Netanyahu would act if Biden were to condition or cut off aid to Israel. But given that U.S. military support is vital to Israel's national security and military operations, Netanyahu would be far more likely to behave conservatively in his military campaigns and targeted strikes across the region.

Netanyahu is aware that the timing of his more aggressive maneuvering comes at an acutely sensitive time for Biden politically. Biden is likely in the weeks before Election Day to be particularly hesitant to initiate an upheaval in U.S.-Israeli relations by cutting off weapons shipments or demanding that Netanyahu act like more of a cooperative U.S. ally. But at the same time Biden looks rudderless and weak by not doing anything.

When asked at a press conference Friday if he believed Netanyahu was trying to influence the U.S. election, Biden said, ""I don't know."" And when asked by another reporter, ""How long are you OK with Israel bombing Lebanon? What is acceptable to you?"" he smiled and walked away from the podium.

Biden has gotten himself into this bind through his record of unconditional support for Israel, no matter how badly it deviates from basic morality in warfare, international law or U.S. interests. One can't help but wonder if Biden's poor leadership in the Middle East might just mark a historic first: a president inadvertently springing an October surprise on his own party."
Opinion | How Israel's invasion of Lebanon could spiral into a massive regional war,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-lebanon-war-iran-hezbollah-biden-rcna173364,2024-10-04T16:30:43Z,"An expert explains why Israel's intensifying war on Hezbollah is risky for the region.

Israel moved military forces into southern Lebanese territory Monday, an invasion that marks a major new level of intensity in about a year of conflict with Hezbollah. The paramilitary organization fired rockets at Israeli positions in the Shebaa Farms the day after Oct. 7 ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people after Hamas' attacks on Israel. (That area is a disputed territory which Lebanon and Syria say belongs to Lebanon, and Israel controls and says belongs to Syria.) Hezbollah, sometimes called a state within a state, is backed by Iran and does not have widespread support in Lebanon.

Then Tuesday, Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, citing last week's assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and, this summer, the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

The Biden administration has long opposed an Israeli incursion into Lebanon. But in the past year, the administration has also been unwilling to take any meaningful steps to rein in Israel's behavior, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acting boldly to assert more dominance in the region and degrade Israel's adversaries -- with a continued disregard for civilian lives. Israeli airstrikes have struck medical facilities and already killed hundreds of civilians in Lebanon. The probability of a regional war seems to be growing by the day.

To better understand the unfolding conflict, I called Nick Blanford, a Beirut-based fellow at the Atlantic Council and the author of ""Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel.""

Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Zeeshan Aleem: What is happening right now and how do we know when to say whether this is a new war?

Nicholas Blanford: I think you have to put the developments of the last few weeks into some context. One day after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Hezbollah staged a pro forma attack against Israeli positions along the Lebanon-Israel border, and it dedicated this attack to its allies -- Hamas in Gaza. But very quickly it turned into a kind of a tit-for-tat, daily attacks. The Hezbollah guys would attack Israeli military positions along the border; the Israelis would retaliate with artillery fire airstrikes into south Lebanon. And this really continued from October almost uninterrupted.

There was a clear moment in September when Israel's patience ran out. And they escalated in a very dramatic fashion, by detonating thousands of pagers which they'd been able, apparently, to booby trap. The following day, they detonated hundreds of walkie-talkies. That was followed up by intense airstrikes across areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a presence. And those attacks have intensified over the past two weeks, climaxing on Sept. 27 with the massive airstrike on Hezbollah's underground headquarters in south Beirut, which killed the veteran Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who has led the group for 32 years. The latest development is the advance of some elite Israeli army units into southern Lebanon where they have reportedly already taken some casualties.

So I would say we are in a war but it is not yet full scale. Both sides are mainly hitting military targets, not infrastructure as well, although hundreds of civilians have been killed in Lebanon.

Could you give us a brief primer on Hezbollah? How it emerged, what it is, what it believes in and its social function in Lebanon?

Blanford: Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organization that follows the Iranian, theocratic system of rule. Hezbollah has a secretary general -- most recently the late Nasrallah -- but the true leader of Hezbollah is the spiritual leader of Iran, currently, Ali Khamenei. He's the ultimate authority and, in general, the Iranians will set the strategic agenda.

Hezbollah emerged after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to kick out the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was deployed in strength in south Lebanon. The Israelis in '82 reached all the way to Beirut and then they gradually withdrew. By 1985, they were occupying a border strip along the Lebanon-Israel border and Hezbollah became the main resistance force against that Israeli occupation. Particularly during the 1990s, Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran but also supported by neighboring Syria, was able to deal blow after blow to the Israeli occupation forces, and that culminated in May 2000 with Israel pulling out of south Lebanon.

Hezbollah refused to put down its arms after the Israelis left. They said, 'We need to keep our arms, our military force, to deter Israel from coming back into south Lebanon.' But there was also another unspoken reason, which is that Hezbollah gradually became a source of deterrence for Iran -- especially after the war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 when it expanded very quickly and acquired a great deal of weaponry from Iran, Syria and elsewhere. So, for Iran, Hezbollah has now become a major force multiplier.

Hezbollah has a slightly schizophrenic character, because it is ideologically beholden to the Islamic leadership of Iran, but of course it is a Lebanese organization. It survives or falls depending on the support it gets from the Lebanese Shia community, which is why, since the beginning, Hezbollah has invested a lot in social welfare organizations.

The Shia population of Lebanon tends to be traditionally fairly downtrodden. They live in the poorer areas of the country, traditionally neglected by central governments. And Hezbollah really stepped in with schools, with hospitals, with repairing war damaged houses, even things like helping farmers with agricultural aid. It's become an indispensable organization for the Lebanese Shia community. So they've been able to maintain that support since the early 1980s.

Other communities: the Christians and Sunnis, in particular, the Druze, to an extent, [say] 'Well, hang on a minute. We do have a national army. Why do we need a Shia militia, armed to the teeth, stronger than many armies around the world, to defend Lebanon?' So there have been growing calls for Hezbollah to disarm, and this is why Hezbollah has moved deeper into Lebanese politics, particularly over the last 19 years, since the 2005 parliamentary elections.

What are the fundamental dynamics driving how Hezbollah and Israel's government see each other, both in terms of geopolitical interests and domestic political interests?

Blanford: Ideologically, Hezbollah and Iran want to see the end of Israel, and the restitution of Palestine to the Palestinians. They have in the past assisted Palestinians during the Al Aqsa Intifada. They would help the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza fight the Israelis. But in the past, they didn't get directly involved. When they kicked the Israelis out of Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah didn't immediately rush across the border into Israel and say, ""We're going to go and liberate Jerusalem now."" There's an acknowledgment that it's up to the Palestinians to liberate themselves, but Hezbollah is definitely there to help.

When you look at it more realistically, the reason why Hezbollah is so powerful now is because the Iranians want them to be. We go back to this notion of Hezbollah forming a key role in Iran's deterrence architecture: The stronger Hezbollah becomes, the safer Iran feels.

The Institute for National Security Studies, a leading think tank in Israel, has for the past few years described Hezbollah as Israel's greatest threat, which is quite remarkable in itself, because we're not talking about a country, we're talking about an organization, albeit one that is backed by a powerful regional country.

The Israelis have watched Hezbollah grow stronger and stronger. What the Israelis are doing now is something they haven't dared to do before, and that is to really go for broke with Hezbollah. What's interesting is I think the Israelis are gambling that Hezbollah and the Iranians do not want a full-scale war with Israel right now. Why? Because if there is a full-scale war, whatever the outcome, Hezbollah will take a huge battering, as indeed we're seeing now, and there's no guarantee that Hezbollah will be able to rebuild, rearm and re-equip as quickly as it did after the 2006 war to continue serving as a deterrence for Iran. In other words, if Hezbollah gets engaged in a full-scale war now, Iran could lose its major deterrence factor in that war, and all this would be for the sake of coming to the support of Hamas in Gaza. Hamas is small fry compared to Hezbollah -- Hezbollah is much, much, much more important to Iran than Hamas. Which is why Hezbollah is still acting with a certain amount of restraint despite Israel's escalated action against it. Hezbollah still has not used its arsenal of precision-guided missiles.

It's a dangerous gamble. It could go wrong. Especially now that Israeli troops are operating on the ground in south Lebanon, Hezbollah's home turf. The current conflict could spill into a major war. We're still below that threshold moment, but if it happens, it has a potential to go regional, dragging in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Can you walk us through the different scenarios you see unfolding here?

Blanford: The least likely one is that a cease-fire comes in. The Americans and the French had an idea for a 21-day cease-fire to calm things down along the Lebanon-Israel border. Netanyahu has rejected it. So that's not going to happen..

A second scenario is that what we're seeing now continues. The Israelis haven't started hitting Lebanese infrastructure, power stations, bridges, roads, the airports, seaports; they are focusing on Hezbollah military targets by using air power and now ground forces, albeit in a limited manner. Hezbollah, by the same token, is striking back at Israeli military targets. They haven't been hitting Israeli infrastructure. Now this could go on even at this heightened rate. But under current circumstances, I suspect that Hezbollah will continue doing what it's doing -- in other words, absorb these blows that the Israelis have inflicted, and keep firing rockets into Israel.

In some respects, the Israeli ground maneuver could play right into Hezbollah's hands, as the Israelis are entering terrain that Hezbollah has had for 18 years [and Hezbollah has been able] to prepare for exactly this eventuality. When the Israelis did move into Lebanon in 2006 after two weeks of aerial bombing, they came in for a big surprise. They didn't understand Hezbollah's underground bunker networks, its ambush positions, firing positions.

You could have a similar scenario this time round, albeit on a larger scale, where the Israelis, who have a better understanding of what Hezbollah is about these days, could come in in force for what they would describe perhaps as a limited incursion to basically rubble-ize and depopulate this broad strip of south Lebanon. But they risk losing a lot of troops because they're going to be operating in Hezbollah's environment. And at the end of it, if the mission is successful, what do you do then? Do you reoccupy south Lebanon? If so, you've gone back to the situation between 1978 and 2000 and that didn't end too well for the Israelis. But if you pull back to the border, then what is to stop Hezbollah basically moving back into the border district and beginning to rebuild?

There could come a point when the Israelis say, 'We've hit all the targets from the air and our soldiers are fighting on the ground but Hezbollah is still firing rockets across the border.' And this is where perhaps a third scenario can kick in: The Israelis conclude that, well, we're going to have to escalate this even further by deploying a larger number of troops into Lebanon to expand the target set to include Lebanese infrastructure as well. It could be at that point that Hezbollah, with Iranian blessing, feels it has no choice but to launch its precision-guided systems at Israeli military and infrastructure targets. This is where the conflict could go regional.

What role does the U.S. have in all this, and what advice would you give to the Biden administration on how to prevent a full-scale regional war from breaking out?

Blanford: Yes, a regional war potentially could happen. If the Iranians assess that Hezbollah is about to get bludgeoned by Israel, they may conclude, 'We've got nothing left to lose. We're about to lose Hezbollah. Let's go large. We'll activate all our proxies across the region, and we'll give it a go and see what happens to Israel.'

I think the Biden administration is in a difficult position. President Biden is enormously frustrated with Netanyahu, partly because of the Gaza conflict going on for so long. But he has been urging Netanyahu since the get-go to not open a second front with Hezbollah. Now you could argue that a second front was open anyway, because of these simmering tit-for-tat attacks that have been going on across the Lebanon-Israel border since October. But these attacks were containable. Hezbollah has said, 'Look, this is a support front that we're doing. Once the war in Gaza ends, we're going to stop.' So the emphasis has been very much on trying to conclude a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which will then have a trickle-down effect and should stabilize the Lebanon-Israel border. But of course, we haven't had a Gaza cease-fire. The conflict continues, and now the Israelis clearly have lost patience with Hezbollah and have gone large.

There's very little that the Biden administration feels it can do, particularly when you've got a very close election coming up in just over a month now. So the Biden administration could do what it's done before, and then suspend arms shipments to Israel, but this time do it properly. Cut off all military support to Israel. That would put a lot of pressure on Netanyahu to start picking up the phone and listening when Biden calls. But I don't think they're going to do that because there'll be a political backlash in the United States, and that could affect Kamala Harris' chances against Donald Trump. I think Netanyahu is taking advantage of this and is going for it."
When is an interview too tough? CBS News grappling with question after Dokoupil interview,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/cbs-news-dokoupil-israel-coates-interview-tone-01035b94b1a824c1589555def1a52c6b,2024-10-08T19:43:47Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Television morning show interviews often don't stray beyond dinner recipes or celebrity hijinks. Yet a week after it took place, CBS News host Tony Dokoupil's pointed interview with author Ta-Nehisi Coates about Israel remains the subject of heated conversations at the network and beyond.

CBS management took the unusual step of scolding Dokoupil before his colleagues for not living up to network standards, in a private meeting Monday that quickly became public, and ""CBS Mornings"" staff continued to discuss it on Tuesday.

The seven-minute interview on Sept. 30 was about Coates' new book of essays, and Dokoupil zeroed in right away on a section about Israel and Palestinians in the West Bank in an exchange the Washington Post last week called ""unusually tense and substantive.""

For all of Coates' honors as a writer, Dokoupil said that the essay ""would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist."" He wondered why Coates' writing did not include references to Israel being surrounded by enemies that want to eliminate the country.

""Is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?"" he asked.

Coates said there was no shortage of places where Israel's viewpoint is represented, and that he wanted to speak for those who don't have a voice.

""I wrote a 260-page book,"" Coates said. ""It is not a treatise on the entirety of the conflict between the Israelis and the Palestinians.""

Dokoupil later asked Coates about what offended him about the existence of a Jewish state, and he said that Palestinians ""exist in your narrative merely as victims of Israel,"" as if they had not been offered peace in any juncture.

Coates said that he was offended when anyone -- including the Palestinians who talked to him for his book -- are treated as second-class citizens in the country where they live, comparing it to the Jim Crow-era United States where his ancestors grew up.

In the staff call on Monday, CBS News chief Wendy McMahon and her deputy, Adrienne Roark, said several journalists in the company had reached out to them about the interview.

""There are times we have not met our editorial standards,"" Roark said, citing Dokoupil's interviews and other comments made by CBS personnel that she did not identify.

CBS News is built on a ""foundation of neutrality,"" she said. ""Our job is to serve our audience without bias or perceived bias.""

She said that the problems had been addressed, but neither she nor CBS explained what this meant.

McMahon told staff members on the call that she expected its contents would remain confidential. But a tape of it was posted within hours on The Free Press news site.

Dokoupil did not immediately return messages seeking comment. A spokesman for Coates did not return a message.

Dokoupil is one of three ""CBS Mornings"" hosts, along with Gayle King and Nate Burleson. All three participated in the interview with Coates, but with the exception of an opening question by Burleson and a brief one at the end by King, it was dominated by Dokoupil.

Dokoupil is married to NBC News journalist Katy Tur. He has two children from a previous marriage who both live with their mother in Israel. In the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack, Dokoupil said on the show that, ""as a father, I think people can understand if somebody, anybody, is firing rockets in the direction of your children without regard to whether they are struck or not, you're going to feel a thing or two.""

The rebuke by CBS management Monday came on the first anniversary of the Hamas attack.

Management received immediate pushback on the call from Jan Crawford, CBS News' chief legal correspondent, who said that it's a journalist's obligation to ask tough questions when somebody comes on the air to present a one-sided view.

""I don't see how we can say that failed to meet our editorial standards,"" Crawford said. She said she worried that it would make her think twice when conducting interviews.

Ataques israelíes están trastocando el equilibrio de poder en Oriente Medio,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-b4a473447c9923bc9d7e5db222346f7b,2024-10-08T14:36:27Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israel está atacando a milicias respaldadas por Irán en una franja de casi 3.200 kilómetros (2.000 millas) y ha amenazado al mismo Irán, una gestión que podría poner fin a dos décadas de ascendencia iraní en la región inadvertidamente provocada por la invasión estadounidense de Irak en el 2003.

En Washington, Tel Aviv, Jerusalén y en las capitales árabes, los opositores y partidarios de la ofensiva israelí están ofreciendo ideas encontradas sobre qué debería hacer Estados Unidos a medida que su aliado se anota éxitos tácticos contra Hezbollah en el Lïbano y contra los hutíes en Yemen, y avanza en su campaña por aplastar al grupo Hamás en la Franja de Gaza.

Israel debe recibir todo el apoyo que necesita de Estados Unidos hasta que el gobierno iraní ""caiga en el basural de la historia como lo han hecho tantas dictaduras del pasado"", estimó Richard Goldberg, asesor sénior de la Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, una institución de inclinación conservadora en Washington. Es una postura que comparten algunos políticos israelíes.

Yendo aun más lejos, Yoel Guzansky, ex integrante del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional israelí, se manifestó a favor de que Estados Unidos se suma a Israel en un ataque conjunto contra Irán. Ello ""le enviaría un mensaje bien claro a los iraníes: no se metan con nosotros"", dijo Guzansky.

Sin embargo, hay quienes apuntan a lecciones de la campaña norteamericana en Irak y el derrocamiento de Saddam Hussein, cuando el entonces presidente George W. Bush ignoró advertencias árabes de que el dictador iraquí era un contrapeso indispensable contra la influencia iraní. Advierten que Estados Unidos no debe depender en victorias militares sin considerar los riesgos, objetivos y planes para siguientes etapas, y sobre la posibilidad de consecuencias indeseadas.

Al final Israel ""podría terminar en una situación en que sólo se puede proteger mediante una guerra perpetua"", dice Vali Nasr, quien fue asesor a la administración de Barack Obama y quien es hoy profesor en la Escuela de Estudios Internacionales Avanzados Johns Hopkins (SAIS) y ha sido uno de los principales estudiosos del ascenso de la influencia iraní desde la invasión estadounidense de Irak.

En momentos en que el primer ministro israelí Benjamin Netanyahu le presta limitada atención a los llamados de mesura que le hace el gobierno estadounidense, Washington y sus aliados en el Medio Oriente ""están a merced de cuán lejos quiere Netanyahu llevar las cosas"", dice Nasr.

""Es como si no hemos aprendido las lecciones del error de ese experimento ... en Irak en el 2003, sobre la idea de reestructurar el orden político del Medio Oriente"", sostiene Randa Slim, profesora en SAIS e investigadora del Middle East Institute, una institución en Washington.

Los partidarios de Israel están a favor de debilitar a Irán y las milicias que controla, las cuales atacan a Estados Unidos, Israel y sus aliados, reprimen a la sociedad civil y se ponen del lado de Rusia y otros adversarios de Occidente.

Los opositores advierten que acciones militares sin resolver los agravios de los palestinos y otros grupos podrían dejar al Medio Oriente en un espiral de guerra, insurgencias, violencia y la represión de regímenes que tratan de controlar la situación.

Está además la posibilidad de que Irán desarrolle armas nucleares en un intento por asegurar su supervivencia. Antes de los ataques israelíes contra Hezbollah, los líderes iraníes habían mostrado interés en regresar a la mesa de negociaciones sobre su programa nuclear y en general, en mejorar relaciones con Occidente.

En apenas semanas, los ataques y operaciones encubiertas israelíes han devastado la conducción, las filas y los arsenales de Hezbollah -- milicia libanesa que se había erguido como una de las fuerzas más potentes del Medio Oriente y una herramienta de Irán para defenderse de ataques contra su territorio -- y han golpeado instalaciones petroleras de los hutíes yemeníes.

Un año de ataques aéreos israelíes en Gaza parecen haber reducido la cúpula del grupo proiraní Hamás a unos pocos sobrevivientes escondidos en túneles. Sin embargo, las fuerzas israelíes nuevamente se vieron enfrascadas en combates allí esta semana y Hamás logró disparar cohetes contra Tel Aviv en el aniversario de los ataques que ese grupo perpetró contra Israel el 7 de octubre, hecho que desencadenó la actual guerra.

La anticipada represalia israelí contra Irán podría acelerar el cambio en el equilibrio de poder regional, luego que Irán lanzó misiles balísticos contra Israel la semana pasada en respuesta a los asesinatos de líderes de Hezbollah y Hamás. Podría también aumentar el riesgo de una conflagración regional más amplia, algo que el presidente Joe Biden y muchos gobiernos anteriores han tratado de evitar desde hace décadas.

El aumento de los ataques israelíes desde fines del mes pasado ha frustrado los intentos de Estados Unidos, Egipto y Qatar por lograr un cese al fuego y una liberación de rehenes en Gaza. Líderes estadounidenses dicen que Israel no les avisó antes de atacar a los líderes del Hezbollah en el Líbano, pero han defendido los asaltos israelíes aunque perseveran en sus intentos por lograr una tregua.

La vicepresidenta y candidata presidencial demócrata Kamala Harris dijo en una entrevista el lunes con el programa ""60 Minutes"" de CBS que Estados Unidos está decidido a darle a Israel las armas que necesite para su defensa, pero que al mismo tiempo seguirá con sus esfuerzos por poner fin al conflicto.

""No vamos a dejar de ejercer presión sobre Israel y sobre otros en la región, incluyendo los líderes árabes"", manifestó Harris.

Los ataques israelíes, para algunos, asoman la tentadora posibilidad de debilitar la alianza antioccidental y antiisraelí entre Irán y grupos afines en el Líbano, Irak, Siria y Yemen, y gobiernos como el de Rusia y Corea del Norte.

Las alianzas militares iraníes - apodadas ""El eje de la resistencia"" - crecieron primero a nivel regional y luego a nivel global luego que la invasión estadounidense de Irak derrocó a Saddam, quien había librado una guerra de ocho años contra el ambicioso régimen teocrático iraní.

Los partidarios de la invasión estadounidense de Irak y del derrocamiento de Saddam acertaron en cuanto a que la democracia iraquí se afianzaría, pero las consecuencias indeseadas fueron aun mayores, como el surgimiento del ""Eje de la resistencia"" y de nuevos grupos extremistas, como el Estado Islámico.

""Un Irán envalentonado y expansionista parece ser el único ganador"" de la guerra del 2003, dice una evaluación del ejército norteamericano sobre las lecciones derivadas de ese conflicto.

""Hace dos décadas, ¿quién se hubiera imaginado que Irán le estaría dando armas a Rusia? La explicación está en el aumento de su influencia tras el derrocamiento de Saddam"", dijo Ihsan Alshimary, profesor de ciencias políticas de la Universidad de Bagdad.

Aun más que en el 2003, los líderes globales están ofreciendo pocos vaticinios de cómo terminarán los cambios que están generando las acciones militares israelíes, ya sea para Irán, Israel, el Medio Oriente en general y Estados Unidos.

Irán y sus aliados están siendo debilitados, dijo Goldberg, de la Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. Pero también está disminuyendo la influencia estadounidense, al ser arrastrada por Israel, sostuvo Nasr.

El conflicto podría terminar perjudicando a Israel si se estanca, por ejemplo, en una guerra terrestre en el Líbano, dijo Mehran Kamrava, profesor y experto en temas del Medio Oriente en la Universidad de Georgetown en Qatar.

Tras cuatro décadas de intensa animosidad entre Israel y los líderes iraníes, ""la guerra fría entre ellos se ha convertido una guerra caliente. Y ello está cambiando, y sin duda cambiará, el panorama estratégico en el Medio Oriente"", afirmó Kamrava.

""Estamos sin duda en el precipicio de un cambio"", dijo Kamrava, pero ""la dirección y la naturaleza de ese cambio es muy difícil de predecir en estos momentos"".

"Facebook, YouTube and TikTok users in Europe get forum to challenge social media content decisions",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/meta-facebook-youtube-tiktok-european-union-43737583cf65696233bbdb522eb227bd,2024-10-08T08:34:13Z,"LONDON (AP) -- Social media users in the European Union will soon have a new forum to challenge decisions by platforms to remove posts and videos for breaking their rules or leave up others that may violate them.

An ""out of court dispute settlement body"" named the Appeals Center Europe said Tuesday it has been certified by Irish regulators to act as a referee on content moderation disputes across the 27-nation EU, starting with cases involving Facebook, YouTube and TikTok.

The center is similar to Meta's Oversight Board, a quasi-independent body set up in 2020 that acts like a supreme court for thorny decisions about content moderation issues on Facebook, Instagram and Threads submitted by users around the world.

Under the EU's digital rulebook known as the Digital Services Act, or DSA, tech companies and social media platforms are required to work with dispute settlement bodies and comply with any decisions they make. EU officials in Brussels wanted to give EU citizens a way to challenge any decisions made by Big Tech companies as they sought to balance the right to free speech against the goal of curbing online risks.

The center will hear appeals from users or groups located in the EU about ""everything from violence and incitement to hate speech to bullying and harassment,"" CEO Thomas Hughes said.

""It could be everything from a case that relates to a head of state all the way through to a neighborly dispute,"" Hughes said.

The Digital Services Act is a sweeping set of regulations that requires tech and social media companies operating in Europe to clean up their platforms under threat of hefty fines.

The Appeals Center, based in Dublin, where many Silicon Valley tech companies have their European headquarters, will start hearing complaints from users before the end of the year. It's initially dealing with Facebook, YouTube and TikTok users because it wanted to start with the biggest platforms, with plans to add others later. Unlike the Oversight Board, which can cherry pick the biggest and most important cases, the center will have to rule on every case it gets.

The Oversight Board both issues binding decisions on individual cases, such as ruling in September on three separate posts with the controversial Palestinian rallying cry "" from the river to the sea,"" and also weighs in on wider policy issues with non-binding recommendations, such as guidance in July on updating Meta's policies on non-consensual deepfakes after reviewing a case involving deepfake intimate images of two women.

The Appeals Center's decisions, in contrast, will be limited to whether content such as a post, photo or video violates each platform's rules.

Hughes said the center will hire staff from across the EU to handle what he said could be up to tens of thousands of cases each year. The staff will have expertise in specific regions, languages and policy areas.

Meta's Oversight Board is providing 15 million euros ($16.5 million) in startup funding, said Hughes, who was previously the Oversight Board's director. He added that the two bodies will operate separately but will ""point in the same direction in terms of platform accountability and transparency, user rights"" and applying a human rights framework to online speech.

The Appeals Center will fund its ongoing operations by charging tech companies 95 euros for every case it hears, as well as a 5 euro fee from users who raise disputes. This ""nominal"" fee is intended to stop people from ""gaming or abusing"" the system and will be refunded if a user wins, Hughes said.

The decisions are not binding, but users will still get their money back if the center rules in favor of their disputes, regardless of the action the platform does or does not take.

There's a 90-day deadline for decisions, but in most cases they will be made much more quickly, he said.

Ejército de Israel dice que mató a un alto mando de Hezbollah en un ataque en Beirut,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-615a6e7731f0d9f18baeba464b60b34d,2024-10-08T06:29:45Z,"JERUSALÉN (AP) -- El ejército de Israel dijo el martes que en la víspera mató a un alto comandante de Hezbollah en un ataque sobre Beirut, un día después de que el luto y las manifestaciones en todo el mundo marcaron el primer aniversario de los ataques del 7 de octubre.

Según el ejército, el ataque mató a Suhail Husseini, a quien presentó como responsable de supervisión logística, presupuestos y gestión del grupo político-paramilitar.

Hezbollah no realizó comentarios de inmediato.

Husseini estaría involucrado en la transferencia de armas avanzadas desde Irán y en su distribución a distintas unidades de Hezbollah, además de formar parte de su consejo militar, añadió el ejército.

En las últimas semanas, los ataques israelíes han eliminado al líder de Hezbollah, Hassan Nasrallah, y a varios de sus principales comandantes. Israel lanzó la semana pasada lo que dice que es una incursión terrestre limitada en el sur de Líbano.

Hezbollah afirma que ya ha sustituido a los comandantes asesinados y se comprometió a seguir lanzando cohetes, misiles y drones contra Israel hasta que se alcance un alto el fuego en Gaza, donde su aliado Hamás lleva un año en guerra con Israel.

Insurgentes palestinos en la Franja dispararon el lunes una andanada de cohetes hacia Israel, subrayando su resistencia frente a la devastadora ofensiva rival sobre el sitiado enclave, que se ha cobrado la vida de alrededor de 42.000 palestinos, según las autoridades sanitarias locales, destruyó amplias zonas y desplazó a cerca del 90% de su población.

Hace un año, insurgentes encabezados por Hamás abrieron agujeros en la cerca fronteriza de seguridad y asaltaron bases del ejército y comunidades agrícolas, mataron a unas 1.200 personas, en su mayoría civiles, y tomaron a otras 250 como rehenes. Siguen teniendo cerca de 100 cautivos en Gaza, pero se cree que un tercio de ellos estarían muertos.

Israel está en guerra ahora con Hamás en Gaza y con Hezbollah en Líbano, que comenzó a disparar cohetes al norte de Israel el 8 de octubre. El Ministerio de Salud libanés dijo el lunes que un ataque israelí sobre el sur del país, que formó parte de un operativo más amplio, mató a al menos 10 bomberos."
Middle East latest: Israeli military says it killed a senior Hezbollah commander in Beirut strike,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-8-october-2024-3169a0d6d77b4a195705b0c4ccbe99dd,2024-10-08T06:04:30Z,"The Israeli military said Tuesday it had killed a senior Hezbollah commander in a strike on Beirut, a day after the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack was marked by mourning and demonstrations around the globe.

The military said the strike killed Suhail Husseini, who it said was responsible for overseeing logistics, budget and management of the militant group.

Palestinian militants in Gaza fired a barrage of rockets into Israel on Monday, underscoring militants' resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive in Gaza that has killed about 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials, destroyed large areas and displaced around 90% of its population.

A year ago, Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's security fence and stormed into army bases and farming communities, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding about 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon, which began firing rockets at Israel on Oct. 8, 2023. On Monday, Lebanon's Health Ministry said an Israeli strike in the country's south, part of a wider bombardment, killed at least 10 firefighters. Hezbollah fired new barrages despite its recent losses.

Here is the latest:

JERUSALEM -- The Israeli military says it killed a senior Hezbollah commander in a strike on Beirut.

The military said Tuesday that it killed Suhail Husseini, who it said was responsible for overseeing logistics, budget and management of the militant group.

There was no immediate comment from Hezbollah.

The military said Husseini was involved in the transfer of advanced weapons from Iran and their distribution to different Hezbollah units, and that he was a member of the group's military council.

Israeli strikes have killed Hezbollah's overall leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and several of his top commanders in recent weeks. Last week, Israel launched what it says is a limited ground incursion into southern Lebanon.

Hezbollah says it has already replaced its slain commanders. It has vowed to keep firing rockets, missiles and drones into Israel until there is a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip, where its ally Hamas has been at war with Israel for a year."
"Israel's strikes are shifting the power balance in the Middle East, with US support",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-middle-east-war-united-states-36d7c0bbc35964ed6ac9d21de17c632a,2024-10-08T04:13:11Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israeli military strikes are targeting Iran's armed allies across a nearly 2,000-mile stretch of the Middle East and threatening Iran itself. The efforts raise the possibility of an end to two decades of Iranian ascendancy in the region, to which the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq inadvertently gave rise.

In Washington, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and Arab capitals, opponents and supporters of Israel's offensive are offering clashing ideas about what the U.S. should do next, as its ally racks up tactical successes against Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen and presses its yearlong campaign to crush Hamas in Gaza.

Israel should get all the support it needs from the United States until Iran's government ""follows other dictatorships of the past into the dustbin of history,"" said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at Washington's conservative-leaning Foundation for the Defense of Democracies -- calls echoed by some Israeli political figures.

Going further, Yoel Guzansky, a former senior staffer at Israel's National Security Council, called for the Biden administration to join Israel in direct attacks in Iran. That would send ""the right message to the Iranians -- 'Don't mess with us,''' Guzansky said.

Critics, however, highlight lessons from the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and toppling of Saddam Hussein, when President George W. Bush ignored Arab warnings that the Iraqi dictator was the region's indispensable counterbalance to Iranian influence. They caution against racking up military victories without adequately considering the risks, end goals or plans for what comes next, and warn of unintended consequences.

Ultimately, Israel ""will be in a situation where it can only protect itself by perpetual war,"" said Vali Nasr, who was an adviser to the Obama administration. Now a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, or SAIS, he has been one of the leading documenters of the rise of Iranian regional influence since the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu giving limited weight to Biden administration calls for restraint, the United States and its partners in the Middle East are ""at the mercy of how far Bibi Netanyahu will push it,"" Nasr said, referring to the Israeli leader by his nickname.

""It's as if we hadn't learned the lessons, or the folly, of that experiment ... in Iraq in 2003 about reshaping the Middle East order,"" said Randa Slim, a fellow at SAIS and researcher at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

Advocates of Israel's campaign hope for the weakening of Iran and its armed proxies that attack the U.S., Israel and their partners, oppress civil society and increasingly are teaming up with Russia and other Western adversaries.

Opponents warn that military action without resolving the grievances of Palestinians and others risks endless and destabilizing cycles of war, insurgency and extremist violence, and Middle East governments growing more repressive to try to control the situation.

And there's the threat that Iran develops nuclear weapons to try to ensure its survival. Before the Israeli strikes on Hezbollah, Iranian leaders concerned about Israel's offensives had made clear that they were interested in returning to negotiations with the U.S. on their nuclear program and claimed interest in improved relations overall.

In just weeks, Israeli airstrikes and intelligence operations have devastated the leadership, ranks and arsenals of Lebanon-based Hezbollah -- which had been one of the Middle East's most powerful fighting forces and Iran's overseas bulwark against attacks on Iranian territory -- and hit oil infrastructure of Yemen's Iran-allied Houthis.

A year of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza appears to have reduced the leadership of Iranian-allied Hamas to a few survivors hiding in underground tunnels. However, Israeli forces again engaged in heavy fighting there this week, and Hamas was able to fire rockets at Tel Aviv in a surprising show of enduring strength on the Oct. 7 anniversary of the militant group's attack on Israel, which started the war.

Anticipated Israeli counterstrikes on Iran could accelerate regional shifts in power. The response would follow Iran launching ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for killings of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

It also could escalate the risk of all-out regional war that U.S. President Joe Biden -- and decades of previous administrations -- worked to avert.

The expansion of Israeli attacks since late last month has sidelined mediation by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar for a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. U.S. leaders say Israel did not warn them before striking Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon but have defended the surge in attacks, while still pressing for peace.

Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" aired Monday that the U.S. was dedicated to supplying Israel with the military aid needed to protect itself but would keep pushing to end the conflict.

""We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders,"" she said.

Israel's expanded strikes raise for many what is the tempting prospect of weakening Iran's anti-Western, anti-Israel alliance with like-minded armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen to governments in Russia and North Korea.

Called the ""Axis of Resistance,"" Iran's military alliances grew -- regionally, then globally -- after the U.S. invasion of Iraq removed Saddam, who had fought an eight-year war against Iran's ambitious clerical regime.

Advocates of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and overthrow of Saddam, said correctly that an Iraqi democracy would take hold.

But the unintended effects of the U.S. intervention were even bigger, including the rise of Iran's Axis of Resistance and new extremist groups, including the Islamic State.

""An emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor"" of the 2003 Iraq war, notes a U.S. Army review of lessons learned.

""Two decades ago, who could have seen a day when Iran was supporting Russia with arms? The reason is because of its increased influence"" after the U.S. overthrow of Saddam, said Ihsan Alshimary, professor of political science at Baghdad University.

Even more than in 2003, global leaders are offering little clear idea on how the shifts in power that Israel's military is putting in motion will end -- for Iran, Israel, the Middle East at large, and the United States.

Iran and its allies are being weakened, said Goldberg, at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. So is U.S. influence as it appears to be dragged along by Israel, Nasr said.

The conflict could end up hurting Israel if it bogs down in a ground war in Lebanon, for example, said Mehran Kamrava, a professor and Middle East expert at Georgetown University in Qatar.

After four decades of deep animosity between Israeli and Iranian leaders, ""the cold war between them has turned into a hot war. And this is significantly changing -- is bound to change -- the strategic landscape in the Middle East,"" he said.

""We are certainly at the precipice of change,"" Kamrava said. But ""the direction and nature of that change is very hard to predict at this stage.""

Gaza está en ruinas tras un año de ofensiva israelí. La reconstrucción podría tomar décadas,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-domestic-news-b79a673b1fc3b067d91af0455a4ad182,2024-10-07T18:24:31Z,"Hay montañas de escombros donde antes había bloques de apartamentos y charcos de agua contaminada con aguas residuales que propagan enfermedades. Las calles de las ciudades se han convertido en cañones de tierra y, en muchos lugares, el aire está impregnado del hedor de cadáveres no recuperados.

La ofensiva israelí contra Hamás, una de las más mortíferas y destructivas en la historia reciente, ha matado a más de 41.000 personas, un poco más de la mitad de ellas mujeres y niños, según los funcionarios de salud locales. Sin un final a la vista para la guerra, y sin un plan para el día después, es imposible decir cuándo -- o hasta si -- algo será reconstruido.

Incluso después de que cesen los combates, cientos de miles de personas podrían quedar atrapadas y vivir en campamentos de tiendas de campaña durante años. Los expertos dicen que la reconstrucción podría tomar décadas.

""Esta guerra es destrucción y miseria. Haría que las piedras clamaran"", dijo Shifaa Hejjo, un ama de casa de 60 años, quien vive en una tienda de campaña instalada en el terreno donde antes estuvo su casa. ""Quienquiera que vea Gaza ... lo hará llorar"".

Israel culpa a Hamás por la destrucción. El ataque de ese grupo palestino contra Israel el 7 de octubredel año pasado -- en el que murieron unas 1.200 personas y unas 250 fueron tomadas como rehenes -- provocó la guerra. Israel dice que Hamás incrustó gran parte de su infraestructura militar, incluidos cientos de kilómetros (millas) de túneles, en áreas densamente pobladas donde se libraron algunas de las batallas más duras.

Los combates dejaron aproximadamente una cuarta parte de todas las estructuras en Gaza destruidas o gravemente dañadas, según una evaluación de la ONU en septiembre con base en videos satelitales. Dijo que alrededor del 66% de las estructuras, incluidas más de 227.000 unidades de vivienda, habían sufrido al menos algún daño.

Si hay un alto al fuego, alrededor de la mitad de las familias ""no tendrán a dónde regresar"", dijo Alison Ely, coordinadora en Gaza del Shelter Cluster, una coalición internacional de proveedores de ayuda liderada por el Consejo Noruego para los Refugiados.

Casi tantos edificios han sido destruidos o dañados en Gaza como en toda Ucrania después de sus primeros dos años de guerra con Rusia, según Corey Scher y Jamon Van Den Hoek, investigadores con sede en Estados Unidos que utilizan radares satelitales para documentar la devastación de las guerras.

Para poner eso en perspectiva: Gaza tiene menos de la mitad del tamaño de Kiev, la capital de Ucrania.

La cantidad de destrucción solo en el centro y sur de Gaza, dijo Scher, es aproximadamente equivalente a lo que se perdió en la ciudad de primera línea de Bajmut, escenario de una de las batallas más mortíferas en la guerra de Ucrania y donde las fuerzas rusas destruyeron casi todos los edificios a su paso para obligar a las tropas ucranianas a retirarse. La destrucción en el norte de Gaza es aún peor, agregó.

El sistema de agua y saneamiento de Gaza ha colapsado. Más del 80% de sus instalaciones sanitarias -- y un porcentaje mayor de sus carreteras -- están dañadas o destruidas.

""No puedo pensar en ningún paralelo, en términos de la severidad de los daños, para un enclave, un país o un pueblo"", manifestó Scher.

A finales de enero, el Banco Mundial estimó que los daños ascendían a 18.500 millones de dólares: casi la producción económica combinada de Cisjordania y Gaza en 2022. Eso fue antes de algunas operaciones terrestres israelíes intensamente destructivas, incluso en la ciudad sureña fronteriza de Rafah.

En enero, cuando las fuerzas terrestres israelíes avanzaron hacia la ciudad de Jan Yunis, en el sur, Shifaa Hejjo y su familia huyeron de su casa de cuatro pisos con solo la ropa que vestían.

Pasaron meses en varios campamentos de tiendas de campaña antes de que ella decidiera regresar. Y lo que vio la hizo llorar.

Todo su vecindario había sido destruido: su antigua casa y los caminos que conducían a ella estaban hundidos en un mar de escombros.

""No la reconocí"", dijo. ""No sabía dónde estaban las casas de la gente"".

Alrededor del 90% de los 2,3 millones de habitantes de Gaza han sido desplazados por la guerra, a menudo varias veces, según estimaciones de la ONU. Cientos de miles se han apiñado en campamentos de tiendas de campaña en expansión cerca de la costa sin electricidad, agua corriente ni baños. El hambre está extendida.

Hejjo vivió en una tienda de campaña en el patio de un hospital. Antes de eso, estuvo en Muwasi, el principal campamento de tiendas de campaña en el sur de Gaza.

""Olía mal"", reportó. ""Había enfermedades que se propagaban"".

Agregó que su esposo, quien sufría una enfermedad hepática, se sintió destrozado cuando escuchó que su casa había sido destruida y murió poco después.

Ella fue una de las primeras en regresar después de que las fuerzas israelíes se retiraran en abril. Sus vecinos se mantuvieron alejados, temerosos de encontrar cuerpos o bombas sin explotar.

Pero para ella, ese todavía era su hogar.

""Es mejor vivir en mi casa, donde viví durante 37 años, aunque esté destruida"", dijo.

Hejjo y sus hijos cavaron entre los escombros con palas y con las manos, ladrillo por ladrillo, para rescatar todo lo que se pudiera reutilizar. Usaron ropa rasgada para alimentar el fuego de la cocina.

Las ratas se habían colado y enjambres de mosquitos revoloteaban sobre las ruinas. Había vidrios rotos por todas partes. Montaron una tienda de campaña fortificada con láminas de metal corrugado y algunos ladrillos rescatados de su casa destruida. Una ligera llovizna mojó sus ropas mientras dormían.

Las agencias de la ONU dicen que el desempleo se ha disparado a alrededor del 80%, en comparación con casi el 50% antes de la guerra y que casi toda la población vive en la pobreza. Incluso a quienes tienen medios les resultaría casi imposible importar materiales de construcción debido a las restricciones israelíes, los combates en curso y el colapso de la ley y el orden.

El primer obstáculo para cualquier reconstrucción significativa son los escombros: montañas de ellos.

Donde antes había casas, tiendas y edificios de oficinas, ahora hay enormes montones de escombros con restos humanos, sustancias peligrosas y municiones sin explotar.

La ONU estima que la guerra ha dejado unas 40 millones de toneladas de escombros en Gaza, suficientes para llenar el Central Park de Nueva York a una profundidad de ocho metros (unos 25 pies). Podría tomar hasta 15 años y casi 650 millones de dólares limpiarlo todo, dijo.

También está la cuestión de dónde deshacerse de ellos: la ONU calcula que se necesitarían unos cinco kilómetros cuadrados (unas dos millas cuadradas) de terreno, que será difícil de conseguir en el territorio pequeño y densamente poblado.

No sólo se destruyeron viviendas, sino también infraestructura crítica.

La ONU estima que casi el 70% de las plantas de agua y saneamiento de Gaza han sido destruidas o dañadas. Eso incluye las cinco instalaciones de tratamiento de aguas residuales del territorio, además de plantas de desalinización, estaciones de bombeo de aguas residuales, pozos y embalses.

Los empleados que antes gestionaban los sistemas municipales de agua y de residuos han sido desplazados y algunos han muerto. Y la escasez de combustible ha dificultado el mantenimiento de instalaciones que siguen intactas.

La organización benéfica internacional Oxfam dijo que solicitó un permiso para traer unidades de desalinización y tuberías para reparar la infraestructura hídrica en diciembre. Israel tardó tres meses en aprobar el envío, que aún no entra en Gaza, agregó Oxfam.

La destrucción de las redes de alcantarillado ha dejado las calles inundadas de agua pútrida, lo que acelera la propagación de enfermedades.

No ha habido energía central en Gaza desde los primeros días de la guerra, cuando su única planta eléctrica se vio obligada a cerrar por falta de combustible, y más de la mitad de la red eléctrica del territorio ha sido destruida, según el Banco Mundial.

Los países árabes ricos, como Arabia Saudí y Emiratos Árabes Unidos, han dicho que están dispuestos a contribuir a la reconstrucción de Gaza sólo como parte de un acuerdo de posguerra que cree una ruta hacia un estado palestino.

Benjamin Netanyahu, el primer ministro israelí, ha descartado esa posibilidad y ha dicho que no permitirá que Hamás o incluso la Autoridad Palestina, apoyada por Occidente, gobiernen Gaza. Ha informado que Israel mantendrá un control de seguridad ilimitado y delegará los asuntos civiles a los palestinos locales. Pero hasta donde se sabe, nadie se ha ofrecido como voluntario y Hamás ha amenazado con matar a cualquiera que ayude a la ocupación.

La reconstrucción de Gaza también requeriría la importación de cantidades masivas de materiales de construcción y equipo pesado, algo que es poco probable que Israel permita mientras exista la posibilidad de que Hamás reconstruya su infraestructura bélica. En cualquier caso, Gaza sólo tiene un pequeño número de cruces con capacidad limitada.

El organismo militar israelí que coordina los asuntos civiles en Gaza dice que no restringe la entrada de suministros civiles y permite los llamados artículos de doble uso que también podrían utilizarse con fines militares. Israel autorizó la entrada de algunos materiales de construcción antes de la guerra bajo lo que se conocía como el Mecanismo de Reconstrucción de Gaza, pero estaban sujeto a fuertes restricciones y retrasos.

La coalición Shelter Cluster estima que se necesitarían 40 años para reconstruir todas las casas destruidas en Gaza bajo esas condiciones.

Por ahora, los proveedores de asistencia tienen dificultades para traer suficientes tiendas de campaña básicas debido al número limitado de camiones que entran en Gaza y a las dificultades para entregar la ayuda. Los esfuerzos para traer viviendas temporales más sólidas todavía están en las primeras etapas, y nadie ha intentado traer materiales de construcción, según Ely.

En septiembre, Shelter Cluster estimó que 900.000 personas todavía necesitaban tiendas de campaña, ropa de cama y otros artículos para prepararse para los inviernos típicamente fríos y lluviosos de la región.

Países de todo el mundo conmemoran aniversario de ataques de 7 de octubre,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-6532e68218f1d799153128395777e026,2024-10-07T17:41:23Z,"BUDAPEST (AP) -- Vigilias, conmemoraciones y actos de recordación se planearon en todo el mundo el lunes por el primer aniversario de los ataques de Hamás contra Israel, pidiendo el fin del antisemitismo y la liberación de los rehenes israelíes.

El sorpresivo ataque transfronterizo del año pasado, en que murieron unas 1.200 personas, tomó desprevenido a Israel durante una importante festividad judía, quebrantando el sentido de seguridad de los israelíes y dejando a muchos países, que de antemano estaban nerviosos por la invasión rusa de Ucrania, enfrentando la posibilidad de otra conflagración bélica en el Oriente Medio.

Las naciones de Europa, hogar de muchas comunidades judías y musulmanas, han tratado de sofocar los ánimos antisemitas y antiislámicos luego del ataque del grupo Hamás y la subsiguiente represalia israelí en Gaza, que ha matado a unas 41.000 personas y ha desplazado a unas 1,9 millones.

El Vaticano conmemoró el aniversario recaudando fondos para el pueblo de Gaza y publicando una carta del papa Francisco en que expresa su solidaridad con los católicos de la región.

Francisco no mencionó a Israel, a Hamás ni a los rehenes en la carta fechada el 7 de octubre. Mencionó que el año pasado fue prendida ""la mecha del odio"" y la subsiguiente espiral de violencia, insistiendo en que lo que se necesita es diálogo y paz.

""Estoy con ustedes, pueblo de Gaza, desde hace tiempo atribulado y en dificultades. Están en mis pensamientos y mis oraciones a diario"", escribió el pontífice.

Luego de unos comentarios que enojaron a Israel a inicios del conflicto, el papa ha tratado de mantener un tono equilibrado. Pero recientemente ha sugerido que Israel ha estado usando una fuerza desproporcionada e ""inmoral"" en Líbano y Gaza.

Dijo que particularmente está cerca de quienes se han visto obligados a huir de sus hogares y refugiarse de las bombas, y de las madres que lloran a sus hijos muertos y los que ""temen alzar la mirada por temor al fuego que llueve del cielo"".

La cancillería alemana en Berlín estaba adornada con una cinta amarilla, símbolo del deseo de que sean liberados los rehenes israelíes tomados por Hamás, de los cuales unos 100 siguen en cautiverio y muchos de los cuales podrían estar muertos.

Se leyeron en voz alta los nombres de cada una de las personas asesinadas y tomadas como rehenes en el ataque, frente a la Puerta de Brandeburgo en Alemania a partir de las 5:29 de la mañana hora local, la hora exacta que empezó el ataque un año atrás.

El canciller alemán Olaf Scholz, dirigiéndose a ""nuestros queridos amigos en Israel"", declaró: ""Los acompañamos en su sentimiento ... nos plantamos a su lado"".

Pero también mencionó el sufrimiento de los palestinos en Gaza y expresó que ""la experiencia diaria de violencia y hambre no es una base sobre la cual pueden crecer cosas buenas"".

Scholz, ante una conferencia en Hamburgo, dijo que Alemania está tratando de lograr un cese al fuego y la liberación de los rehenes y ""un proceso político, aunque esté hoy más lejos que nunca"". Afirmó que el objetivo debe ser una solución de dos Estados y que ello es sólo posible si es evitada una conflagración regional más amplia, añadiendo que Hezbollah e Irán deben cesar sus ataques contra Israel.

EEUU ha gastado cifra récord en ayuda a Israel desde inicio de guerra en Gaza,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/general-news-49f2e56e58227c28dc174d0d1959a00e,2024-10-07T15:00:39Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Estados Unidos ha gastado un récord de al menos 17.900 millones de dólares en ayuda militar a Israel desde que comenzó la guerra en Gaza y llevó a una escalada del conflicto en todo Oriente Medio, según un informe del proyecto Costos de la Guerra de la Universidad de Brown, publicado el lunes al cumplirse un año de los ataques del grupo armado palestino Hamás contra Israel.

Se han destinado 4.860 millones de dólares adicionales a la intensificación de las operaciones militares estadounidenses en la región desde los ataques del 7 de octubre de 2023, dijeron los investigadores. Eso incluye los costos de una campaña liderada por la Armada para sofocar los ataques contra el transporte marítimo comercial por parte de los hutíes de Yemen, aliados de Hamás y respaldados por Irán.

El informe -- completado antes que Israel abriera un segundo frente, esta vez contra el grupo político-paramilitar Hezbollah, también respaldado por Irán, en el Líbano, a fines de septiembre -- es uno de los primeros recuentos de los costos estimados de Estados Unidos, mientras el gobierno del presidente Joe Biden respalda a Israel en sus conflictos en Gaza y Líbano y busca contener las hostilidades de los grupos armados aliados de Irán en la región.

El costo financiero se suma al costo en vidas humanas: los milicianos de Hamás mataron a más de 1.200 personas en Israel hace un año y tomaron a unos 250 como rehenes. La ofensiva de represalia de Israel ha cobrado la vida de casi 42.000 personas en Gaza, según el Ministerio de Salud palestino, que no distingue entre civiles y combatientes en su recuento.

Al menos 1.400 personas en Líbano, incluidos combatientes de Hezbollah y civiles, han muerto desde que Israel amplió sus ataques en ese país a fines de septiembre.

Los costos financieros fueron calculados por Linda J. Bilmes, profesora de la Facultad de Gobierno John F. Kennedy de Harvard, quien ha evaluado los costos totales de las guerras estadounidenses desde los ataques del 11 de septiembre de 2001, y sus colegas investigadores William D. Hartung y Stephen Semler.

Entre otros datos, se destaca que Israel es el mayor receptor de ayuda militar estadounidense en la historia, con 251.200 millones de dólares ajustados a la inflación desde 1959, según el informe.

Aun así, los 17.900 millones de dólares gastados desde el 7 de octubre de 2023 en dólares ajustados a la inflación son, con mucho, la mayor cantidad de ayuda militar enviada a Israel en un año.

Gran parte de las armas estadounidenses entregadas en el año fueron municiones, desde proyectiles de artillería hasta destructores de búnkeres de 2.000 libras y bombas guiadas de precisión.

Los gastos van desde los 4.000 millones de dólares para reponer los sistemas de defensa antimisiles Cúpula de Hierro y Honda, de Israel, hasta dinero en efectivo para fusiles y combustible para aviones, según el estudio."

"Traumatizados y con varios frentes abiertos, los israelíes enfrentan el aniversario del 7 de octubre",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-186845afb2973da28c3c4c70cf2d6ee6,2024-10-07T14:18:08Z,"RE'IM, Israel (AP) -- Los israelíes celebraban el lunes ceremonias solemnes para conmemorar el primer aniversario del ataque más letal en la historia del país, un asalto liderado por Hamás que hizo añicos su sensación de seguridad y abrió guerras en dos frentes que no dan visos de terminar.

Por su parte, Hamás dedicó el aniversario de su ataque del 7 de octubre de 2023 lanzando un aluvión de cohetes a Tel Aviv, lo que subrayaba su resiliencia tras un año de guerra y devastación en Gaza. El grupo político y militar libanés Hezbollah, que comenzó a lanzar cohetes a Israel el 8 de octubre en apoyo de su aliado Hamás, prometió mantener los ataques pese a sus recientes pérdidas.

El inesperado ataque transfronterizo, que tomó desprevenidos a los israelíes en un importante feriado judío, remeció su fe en sus líderes y su ejército, y sus consecuencias aún continúan un año más tarde. Unos 100 rehenes capturados ese día -- de lo que se cree que un tercio ha muerto -- siguen sin regresar, y los esfuerzos de buscar un cese el fuego están paralizados.

La guerra en Gaza sigue en marcha, Israel libra una nueva guerra contra Hezbollah, que comenzó a atacar Israel el 8 de octubre, y un conflicto creciente con Irán -- que respalda tanto a Hamás como a Hezbollah -- amenaza con hundir la región en una conflagración mucho más peligrosa.

No había actos conmemorativos programados en la Franja de Gaza, donde continúan los combates, hay enormes zonas destruidas por completo y la mayor parte de la población ha sido expulsada de sus hogares.

En Líbano, mientras tanto, al menos 10 bomberos murieron en un ataque israelí, dentro de una serie de bombardeos que han matado a docenas de trabajadores de emergencias, según el Ministerio libanés de Salud. Los bomberos estaban en un edificio municipal en la localidad sureña de Baraachit que fue alcanzado cuando se preparaban para salir en una misión de rescate.

El Ejército israelí no hizo comentarios en un primer momento.

Los israelíes acudieron a ceremonias, cementerios y monumentos en todo el país en recuerdo de los cientos de víctimas, las docenas de rehenes que siguen cautivos y los soldados heridos o caídos cuando intentaban salvarlos. También había actos conmemorativos planificados en Europa y otros lugares.

Los milicianos liderados por Hamás mataron a unas 1.200 personas, en su mayoría civiles, en el ataque del 7 de octubre y secuestraron a otras 250.

Antes del amanecer, cientos de familiares de los fallecidos en el festival de música Nova, junto con el presidente de Israel, Isaac Herzog, se reunieron en el lugar donde al menos 364 asistentes murieron baleados y muchos otros fueron capturados. Al salir el sol, los organizadores reprodujeron la misma pieza de música trance que se interrumpió de pronto cuando comenzó la andanada de cohetes.

A las 6:29 de la mañana, justo cuando comenzó el ataque de Hamás, los asistentes se pusieron en pie y guardaron un momento de silencio. El llanto de una mujer rompió el silencio mientras se oían explosiones de los combates en Gaza, apenas a unos kilómetros de distancia.

""Cuando estamos aquí, estamos cerca de nuestros seres queridos, este es el momento en el que bailaban y huían"", dijo Sigal Bar-On, cuya sobrina, Yuval Bar-On, de 25 años, y su prometido, Moshe Shuva, de 34, planeaban casarse en diciembre de 2023.

""No podemos entender cómo ha pasado un año"", dijo Shimon Busika, padre de Yarden Busika, de 25 años y que fue asesinado en el festival. ""Es el lugar más natural donde estar, estar aquí para este momento de silencio"".

A las 6:31 de la mañana, cuatro proyectiles se lanzaron desde Gaza hacia las mismas poblaciones israelíes que sufrieron el duro asalto el año pasado, según el ejército israelí. La ceremonia no se vio interrumpida.

El Ejército dijo que otros cinco cohetes salieron de la ciudad sureña gazatí de Jan Yunis hacia el centro de Israel e hicieron sonar las sirenas antiaéreas en Tel Aviv. Dos mujeres sufrieron heridas leves, según personal de emergencia, y se reportaron daños menores. El Ejército dijo que había alcanzado los lugares desde donde se habían lanzado los proyectiles.

Familiares de rehenes que siguen en Gaza se congregaron por la mañana cerca de la residencia en Jerusalén del primer ministro, Benjamin Netanyahu, y se mantuvieron en pie durante dos minutos mientras sonaba una sirena, una costumbre de los días más solemnes en el calendario israelí: el Recuerdo del Holocausto y el Día de los Caídos.

""Estamos aquí para recordar (a los rehenes), que no nos hemos olvidado de ellos"", dijo Shiri Albag, cuya hija, Liri, está entre los cautivos. Albag tenía un mensaje para Netanyahu, que ""no le dejaremos descansar hasta que todos ellos estén de vuelta, hasta el último"", dijo a la multitud, que mostraba carteles con los rostros de los rehenes.

Netanyahu emitió un comunicado que rendía homenaje a los muertos o capturados y dijo que ""hace un año pasamos por una masacre terrible y nos levantamos como nación como leones"".

Las banderas en el parlamento israelí, la Knéset, ondeaban a media asta. Estaba previsto que el lunes por la tarde se emitiera una ceremonia oficial de Estado centrada en actos de valor y esperanza. La ceremonia se grabó con antelación sin público, al parecer para evitar posibles interrupciones, en la ciudad sureña de Ofakim, donde fueron asesinados unas dos docenas de israelíes.

Pero la ira contra el gobierno por no evitar el ataque y la frustración persistente porque no ha recuperado a los rehenes que quedan hizo que las familias de varios de los fallecidos y capturados organizaran un acto separado en Tel Aviv.

Estaba previsto que el evento congregara a decenas de miles de personas, pero se vio reducido de forma drástica por las restricciones a las grandes aglomeraciones debido a la amenaza de ataques de misiles de Irán y Hezbollah.

La guerra en Gaza ha matado a más de 41.000 palestinos, desplazado a la mayoría de los 2,3 millones de habitantes del territorio e iniciado una crisis humanitaria que ha llevado a un hambre generalizada.

Pero Hamás sigue controlando el territorio y sus fuerzas se han reagrupado de forma reiterada en zonas donde Israel ha realizado grandes operaciones. Tropas israelíes rodearon el domingo la localidad norteña de Jabaliya y comenzaron otra gran operación allí que según el Ejército pretende expulsar a los milicianos.

En Líbano, Hezbollah ha seguido disparando cohetes, misiles y drones a Israel incluso después de una sucesión de ataques israelíes en las últimas semanas que mataron a la mayoría de su cúpula, incluido su veterano líder Hassan Nasrallah, y castigaron amplias zonas de Líbano. Israel emprendió la semana pasada lo que por ahora es una operación terrestre limitada al otro lado de la frontera.

Al menos 1.400 libaneses, incluidos civiles, médicos y combatientes de Hezbollah, han muerto y 1,2 millones han sido expulsados de sus hogares. Israel dice que intenta expulsar al grupo armado y político de su frontera para que decenas de miles de ciudadanos israelíes puedan regresar a casa.

Israel también ha prometido responder a un ataque de misiles balísticos de Irán la semana pasada que según Teherán respondía a los asesinatos de Nasrallah, el líder de Hamás Ismail Haniyeh y uno de los generales de su Guardia Revolucionaria.

En un comunicado el lunes, Hezbollah prometió seguir luchando hasta que haya un cese el fuego en Gaza y dijo que Israel ""era y seguirá siendo una glándula mortal, agresiva, cancerosa, que debe ser eliminada, sin importar cuánto tiempo tome"".

Trump and Harris mark somber anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-oct-7-hamas-israel-78ba85f87ea89fa93c6537f77ca81b25,2024-10-07T14:07:35Z,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are marking the first anniversary of the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust as the presidential candidates approach the final weeks of the campaign during a widening conflict in the Middle East.

Trump will speak before Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in the Miami suburb of Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and plant a pomegranate tree with her husband on the grounds of the Vice President's residence in honor of the 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, who were killed by Hamas-led militants in the Oct. 7 attack last year.

Harris' husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, will recite a prayer at an event to commemorate the anniversary with the American Jewish Committee.

Trump has blamed both Harris and President Joe Biden for the war, arguing their administration empowered Iran, and tried to take advantage of some of the divisions within the Democratic Party with progressives protesting Israel's military campaign, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians.

Some of his statements on Israel overlook his association with people who spew antisemitic rhetoric such as far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.

Trump has also repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats ""should have their head examined"" and recently said that if he loses the presidential election to Harris on Nov. 5 ""the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that.""

In an excerpt released from an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air Monday night, Harris appeared to avoid answering a question about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered ""a real close ally,"" and said that ""The better question is: Do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.""

Trump's own relations with Netanyahu have been rocky. They soured after the Israeli prime minister became one of the first world leaders to congratulate President Joe Biden for his 2020 victory, which Trump continues to deny. A few days after the Oct. 7 attack last year, Trump publicly criticized Netanyahu and said he ""was not prepared"" for the deadly incursion from Gaza on Oct. 7. Trump said Netanyahu had let the U.S. down just before the U.S. killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020.

Since then, the two have met to talk about a cease-fire deal for Gaza.

Halie Soifer, head of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said the conflict in the Middle East -- including fighting with Hezbollah and Iran -- has left Jewish voters ""with a sense of vulnerability and concern for Israel's future."" Soifer previously advised Harris on national security issues.

But she says Harris has been consistent with the message of commitment to Israel's defense for the last year, and said Harris and Biden have directed U.S. forces to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel on multiple occasions."
Countries around the world commemorate the anniversary of Hamas attack on Israel,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hamas-attack-israel-anniversary-protests-b8f7428b707f2cf4300405feca0b570e,2024-10-07T11:25:07Z,"BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) -- Vigils, commemorations and acts of remembrance were planned across the world on Monday to mark one year since the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel as world leaders called for an end to antisemitism and the release of Israeli hostages.

Last year's surprise cross-border attack, which killed about 1,200 people, caught Israel unprepared on a major Jewish holiday, shattering Israelis' sense of security and putting many countries, already on edge over Russia's war in Ukraine, facing the prospect of another major conflict in the Middle East.

The nations of Europe, home to many Jewish and Muslim communities, have sought to tamp down both antisemitic and anti-Muslim sentiment in the wake of the Hamas attack and Israel's subsequent war against the militants in Gaza, which has killed over 41,000 people and displaced around 1.9 million in the embattled coastal territory.

The German chancellery in Berlin was adorned with a yellow ribbon commemorating the Israeli hostages taken by Hamas, around 100 of which remain in captivity, with many of them feared dead.

The names of the people killed and kidnapped in the attack on Israel were read out in front of the Brandenburg Gate starting at 5:29 a.m. local time in Germany, when Hamas' onslaught began a year ago.

German Chancellor Olaf Scholz said in a video message on Sunday that ""with its abhorrent attack on Israel, Hamas at the same time caused a catastrophe for the Palestinian people."" He stressed the need for a cease-fire in Gaza and international efforts to avoid an even wider Mideast conflagration.

""We will never accept antisemitism and blind hatred of Israel,"" he said. ""The full solidarity of our state goes to Jews here in Germany -- and the solidarity of all decent people in our country.""

An inter-religious service at a Berlin church, addressed by German President Frank-Walter Steinmeier, was planned for later Monday. Scholz was to attend a memorial event at a synagogue in Hamburg.

Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni, who has voiced strong support for Israel, commemorated the Oct. 7 anniversary by visiting the main synagogue in Rome and reaffirming Israel's right to defend itself.

She denounced the ""latent and rampant antisemitism"" she said has arisen since the Hamas attack, citing in particular pro-Palestinian protests in Italy this past weekend, some of which turned violent.

While asserting Israel's lights to live safely within its borders, Meloni insisted it respect international law and lamented the devastation unleashed by Israeli forces in Gaza. She said Palestinians in Gaza had been ""victims twice over: first of Hamas' cynicism, which uses them as human shields, and then of Israeli military operations.""

As the current president of the Group of Seven, Italy will continue to work for an immediate cease-fire, ""the release of Israeli hostages and the stabilization of the Israeli-Lebanese border through the full implementation of U.N. resolutions,"" she said.

French President Emmanuel Macron took to social media Monday to mark the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks. ""The pain remains, as vivid as it was a year ago. The pain of the Israeli people. Ours. The pain of wounded humanity,"" he said.

""We do not forget the victims, the hostages, or the families with broken hearts from absence or waiting. I send them our fraternal thoughts,"" Macron wrote on X.

French Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot attended a memorial service at the site of the Nova music festival, in Re'im, Israel, where hundreds were killed. Speaking to the families of victims, he expressed France's support in the face of ""the worst antisemitic massacre in our history since the Holocaust.""

""The joyful dawn of what should have been a day of celebration was suddenly torn apart by unspeakable horror,"" he said. ""France mourns alongside Israel for our 48 compatriot victims of barbarism.""

Barrot, who will meet with his counterpart Israel Katz later Monday, said Macron will receive in Paris some of the family members of hostages held by Hamas.

Commemorations were planned in France, Belgium, Spain, Austria and Hungary, while leading European politicians were also expected to take part in remembering those killed and kidnapped.

The European Parliament is holding a plenary session in Strasbourg, France, marking the anniversary, with the parliament's president, Roberta Metsola, to address lawmakers. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen is also expected to attend a ceremony at a synagogue in Brussels.

In Australia, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese attended a vigil in Melbourne, where he walked with members of the Jewish community and lawmakers from across party lines. Thousands attended the vigil.

Earlier in the morning, Albanese said the day carried ""terrible pain,"" and that his government ""unequivocally"" condemned Hamas' actions.

""Since the atrocities of October 7, Jewish Australians have felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day, and as a nation we say never again,"" he said. ""We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred.""

In Sydney, opposition leader Peter Dutton -- who has vehemently decried Australia's acceptance of Palestinian refugees -- arrived to cheers at a vigil also attended by thousands at which he reiterated his party's support for Israel.

Dutton's remarks to the crowd echoed those he made earlier Monday, in which he said the Oct. 7 attack ""awoke and exposed an antisemitic rot afflicting Western democracies.""

""Israel has every right to defend its territory and its people from existential threats,"" he said.

Hundreds of people gathered amid a heavy police presence Monday night at Sydney town hall for a vigil for Palestinian lives lost in the conflict. Thousands of pro-Palestinian protesters had rallied across Australia's cities on Sunday.

Middle East latest: Palestinian militants in Gaza fire 4 rockets into Israel as mourners mark Oct 7,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-7-october-2024-d3d272d83e70d420ba547dbd7e09ef52,2024-10-07T05:58:18Z,"Palestinian militants in Gaza fired four rockets into Israel on Monday as mourners marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, without disrupting a nearby ceremony.

Hamas also said it attacked Israeli forces in different parts of Gaza.

The Israeli military said three rockets were intercepted and a fourth fell in an open area. There were no reports of casualties or damage.

The military said it launched a wave of artillery and airstrikes overnight and into Monday to thwart what it said was an imminent attack. It said it targeted Hamas launch posts and underground militant infrastructure.

The fighting on the anniversary underscored the militants' resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive that has killed around 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials. It has also destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population.

Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's security fence and stormed into nearby army bases and farming communities in a surprise attack one year ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding around 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has also vowed to strike Iran in response to a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week.

Here is The Latest:

RE'IM, Israel -- Hundreds of families and friends of people killed at the Nova music festival gathered Monday at the site of the attack, where nearly 400 were gunned down during Hamas' Oct. 7 assault.

Families gathered around photos of their loved ones, which were arranged in a semicircle around what was the DJ stage. Many lit candles and added mementos or photos, crying and embracing. Overhead, army helicopters circled and constant booms echoed across the area, causing many to flinch.

""We can't understand how a year has passed,"" said Shimon Busika, whose son, Yarden, 25, was killed at the festival. ""It's the most natural place to be, to be here for this moment of silence,"" he said.

Busika said it took them a long time, piecing together testimony from other survivors, to understand what happened in Yarden's last moments. They now know he was killed around 9:20 near a yellow container at the festival where many others were killed, and they will hold a second minute of silence there at the moment he was killed.

The last sounds of the trance track that was playing at the Nova site on Oct. 7 one year ago stopped abruptly, as hundreds of family members and friends of the more than 300 victims stood in a moment of silence. One woman's piercing wail broke the silence as booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers (miles) away.

JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Twenty Indonesian nationals and a Lebanese evacuated from Lebanon arrived in Jakarta on a commercial flight early Monday and will likely be followed by 20 more in the afternoon, officials said.

President Joko Widodo has called to prioritize the evacuation of Indonesians in Lebanon as hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalate and fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East grow.

""I have directed the foreign affairs minister to take immediate action to ensure the safety and protection of our citizens and expedite their evacuation,"" Widodo said last week.

Indonesia's Embassy in Beirut had prepared evacuation procedures for citizens as part of its contingency planning since August. The Embassy evacuated 25 Indonesian citizens who returned safely to Indonesia last month, said Judha Nugraha, Director of Indonesian Citizen Protection at the Foreign Affairs Ministry.

There are 116 registered Indonesian citizens in Lebanon, most of them students, migrant workers and people married to Lebanese nationals. Many of them have chosen to remain there for various reasons, Nugraha said.

CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement Monday that the day carried ""terrible pain"" and his government ""unequivocally"" condemned Hamas' attack on Israel a year ago.

Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns on Oct. 7 a year ago, killing dozens and abducting others in an unprecedented surprise attack.

Albanese said that since the attack, Jewish Australians have ""felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day -- and as a nation we say never again.""

""We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred. There is no place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith,"" Albanese said.

He added that ""every innocent life matters"" and the number of civilians killed in the conflict was ""a devastating tragedy.""

""Today we reflect on the truth of our shared humanity, of the hope that peace is possible, and the belief that it belongs to all people,"" Albanese said.

BEIRUT -- A new round of airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs late Sunday as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon. Palestinian officials said a strike on a mosque in Gaza killed at least 19 people.

Rocket sirens and blasts were heard in Haifa in northern Israel late Sunday, and Hezbollah claimed the attack. Israel's military said at least five projectiles were identified coming from Lebanon and ""fallen projectiles"" were found in the area. The military showed what appeared to be rubble along a street. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating a teen with shrapnel injuries to the head and a man who fell from a window due to a blast.

A year after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Israel has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has traded fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel also has vowed to strike Iran after a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week."
Takeaways from AP's report on the Gaza war's destruction,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-anniversary-destruction-takeaways-a1ae8d316633fd7d1f3fe24cc527a2ee,2024-10-07T05:06:25Z,"Israel's yearlong offensive against Hamas, launched in response to the militant group's Oct. 7 attack into Israel, has killed tens of thousands of Palestinians and caused staggering destruction across the Gaza Strip that could take decades to rebuild.

Hundreds of thousands of people are crammed into squalid tent camps with no homes to return to, even if there is a cease-fire. The mountains of rubble alone, laced with human remains, unexploded ordnance and other hazardous materials, could take years to remove.

Israel blames the destruction on Hamas. Its Oct. 7 attack on Israel -- in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage -- ignited the war. Hamas embedded much of its military infrastructure, including hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, in densely populated areas where some of the heaviest battles were fought.

The fighting left roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza destroyed or severely damaged, according to a U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage.

Here's a look at the main takeaways from an AP interactive report looking at the scope of the devastation.

Israel's offensive has killed over 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza and wounded more than 96,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. It does not say how many were fighters, but says women and children make up more than half of those killed.

It also says the toll may be higher as thousands of bodies remain buried under rubble or in areas that are inaccessible to medical teams.

Israel says it has killed over 17,000 militants, but has not provided evidence. Over 720 Israeli soldiers have been killed since Oct. 7, including in the attack itself, the war in Gaza and the conflict with Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group.

The U.N. estimates that around 90% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million people have been displaced, often multiple times. Israeli evacuation orders now cover around 90% of the territory.

Schools have been turned into shelters, and hundreds of thousands have crammed into sprawling tent camps along the coast.

The Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council, says it has struggled to bring in basic supplies because of Israeli restrictions, the ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order in Gaza.

It estimates that some 900.000 people are in need of tents and bedding.

The war has gutted Gaza's infrastructure, which was already in bad shape after a 16-year blockade imposed by Israel and Egypt when Hamas seized power in 2007.

The U.N. says the war has damaged or destroyed over 92% of Gaza's main roads and more than 84% of its health facilities.

It estimates nearly 70% of Gaza's water and sanitation plants have been destroyed or damaged. That includes all five of the territory's wastewater treatment facilities, plus desalination plants, sewage pumping stations, wells and reservoirs.

The breakdown of water infrastructure has flooded the streets with sewage in many areas, contributing to the spread of disease among a population weakened by widespread hunger.

Where houses, shops and office buildings once stood, there are now giant drifts of rubble laced with human remains, hazardous substances and unexploded munitions.

The U.N. estimates the war has left some 40 million tons of debris and rubble in Gaza, enough to fill New York's Central Park to a depth of eight meters (about 25 feet). It could take up to 15 years and nearly $650 million to clear it all away, it said.

The World Bank estimated $18.5 billion in damage in Gaza from just the first three months of the war, before several major Israeli operations. That figure is nearly equivalent to the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022.

Wealthy Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they are only willing to contribute to Gaza's reconstruction as part of a postwar settlement that creates a path to a Palestinian state.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled that out, saying he won't allow Hamas or even the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza. He has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control and delegate civilian affairs to local Palestinians. But none are known to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened to kill anyone who aids the occupation.

Israel allowed construction materials in before the war, but the system was subject to heavy restrictions and delays.

The Shelter Cluster estimates that it would take 40 years to rebuild all of Gaza's destroyed homes under that system."

Mideast violence is spiraling a year since the Gaza war began,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-hezbollah-lebanon-anniversary-73916b17394f093f01ca5554cf26b528,2024-10-07T05:00:00Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- A year after Hamas' fateful attack on southern Israel, the Middle East is embroiled in a war that shows no signs of ending and seems to be getting worse.

Israel's retaliatory offensive was initially centered on the Gaza Strip. But the focus has shifted in recent weeks to Lebanon, where airstrikes have given way to a fast-expanding ground incursion against Hezbollah militants who have fired rockets into Israel since the Gaza war began.

Next in Israel's crosshairs is archenemy Iran, which supports Hamas, Hezbollah and other anti-Israel militants in the region. After withstanding a massive barrage of missiles from Iran last week, Israel has promised to respond. The escalating conflict risks drawing deeper involvement by the U.S., as well as Iran-backed militants in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

When Hamas launched its attack on Oct. 7, 2023, it called on the Arab world to join it in a concerted campaign against Israel. While the fighting has indeed spread, Hamas and its allies have paid a heavy price.

The group's army has been decimated, its Gaza stronghold has been reduced to a cauldron of death, destruction and misery and the top leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah have been killed in audacious attacks.

Although Israel appears to be gaining the edge militarily, the war has been problematic for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, too.

Dozens of Israeli hostages are languishing in Hamas captivity, and a year after Netanyahu pledged to crush the group in ""total victory,"" remnants of the militant group are still battling in pockets of Gaza. The offensive in Lebanon, initially described as ""limited,"" grows by the day. A full-on collision with Iran is a possibility.

At home, Netanyahu faces mass protests over his inability to bring home the hostages, and to many, he will be remembered as the man who led Israel into its darkest moment. Relations with the U.S. and other allies are strained. The economy is deteriorating.

Here are five takeaways from a yearlong war that has upended longstanding assumptions and turned conventional wisdom on its head.

A long list of previously unthinkable events have occurred in mind-boggling fashion.

The Oct. 7 attack was the bloodiest in Israel's history. Young partygoers were gunned down. Cowering families were killed in their homes. In all, about 1,200 people died and 250 were taken hostage. Some Israelis were raped or sexually assaulted.

The ensuing war in Gaza has been the longest, deadliest and most destructive in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Gaza health authorities say nearly 42,000 people have been killed -- roughly 2% of the territory's entire population. Although they do not give a breakdown between civilians and combatants, more than half of the dead have been women and children. Numerous top Hamas officials have been killed.

The damage and displacement in Gaza have reached unseen levels. Hospitals, schools and mosques - once thought to be insulated from violence - have repeatedly been targeted by Israel or caught in the crossfire. Scores of journalists and health workers have been killed, many of them while working in the line of duty.

Months of simmering tensions along Israel's northern border recently boiled over into war.

A growing list of Hezbollah officials - including the group's longtime leader -- have been killed by Israel. Hundreds of Hezbollah members were killed or maimed in explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies. Israel's ground offensive is its first in Lebanon since a monthlong war in 2006.

Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis and over 1 million Lebanese. Israel promises to keep pounding Hezbollah until its residents can return to homes near the Lebanese border; Hezbollah says it will keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza.

When the war erupted, the days appeared to be numbered for both Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.

Netanyahu's public standing plummeted as he faced calls to step aside. Sinwar fled into Gaza's labyrinth of tunnels as Israel declared him a ""dead man walking.""

Yet both men -- facing war crimes charges in international courts -- remain firmly in charge, and neither appears to be in a rush for a cease-fire.

The end of the war could mean the end of Netanyahu's government, which is dominated by hard-line partners opposed to a cease-fire. That would mean early elections, potentially pushing him into the opposition while he stands trial on corruption charges. Also looming is the prospect of an unflattering official inquiry into his government's failures before and during the Oct. 7 attack.

Fearing that, his coalition has hung together even through mass protests and repeated disagreements with top security officials pushing for a deal to bring home the hostages. After a brief period of post-Oct. 7 national unity, Israel has returned to its divided self -- torn between Netanyahu's religious, conservative, nationalist right-wing base and his more secular, middle-class opposition.

Sinwar, believed to be hiding in Gaza's tunnels, continues to drive a hard bargain in hopes of declaring some sort of victory. His demands for a full Israeli withdrawal, a lasting cease-fire and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for scores of hostages have been rejected by Israel -- even as much of the international community has embraced them.

With cease-fire efforts deadlocked and Netanyahu's far-right coalition firmly intact, the war could go on for some time. An estimated 1.9 million Palestinians remain displaced in Gaza while an estimated 68 hostages remain captive in Gaza, in addition to the bodies of 33 others held by Hamas.

Early in the war, Netanyahu promised to destroy Hamas' military and governing abilities.

Those goals have been achieved in many ways. Israel says it has dismantled Hamas' military structure, and its rocket barrages have been diminished to a trickle. With Israeli troops stationed indefinitely in Gaza, it is difficult to see how the group could return to governing the territory or pose a serious threat.

But in other ways, total victory is impossible. Despite Israel's overwhelming force, Hamas units have repeatedly regrouped to stage guerrilla-style ambushes from areas where Israel has withdrawn.

Across the Middle East, bitter enemies are witnessing the limits of force and deterrence.

Israel's deepening invasion of Lebanon and repeated strikes on Hezbollah have failed to halt the rockets and missiles. Missile and drone attacks by Iran and its allies have only deepened Israel's resolve. Israel is vowing to strike Iran hard after its latest missile barrage, raising the likelihood of a broader, regionwide war.

Without diplomatic solutions, the fighting is likely to persist.

Israel is still deeply traumatized as people try to come to terms with the worst day in its history.

The Oct. 7 killings and kidnappings had an outsized impact on a tiny country founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Israelis' sense of security was shattered, and their faith in the military was tested like never before.

Photos of Israeli hostages are everywhere, and mass demonstrations are held each week calling on the government to reach a deal to bring them home. The prospect of ongoing war looms over families and workplaces as reserve soldiers brace for repeated tours of duty.

The trauma is far more acute in Gaza - where an estimated 90% of the population remains displaced, many of them living in squalid tent camps.

The scenes have drawn comparisons to what the Palestinian call the Nakba, or catastrophe - the mass displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948. The Palestinians now find themselves looking at a tragedy of even greater scale.

It remains unclear when displaced Palestinians in Gaza will be able to return home and whether there will be anything to return to. The territory has suffered immense destruction and is littered with unexploded bombs. Children are missing a second consecutive school year, virtually every family has lost a relative in the fighting and basic needs like food and health care are lacking.

After a hellish year, the Palestinians of Gaza have no clear path forward, and it could take generations to recover.

The international community's response to this bloodiest of wars has been tepid and ineffective.

Repeated cease-fire calls have been ignored, and a U.S.-led plan to reinstate the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza has been rejected by Israel. It remains unclear who will run the territory in the future or who will pay for a cleanup and reconstruction effort that could take decades.

One thing that seems clear is that old formulas will no longer work. The international community's preferred peace formula - the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel - seems hopelessly unrealistic.

Israel's hard-line government opposes Palestinian statehood, says its troops will remain in Gaza for years to come and has further cemented its undeclared annexation of the West Bank. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority has been pushed to the brink of irrelevance.

For decades, the United States has acted as the key mediator and power broker in the region - calling for a two-state solution but showing little political will to promote that vision. Instead, it has often turned to conflict management, preventing any side from doing anything too extreme to destabilize the region.

This approach went up in smoke on Oct. 7. Since then, the U.S. has responded with a muddled message of criticizing Israel's wartime tactics as too harsh while arming the Israeli military and protecting Israel against diplomatic criticism. The result: The Biden administration has managed to antagonize both Israel and the Arab world while cease-fire efforts repeatedly sputter.

This approach has also alienated the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, complicating Kamala Harris' presidential aspirations. The warring sides appear to have given up on the Biden administration and are waiting for the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election before deciding their next moves.

Whoever wins the race will almost certainly have to find a new formula and recalibrate decades of American policy if they want to end the war."
"A year after the Hamas attack shattered this Israeli community, going home still feels impossible",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-kibbutz-attack-anniversary-344b289751d8ee80d4909f15864f508c,2024-10-07T04:49:28Z,"KFAR AZA, Israel (AP) -- On a sun-dappled day in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, Liora Eilon stood at the spot where her son was killed. She stooped to pick a figurine from the pile of belongings scattered around an abandoned home nearby.

""Every time we come here, Tal leaves us a little message,"" the 71-year-old said, turning over the plastic soldier in her hands.

It has been a year since Hamas militants stormed into this community within sight of the border fence surrounding Gaza. Eilon's 46-year-old son, Tal, who was the Kfar Aza civilian defense commander, was killed in the early moments of the attack, as he ran to the kibbutz armory to grab a weapon.

Now living in a university dormitory in Israel's north, Liora Eilon wonders if she'll ever return home to this place, seared into Israeli history for that day of mass death, when the militants killed some 1,200 people in southern communities and took about 250 others hostage. The attack sparked an ongoing Israeli campaign in Gaza that has killed more than 41,600 Palestinians and laid waste to much of the territory.

""How can I trust the government who abandoned me here, who betrayed me, promised me that my family was safe here?"" she said. ""The government wants us to go back to Kfar Aza, but I need more to feel safe.""

Only about 50 of Kfar Aza's 1,000 residents have returned. They live among the skeletons of houses burned by explosives, riddled with bullet holes or reduced to rubble by tank shells during the battle that raged for days.

The others are scattered in dorms and hotels further north. The Associated Press spoke to a dozen residents who shared feelings of extreme vulnerability to future attack and deep misgivings about Israel's military and government, and the Palestinians on the other side of the fence.

Some wondered whether such a scarred place could ever be lived in at all.

""Are we going to live inside a memorial? Are we going to see a plaque every few meters, he was killed here and he was killed here?"" asked Zohar Shpack, 58, who has returned and serves in the civilian defense squad. ""I don't know yet.""

The seasons have spun by since Oct. 7. Relatively untended, Kfar Aza's orchards have borne new fruit. With few to harvest, soldiers guarding the community have their pick from loads of fresh avocadoes.

The land still holds traces of the day. On trees hung with fresh pomegranates, some of last year's fruit remains, charred and black like used grenades. Gardener Rafael Friedman says he still finds teeth and bones in the soil when he rakes back the overgrowth -- likely remnants of Hamas militants killed in the fighting.

Kfar Aza has always been a close-knit place. It takes just 15 minutes to walk from one end to the other, past neighborhoods, orchards and a soccer pitch. Many residents grew up here and raised families alongside each other.

Now photos of slain young people, couples killed together and hostages are posted everywhere. During the day, former residents like Eilon guide tours, hold memorials and see familiar faces. When night falls, most disappear to hotel rooms to the north.

Every Friday, survivors gather on Shachar Schnorman's porch for dinner, filling the kibbutz with the rare sound of laughter.

""It's the only place where people can talk about the seventh and all the people at the table understand exactly what they are talking about,"" Schnorman said.

""We do whatever we can to try to build community, to try to show ... that people can live here,"" he said.

The government says it will rebuild. Meanwhile, it's constructing pre-fabricated houses for residents in another kibbutz, Ruhama, about 15 kilometers (10 miles) away. After two years there, they say authorities want them to return to Kfar Aza.

About two-thirds of the community plan to move into the temporary housing. On a recent tour, some enthusiastically examined the box-like structures. It's a chance, they said, to live together and rebuild on the southern land they're accustomed to.

But some weren't convinced Kfar Aza will be rebuilt and not sure they'd ever feel safe returning.

They want to know why it took so many hours before soldiers arrived at the kibbutz. The military has launched an investigation into what happened, but has not yet released its results. An investigation into the military's failures at neighboring Kibbutz Be'eri found a ""lack of command and control, a lack of coordination and a lack of order"" among the units that fought there.

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government has brushed off calls for accountability, saying it will investigate at war's end.

Simona Steinbrecher feels too frozen in time to make a decision now about whether to return. Her daughter, Doron, a veterinary nurse who spent her girlhood in Kfar Aza, was dragged by militants into Gaza on Oct. 7. She is among 66 Israelis still held captive. Hamas is believed to hold the bodies of 35 others.

The 65-year-old Steinbrecher last saw her daughter in a Hamas propaganda video. Doron's skin was pale, her voice weak.

""Without Doron, it's still the seventh of October,"" her mother said. ""And we won't go home until she's home.""

Hostage families and many residents of southern communities are boycotting the government's ceremony commemorating Oct. 7. To them, as long as it fails to bring hostages home and refuses to investigate and take responsibility for its mistakes, it has blood on its hands. Instead, residents of Kfar Aza will hold a small tribute and lower the kibbutz flag to half-mast.

Residents said they have nothing but admiration for the troops who fought that day. But they are furious at the military higher-ups, blaming them for a command structure that collapsed when the kibbutz needed it most.

When she recounts the day, Eilon is gripped with fury and astonishment -- over 35 hours of horror her family endured and the military's response.

When the sirens began blaring that Saturday morning, Eilon thought it would take the army minutes to arrive, she told the AP as she toured the bullet-riddled remnants of her home.

It took hours.

Her family scrambled into their safe room. A son and daughter muscled the door shut against gunmen trying to get inside. Granddaughters, Gali and Mika, hid under the bed. Eilon got a message saying Tal had gone out to fight.

The five huddled in the saferoom, hearing the attackers' shouts and gunfire, not knowing whether Tal was dead or alive. Israeli troops finally gained control of their house, and Eilon said she saw how scared and confused the young soldiers looked.

Gali shared with them desperate texts from her friends across the kibbutz trying to escape the rampage.

""She became a 15-year-old commander of an IDF elite unit,"" said Eilon, using the acronym for the Israeli military.

Still, the troops didn't evacuate the family. It was only on Sunday afternoon, as militants were hiding out in the house again, that soldiers hustled them out.

As she ran into her backyard, Eilon saw a tank swivel its cannon at her house. It fired, collapsing her home on the militants inside.

Soon after being rescued, Eilon learned Tal was dead.

""I'd known it all along,"" she said. ""But some part of me was hoping that he was injured, that he was unconscious in some hospital.""

As the battle still raged, some residents were evacuated early and sped away in army jeeps. Hanan Dann, a young father, recounted passing a cluster of soldiers at a gas station just outside the kibbutz, who looked like they were waiting for orders.

""I wanted to say, there's fighting inside still, there're people dying,"" he said. ""They could have saved them.""

Soldiers and militants fought in Kfar Aza for days. By the end, militants had killed 64 civilians and 22 soldiers and dragged 19 hostages into Gaza.

Nearby, in the recesses of the Negev desert, stands a decrepit water tower. It's a remnant of Be'erot Yitzhak, a kibbutz abandoned after a deadly 1948 Egyptian attack during the war that led to Israel's creation.

""Will that be what Kfar Aza looks like 10 years from now?"" asked Dann. ""Just a stop on the highway I can point out to my kids?""

Even those who want to reinhabit it know Kfar Aza will never be the same.

Shpack, the civilian guard member, said he understands why no one would bring a child here now, pointing to the border fence. Every few minutes, an Israeli warplane drops a bomb on Gaza, puncturing the kibbutz's silence with a loud boom.

""And even once the bombs end, how can you raise him here?"" Shpack asked. ""How do you explain what happened here?""

Marcus Scharfstein, 29, who lives in the kibbutz, said he won't feel completely safe until Israel reestablishes Jewish settlements in Gaza. Israel unilaterally withdrew its soldiers and some 8,000 Jewish settlers from Gaza in 2005.

""If I will know that in Gaza right now, there are 10, 20 villages of Jewish people,"" he said, ""I will feel in control again,"" adding he did not feel that way before the Oct. 7 attack.

But others say as long as there is no peace agreement with Palestinians, they will again be on the front lines of another Oct. 7. Some of Gaza's Palestinians once lived in these same arid reaches of what is now southern Israel. Almost no trace is left of their villages after Israeli troops drove them out during the 1948 war.

""We've tried war enough times and it never led to anything good,"" Eilon said. She wants a new government that will talk to the Palestinians to find ""some arrangement for us to live together on the same land.""

""I'm dreaming for the day with an open fence from here to the sea, with two people living together."""
Gaza is in ruins after Israel's yearlong offensive. Rebuilding may take decades,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-anniversary-palestinians-gaza-destruction-6b41ad9f64887228e90793705dd379a7,2024-10-07T04:49:05Z,"There are hills of rubble where apartment blocks stood, and pools of sewage-tainted water spreading disease. City streets have been churned into dirt canyons and, in many places, the air is filled with the stench of unrecovered corpses.

Israel's yearlong offensive against Hamas, one of the deadliest and most destructive in recent history, has killed more than 41,000 people, a little over half of them women and children, according to local health officials. With no end in sight to the war and no plan for the day after, it is impossible to say when - or even if - anything will be rebuilt.

Even after the fighting stops, hundreds of thousands of people could be stuck living in squalid tent camps for years. Experts say reconstruction could take decades.

""This war is destruction and misery. It would make the stones cry out,"" said Shifaa Hejjo, a 60-year-old housewife living in a tent pitched on land where her home once stood. ""Whoever sees Gaza ... It will make them cry.""

Israel blames the destruction on Hamas. Its Oct. 7 attack on Israel -- in which some 1,200 people were killed and around 250 taken hostage -- ignited the war. Israel says Hamas embedded much of its military infrastructure, including hundreds of kilometers (miles) of tunnels, in densely populated areas where some of the heaviest battles were fought.

The fighting left roughly a quarter of all structures in Gaza destroyed or severely damaged, according to a U.N. assessment in September based on satellite footage. It said around 66% of structures, including more than 227,000 housing units, had sustained at least some damage.

If there's a cease-fire, around half of all families ""have nowhere to go back to,"" said Alison Ely, a Gaza-based coordinator with the Shelter Cluster, an international coalition of aid providers led by the Norwegian Refugee Council.

Almost as many buildings have been destroyed or damaged in Gaza as in all of Ukraine after its first two years of war with Russia, according to Corey Scher and Jamon Van Den Hoek, U.S.-based researchers who use satellite radar to document the wars' devastation.

To put that into perspective: Gaza is less than half the size of Ukraine's capital, Kyiv.

The amount of destruction in central and southern Gaza alone, Scher said, is roughly equivalent to what was lost in the front-line town of Bakhmut, the scene of one of the deadliest battles in the Ukraine war and where Russian forces destroyed nearly every building in their path to force Ukrainian troops to withdraw. The destruction in northern Gaza is even worse, he said.

Gaza's water and sanitation system has collapsed. More than 80% of its health facilities -- and even more of its roads -- are damaged or destroyed.

""I can't think of any parallel, in terms of the severity of damage, for an enclave or a country or a people,"" Scher said.

At the end of January, the World Bank estimated $18.5 billion of damage -- nearly the combined economic output of the West Bank and Gaza in 2022. That was before some intensely destructive Israeli ground operations, including in the southern border city of Rafah.

When Israeli ground forces pushed into the southern city of Khan Younis in January, Shifaa Hejjo and her family fled their four-story home with only the clothes they were wearing.

They spent months in various tent camps before she decided to return - and the sight brought her to tears.

Her entire neighborhood had been destroyed, her former home and the roads leading to it lost in a sea of rubble.

""I didn't recognize it,"" she said. ""I couldn't tell where people's homes were.""

Around 90% of Gaza's 2.3 million people have been displaced by the war, often multiple times, according to U.N. estimates. Hundreds of thousands have crowded into sprawling tent camps near the coast with no electricity, running water or toilets. Hunger is widespread.

Hejjo lived in a tent in the courtyard of a hospital. Before that, she was in Muwasi, the main tent camp in southern Gaza.

""It smelled bad,"" she said. ""There were diseases spreading.""

She said her husband, who was suffering from liver disease, was broken-hearted when he heard their home had been destroyed and he died shortly thereafter.

She was among the first to return after Israeli forces withdrew in April. Her neighbors stayed away, fearful they would find bodies or unexploded bombs.

But for her it was still home.

""It is better to live in my home, where I lived for 37 years, even though it is destroyed,"" she said.

Hejjo and her children dug through the rubble with shovels and their bare hands, going brick by brick and saving whatever could be reused. Torn clothes were used to feed cooking fires.

Rats had crept in, and swarms of mosquitoes hovered over the ruins. There was broken glass everywhere. They set up a tent fortified by corrugated metal sheeting and some bricks salvaged from her destroyed home. A light drizzle wet their clothes as they slept.

U.N. agencies say unemployment has soared to around 80% -- up from nearly 50% before the war -- and that almost the entire population is living in poverty. Even those with means would find it nearly impossible to import construction materials because of Israeli restrictions, ongoing fighting and the breakdown of law and order.

The first obstacle to any significant rebuilding is the rubble - mountains of it.

Where houses, shops and office buildings once stood, there are now giant drifts of rubble laced with human remains, hazardous substances and unexploded munitions.

The U.N. estimates the war has left some 40 million tons of debris and rubble in Gaza, enough to fill New York's Central Park to a depth of eight meters (about 25 feet). It could take up to 15 years and nearly $650 million to clear it all away, it said.

There's also the question of where to dispose of it: The U.N. estimates about five square kilometers (about two square miles) of land would be needed, which will be hard to come by in the small and densely populated territory.

It isn't just homes that were destroyed, but also critical infrastructure.

The U.N. estimates nearly 70% of Gaza's water and sanitation plants have been destroyed or damaged. That includes all five of the territory's wastewater treatment facilities, plus desalination plants, sewage pumping stations, wells and reservoirs.

The employees who once managed municipal water and waste systems have been displaced, and some killed. And fuel shortages have made it difficult to keep operating facilities that are still intact.

The international charity Oxfam said it applied in December for a permit to bring in desalination units, and pipes to repair water infrastructure. It took three months for Israel to approve the shipment, but it still has not entered Gaza, Oxfam said.

The destruction of sewage networks has left streets flooded with putrid water, hastening the spread of disease.

There has been no central power in Gaza since the opening days of the war, when its sole power plant was forced to shut down for lack of fuel, and more than half of the territory's electrical grid has been destroyed, according to the World Bank.

Wealthy Arab countries like Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates have said they are only willing to contribute to Gaza's reconstruction as part of a postwar settlement that creates a path to a Palestinian state.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ruled that out, saying he won't allow Hamas or even the Western-backed Palestinian Authority to govern Gaza. He has said Israel will maintain open-ended security control and delegate civilian affairs to local Palestinians. But none are known to have volunteered, and Hamas has threatened to kill anyone who aids the occupation.

Rebuilding Gaza would also require the import of massive amounts of construction supplies and heavy equipment, which Israel is unlikely to allow as long as there's a potential for Hamas to rebuild its militant infrastructure. In any case, Gaza has only a small number of crossings with limited capacity.

The Israeli military body that coordinates civilian affairs in Gaza says it does not restrict the entry of civilian supplies and allows so-called dual-use items that could also be used for military purposes. Israel allowed some construction materials in before the war under what was known as the Gaza Reconstruction Mechanism, but it was subject to heavy restrictions and delays.

The Shelter Cluster estimates that it would take 40 years to rebuild all of Gaza's destroyed homes under that setup.

For now, aid providers are struggling just to bring in enough basic tents because of the limited number of trucks going into Gaza and the challenges of delivering aid. Efforts to bring in more robust temporary housing are still in the early stages, and no one has even tried to bring in construction materials, according to Ely.

In September, the Shelter Cluster estimated 900,000 people were still in need of tents, bedding and other items to prepare for the region's typically cold and rainy winters."
"Israelis, scarred and battling on multiple fronts, mark a year since Hamas' Oct. 7 attack",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-one-year-anniversary-cf123f95609051e8e8eaf6aebe661b6a,2024-10-07T04:07:59Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Israelis were holding vigils and somber ceremonies on Monday to mark a year since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack, the deadliest in the country's history, which sparked the war in Gaza and scarred Israelis indelibly.

The surprise cross-border attack, which caught Israel unprepared on a major Jewish holiday, shattered Israelis' sense of security and shook their faith in their leaders and their military.

Its aftershocks still ripple one year later. The war in Gaza rages on, Israel is fighting a new war against Hezbollah, which began attacking Israel on Oct. 8, and an escalating conflict with Iran -- which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah -- threatens to drag the region into a far more dangerous conflagration.

In Gaza, which is still buckling under the weight of the ongoing war, no formal commemorative event is planned. The massive destruction and displacement are a constant reminder of the retaliatory Israeli assault on the territory, which has no end in sight.

Israelis were expected to flock to ceremonies, cemeteries and memorial sites around the country, remembering the hundreds of victims, the dozens of hostages still in captivity and the soldiers wounded or killed trying to save them.

At 6:30 a.m. -- the exact hour Hamas launched its attack -- the families of those killed at the Nova music festival were gathering at the site where almost 400 revelers were gunned down and from where many others were taken hostage.

At that same time, the families of hostages still held in Gaza -- about 100, a third of whom are said to be dead -- were gathering outside Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's Jerusalem residence to stand during a two-minute siren, replicating a custom from the the most solemn dates on the Israeli calendar, Holocaust Remembrance and Memorial Day.

An official state ceremony focusing on acts of bravery and hope is set to be aired on Monday evening. The ceremony was prerecorded without an audience -- apparently to avoid potential disruptions -- in the southern city of Ofakim, where over two dozen Israelis were killed.

But anger at the government's failure to prevent the attack and enduring frustration that it has not returned the remaining hostages prompted the families of those killed and taken captive to hold a separate event in Tel Aviv.

That event had been set to draw tens of thousands of people but was scaled back drastically over prohibitions on large gatherings due to the threat of missile attacks from Iran and Hezbollah.

Hamas' attack, which killed 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and dragged some 250 into Gaza as hostages, continues to cast a shadow over daily life in Israel. Dozens of hostages remain in captivity, with no end in sight to their struggle. Border communities have been upended and tens of thousands were displaced. Soldiers are being killed in Gaza and Lebanon. Israel faces ongoing international criticism over its wartime conduct, with two world courts examining its actions.

The war in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, displaced most of the territory's 2.3 million population and sparked a humanitarian crisis that has led to widespread hunger. It has also left the tiny coastal enclave ravaged beyond recognition as U.S.-led cease-fire efforts have repeatedly sputtered."

Pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli crowds rally across the world on the eve of Oct. 7 anniversary,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-gaza-war-protests-memorial-hostages-d1e8c03e14c28c64afa3fffe086c3e8f,2024-10-06T14:09:42Z,"PARIS (AP) -- Crowds were participating in pro-Palestinian and pro-Israeli protests and memorial events across the world on Sunday on the eve of the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel.

Sunday's events follow massive rallies that took place Saturday in several European cities, including London, Berlin, Paris and Rome. Other events are scheduled through the week, with an expected peak on Monday, the date of the anniversary.

In Australia, thousands of people on Sunday protested in support of Palestinians and Lebanon in various cities, while a pro-Israeli rally also took place in Melbourne.

Samantha Gazal, who came to the rally in Sydnay, said she was there ""because I can't believe our government is giving impunity to a violent extremist nation and has done nothing. ... We're watching the violence play out on livestream, and they're doing nothing.""

In Melbourne, supporters of Israel held up posters showing Israeli hostages who are still missing.

""We feel like we didn't do anything to deserve this,"" said Jeremy Wenstein, one of the participants. ""We're just supporting our brothers and sisters who are fighting a war that they didn't invite.""

At a rally in Berlin, near the Brandenburg Gate, hundreds of pro-Israeli demonstrators set off up the famed Unter den Linden behind a banner that read ""Against all antisemitism,"" accompanied by a police escort.

With many Israel flags waving over head, some Jewish leaders led a song about ""shalom"" -- peace -- while marchers chanted ""Free Gaza from Hamas!"" and ""Bring them home,"" referring to hostages still held in the Gaza strip.

Some in the crowd held up photos of hostages still held by Hamas. Photos of several women featured the word ""Kidnapped"" in German.

Memorial events organized by the Jewish community for those killed in the Oct. 7 attack and prayers for those still in captivity were also to be held in Paris and London on Sunday afternoon.

Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that some of the protests could turn violent.

On Sunday, Italy's Premier Giorgia Meloni expressed her ""full solidarity"" with police, the day after after security forces used tear gas and water cannons to disperse violent demonstrators in Rome.

Meloni firmly condemned clashes between a few pro-Palestinian demonstrators and law enforcement officers, saying it was ""intolerable that dozens of officers are injured during a demonstration.""

Thirty police officers and four protesters were hurt in clashes at the pro-Palestinian march in Rome Saturday, local media said. In Rome's central Piazzale Ostiense, hooded protesters threw stones, bottles and even a street sign at the police, who responded using water cannons and tear gas.

Pope Francis, celebrating his Sunday Angelus prayer from the Vatican, issued a new appeal for peace ""on every front."" Francis also urged his audience not to forget the many hostages still held in Gaza, asking for ""their immediate liberation.""

The pope called for a day of prayer and fasting on Monday, the first anniversary of the attack.

On Oct. 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.

More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. It says more than half were women and children.

Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks -- missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings -- as the region braces for further escalation.

In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which holds much of the power in parts of southern Lebanon and some other areas of the country, attacking the militants with exploding pagers, airstrikes and, eventually, incursions into Lebanon."
Middle East latest: Israel strikes Gaza and southern Beirut as attacks intensify,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-6-october-2024-19e665a4546e92d006d63a3073219513,2024-10-06T09:51:06Z,"An Israeli airstrike hit a mosque in central Gaza and Palestinian officials said at least 19 people were killed early Sunday. Israeli planes also lit up the skyline across the southern suburbs of Beirut, striking what the military said were Hezbollah targets.

The strike in Gaza hit a mosque where displaced people were sheltering near the main hospital in the central town of Deir al-Balah. Another four people were killed in a strike on a school sheltering displaced people near the town.

The Israeli military said both strikes targeted militants, without providing evidence.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the Al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead from the strike on the mosque were all men, while another man was wounded.

In Beirut, the strikes reportedly targeted a building near a road leading to Lebanon's only international airport and another formerly used by the Hezbollah-run broadcaster Al-Manar.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. As the Israel-Hamas war reaches the one-year mark, nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials.

Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in the latest conflict, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

Here is the latest:

BEIRUT -- The southern suburbs of Beirut were hit by more than 30 strikes overnight, the heaviest bombardment since Sept. 23, when Israel began a significant escalation in its air campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported Sunday.

The targets included a gas station on the main highway leading to the Beirut airport and a warehouse for medical supplies, the agency said.

Some of the overnight strikes set off a long series of explosions, suggesting that ammunition stores may have been hit.

PARIS -- French President Emmanuel Macron called for ""a halt to arms exports for use in Gaza,"" saying it's urgent to avoid escalating tensions in the region, his office said.

Macron drew strong criticism from Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu by saying ""the priority is ... that we stop delivering weapons to fight in Gaza."" He made the comments in an interview with France Inter radio, which was recorded on Tuesday and aired Saturday.

France doesn't deliver any weapons to Israel, Macron said.

Netanyahu released a video statement in which he called out the French president by name and referred to such calls as a ""disgrace.""

In a statement, Macron's office said ""France is Israel's unfailing friend. Mr. Netanyahu's words are excessive and irrelevant to the friendship between France and Israel.""

""We must return to diplomatic solutions,"" it added.

The statement also said that Macron had demonstrated his commitment to Israel's security when France mobilized its military resources in response to the Iranian attack. French authorities did not provided details about France's role.

Macron has called for an immediate cease-fire in both Gaza and Lebanon.

DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip -- An apparent Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed at least 18 people in central Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said.

The strike hit a mosque sheltering displaced people near the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah, the hospital said in a statement.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead were all men. Another two men were critically wounded, the hospital said.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment about the strike on the mosque.

The latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is now nearing 42,000 according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but many of the dead were women and children.

BEIRUT -- Powerful new explosions rocked Beirut's southern suburbs late Saturday as Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon, also striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in the north for the first time as it targeted both Hezbollah and Hamas fighters.

Thousands of people in Lebanon, including Palestinian refugees, continued to flee the widening conflict in the region, while rallies were held around the world marking the approaching anniversary of the start of the war in Gaza.

The strong explosions began near midnight after Israel's military urged residents to evacuate areas in Beirut's Haret Hreik and Choueifat neighborhoods. AP video showed the blasts illuminating the densely populated southern suburbs, where Hezbollah has a strong presence. They followed a day of sporadic strikes and the nearly continuous buzz of reconnaissance drones.

Israel's military confirmed it was striking targets near Beirut and said about 30 projectiles had crossed from Lebanon into Israeli territory."
A year of fleeing across Gaza,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/a-year-of-fleeing-across-gaza-000001925701d383a5925f8f807f0000,2024-10-06T08:00:35Z,"Ne'man Abu Jarad sat on a tarp on the ground. Around him, canvas sheets hung from cords, forming the walls of his tent. For the past year, Ne'man; his wife, Majida; and their six daughters have trekked the length of the Gaza Strip, trying to survive as Israeli forces wreaked destruction around them.

It's a far cry from their house in northern Gaza -- a place of comforting routine, of love, affection and safety. A place where loved ones gathered around the kitchen table or on the roof on summer evenings amid the scent of roses and jasmine flowers.

""Your house is your homeland. Everything good in our life was the home,"" Ne'man said. ""Everything in it, whether physical or intangible -- family, neighbors, my siblings who were all around me.

They did exactly as the Israelis ordered in the devastating weeks and months of war that followed. They obeyed evacuation calls. They moved where the military told them to move. Seven times they fled, and each time, their lives became more unrecognizable to them, crowding with strangers in a school classroom, searching for water in a vast tent camp or sleeping on the street.

The Associated Press traced the family's journey as they were driven from their home. Israel's campaign has displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza - 1.9 million of its 2.3 million Palestinians -- and killed more than 41,600 people. Like the Abu Jarads, most families have been uprooted multiple times.

For this family, the journey has taken them from a comfortable middle-class life to ruin.

Living at the northernmost end of Gaza, most days before the war in Beit Hanoun were simple. Ne'man headed out each morning to work as a taxi driver. Majida got their daughters off to school. Their youngest, Lana, had started first grade. Hoda, the 18-year-old, was in her first year at university. The eldest, Balsam, just had her first baby.

Majida spent much of her day doing housework -- her face lights up when she talks about her kitchen, the center of family life.

Ne'man had planted the garden with a grapevine and covered the roof with potted flowers. Watering them in the evenings was a soothing ritual. Then, the family and neighbors would sit on the front stoop or the roof to chat.

""The area would always smell nice,"" he said. ""People would say we have perfume because of how beautiful the flowers are.""

On the morning of Oct. 7, the family heard Hamas rockets firing and news of the militants' attack into southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped. The Abu Jarads knew that the Israeli response would be swift and that their house, only about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the border fence with Israel, would be on the front line.

By 9 a.m., Ne'man and Majida, their six daughters, and Ne'man's sister packed up what they could and fled, as the Israeli military issued one of its first evacuation orders.

""It makes no sense to be stubborn and stay,"" Majida said. ""It is not about one person. I am part of a family and have girls.""

Like many, the family tried, at first, to stay close to home. They went to stay with Majida's parents, nearby in the town of Beit Lahiya.

""The place was very comfortable, to be honest. I felt like I was at home,"" Majida said. ""But we were living in fear and terror.""

Already, Beit Lahiya was being heavily bombarded. Over the six days they were there, at least nine Israeli strikes hit the town, killing dozens, according to the conflict monitor Airwars. Entire families were killed or wounded under the rubble of their homes.

As the explosions got closer, shrapnel pierced water tanks at Majida's parents' home. Windows shattered as the family huddled inside.

The building and its grounds were packed with thousands of people. All around northern Gaza, families took refuge in hospitals, hoping they'd be safe.

The family found a small space on the floor, barely enough room to spread their blanket amid the frantic medical staff struggling with the wounded.

It was a black night and there were strikes, Majida remembers.

The day after they arrived, a strike smashed into a house a few hundred meters away, killing a prominent doctor and some two dozen members of his family, many of them children.

The Israeli military ordered all civilians to leave northern Gaza, setting in motion a wave of hundreds of thousands of people heading south across Wadi Gaza, the stream and wetlands that divide the north from the rest of the strip.

The family joined the exodus.

The family walked 10 kilometers (6 miles) until they reached the U.N.-run Girls' Preparatory School in the Nuseirat refugee camp.

Every classroom and corridor was packed with families from the north. Majida, the daughters and Ne'man's sister found a tiny space in a classroom already housing more than 100 women and children. For privacy in the cramped conditions, Ne'man moved in with the men in tents outside, in the schoolyard.

This was their home for more than 10 weeks. Majida and the girls slept curled up on the floor, without enough space even to extend their legs. As winter set in, there weren't enough blankets.

The bathrooms were the worst part, Majida said. Only a few toilets served thousands of people. Getting a shower was a miracle, she said. People went weeks unable to bathe. Skin diseases ran rampant.

Every day, the daughters went at dawn to wait in line at the few bakeries still working and came back in the afternoon, sometimes with only one flatbread. One day, Ne'man and his daughters walked 5 kilometers (3 miles) to the town of Deir al-Balah, looking for drinkable water.

""If it wasn't for the kind people in Deir al-Balah who took pity on us and gave us half a gallon, we could have returned with nothing,"" Ne'man said.

As strikes continued, the family decided to go as far as possible, trekking 20 kilometers (12 miles) to Rafah, at Gaza's southernmost end.

The Abu Jarads weren't the only ones: As Israeli evacuation orders ate away at more and more of Gaza, nearly half of the population crammed into Rafah.

Here, the family had their first taste of living in a tent.

They set up amid the massive sprawl of tens of thousands of tents on Rafah's outskirts, near U.N. aid warehouses known as ""the barracks.""

""In the winter, it was hell, water drenched us,"" Majida said. ""We slept on the ground, nothing under us, and no covers.""

They had no money to buy food in the markets, where prices soared. The youngest girls got sick with colds and diarrhea, and there was no nearby pharmacy to buy medicine. The family survived completely off U.N. handouts of flour and other basics.

""To buy one tomato or cucumber and find it in the tent was like a dream,"" Ne'man said.

Like so many others, they'd believed Rafah was the last safe place in Gaza.

It was not.

In the first week of May, Israel ordered the evacuation of all of Rafah. Then its troops pushed into the city. Bombardment intensified.

Ne'man and Majida tried to stay as long as possible. But an airstrike hit nearby, he said, killing four of Ne'man's cousins and a young girl.

Palestinians who'd packed into Rafah -- more than 1 million -- all streamed out again, fleeing the Israeli offensive.

They scattered across southern and central Gaza. New tent cities filled beaches, fields, empty lots, schoolyards, cemeteries, even dumpsites - any open space.

The Abu Jarads moved by foot and donkey cart until they reached a former amusement park known as Asdaa City. Now its Ferris wheel stood above a landscape of tents stretching as far as the eye could see.

Here, in Muwasi, a barren area of dunes and fields along the coast, Israel had declared a ""humanitarian zone"" - though there was little aid, food or water.

Every amenity once taken for granted was a distant memory. Now the kitchen was a pile of sticks for kindling and two rocks for setting a pot over the fire. No shower, only the occasional bucket of water. Soap was too expensive. Only a draped sheet separated them from their neighbors. Everything was filthy and sandy. Large spiders, cockroaches and other insects crept into the tent.

A raid by Israeli troops less than a kilometer (half-mile) away forced Majida and Ne'man to uproot their family once more. They headed toward the Mediterranean coast, not knowing where they'd stay.

Fortunately, they said, they found some acquaintances.

""God bless them, they opened their tent for us and let us live with them for 10 days,"" Ne'man said.

When they returned to Muwasi, the Abu Jarads found their tent had been robbed - their food and clothes, all gone.

Since then, the weeks blur together. The family finds survival itself loses meaning in a conflict that seems to have no end.

Food has become even harder to find as supplies entering Gaza drop to their lowest levels of the war.

Israeli drones buzz overhead constantly. The mental strain wears on everyone.

One day, Ne'man said, his youngest daughter, Lana, told him, ""You stopped loving me. Because now when I come near you, you say you are fed up and tell me to stay away.""

He kept telling her, ""No, darling, I love you. I just can't bear it all.""

They all dream of home. Ne'man said he learned that his brother's house next door was destroyed in a strike, and his own home was damaged. He wonders about his flowers. He hopes they survived -- even if the house is gone.

The difference between then and now, Majida said, is ""the difference between heaven and earth.""

Far from the warmth and affection of home, the Abu Jarads feel themselves surrendering to despair.

""We are jealous,"" Majida said. ""Jealous of who? Of the people who were killed. Because they found relief while we are still suffering, living horrors, torture and heartbreak.""

Lebanese worldwide fear for their homeland and loved ones as violence escalates,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-global-diaspora-violence-israel-hezbollah-12b4de400efafed84f665a0ea3045c9f,2024-10-06T05:36:19Z,"It was a year ago when Jomana Siddiqui visited Lebanon, where her father was born -- and is now buried. She planned to return there soon; this time, she thought, she would take her two teenage daughters.

Instead, Siddiqui, who lives in California, now worries about relatives there. As she watches from afar the violence and the recent escalation in Israel's military campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, Siddiqui thinks about the people she met during her visit, the kindness and generosity she encountered.

She thinks about her father's grave -- when, or if, she will get to visit it again. Her voice cracks with emotions. It's been gut-wrenching, she said.

""It's like the universal story of the Lebanese people,"" she said. ""They have to keep leaving and not knowing when they can come back.""

From the United States to South Africa, Cyprus, Brazil and beyond, many members of Lebanon's far-flung and large diaspora are contending with the ripples of the violence -- grieving, gripped by fear for loved ones and for their homeland, trying to find ways to help.

Some 1,400 Lebanese, including civilians and fighters of the militant group Hezbollah, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September, saying it aims to push Hezbollah away from the countries' shared border.

For Lina Kayat, who moved to South Africa almost 36 years ago but still has a big family in Lebanon, the violence and tensions there have echoes of earlier turbulent chapters.

""We lived through a civil war for a long time; I was like seven years old,"" she said. ""It feels like history repeating itself. ... It's the unknown of who is going to get killed next.""

Kayat, who lives in South Africa's coastal city of Durban, speaks daily to her family, including her mother and her sister.

""They are very scared and very worried about what is going to happen,"" she said.

Generations of Lebanese have grappled with whether to leave to seek better opportunities or escape various times of tumult -- from a 15-year-old civil war to military occupations, bombings and political assassinations -- or stay in a Lebanon that despite its numerous scars retains its allure for many. Lebanon -- home to multiple religious groups, including Christians and Sunni and Shiite Muslims -- takes pride in its large emigrant communities, which include successful businessmen and celebrities of Lebanese heritage.

The current military escalation unfolds amid fears that fighting could spread in the region and comes as the Israel-Hamas war in Gaza nears the grim one-year mark.

""It happening on top of Gaza is almost too much to bear,"" said James Zogby, president of the Washington D.C.-based Arab American Institute.

""It almost makes you physically ill just trying to fathom the extent of the trauma,"" added Zogby, whose father was born in Lebanon.

Already, Lebanon had been on edge and struggling under the weight of an economic meltdown, the fallout from a massive 2020 port explosion and other crises. It's been without a president for two years.

Against such a somber backdrop, Zogby wonders what will become of the displaced.

""Who's going to care for them? Where do the health services come from ... when the country is already as overstretched as it is and on the verge of collapse?"" he said. ""At what point does it finally collapse? And who will care?""

Fueling the pain, he said, is his anger at the U.S. response to the devastation in Gaza and now the escalation in Lebanon.

""There's a sense of powerlessness, a sense of almost despair that, you know, it can get out of control. And as long as nothing here happens to restrain it, it will get worse.""

Akram Khater, director of the Khayrallah Center for Lebanese Diaspora Studies at North Carolina State University, said that since the earliest diaspora, Lebanese who left have been contributing heavily to the economic well-being of Lebanon, sending large amounts of remittances.

Watching the escalation in Lebanon, where he was born and raised, has been re-traumatizing, he said.

""I find myself amidst a swirl of emotions that are unresolved and that derive from this recurring nightmare,"" he said. ""Yet, even amidst this our community comes together to create solidarity and provide solace and comfort for each other.""

Recently, hundreds of Lebanese flags filled the night sky in Dearborn, Michigan, as some attended a rally to support Lebanon and protest the Israeli offensive there.

At Sao Paulo's international airport, two Lebanese brothers who've been living in Brazil, recently had a solemn reunion. They said eight of their loved ones -- their sister, brother-in-law, four of their nephews and two of their nephews' children -- were killed in Lebanon in one of the attacks.

Hussein Zeineddine, one of the brothers, had been on vacation with his family in southern Lebanon when the area was hit by Israeli attacks, he told The Associated Press. He and his family moved to a safer location until they could book flights back to Brazil. ""My wife was crying and asking us to leave. We left just with basic items. And then, shortly after, my sister's house was bombed,"" he said after his arrival.

""It will be tough here. But it will be tougher for people there,"" he said.

In Cyprus, Rosaline Ghoukassian said the overwhelming majority of Lebanese don't want this war. She relocated to Cyprus with her husband Raffi Garabedian and their daughter Maria after the 2020 ammonium nitrate explosion in Beirut's port that killed more than 200 people. She said she'd been disenchanted with Lebanon's political leadership and also lamented Hezbollah's influence.

""We knew this was coming,"" she said. ""The problem is in Lebanon. ... Because we don't have a good government.""

Their decision to leave Lebanon was never about money but safety, as their daughter explained in a letter she wrote in class in Cyprus: ""I don't want to go there because I was saved in the explosion, and I don't want to go live there because I don't want to die.""

The family chose to stay.

""I'm not here to make thousands of euros. No. I'm here just to live. To be happy, to be safe. This is what I want. To live,"" Garabedian said.

Hezbollah began firing into Israel the day after Hamas' attack on southern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed some 1,200 people and took about 250 others hostage. Since then, Israel's military response in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to local health officials.

Back in California, Siddiqui said coping with it all has been challenging.

""You grab the phone; you hesitate to open it because you're afraid of what you're going to see, but you kind of have to.""

She talks to friends and others in her circle who can relate.

""We all feel kind of sad, depressed, helpless, rundown,"" she said. ""We can do things like fundraise and donate and protest or anything like that, but at the end of the day, it still weighs on you.""

Apparent Israeli airstrike on mosque in central Gaza kills at least 18 people,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-6-october-2024-0210e9d539a899e21ee89b52807b6af7,2024-10-06T04:48:41Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- An apparent Israeli airstrike early Sunday killed at least 18 people in central Gaza, Palestinian medical officials said.

The strike hit a mosque sheltering displaced people near the al-Aqsa Martyrs hospital in the town of Deir al-Balah, the hospital said in a statement.

An Associated Press journalist counted the bodies at the hospital morgue. Hospital records showed that the dead were all men. Another two men were critically wounded, the hospital said.

The Israeli military did not immediately comment about the strike on the mosque.

The latest strikes add to the mounting Palestinian death toll in Gaza, which is now nearing 42,000 according to the Palestinian Health Ministry. The ministry does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths, but many of the dead were women and children."
"A year into the Israel-Hamas war, students say a chill on free speech has reached college classrooms",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-palestinians-campus-protest-anniversary-46faa669edb6b8bf1da6f670f6186bbc,2024-10-06T04:41:05Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- As a junior at George Washington University, Ty Lindia meets new students every day. But with the shadow of the Israel-Hamas war hanging over the Washington, D.C., campus, where everyone has a political opinion, each new encounter is fraught.

""This idea that I might say the wrong thing kind of scares me,"" said Lindia, who studies political science. ""You have to tiptoe around politics until one person says something that signifies they lean a certain way on the issue.""

He has seen friendships -- including some of his own -- end over views about the war. In public, he keeps his stance to himself for fear that future employers could hold it against him.

""Before Oct. 7, there wasn't really a big fear,"" said Lindia, of Morristown, New Jersey.

A year after Hamas' attack in southern Israel, some students say they are reluctant to speak out because it could pit them against their peers, professors or even potential employers. Social bubbles have cemented along the divisions of the war. New protest rules on many campuses raise the risk of suspension or expulsion.

Tensions over the conflict burst wide open last year amid emotional demonstrations in the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attack. In the spring, a wave of pro-Palestinian tent encampments led to some 3,200 arrests.

The atmosphere on U.S. campuses has calmed since those protests, yet lingering unease remains.

In a recent class discussion on gender and the military at Indiana University, sophomore Mikayla Kaplan said she thought about mentioning her female friends who serve in the Israeli military. But in a room full of politically progressive classmates, she decided to stay quiet.

""In the back of my head, I'm always thinking about things that I should or shouldn't say,"" Kaplan said.

Kaplan, who proudly wears a Star of David necklace, said that before college she had many friends of different faiths, but after Oct. 7, almost all of her friends are Jewish.

The war began when Hamas-led fighters killed about 1,200 people, mostly civilians, in the Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. They abducted another 250 people and are still holding about 100 hostages. Israel's campaign in Gaza has killed at least 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

At the University of Connecticut, some students said the conflict doesn't come up as much in classes. Ahmad Zoghol, an engineering student, said it remains a tense issue and he has heard of potential employers scrutinizing political statements students make in college.

""There's definitely that concern for a lot of people, including myself, that if we speak about it there's going to be some sort of repercussion,"" he said.

Compared with the much larger campus protests of the Vietnam War era, when few students openly supported the war, campuses today appear more divided, said Mark Yudof, a former president of the University of California system. For many, the issues are more personal.

""The faculty are at odds with each other. The student body is at odds with each other. There's a war of ideologies going on,"" he said.

Some universities are trying to bridge the divide with campus events on civil discourse, sometimes inviting Palestinian and Jewish speakers to share the stage. At Harvard University in Massachusetts, a recent survey found that many students and professors are reluctant to share views in the classroom. A panel suggested solutions including ""classroom confidentiality"" and teaching on constructive disagreement.

Meanwhile, many campuses are adding policies that clamp down on protests, often banning encampments and limiting demonstrations to certain hours or locations.

At Indiana University, a new policy forbids ""expressive activity"" after 11 p.m, among other restrictions. Doctoral student Bryce Greene, who helped lead a pro-Palestinian encampment last semester, said he was threatened with suspension after organizing an 11:30 p.m. vigil.

That's a startling contrast to past protests on campus, including a 2019 climate demonstration that drew hundreds of students without university interference, he said.

""There's definitely a chilling effect that occurs when speech is being restricted in this manner,"" said Greene, who is part of a lawsuit challenging the new policy. ""This is just one way for them to restrict people from speaking out for Palestine.""

The tense atmosphere has led some faculty members to rethink teaching certain subjects or entering certain debates, said Risa Lieberwitz, general counsel for the American Association of University Professors.

Lieberwitz, who teaches labor law at Cornell University, has been alarmed by the growing number of colleges requiring students to register demonstrations days in advance.

""It's so contradictory to the notion of how protests and demonstrations take place,"" she said. ""They're oftentimes spontaneous. They're not planned in the way that events are generally planned.""

Protests have continued on many campuses, but on a smaller scale and often under the confines of new rules.

At Wesleyan University in Connecticut, police removed a group of pro-Palestinian students from a campus building where they held a sit-in in September. Wesleyan President Michael Roth said he supports students' free speech rights, but they ""don't have a right to take over part of a building.""

Wesleyan is offering new courses on civil disagreement this year, and faculty are working to help foster discussion among students.

""It's challenging for students, as it is for adults -- most adults don't have conversations with people who disagree with them,"" Roth said. ""We're so segregated into our bubbles.""

American universities pride themselves as being places of open discourse where students can engage across their differences. Since Oct. 7, they have been under tremendous pressure to uphold free speech while also protecting students from discrimination.

The U.S. Education Department is investigating more than 70 colleges for reports of antisemitism or Islamophobia. Leaders of several prestigious colleges have been called before Congress by Republicans who accuse them of being soft on antisemitism.

Yet finding the line where protected speech ends is as hard as ever. Leaders grapple with whether to allow chants seen by some as calls of support for Palestinians and by others as a threat against Jews. It's especially complicated at public universities, which are bound by the First Amendment, while private colleges have flexibility to impose wider speech limits.

At George Washington University, Lindia said the war comes up often in his classes but sometimes after a warming-up period -- in one class, discussion loosened after the professor realized most students shared similar views. Even walking to class, there is a visible reminder of the tension. Tall fencing now surrounds University Yard, the grassy space where police broke up a tent encampment in May.

""It's a place for free expression, and now it's just completely blocked off,"" he said.

Some students say moderate voices are getting lost.

Nivriti Agaram, a junior at George Washington, said she believes Israel has a right to defend itself but questions America's spending on the war. That opinion puts her at odds with more liberal students, who have called her a ""genocide enabler"" and worse, she said.

""It's very stifling,"" she said. ""I think there's a silent majority who aren't speaking.""

A year of blood and anguish: The Mideast war in AP photos,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-hamas-war-lebanon-photo-gallery-dc81e4fa104fa821ed74bd40fd9e56f5,2024-10-06T04:11:49Z,"A year after Hamas launched a cross-border attack into southern Israel on Oct. 7, the images of that day and its ongoing aftermath still defy belief.

No one thought they would see heavily armed Hamas gunmen going door-to-door on quiet Israeli streets or storming a crowded music festival, mowing people down for hours with no soldiers in sight.

No one thought they would see entire neighborhoods in the Gaza Strip turned into rubble-strewn wastelands, with high-rises leveled, paved roads turned to dirt and people fleeing on foot with only what they could carry. Few thought it would last this long, or claim so many lives.

Hamas' surprise attack and the war it triggered in Gaza have brought unprecedented death, destruction and anguish to both Israelis and Palestinians. Its ripples across the Middle East have raised the specter of an even larger conflict.

Associated Press photographers have tried to capture its impact on ordinary people.

They have photographed Israelis returning to the scenes of the killings, mobilizing for war and protesting their country's wartime leadership and its failure to return scores of hostages.

They have been there as Palestinians dig for survivors after airstrikes and as the wounded are treated on the floors of overwhelmed hospitals. They have photographed people huddling in tents and crowding around aid stations, reaching with empty pots for desperately needed food,

They have followed Palestinians from one end of Gaza to another as they flee airstrikes and evacuation orders, often traveling by foot or donkey cart with only what they can carry.

And they have been to funerals -- too many funerals -- on both sides.

As with all wars, civilians have paid the heaviest price. Young Israelis were killed by the hundreds at the music festival. Grandparents in their 70s and 80s were dragged into Gaza and held in tunnels, where many perished. Airstrikes killed Palestinian children in front of their parents and left thousands of orphans -- some with no living relatives.

Lebanon's Hezbollah militant group began firing rockets into Israel on Oct. 8, drawing retaliatory strikes in a cycle of escalation that has steadily worsened. In recent weeks, Israeli warplanes have pounded large areas of Lebanon, killing Hezbollah's leader and several of his top commanders, as well as many civilians. Ground operations commenced last week.

The bombings have brought more giant plumes of smoke, more blackened craters where buildings once stood, more screaming ambulances and more people -- by the hundreds of thousands -- taking to the roads to flee the war's widening vortex.

Through it all, there have been some moments of joy, however fleeting.

There were happy homecomings -- on both sides -- last November after more than 100 hostages were freed in exchange for the release of Palestinians imprisoned by Israel.

But a year on, everyone still seems to be trapped in the violent reality unleashed in the early hours of Oct. 7, with no end in sight."
A displaced family's year of fleeing across the devastated Gaza Strip,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-gaza-displacement-families-moving-161d9ad8d07e12b22bfd41c79d174c70,2024-10-06T04:03:24Z,"DEIR AL-BALAH, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Ne'man Abu Jarad sat on a tarp on the ground. Around him, canvas sheets hung from cords, forming the walls of his tent. For the past year, Ne'man; his wife, Majida; and their six daughters have trekked the length of the Gaza Strip, trying to survive as Israeli forceswreaked destruction around them.

It's a far cry from their house in northern Gaza -- a place of comforting routine, of love, affection and safety. A place where loved ones gathered around the kitchen table or on the roof on summer evenings amid the scent of roses and jasmine flowers.

""Your house is your homeland. Everything good in our life was the home,"" Ne'man said. ""Everything in it, whether physical or intangible -- family, neighbors, my siblings who were all around me.

They did exactly as the Israelis ordered in the devastating weeks and months of war that followed. They obeyed evacuation calls. They moved where the military told them to move. Seven times they fled, and each time, their lives became more unrecognizable to them, crowding with strangers in a school classroom, searching for water in a vast tent camp or sleeping on the street.

The Associated Press traced the family's journey as they were driven from their home. Israel's campaign has displaced nearly the entire population of Gaza -- 1.9 million of its 2.3 million Palestinians -- and killed more than 41,600 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry. Like the Abu Jarads, most families have been uprooted multiple times.

For this family, the journey has taken them from a comfortable middle-class life to ruin.

Living at the northernmost end of Gaza, most days before the war in Beit Hanoun were simple. Ne'man headed out each morning to work as a taxi driver. Majida got their daughters off to school. Their youngest, Lana, had started first grade. Hoda, the 18-year-old, was in her first year at university. The eldest, Balsam, just had her first baby.

Majida spent much of her day doing housework -- her face lights up when she talks about her kitchen, the center of family life.

Ne'man had planted the garden with a grapevine and covered the roof with potted flowers. Watering them in the evenings was a soothing ritual. Then, the family and neighbors would sit on the front stoop or the roof to chat.

""The area would always smell nice,"" he said. ""People would say we have perfume because of how beautiful the flowers are.""

On the morning of Oct. 7, the family heard Hamas rockets firing and news of the militants' attack into southern Israel, in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped.

The Abu Jarads knew that the Israeli response would be swift and that their house, only about 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) from the border fence with Israel, would be on the front line.

By 9 a.m., Ne'man and Majida, their six daughters, and Ne'man's sister packed up what they could and fled, as the Israeli military issued one of its first evacuation orders.

""It makes no sense to be stubborn and stay,"" Majida said. ""It is not about one person. I am part of a family and have girls.""

Like many, the family tried, at first, to stay close to home. They went to stay with Majida's parents, in Beit Lahiya about a kilometer (.6 miles) away.

""The place was very comfortable, to be honest. I felt like I was at home,"" Majida said. ""But we were living in fear and terror.""

Already, Beit Lahiya was being heavily bombarded. Over the six days they were there, at least nine Israeli strikes hit the town, killing dozens, according to the conflict monitor Airwars. Entire families were killed or wounded under the rubble of their homes.

As the explosions got closer, shrapnel pierced water tanks at Majida's parents' home. Windows shattered as the family huddled inside.

The building and its grounds were packed with thousands of people. All around northern Gaza, families took refuge in hospitals, hoping they'd be safe.

The family found a small space on the floor, barely enough room to spread their blanket amid the frantic medical staff struggling with the wounded.

It was a black night and there were strikes, Majida remembers. ""The martyrs and wounded were strewn on the floor,"" she said.

The day after they arrived, a strike smashed into a house a few hundred meters away, killing a prominent doctor and some two dozen members of his family, many of them children.

The Israeli military ordered all civilians to leave northern Gaza, setting in motion a wave of hundreds of thousands of people heading south across Wadi Gaza, the stream and wetlands that divide the north from the rest of the strip.

The family joined the exodus.

The family walked 10 kilometers (6 miles) until they reached the U.N.-run Girls' Preparatory School in the Nuseirat refugee camp.

Every classroom and corridor was packed with families from the north. Majida, the daughters and Ne'man's sister found a tiny space in a classroom already housing more than 100 women and children. For privacy in the cramped conditions, Ne'man moved in with the men in tents outside, in the schoolyard.

This was their home for more than 10 weeks. Majida and the girls slept curled up on the floor, without enough space even to extend their legs. As winter set in, there weren't enough blankets.

The bathrooms were the worst part, Majida said. Only a few toilets served thousands of people. Getting a shower was a miracle, she said. People went weeks unable to bathe. Skin diseases ran rampant.

Every day, the daughters went at dawn to wait in line at the few bakeries still working and came back in the afternoon, sometimes with only one flatbread. One day, Ne'man and his daughters walked 5 kilometers (3 miles) to the town of Deir al-Balah, looking for drinkable water.

""If it wasn't for the kind people in Deir al-Balah who took pity on us and gave us half a gallon, we could have returned with nothing,"" Ne'man said.

As strikes continued, the family decided to go as far as possible, trekking 20 kilometers (12 miles) to Rafah, at Gaza's southernmost end.

The Abu Jarads weren't the only ones: As Israeli evacuation orders ate away at more and more of Gaza, nearly half of the population crammed into Rafah.

Here, the family had their first taste of living in a tent.

They set up amid the massive sprawl of tens of thousands of tents on Rafah's outskirts, near U.N. aid warehouses known as ""the barracks.""

""In the winter, it was hell, water drenched us,"" Majida said. ""We slept on the ground, nothing under us, and no covers.""

They had no money to buy food in the markets, where prices soared. The youngest girls got sick with colds and diarrhea, and there was no nearby pharmacy to buy medicine. The family survived completely off U.N. handouts of flour and other basics.

""To buy one tomato or cucumber and find it in the tent was like a dream,"" Ne'man said.

Like so many others, they'd believed Rafah was the last safe place in Gaza.

It was not.

In the first week of May, Israel ordered the evacuation of all of Rafah. Then its troops pushed into the city. Bombardment intensified.

Ne'man and Majida tried to stay as long as possible. But an airstrike hit nearby, he said, killing four of Ne'man's cousins and a young girl.

Palestinians who'd packed into Rafah -- more than 1 million -- all streamed out again, fleeing the Israeli offensive.

They scattered across southern and central Gaza. New tent cities filled beaches, fields, empty lots, schoolyards, cemeteries, even dumpsites - any open space.

The Abu Jarads moved by foot and donkey cart until they reached a former amusement park known as Asdaa City. Now its Ferris wheel stood above a landscape of tents stretching as far as the eye could see.

Here, in Muwasi, a barren area of dunes and fields along the coast, Israel had declared a ""humanitarian zone"" - though there was little aid, food or water.

Every amenity once taken for granted was a distant memory. Now the kitchen was a pile of sticks for kindling and two rocks for setting a pot over the fire. No shower, only the occasional bucket of water. Soap was too expensive. Only a draped sheet separated them from their neighbors. Everything was filthy and sandy. Large spiders, cockroaches and other insects crept into the tent.

Even the ""humanitarian zone"" was unsafe.

A raid by Israeli troops less than a kilometer (half-mile) away forced Majida and Ne'man to uproot their family once more. They headed toward the Mediterranean coast, not knowing where they'd stay.

Fortunately, they said, they found some acquaintances.

""God bless them, they opened their tent for us and let us live with them for 10 days,"" Ne'man said.

When they returned to Muwasi, the Abu Jarads found their tent had been robbed - their food and clothes, all gone.

Since then, the weeks blur together. The family finds survival itself loses meaning in a conflict that seems to have no end.

Food has become even harder to find as supplies entering Gaza drop to their lowest levels of the war.

Israeli drones buzz overhead constantly. The mental strain wears on everyone.

One day, Ne'man said, his youngest daughter, Lana, told him, ""You stopped loving me. Because now when I come near you, you say you are fed up and tell me to stay away.""

He kept telling her, ""No, darling, I love you. I just can't bear it all.""

They all dream of home. Ne'man said he learned that his brother's house next door was destroyed in a strike, and his own home was damaged. He wonders about his flowers. He hopes they survived -- even if the house is gone.

The difference between then and now, Majida said, is ""the difference between heaven and earth.""

Far from the warmth and affection of home, the Abu Jarads feel themselves surrendering to despair.

""We are jealous,"" Majida said. ""Jealous of who? Of the people who were killed. Because they found relief while we are still suffering, living horrors, torture and heartbreak.""

"Born on Oct. 7, Ali's first year has played out against the backdrop of the Israel-Hamas war",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/gaza-israel-war-anniversary-birthday-child-515add1ecaeefeab07429ce4eded92b1,2024-10-05T17:07:13Z,"NUSEIRAT, Gaza Strip (AP) -- Ali Al-Taweel was born as Israeli warplanes started to pound the Gaza Strip after Hamas' surprise cross-border attack on southern Israel.

Now, the Palestinian child will celebrate his first birthday as the Israeli-Hamas war reaches its one-year mark. For his family, it's been a year filled with uncertainty and anxiety as they moved place to place amid widespread destruction and limited resources.

""I had arranged another, very sweet life for him,"" Ali's mother, Amal Al-Taweel, told The Associated Press in an interview, ""The war has changed everything.""

When the war began on Oct. 7 of last year, Al-Taweel was being rushed to a hospital in central Gaza to give birth to a child she and her husband, Mustafa Al-Taweel, had sought for three years. Days after Ali's birth, his family returned to their home in the Zahrah neighborhood, just north of Wadi Gaza, but were forced to flee on Oct. 18, just a day before Israeli warplanes bombed the area, Al-Taweel said.

Since then, they have been living in relatives' homes and shelters across central and southern Gaza, including the city of Rafah before the Israeli military invaded it in May. They now shelter in the house of Al-Taweel's parents in the Nuseirat refugee camp, along with 15 other relatives.

""It was a very difficult year, bad in every way -- from a health perspective, from a psychological perspective,"" the 30-year-old said, adding that her child has been raised against the backdrop of daily bombing and killing.

The Hamas-led attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed some 1,200 people -- mostly civilians -- and took about 250 hostage, including children and a newborn. Israel responded with one of the deadliest and most destructive military campaigns in recent history. The war has killed about 42,000 Palestinians, many of them women and children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which doesn't differentiate between civilians and combatants.

More than 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million have been forced to flee their homes and cram into a tent camp on Gaza's shore. A quarter of the strip's population faces starvation amid an Israel-imposed blockade, allowing only limited delivery of aid, according to the United Nations.

Al-Taweel said every stage of Ali's life has been difficult ""from the time he started crawling, to when his teeth came out, to when he started his first steps, to when he started walking."" And she worried constantly about his safety, recalling that he was slightly injured when a strike hit close to her sister's house in the camp, shattering the windows.

Al-Taweel counted multiple challenges she and her husband, who lost his job as a day laborer in a seaside restaurant in Gaza City, have faced since the war began. Ali didn't receive any vaccinations in his first six months, making him vulnerable to disease, his mother said. And, with the blockade in place, she has struggled to obtain formula and diapers.

""They do not exist, and if they exist, they are very expensive and we can't afford them,"" she said.

Israel has severely restricted aid deliveries of food, water, medicine and other supplies into Gaza during the war. U.N. agencies and aid groups working in the enclave have long complained about lack of access and crippling restrictions on aid delivery.

""There is no single word that can describe the past year,"" said Sondos Alashqar, who works with the Medical Aid for Palestine group. Alashqar said that the hardships Palestinians saw during this past year exceeded what their grandparents experienced during the 1948 Nakba -- or catastrophe -- when some 700,000 Palestinians fled or were forced from what is now Israel.

""We witnessed numerous death-and-life situations,"" she said. ""It was one of the hardest years we've even lived -- harder than what our grandparents experienced.""

Al-Taweel said that constant bombing, displacement and destruction have made it difficult for her to raise her child as she had planned in his first year.

""It (the year) was full of tension, fear, anxiety, displacement, bombing and destruction,"" she said. ""He was not like any other child who lives in a safe, peaceful, and healthy (environment)."""
The Gaza war long felt personal for Palestinian refugees in Lebanon. Now they're living it,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-gaza-palestinian-refugees-unrwa-b1261f29422c2fe60c7152f4025ad710,2024-10-05T14:53:49Z,"Many live in camps set up after 1948, when their parents or grandparents fled their homes in land that became Israel, and they have followed a year's worth of news of destruction and displacement in Gaza with dismay.

While Israeli air strikes in Lebanon have killed a few figures from Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups, the camps that house many of the country's approximately 200,000 refugees felt relatively safe for the general population.

That has changed.

Tens of thousands of refugees have fled as Israel has launched an offensive in Lebanon against Hezbollah amid an ongoing escalation in the war in the Middle East. For many, it feels as if they are living the horrors they witnessed on their screens.

Manal Sharari, from the Rashidiyeh refugee camp near the southern coastal city of Tyre, used to try to shield her three young daughters from images of the war in Gaza even as she followed the news ""minute by minute.""

In recent weeks, she couldn't shield them from the sounds of bombs dropping nearby.

""They were afraid and would get anxious every time they heard the sound of a strike,"" Sharari said.

Four days ago, the Israeli military issued a warning to residents of the camp to evacuate as it launched a ground incursion into southern Lebanon -- similar to the series of evacuation orders that have sent residents of Gaza fleeing back and forth across the enclave for months.

Sharari and her family also fled. They are now staying in a vocational training center-turned-displacement shelter run by the U.N. agency for Palestinian refugees, or UNRWA, in the town of Sebline, 55 km (34 mi) to the north. Some 1,400 people are staying there.

Mariam Moussa, from the Burj Shamali camp, also near Tyre, fled with her extended family about a week earlier when strikes began falling on the outskirts of the camp.

Before that, she said, ""we would see the scenes in Gaza and what was happening there, the destruction, the children and families. And in the end, we had to flee our houses, same as them.""

Israeli officials have said the ground offensive in Lebanon and the week of heavy bombardment that preceded it aim to push Hezbollah back from the border and allow residents of northern Israel to return to their homes.

The Lebanese militant group began launching rockets into Israel in support of its ally, Hamas, one day after the Oct. 7 Hamas-led incursion into southern Israel and ensuing Israeli offensive in Gaza.

Israel responded with airstrikes and shelling, and the two sides were quickly locked into a monthslong, low-level conflict that has escalated sharply in recent weeks.

Lebanese officials say that more than 1 million people have been displaced. Palestinian refugees are a relatively small but growing proportion. At least two camps -- Ein el Hilweh and el Buss -- have been directly hit by airstrikes, while others have received evacuation warnings or have seen strikes nearby.

Dorothee Klaus, UNRWA's director in Lebanon, said around 20,000 Palestinian refugees have been displaced from camps in the south.

UNRWA was hosting around 4,300 people -- including Lebanese citizens and Syrian refugees as well as Palestinians -- in 12 shelters as of Thursday, Klaus said, ""and this is a number that is now steadily going to increase.""

The agency is preparing to open three more shelters if needed, Klaus said.

""We have been preparing for this emergency for weeks and months,"" she said.

Outside of the center in Sebline, where he is staying, Lebanese citizen Abbas Ferdoun has set up a makeshift convenience store out of the back of a van. He had to leave his own store outside of the Burj Shemali camp behind and flee two weeks ago, eventually ending up at the shelter.

""Lebanese, Syrians, Palestinians, we're all in the same situation,"" Ferdoun said.

In Gaza, U.N. centers housing displaced people have themselves been targeted by strikes, with Israeli officials claiming that the centers were being used by militants. Some worry that pattern could play out again in Lebanon.

Hicham Kayed, deputy general coordinator with Al-Jana, the local NGO administering the shelter in Sebline, said he felt the international ""response to the destruction of these facilities in Gaza was weak, to be honest,"" so ""fear is present"" that they might be similarly targeted in Lebanon.

Sharari said she feels safe for now, but she remains anxious about her father and others who stayed behind in the camp despite the warnings -- and about whether she will have a home to return to.

She still follows the news obsessively but now, she said, ""I'm following what's happening in Gaza and what's happening in Lebanon."""
European cities brace for pro-Palestinian rallies amid high alert as Oct. 7 anniversary approaches,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-israel-gaza-war-protests-rallies-propalestine-terror-alerts-b314ac9fc24ab91e3c0639405a15d5d0,2024-10-05T12:16:11Z,"ROME (AP) -- Hundreds of thousands of pro-Palestinian demonstrators were expected to take to the streets across Europe on Saturday calling for a cease-fire as the first anniversary of the Hamas attacks on Israel approached.

Security forces in several countries warned of heightened levels of alert in major cities, amid concerns that the escalating conflict in the Middle East could inspire new terror attacks in Europe or that some of the protests could turn violent.

Massive rallies are planned in several European cities, including London, Berlin, Paris and Rome through next week, with the largest gatherings expected from Saturday to Monday. Events will peak on Monday, the date of the anniversary.

By midday Saturday, thousands had gathered in central London's Russell Square amid a significant police presence. Some of the march's organizers had said they planned to target companies and institutions they claimed were ""complicit in Israel's crimes,"" including Barclays Bank and the British Museum.

Protests are also taking place in other parts of the world. In the Philippines on Saturday, dozens of left-wing activists protested near the U.S. Embassy in Manila, where police prevented them from getting closer to the seaside compound.

On Oct. 7 last year, Hamas launched a surprise attack into Israel, killing 1,200 Israelis, taking 250 people hostage and setting off a war with Israel that has shattered much of the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.

More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed since then in Gaza, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians. It says more than half were women and children.

Nearly 100 Israeli hostages remain in Gaza, with fewer than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks -- missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings -- as the region braces for further escalation.

In late September, Israel shifted some of its focus to Hezbollah, which holds much of the power in parts of southern Lebanon and some other areas of the country, attacking the militants with exploding pagers, airstrikes and, eventually, incursions into Lebanon.

Pro-Palestinian protests calling for an immediate cease-fire have repeatedly taken place across Europe and around the globe in the past year and have often turned violent, with confrontations between demonstrators and law enforcement officers.

In Rome, a rally was planned for Saturday afternoon -- with about 30,000 demonstrators expected -- in spite of a ban by local police chiefs who refused to authorize protests in the Italian capital, citing public security concerns.

Italian authorities believed that the timing of the planned rally risked the Oct. 7 attack being ""glorified,"" local media reported.

Interior Minister Matteo Piantedosi also stressed that, ahead of the key anniversary, Europe is on high alert for potential terror attacks. ""This is not a normal situation ... We are already in a condition of maximum prevention,"" he said.

A large crowd was also expected to gather in central London on Saturday afternoon. Ben Jamal, director of the Palestine Solidarity Campaign in Britain, said he and others will keep organizing marches until action against Israel is taken.

""We need to be out on the streets in even bigger numbers to stop this carnage and stop Britain being drawn into it,"" Jamal said.

In Berlin, a march is scheduled from the Brandenburg Gate to Bebelplatz on Sunday. Local media reported that security forces have warned of potential overload due to the scale of protests. German authorities pointed to increasing antisemitic and violent incidents in recent days.

France was also on alert for new protests on Saturday. Earlier this week, Interior minister Bruno Retailleau warned the country's regional prefects, expressing concern about possible tensions and saying that the terrorist threat was high."
"Israel strikes Lebanon, hitting Beirut suburbs and the north",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-5-october-2024-a8b70daeccc57a86fc6d939c604f2caf,2024-10-05T12:04:14Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- Israel expanded its bombardment in Lebanon on Saturday, hitting Beirut's southern suburbs with 12 airstrikes and striking a Palestinian refugee camp deep in northern Lebanon for the first time.

The attack on the Beddawi refugee camp near the northern city of Tripoli killed an official with Hamas's military wing, along with his wife and two young daughters, the Palesitnian militant group said in a statement. Tripoli is much farther north than the majority of Israel's strikes, which have been concentrated in southern Lebanon and Beirut.

Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began in October last year, in addition to most of the top leadership of Hezbollah.

At least six people were killed in more than a dozen Israeli airstrikes overnight and into Saturday, according to National News Agency, Lebanon's official news agency.

The Israeli military said special forces were carrying out targeted ground raids against Hezbollah infrastructure in southern Lebanon, destroying missiles, launchpads, watchtowers and weapons storage facilities. The military said troops also dismantled tunnel shafts that Hezbollah used to approach the Israeli border.

Some 1,400 Lebanese, including Hezbollah fighters and civilians, have been killed and some 1.2 million driven from their homes since Israel escalated its strikes in late September aiming to cripple Hezbollah and push it away from the countries' shared border. On Tuesday, Israel launched what it called a limited ground operation into southern Lebanon. Nine Israeli troops have been killed in close fighting in the area in the past few days, the military said.

Also on Saturday, Palestinian medical officials say Israeli strikes in northern and central Gaza early Saturday have killed at least 9 people, including two children.

One strike hit a group of people in the northern town of Beit Hanoun, killing at least five people, including two children, according to the Health Ministry's Ambulance and Emergency service.

Another strike hit a house in the northern part of the Nuseirat refugee camp, killing at least four people, the Awda hospital said. The strike also left a number of people wounded, it said.

The Israeli military did not have any immediate comment on the strikes, but it has long accused Hamas of operating from within civilian areas.

The Israeli military warned Palestinians to evacuate along the strategic Netzarim corridor in central Gaza, which was at the heart of obstacles to a ceasefire deal earlier this summer. The military told people in parts of the Nuseirat and Bureij refugee camps to evacuate to Muwasi, an area along Gaza's shore the military has designated a humanitarian zone.

It's unclear how many Palestinians are currently living in the areas ordered evacuated, parts of which were evacuated previously.

Almost 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in Gaza during the nearly year-long war, according to the Palestinian Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilian and militant deaths."

The accident happened around 1 a.m. near Peklenica, some 100 kilometers (60 miles) southeast of Zagreb, the capital, said a police statement.

A patrol spotted the van with German license plates overnight and started to follow it when the driver increased the speed, the statement said. After several kilometers (miles), the officers saw the van overturned in a ditch by the road after it apparently hit a concrete bridge, a house and a power pole.

Doctors told Croatian media that 9 people were seriously injured and were being treated in hospitals in the area. They include people from Iraq, Turkey and Syria, as well as Palestinians.

A similar accident in September in Croatia injured 14 people, illustrating the dangers migrants face as they flee wars and poverty in the Middle East, Africa and Asia.

Migrants often seek help from people smugglers to cross borders without authorization to reach wealthy Western European countries. Migrants are often forced to travel in crammed boats or vans."

The early morning strike came a day after another Israeli airstrike cut off a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, leaving two huge craters on either side of the road.

Israel began a ground incursion Tuesday into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. As the Israel-Hamas war reaches the one-year mark, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials.

Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

Here is the latest:

BEIRUT -- An Israeli strike on a refugee camp in north Lebanon has killed a Hamas official and his family, the militant group said Saturday.

Hamas said in a statement that the early Saturday strike on the Beddawi refugee camp struck the home of Saeed Atallah Ali, an official with Hamas's military wing, the Qassam Brigades. Ali's wife, Shaymaa Azzam, and their two daughters, Zeinab and Fatima -- whom the statement described as children -- were also killed in the attack.

Beddawi camp is near the northern city of Tripoli. It was the first such strike on the camp in recent weeks that saw intensified exchanges between Israel and Hamas.

Israel has killed several Hamas officials in Lebanon since the Israel-Hamas war began in October 2023.

SEOUL, South Korea -- A military plane evacuating 97 people from Lebanon arrived in South Korea on Saturday.

South Korea's Foreign Ministry said the group on the plane includes South Korean nationals and their family members. There are about 30 South Koreans left in Lebanon besides diplomats and embassy workers who are staying.

South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol instructed officials Wednesday to send military aircraft to conflict areas in the Middle East as he called a meeting to discuss the impact of the intensified fighting in the region. There are about 480 South Korean nationals living in Israel and 110 in Iran."
"One year in, war casts a shadow over every aspect of life in Israel",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-gaza-war-israelis-mood-depression-28daf7e6aa8ddab419cf76e31b111d4f,2024-10-05T04:13:18Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- At a busy Tel Aviv entertainment district, diners spill into outdoor seating and clink glasses as music fills the air. There's laughter, there's life. But all around the patrons, staring down from lampposts and shop windows, are pictures of hostages held in Gaza, stark reminders that Israel is at war and forever scarred by the deadliest attack in its history.

As Israel's war with Hamas reaches its one-year mark, it can seem on the surface that much of life in the country has returned to normal. But with many still reeling from Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, hostages remaining in captivity and a new front of warwith Hezbollah in the north, many Israelis feel depressed, despondent and angry as the war stretches into its second year.

Uncertainty over the future has cast a pall over virtually every part of daily life, even as people try to maintain a sense of normalcy.

""The conversation about the situation is always there,"" said activist Zeev Engelmayer, whose daily postcard project featuring illustrations of hostages or Israel's new reality has become a fixture at anti-war protests. ""Even those who are sitting in coffee shops, they're talking about it, in every single situation I see it. It's impossible to get away from it. It has entered into every vibration of our life.""

Hamas' attack in which some 1,200 people were killed and 250 kidnapped shattered Israelis' sense of security and stability in their homeland.

Many have been rattled by the war's evolution. Nearly 100 hostages remain in Gaza, with less than 70 believed to be alive. Israelis have experienced attacks -- missiles from Iran and Hezbollah, explosive drones from Yemen, fatal shootings and stabbings -- -- as the region braces for further escalation.

They've watched as Israel is accused of committing war crimes and genocide in Gaza and becomes increasingly isolated internationally.

""I'm almost 80 -- we grew up in this country with a feeling that we have short wars, and we win them quickly,"" said Israeli historian Tom Segev, who described new feelings of utter hopelessness. ""We're not used to a long war.""

Israelis have long harbored a sense that their country, born of the Holocaust's ashes and surviving a panoply of regional threats, is a success story, Segev said. They've strived, he added, for a normality akin to that of European and North American people, though their reality for decades has been anything but.

""I think that history is going backward,"" he said of the past year. ""Everything we have achieved on our way to becoming a normal state isn't happening.""

Reminders are everywhere. At a Hebrew University graduation in Jerusalem, a large yellow ribbon was placed in front of the stage. A graduate who didn't attend because his brother was killed in Gaza the previous day was honored.

Israel's longstanding internal divisions briefly eased in the aftermath of Hamas' attack, but have only intensified since. Weekly protests calling for a cease-fire deal that would free hostages are attended mostly by secular Jewish Israelis who oppose Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his government.

According to a September poll by Jerusalem-based think tank Israel Democracy Institute, 61 percent of right-wing Jewish Israelis -- Netanyahu's base -- support the war continuing.

Occupied with their own trauma, most Israelis paid scant attention to the ongoing destruction in Gaza, even as the Health Ministry there put the Palestinian death toll at more than 41,000. Israeli media have reported little on the devastation. Israelis calling for a cease-fire are driven overwhelmingly by the hostages' plight.

Many Israelis are furious at leaders and the military for not preventing Hamas' attack. Tens of thousands of people are expected at an alternative ceremony marking one year since then, as a statement against the government's official commemoration. The state ceremony is being prerecorded without a live audience, in part because of fears of heckling and disruptions.

""The thing we lost on Oct. 7 -- and we haven't gotten it back -- is our feeling of security,"" Muli Segev, executive producer of ""Eretz Nehederet,"" a popular sketch comedy show. ""Despite everything, we have been able to create a life here that's pretty open and Western.

""Especially in Tel Aviv, we go about our lives, and we don't think about the fact that our lives are really just pauses between wars and between explosions of violence.""

In the war's early months, the show's sketches were gentler, focusing on what united Israeli society, such as the massive civilian volunteer response. Over time, they featured more pointed satire, including a reimagining of negotiations if the hostages were Israeli politicians' children -- released in less than two hours.

Parts of life have rebounded -- beaches full of people, bustling cafes, concerts and sports back on schedules. But residents also check for the nearest bomb shelter, deal with school cancellations when violence flares up, and avoid domestic travel hubs that are now off-limits. Heartbreaking news arrives regularly, including the deaths of six hostages in August.

""It's a nightmare; we're just getting used to it,"" said Maya Brandwine, a 33-year-old graphic designer who witnessed the Jaffa shooting that killed seven on Tuesday. ""I have so little hope. I'm sure the situation will only get worse.""

Dror Rotches, a 47-year-old graphic designer, said from a Tel Aviv coffee shop: ""We try to go out when we can, meet friends and try to forget for a few hours. Then we go home and keep slogging through the mud.""

Others simply can't return home. More than 60,000 from Israel's northern border with Lebanon are displaced. Thousands from the southern towns ransacked Oct. 7 are in temporary housing. Tens of thousands of reserve soldiers are serving their second or third tour of duty, straining their families and jobs.

""As the war goes on and on and we can't see the end, there's also a type of very large worry over the future, and, for some, if there is even a future here,"" Muli Segev said.

Cafe Otef seems like any of Tel Aviv's ubiquitous coffee shops: Patrons laugh and sip specialty coffee beside a playground; light rock music plays. But next to the sandwiches and cakes are chocolates made from the recipes of Dvir Karp, who was killed in the Oct. 7 attack, and cheeses from Kibbutz Be'eri, where more than 100 died and 30 were taken hostage. Totes and T-shirts for sale declare ""We shall thrive again.""

The cafe, named for the region next to the Gaza border, is run by residents of Re'im, one of the kibbutzes struck. It's the second shop in the new chain, each aiming to support people of a southern Israeli town where lives were upended.

""The war still continues for almost a year, and I feel that if we won't live, we will die,"" said Reut Karp, cafe owner and Dvir's ex-wife. She lives with most of her kibbutz in temporary housing nearby.

The cafe gives her purpose as her community deals with trauma and the uncertainty of returning home. While it's strange to see people flowing through the doors, going about life as normal, she and the staff have found comfort in the routine.

""We must take ourselves out of bed and continue to live and to work and to have the hope,"" Karp said. ""Because without this hope, we don't have anything."""
Virginia man charged with defacing monument during Netanyahu protests in DC,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/netanyahu-protests-washington-congress-37861883e2db60606aaf434bf9ec83ad,2024-10-04T20:55:03Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Virginia man was arrested Friday on a charge that he spray-painted graffiti on a monument in the nation's capital during protests against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress in July.

Zaid Mohammed Mahdawi, 26, of Richmond, Va., was charged in a complaint with one count of destruction of federal property. He was among thousands of protesters who gathered in Washington, D.C., on July 24 to condemn Netanyahu's visit.

Some demonstrators who gathered outside Union Station that day removed American flags and hoisted Palestinian ones in their place. Others burned flags and sprayed graffiti on structures in Columbus Circle, in front of Union Station.

Videos posted on social media showed Mahdawi climbing the statue of Christopher Columbus in the middle of Columbus Circle and using red spray paint to write ""HAMAS IS COMIN"" on the monument, according to an FBI agent's affidavit. He also spray-painted an inverted red triangle above the slogan, the affidavit says.

The FBI later received a tip from a witness who knew Mahdawi from a Richmond gym and recognized his image in a police bulletin.

A group of protesters had a permit to demonstrate in front of Union Station, but the U.S. Park Police said it revoked the permit after it couldn't reach protest organizers that afternoon. The National Park Service estimated that it cost more than $11,000 to clean up and fix damage at the site.

""Politically motivated destruction or defacing of federal property is not protected speech, it is a crime,"" Matthew Graves, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, said in a statement.

Mahdawi was expected to make his initial court appearance in Virginia on Friday.

A Maryland woman was arrested last month on a related charge. Isabella Giordano, 20, of Towson, is accused of using red spray paint to write ""Gaza"" on a fountain in front of Union Station and spray-painting the base of two of the flagpoles in Columbus Circle."
Relatives say a whole family was killed in Israel's deadliest West Bank strike since Oct. 7,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-west-bank-strike-tulkarem-militants-1656f77bb28acdfb3d72ec5fccd628e9,2024-10-04T12:17:08Z,"TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) -- An Israeli airstrike on a West Bank cafe that the military said targeted Palestinian militants also killed a family of four, including two young children, relatives told The Associated Press on Friday.

The strike slammed into a three-story building in the Tulkarem refugee camp late Thursday, setting it on fire, destroying a popular cafe and killing at least 18 Palestinians, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It was the deadliest strike in the West Bank since the start of the Israel-Hamas war nearly a year ago.

On Friday, paramedics searched the rubble inside the blasted-out coffee shop, gathering human remains into small boxes. Young boys and men walked among the ruins of the shop, with holes in the ceiling and debris blanketing the ground, digging past bloodstained furniture and dislodged iron beams for anything to salvage.

Among the dead was the Abu Zahra family: Muhammad, a bakery worker; his wife, Saja; and their two children, Sham, 8, and Karam, 6, according to the man's brother, Mustafa Abu Zahra, who said the family lived above the coffee shop. He added that one of Muhammad's brothers-in-law was also in the apartment at the time and was killed.

The Israeli military said the strike killed several militants, including Hamas' leader in the camp, who it accused of planning and taking part in multiple attacks against Israeli civilians. Tulkarem, known to be a hotbed of Palestinian militancy, is a flashpoint in the West Bank and a frequent target of Israeli military raids.

Hamas, which did not immediately claim any of the dead as its fighters, condemned the strike and called for Palestinians in Tulkarem to rise up.

Israel has carried out several large-scale raids in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. While airstrikes used to be rare in the Palestinian territory, they have grown more common since the outbreak of war as Israeli forces clamp down, saying they aim to prevent attacks on their citizens.

Israeli fire has killed at least 722 Palestinians in the West Bank since Oct. 7, Palestinian health officials say. In that time, Palestinian militants have launched a number of attacks on soldiers at checkpoints and within Israel.

A shooting attack in Tel Aviv earlier this week that Israeli police said was carried out by Palestinians from the West Bank left at least six people dead.

Nimer Fayat, the owner of Dr. Coffee, said the cafe was full with ""regular customers coming to eat and drink"" when the strike occurred around 10:15 p.m.

""What happened was a very strong blow, the likes of which we had not seen in the past since the Al-Aqsa Intifada,"" he said, using a Palestinian term for the second intifada, or uprising, in the early 2000s.

Paramedics rushing to the area encountered a ghastly scene, with body parts flung onto power lines by the force of the blast, said Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent, whose teams brought nine dead to the hospital.

A full list of the dead and wounded was not immediately released by the Palestinian Health Ministry.

Yasser Jibra, another relative of the Abu Zahras, said the strike was ""like a lightning bolt.""

""Look around, the destruction is so obvious,"" he said, adding that it was difficult to identify the bodies of his loved ones.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on civilian deaths in the strike. Israel says it takes care to guard against such deaths.

But to Jibra, that means little.

""This is the work of the criminal occupation, which does not take into account the presence of a child or a woman, or an elderly or young person,"" he said, as he stood inside the blasted-out cafe. ""Everything is permissible for them.""

"For Pittsburgh Jews, attack anniversary adds to an already grim October",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/pittsburgh-synagogue-shooting-antisemitism-israel-hamas-f6249df99d8a508ce2f5cfc1508656e7,2024-10-04T11:37:25Z,"PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Jewish communities everywhere reacted with horror at last year's Oct. 7 attack by Hamas on Israel, but the approaching one-year commemoration of the assault hits home particularly hard in Pittsburgh's Jewish community, which already marks a grim anniversary each October.

It was here on Oct. 27, 2018, that a gunman carried out the deadliest antisemitic attack in U.S. history, killing 11 worshippers from three congregations at the Tree of Life synagogue.

Adding to the intense feelings is the arrival of the Jewish High Holy Days -- days that bracket the Oct. 7 anniversary with rituals focused on mortality and recalling the deaths of loved ones and ancient martyrs. Many are taking consolation in the rituals as they mark an emotionally fraught milestone.

""The trauma here runs deep in our community,"" said Rabbi Seth Adelson of Congregation Beth Shalom, a Conservative synagogue near Tree of Life in the Squirrel Hill neighborhood, the heart of Jewish Pittsburgh. ""You can't really separate the trauma of Jews being attacked in Pittsburgh and Jews being attacked in Israel.""

The attacks do have differences.

The Pittsburgh attack was carried out by a right-wing extremist who targeted Jews for their aid to immigrants. It was followed by widespread civic support for the Jewish community.

The Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023, killed 1,200 Israelis and triggered a still-ongoing war in Gaza, whose health ministry says Israel has killed more than 41,500 Palestinians and wounded more than 96,000 others. Israel is now intensifying attacks on Hamas ally Hezbollah with deadly attacks in Lebanon, while Iran has attacked Israel with missiles.

The attacks have common threads, say local Jewish leaders. The synagogue attack violated the sanctuary of a place of worship. The Hamas attack has been followed by an upsurge of antisemitic incidents around the world.

""The similarity of what Oct. 7 and Oct. 27 hold together is a question of safety for Jews,"" said Maggie Feinstein, director of the 10.27 Healing Partnership, which aids those traumatized by the 2018 attack.

Emboldened far-right extremists have been spreading Holocaust denial and other antisemitic screeds. Some on the left have expressed antisemitism along with criticism of Israel's conduct of the war, while debate persists over the line between robust criticism and hate speech.

Nationally, nearly two-thirds of Jews feel less secure than they did a year previously, according to an American Jewish Committee survey earlier this year.

In Pittsburgh, a man was charged in September for allegedly attacking two university students wearing yarmulkes, the skullcap worn by observant Jews.

A synagogue and the Jewish Federation of Greater Pittsburgh office were targeted with graffiti. Parents of Jewish college students say their children have endured antisemitism amid protests critical of Israel.

Rabbi Daniel Yolkut of Congregation Poale Zedeck in Squirrel Hill said it's become ""unremarkable"" for his children to hear antisemitic slurs shouted by motorists.

Rabbi Adelson said that unlike in 2018, local Jews haven't felt widespread community solidarity.

""There's this feeling that Israel was attacked and then the attacks just continued here,"" he said.

Many in Pittsburgh have lived in Israel or have friends or relatives there. For Yolkut, one connection is especially poignant.

As a rabbi in Virginia years ago, his congregants included the family of Hersh Goldberg-Polin, who in 2023 was taken hostage by Hamas.

""I remember him just as a small child running around my synagogue,"" Yolkut recalled. He was devastated to learn weeks ago that Goldberg-Polin was killed by Hamas at age 23, along with five other hostages.

As Oct. 7 approaches, Feinstein said Pittsburgh Jews are already familiar with the ""anniversary effect"" -- the emotional churn around a traumatic calendar date. Each year since 2019, the community has held memorial services honoring the 11 lives lost on 10/27, as the synagogue attack is known locally.

She reminds people that emotions around anniversaries are natural: ""Whatever we're feeling, we shouldn't feel shame.""

Members of all three congregations worshipping at Tree of Life were killed that Sabbath morning in 2018 -- the host congregation, Dor Hadash and New Light.

News of last year's Hamas raid arrived on another Sabbath, just weeks after the conclusion of a lengthy federal trial in which the Pittsburgh assailant was sentenced to death on 63 criminal counts.

That trial confirmed in previously unknown detail how the gunman absorbed white supremacist ideology online and spread the slander that Jews were bringing in immigrants of color to replace white Americans. He targeted Dor Hadash in particular for its support of a national Jewish agency that helps refugees.

Then came Oct. 7.

""The timing was very difficult because some people had not calmed down from their very high level of anxiety from the trial,"" said Rabbi Amy Bardack of Congregation Dor Hadash. Both attacks raised gut-level questions: ""Are Jews safe in the world?""

The war has worsened divisions on the left. Most U.S. Jews are liberal politically and vote Democratic, but many progressive Democrats have supported Palestinians and say Israel's attacks amount to war crimes and genocide -- charges that Israel and its supporters strenuously dispute.

Some Jewish groups dissent from the broad pro-Zionist consensus of established Jewish groups and oppose U.S. military aid to Israel.

Jewish community members acknowledge broad differences within their families and congregations, though most support Israel as a Jewish state and safe haven for Jews.

""Everybody wants peace,"" Adelson said, ""But there is a strong feeling that Israelis deserve to live in peace and not to be subject to the threats and rocket attacks from Hamas and Hezbollah.""

The disputes have flared locally, such as a recent failed effort by some Pittsburgh organizations to bar the city from doing business with entities linked to Israel.

Rebecca Elhassid now volunteers for the new Beacon Coalition, which researches local politicians' views on Israel and Jews.

Until now, ""we didn't think to understand what a city councilperson thought about the Jewish community they represent,"" she said.

""For many years, we were able to put our Jewish identity aside in terms of our social priorities,"" she said. ""We were able to dedicate much of our social resources toward supporting other marginalized communities and identifying other problems in societies. We are going to have to stand up for ourselves in a way we weren't aware we had to before.""

The danger from the far right was well-known, but antisemitism from parts of the progressive left has hit closer to home.

""All my old colleagues, with whom I've done many things over the years with civil rights and voting rights and gay rights and all kinds of women's rights, and I'm seeing them on the other side of an issue,"" said Tree of Life member Audrey Glickman, a survivor of the 2018 attack. ""That's been personally difficult for me, because it's hard to talk to people when they think you're choosing the wrong side.""

But she's determined to maintain dialogue and has continued to visit schools and other settings, spreading the word against antisemitism and other hatreds.

""If we don't talk to each other, we don't get anywhere,"" she said. ""I always feel more motivated to get our there and pull people together. If you don't keep your optimism going, what good is it?""

The High Holy Days add to the sober commemorations of this season.

""It's in our prayers that we need to understand the precariousness of life and our mortality,"" Bardack said. ""There's also joyful themes, but it's with the understanding that we don't know what the future holds.""

She said her congregation has had hard discussions about the war and Israeli policy. She sees her job as helping congregants navigate the complex moment.

""We can't control the Israel-Hamas war, and we can't control antisemitism,"" she said. ""There's only one thing we can control, which is how we treat each other, how we keep loving and kind connections to each other across differences of ideology.""

"Iranian supreme leader praises missile attack on Israel, says Iran will do it again if necessary",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-missile-strike-khamenei-2bce5479abfdac5fd953d5547d04941c,2024-10-04T10:57:48Z,"TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Iran's supreme leader on Friday praised the country's recent missile strike on Israel and said it was ready to do it again if necessary, state TV reported.

Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in his first appearance as leader at Friday prayers in about five years, called the missile strike a ""shining"" job by Iran's armed forces.

On Tuesday, Iran launched at least 180 missiles at Israel, the latest in a series of rapidly escalating attacks between Israel and Iran and its allies that threaten to push the Middle East closer to a regionwide war. Israel said it intercepted many of the missiles, and officials in Washington said U.S. destroyers assisted in Israel's defense. Iran said most of its missiles hit their targets. There were no immediate reports of casualties.

Khamenei, 80, said in a 40-minute speech to thousands of people at the Mosalla mosque, the main prayer site in Tehran, that the Hamas-led attack on southern Israel nearly a year ago on Oct. 7, 2023, was a legitimate action by the Palestinian people.

He said Tuesday's missile barrage was based on international law, the country's law and Islamic beliefs.

He urged nations from ""Afghanistan to Yemen and from Iran to Gaza and Yemen"" to be ready to take action against the enemy, and praised those who had died doing so.

""Our resisting people in Lebanon and Palestine, you brave fighters, you loyal and patient people, these martyrdoms and the blood that was shed shouldn't shake your determination but make you more persistent,"" he said.

Khamenei gave half of the speech in Arabic as he addressed his comments to Arab nations.

Khamenei's last appearance at Friday prayers was after the death of Revolutionary Guard Gen. Qassem Soleimani, who was killed in 2020 in a U.S. drone strike in Baghdad.

A ceremony commemorating the death of Lebanese Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah was held before Khamenei's speech. Most high-ranking Iranian officials, including President Masoud Pezeshkian and top Revolutionary Guard generals, attended the ceremony.

Iran is Hezbollah's main backer and has sent weapons and billions of dollars to the group.

Also on Friday, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi arrived in Beirut, Lebanon, where he was expected to discuss ongoing fighting between Israel and Hezbollah with Lebanese officials.

Foreign Ministry spokesperson Esmail Baghaei, said Iran sent a shipment of aid to Lebanon, including 10 tons of food and medicine."
"The Nobel Prizes will be announced against a backdrop of wars, famine and artificial intelligence",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/norway-nobel-prizes-peace-wars-c72eac3761a1169356b5c8d32dbe177e,2024-10-04T07:42:57Z,"STAVANGER, Norway (AP) -- Wars, a refugee crisis, famine and artificial intelligence could all be recognized when Nobel Prize announcements begin next week under a shroud of violence.

The prize week coincides with the Oct. 7 anniversary of the Hamas-led attacks on Israel, which began a year of bloodshed and war across the Middle East.

The literature and science prizes could be immune. But the Peace Prize, which recognizes efforts to end conflict, will be awarded in an atmosphere of ratcheting international violence -- if awarded at all.

""I look at the world and see so much conflict, hostility and confrontation, I wonder if this is the year the Nobel Peace Prize should be withheld,"" said Dan Smith, director of the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute.

As well as events roiling the Middle East, Smith cites the war in Sudan and risk of famine there, the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, and his institute's research showing that global military spending is increasing at its fastest pace since World War II.

""It could go to some groups which are making heroic efforts but are marginalized,"" Smith said. ""But the trend is in the wrong direction. Perhaps it would be right to draw attention to that by withholding the peace prize this year.""

Withholding the Nobel Peace is not new. It has been suspended 19 times in the past, including during the world wars. The last time it was not awarded was in 1972.

However, Henrik Urdal, director of the Peace Research Institute Oslo, says withdrawal would be a mistake in 2024, saying the prize is ""arguably more important as a way to promote and recognize important work for peace.""

Civil grassroot groups, and international organizations with missions to mitigate violence in the Middle East could be recognized.

Nominees are kept secret for 50 years, but qualified nominators often publicize their picks. Academics at the Free University Amsterdam said they have nominated the Middle East-based organizations EcoPeace, Women Wage Peace and Women of the Sun for peace efforts between Israelis and Palestinians.

Urdal believes it's possible the committee could consider the Sudan Emergency Response Rooms, a group of grassroots initiatives providing aid to stricken Sudanese facing famine and buffeted by the country's brutal civil war.

The announcements begin Monday with the physiology or medicine prize, followed on subsequent days by the physics, chemistry, literature and peace awards.

The Peace Prize announcement will be made on Friday by the Norwegian Nobel Committee in Oslo, while all the others will be announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm. The prize in economics will be announced the following week on Oct. 14.

New technology, possibly artificial intelligence, could be recognized in one or more of the categories.

Critics of AI warn the rise of autonomous weapons shows the new technology could mean additional peace-shattering misery for many people. Yet AI has also enabled scientific breakthroughs which are tipped for recognition in other categories.

David Pendlebury, head of research analysis at Clarivate's Institute for Scientific Information, says scientists from Google Deepmind, the AI lab, could be among those under consideration for the chemistry prize.

The company's artificial intelligence, AlphaFold ""accurately predicts the structure of proteins,"" and is already widely used in several fields, including medicine, where it could one day be used to develop a breakthrough drug.

Pendlebury spearheads Clarivate's list of scientists whose papers are among the world's most cited, and whose work it says are ripe for Nobel recognition.

""AI will increasingly be a part of the panoply of tools that researchers use,"" Pendlebury said. He said he would be extremely surprised if a discovery ""firmly anchored in AI"" did not win Nobel prizes in the next 10 years."
Middle East latest: An Israeli airstrike cuts a major highway linking Lebanon with Syria,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-4-october-2024-22ce0cdc4813e1f0d657d67868a2da61,2024-10-04T07:02:41Z,"An Israeli airstrike has cut a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria, Lebanon's state-run National News Agency said Friday. The airstrike led to the closure of a road near the Masnaa Border Crossing, from where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks.

On Tuesday, Israel began a ground incursion into Lebanon against the Hezbollah militant group while also conducting strikes in Gaza that killed dozens, including children. The Israeli military said nine soldiers have died in the conflict in southern Lebanon.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across the Lebanon border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, which killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage. Israel declared war on the Hamas militant group in the Gaza Strip in response. More than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon since then, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry.

Here is the latest:

BEIRUT -- Lebanon's state-run National News Agency says an Israeli airstrike has cut a main highway linking Lebanon with Syria.

The agency gave no further details about Friday's airstrike that led to the closure of a road near the Masnaa Border Crossing, from where tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It's the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war.

Lebanese General Security recorded more than 250,000 Syrian citizens and over 80,000 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory during the last week of September, after Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon.

Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles and damaged the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous.

There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state.

Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weapons from Iran via Syria. The Lebanese group has a presence on both sides of the border where it fights alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces.

SYDNEY -- Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Friday condemned the Iranian ambassador's comments praising a recently slain Hezbollah leader, but rejected opposition advice to expel the envoy.

Ambassador Ahmad Sadeghi described Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed by an Israeli missile strike in September in Lebanon, as a ""remarkable leader"" on social media.

""The government condemns any support for terrorist organizations such as Hezbollah. We condemn the ambassador's comments,"" Albanese told reporters in Sydney.

""Australia has maintained a relationship with Iran since 1968 that has been continuous. Not because we agree with the regime, but because it's in Australia's national interest,"" Albanese added.

Opposition leader Peter Dutton, who could become prime minister at elections due by May, called for Sadeghi to be expelled over his post. Dutton described Sadeghi's words as ""completely and utterly at odds with what is in our country's best interests.""

Sadeghi did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Friday.

Australia officially rebuked Sadeghi in August for endorsing Hamas spiritual leader Ahmed Yassin's hope that ""wiping out the Zionist plague out of the holy lands of Palestine happens no later than 2027."""
Israeli airstrikes rock southern suburbs of Beirut and cut off a key crossing into Syria,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mideast-wars-lebanon-hezbollah-hamas-4-october-2024-5f2e512d5334b6f7fd7f5a46400e6979,2024-10-04T06:57:13Z,"BEIRUT (AP) -- Israel carried out a series of massive airstrikes overnight in southern suburbs of Beirut and another that cut off the main border crossing between Lebanon and Syria.

The new wave of strikes came after Israel warned people to evacuate communities in southern Lebanon that are outside a United Nations-declared buffer zone, as the yearlong conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah escalates.

Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon on Tuesday and its forces have been clashing with Hezbollah militants in a narrow strip along the border. A series of attacks before the incursion killed some of the group's key members, including longtime leader Hassan Nasrallah.

The blasts overnight rocked Beirut's southern suburbs, sending huge plumes of smoke and flames into the night sky and shaking buildings kilometers (miles) away in the Lebanese capital. The Israeli military did not immediately comment on what the intended target was, and there was no information immediately available on casualties.

Lebanon's state-run National News Agency reported that there were more than 10 consecutive airstrikes in the area late Thursday.

The agency also reported that an Israeli airstrike led to the closure of the road near the busy Masnaa Border Crossing, from which tens of thousands of people fleeing war in Lebanon have crossed into Syria over the past two weeks. It gave no other details.

The airstrike that cut the busiest border crossing between the two countries came a day after an Israeli military spokesperson said Lebanon's Hezbollah has been trying to transport military equipment through the border crossing.

Hezbollah is believed to have received much of its weaponry from Iran via Syria. The group has a presence on both sides of the border, a region where it has been fighting alongside Syrian President Bashar Assad's forces.

Dama Post, a pro-government Syrian media outlet, said Israeli warplanes fired two missiles, damaging the road between Masnaa Border Crossing in Lebanon and the Syrian crossing point of Jdeidet Yabous.

It was the first time this major border crossing has been cut off since the beginning of the war. Lebanese General Security recorded 256,614 Syrian citizens and 82,264 Lebanese citizens crossing into Syrian territory between Sept. 23 -- when the Israel launched a heavy bombardment of southern and eastern Lebanon -- and Sept. 30.

There are half a dozen border crossings between the two countries and most of them remain open. Lebanon's minister of public works said all border crossings between Lebanon and Syria work under the supervision of the state.

Israel and Hezbollah have traded fire across Lebanon's southern border almost daily since the day after Hamas' cross-border attack on Oct. 7, 2023, in which the militants killed 1,200 Israelis and took 250 others hostage.

Meanwhile, the Israeli army said it carried out a strike Thursday in Tulkarem, a militant stronghold in the West Bank, in coordination with the Shin Bet internal security service.

The Palestinian Health Ministry said 18 people were killed in an Israeli strike on a refugee camp there.

Violence has flared across the Israeli-occupied territory since the Israel-Hamas war erupted in October 2023. Tulkarem and other northern cities have seen some of the worst violence.

Israel declared war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip in response to their Oct. 7 attack. More than 41,000 Palestinians have since been killed in the territory, and just over half the dead have been women and children, according to local health officials. Nearly 2,000 people have been killed in Lebanon in that time, most of them since Sept. 23, according to the Lebanese Health Ministry."
Tunisia votes Sunday in its third presidential election since the Arab Spring,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/tunisia-presidential-election-kais-saied-9cb6593c3154b0e9a32131d1afe6d118,2024-10-04T05:34:16Z,"TUNIS, Tunisia (AP) -- With his major opponents imprisoned or left off the ballot, Tunisian President Kais Saied faces few obstacles to winning reelection on Sunday, five years after riding anti-establishment backlash to a first term.

The North African country's Oct. 6 presidential election is its third since protests led to the 2011 ouster of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali -- the first autocrat toppled in the Arab Spring uprisings that also overthrew leaders in Egypt, Libya and Yemen.

International observers praised the previous two contests as meeting democratic norms. However, a raft of arrests and actions taken by a Saied-appointed election authority have raised questions about whether this year's race is free and fair. And opposition parties have called for a boycott.

Not long ago, Tunisia was hailed as the Arab Spring's only success story. As coups, counter-revolutions and civil wars convulsed the region, the North African nation enshrined a new democratic constitution and saw its leading civil society groups win the Nobel Peace Prize for brokering political compromise.

But its new leaders were unable to buoy its struggling economy and were plagued by political infighting and episodes of violence and terrorism.

Amid that backdrop, Saied, then 61 and a political outsider, won his first term in 2019. He advanced to a runoff promising to usher in a ""New Tunisia"" and hand more power to young people and local governments.

This year's election will offer a window into popular opinion about the trajectory that Tunisia's fading democracy has taken since Saied took office.

Saied's supporters appear to have remained loyal to him and his promise to transform Tunisia. But he isn't affiliated with any political party, and it's unclear just how deep his support runs among Tunisians.

It's the first presidential race since Saied upended the country's politics in July 2021, declaring a state of emergency, sacking his prime minister, suspending the parliament and rewriting Tunisia's constitution consolidating his own power.

Those actions outraged pro-democracy groups and leading opposition parties, who called them a coup. Yet despite anger from career politicians, voters approved Saied's new constitution the following year in a low-turnout referendum.

Authorities subsequently began arresting Saied's critics including journalists, lawyers, politicians and civil society figures, charging them with endangering state security and violating a controversial anti-fake news law that observers argue stifles dissent.

Fewer voters turned out to participate in parliamentary and local elections in 2022 and 2023 amid economic woes and widespread political apathy.

Many wanted to challenge Saied, but few were able to.

Seventeen potential candidates filed paperwork to run and Tunisia's election authority approved only three: Saied, Zouhair Maghzaoui and Ayachi Zammel.

Maghzaoui is a veteran politician who has campaigned against Saied's economic program and recent political arrests. Still, he is loathed by opposition parties for backing Saied's constitution and earlier moves to consolidate power.

Zammel is a businessman supported by politicians not boycotting the race. During the campaign, he has been sentenced to prison time in four voter fraud cases related to signatures his team gathered to qualify for the ballot.

Others had hoped to run but were prevented. The election authority, known as ISIE, last month dismissed a court ruling ordering it to reinstate three additional challengers.

With many arrested, detained or convicted on charges related to their political activities, Tunisia's most well-known opposition figures are also not participating.

That includes the 83-year-old leader of Tunisia's most well organized political party Ennahda, which rose to power after the Arab Spring. Rached Ghannouchi, the Islamist party's co-founder and Tunisia's former house speaker, has been imprisoned since last year after criticizing Saied.

The crackdown also includes one of Ghannouchi's most vocal detractors: Abir Moussi, a right-wing lawmaker known for railing against Islamists and speaking nostalgically for pre-Arab Spring Tunisia. The 49-year-old president of the Free Destourian Party also was imprisoned last year after criticizing Saied.

Other less known politicians who announced plans to run have also since been jailed or sentenced on similar charges.

Opposition groups have called to boycott the race. The National Salvation Front -- a coalition of secular and Islamist parties including Ennahda -- has denounced the process as a sham and questioned the election's legitimacy.

The country's economy continues to face major challenges. Despite Saied's promises to chart a new course for Tunisia, unemployment has steadily increased to one of the region's highest at 16%, with young Tunisians hit particularly hard.

Growth has been slow since the COVID-19 pandemic and Tunisia has remained reliant on multilateral lenders such as the World Bank and the European Union. Today, Tunisia owes them more than $9 billion. Apart from agricultural reform, Saied's overarching economic strategy is unclear.

Negotiations have long been stalled over a $1.9 billion bailout package offered by the International Monetary Fund in 2022. Saied has been unwilling to accept its conditions, which include restructuring indebted state-owned companies and cutting public wages. Some of the IMF's stipulations -- including lifting subsidies for electricity, flour and fuel -- would likely be unpopular among Tunisians who rely on their low costs.

Economic analysts say that foreign and local investors are reluctant to invest in Tunisia due to continued political risks and an absence of reassurances.

The dire economic straits have had a two-pronged effect on one of Tunisia's key political issues: migration. From 2019 to 2023, an increasing number of Tunisians attempted to migrate to Europe without authorization. Meanwhile, Saied's administration has taken a harsh approach against migrants arriving from sub-Saharan Africa, many who have found themselves stuck in Tunisia while trying to reach Europe.

Saied energized his supporters in early 2023 by accusing migrants of violence and crime and portraying them as part of a plot to change the country's demography. The anti-migrant rhetoric prompted extreme violence against migrants and a crackdown from authorities. Last year, security forces targeted migrant communities from the coast to the capital with a series of arrests, deportation to the desert and the demolition of tent camps in Tunis and coastal towns.

Bodies continue to wash ashore on Tunisia's coastline as boats carrying Tunisians and migrants from sub-Saharan Africa manage only to make it a few nautical miles before sinking.

Tunisia has maintained ties with its traditional Western allies but also forged new partnerships under Saied.

Much like many populist leaders who've taken power worldwide, Saied emphasizes sovereignty and freeing Tunisia from what he calls ""foreign diktats."" He has insisted that Tunisia won't become a ""border guard"" for Europe, which has sought agreements with him to better police the Mediterranean.

Tunisia and Iran lifted visa requirements and in May announced plans to boost trade ties. It has also accepted millions in loans as part of China's Belt and Road Initiative to build hospitals, stadiums and ports.

Yet European countries remain Tunisia's top trade partners and their leaders have maintained productive ties with Saied, hailing agreements to manage migration as a ""model"" for the region.

Saied has spoken ardently in support of Palestinians as war has swept the Middle East and opposes moves made to normalize diplomatic ties with Israel."
"A year later, Israeli survivors reflect on the lingering toll of Oct. 7",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-palestinians-gaza-war-anniversary-survivors-fb65aa677e344a873566dc948d6bf52a,2024-10-04T04:38:08Z,"Lilach Almog walks past the remains of a police station seized by Hamas militants and buildings pockmarked by bullets in her southern Israeli town multiple times a day.

""Every corner has become a memorial,"" she said. ""Even if you want to forget for a bit, you can't. You look outside at the wall and it reminds you of everything all over again.""

Almog joined the roughly 120,000 Israelis displaced by the Israel-Hamas war but has returned home to constant reminders of the Oct. 7, 2023, attack.

A year later, survivors reflect on that day that changed everything. They hid in bedrooms, bomb shelters, safe rooms and beneath trees as Hamas militants poured across the border. In the aftermath, they've mourned loved ones, struggled with anxiety, suffered survivor's guilt and questioned whether they will ever return home to places that still bear the scars of their ordeal.

The force of a blast at the police station across from her apartment building knocked Almog off her feet on Oct. 7.

She had scrambled to her home's fortified room after air raid sirens sounded in Sderot and watched from the window in disbelief as dozens of gunmen walked down her street with rocket-propelled grenades on their shoulders.

They seized the police station, and a dayslong battle raged before the Israeli military bulldozed the building with militants still inside. More than 30 civilians and police officers were killed in the area around the station.

Almog fled Sderot with her children and mother, living in a hotel in Tel Aviv for eight months, but government assistance ran out in August, forcing her to return to Sderot and memories of that day, when Hamas-led militants killed some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and took about 250 hostage.

The resulting war has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians but says more than half were women and children.

The anxiety of the past year has overwhelmed her, forcing her to leave her work as an architect and interior designer and go on disability leave. Her 9-year-old son began wetting the bed. Her 11-year-old daughter refuses to go anywhere without her.

""As long as the war is still continuing, there's no way to feel calm, to return to our lives,"" she said. ""We still have the hostages there. We still have nightmares. There's no end.""

When Ziv Abud spotted the bomb shelter on the side of the road as she was trying to escape the attack on the Nova music festival, she breathed a sigh of relief, thinking it would be a safe place to wait out the rockets.

""We know now that the shelter we went into was basically going into a death trap,"" she said.

Nearly 30 people had crammed into the concrete shelter meant to hold about 10. When Hamas militants arrived, they started tossing grenades inside.

A former soldier was able to toss out eight grenades, but the ninth exploded inside the shelter, instantly killing about half the people, Abud said. In the smoke and chaos, militants grabbed people to take as hostages and sprayed the shelter with bullets.

Abud survived, protected by the crush of bodies above her. When she opened her eyes, she saw the bodies of her nephew and his girlfriend but no trace of her boyfriend, Eliya Cohen. Four people, including Israeli-American Hersh Goldberg-Polin, were kidnapped, and six others survived.

Over the past year, Abud has campaigned tirelessly for the hostages and flown around the world to press for Cohen's return.

""I think less about my own trauma, just how to bring Eliyah home,"" she said.

Shlomo and Hanna'le Margalit still struggle to comprehend how they survived.

All of the residents on both sides of their home in Kibbutz Nir Oz were killed or kidnapped on Oct. 7. Hamas militants entered their home three times but did not go into the safe room where they were hiding.

Of Nir Oz's nearly 400 residents, 42 were killed and 75 were kidnapped that day. But the couple, part of the founding generation on the kibbutz, was spared.

The Margalits have been married for 64 years and lived in Nir Oz nearly all that time, working to transform the barren desert into a village filled with towering trees and green lawns. The kibbutz was devastated by the attack and will take years to rebuild, though questions remain about how -- or even if -- it should be.

Like most of the residents of Nir Oz, the couple is living in temporary housing, a development of new apartment buildings about an hour northeast.

""I still can't think about what was lost. I think for me that will happen much later,"" Hanna'le Margalit said. ""Right now, all the energy and our work is for survival, to get used to a new place, to hope the hostages will come home.""

Shlomo Margalit returns to the kibbutz about once a week to care for the cemetery, a job he held before Oct. 7. But now many graves have been added. Each time he is there, he chooses one person and goes to their ruined house to properly bid them farewell.

""It's too many to do all at once,"" he said. ""It's too sad and too hard. It's impossible.""

Eilat Shalev remembers that the pomelos -- large citrus fruits -- were about to be harvested a few days after Oct. 7 in southern Israel.

She knows that because farmers had already set out large collection bins, which she hid behind as Hamas militants overran the road leading to the Nova music festival, where she had been dancing with her husband, Shai.

The two got separated as militants began shooting at their car. Shalev ran toward nearby fields, jumping in and out of vehicles, until she found herself near a pomelo orchard.

""I grabbed the first tree I saw on the left side. I hid with my hands on my head and my face in the earth, just praying to God that God will rescue me so I will live and return to my kids,"" she said.

Minutes later, a bullet hit just centimeters from her head. She played dead for hours before making her way back to the road. Eventually, Israeli security forces brought her to a police station. As the hours passed and her husband didn't make contact, she grew increasingly worried. He was pronounced dead five days later.

Shalev said she and her four children, ages 12 to 23, have turned to Judaism for comfort. But she has trouble sleeping at night and struggles to run her household alone.

""As the days go by, one day and another day and another day, it's actually getting worse. It doesn't get better,"" Shalev said. ""Missing him gets stronger because you understand more and more that he's not coming back. He's really not coming back.""

After 54 days in captivity in Gaza, Liat Atzili was determined to return to her work as a high school history and civics teacher to wrest back control of her identity.

""I feel most comfortable and most at ease, and it's the thing that comes the most naturally for me to be in a classroom,"" she said. ""It's a real connection to what I used to be like and what my life was before.""

She counts herself lucky to have been held in an apartment in conditions much better than the hostages kept in underground tunnels. Still, during her captivity, Atzili had no idea whether her family had survived.

The day after her release as part of a November cease-fire deal, the Israeli military announced that her husband, Aviv, had been killed and his body was being held in Gaza. Two of her three children were on the kibbutz, and both survived.

The upcoming anniversary is more difficult than Atzili anticipated, a milestone for how much she has lost over the past year. On Oct. 7, she plans for at least part of the day to stay in bed and watch ""Dirty Dancing.""

Next month, Atzili hopes to return to one of her passions, giving tours at Yad Vashem, Israel's Holocaust Museum. She understands the parallels people want to draw between the Holocaust and what happened to her, but the reality in the Middle East is different, she said.

""The Israeli Jews sort of wish that the Palestinians disappeared, and the Palestinians sort of wish that the Jews disappeared, but that's not going to happen,"" she said. ""Nobody's going anywhere. We don't have to love each other, but we have to get along, and we have to find a way that everybody can live here in safety."""
FIFA opts not to suspend Israel but will investigate Palestinian claims of discrimination,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/fifa-israel-palestinian-soccer-5b78239c70c568877c89695e2dcd0721,2024-10-03T16:15:19Z,"ZURICH (AP) -- FIFA stopped short of suspending the Israeli soccer federation on Thursday, but asked for a disciplinary investigation of possible discrimination alleged by Palestinian soccer officials.

A senior FIFA panel overseeing governance will separately investigate ""the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine,"" soccer's governing body said after a meeting of its ruling Council.

The Palestinian soccer federation has consistently asked FIFA for more than a decade to take action against the Israeli soccer body for incorporating teams from West Bank settlements in its leagues.

The compromise decisions came more than four months after Palestinian officials had urged FIFA to suspend Israel's membership at a meeting in May.

The request to FIFA's congress in May also cited ""international law violations"" in Gaza during the Israel-Hamas conflict and directed the soccer body to its statutory commitments on human rights and against discrimination.

FIFA delayed making a decision in May until after a legal review scheduled for July, then pushed back the issue two more times until the meeting Thursday.

""The FIFA Council has implemented due diligence on this very sensitive matter and, based on a thorough assessment, we have followed the advice of the independent experts,"" FIFA president Gianni Infantino said in a statement.

The latest process follows a pattern -- under Infantino and his predecessor Sepp Blatter -- of Palestinian requests for FIFA to uphold its legal statutes and the question then being steered toward ad hoc panels and other committees.

FIFA gave no timetable Thursday for the investigations it has not requested."
"In time for Oct. 7 anniversary, a new film documents Hamas' attack on Israel music festival",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-gaza-nova-film-massacre-60e0f57009f10065a5ce556e5c97feeb,2024-10-03T15:41:04Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Horror came with sunrise following an all-night rave near the Gaza border on Oct. 7, 2023, the Hamas attack presaged by rockets that some young people mistakenly thought were fireworks.

A new documentary shows the attack unfold over the next hours in stomach-churning detail: Gunmen mowing down passengers in cars that try to escape. Hiding in a garbage dumpster, or a refrigerator, to avoid detection. Live grenades tossed into a bunker, then thrown out seconds before exploding. Terrified hostages carried away to an uncertain fate.

Veteran news producer Susan Zirinsky calls ""We Will Dance Again"" the most significant project she's ever worked on, notable praise considering her ""9/11"" film is arguably the best video document of that day.

How much it is seen, however, may depend as much on context as content.

The film is now streaming on the Paramount+ service and debuted last weekend on Showtime, in advance of the attack's one-year anniversary. Distributors acknowledge, however, that it has been a hard sell in markets across the world: many potential outlets and film festivals did not want to wade into a hot-button political issue with war in the Mideast grinding on.

A message at the film's beginning acknowledges that the human cost of the Oct. 7 massacre and the war that followed in Gaza ""has been catastrophic for both Israelis and Palestinians"" and lists the death toll on both sides. ""This film cannot tell everyone's story,"" it says.

The message does not appear, however, when ""We Will Dance Again"" is screened in Israel.

""We are documenting a moment in history,"" Zirinsky said. ""This is not a political film. This happened.""

The former CBS News president is now chief of See It Now Studios and, with colleague Terence Wrong, has made a specialty of filmed recountings of major events, like the ""11 Minutes"" series about the 2017 mass shooting at a country music concert in Las Vegas. With cameras in everyone's pocket, there's a rich trove of raw material to bring these stories to life.

She was keenly interested when she learned of Israeli director Yariv Mozer, a former Israeli soldier who grabbed a camera and was one of the first non-officials given access to the scene. The haunting pictures of the hellscape he found illuminate the film's opening moments. What Mozer had already completed didn't need a lot of work, she said.

Mozer weaves an intimate story of that morning through interviews with survivors and cellphone video many had saved. One of his executive producers also acquired material taken by Hamas fighters later killed. ""She didn't tell me how and I didn't ask,"" he said.

That access enabled the scene of the grenades tossed back and forth, almost a cartoonish sequence if the explosions didn't illustrate the life-and-death consequences.

The killings that day weren't confined to the concert site. But Mozer quickly determined he wanted to concentrate his film on the people who were there.

""They were beautiful, young, young in spirit,"" he said. ""Naive in a way.""

The film is graphic and obviously not easy to watch. Zirinsky and Wrong had arguments over how much could be shown; there are a handful of spots where the picture is blurred out, in some cases to avoid showing expressions on the faces of victims. Critic Jacqueline Cutler wrote in The Daily Beast: ""There is no sugarcoating this. 'We Will Dance Again' is the most harrowing documentary I have ever seen.""

Although the film is being offered on a streaming service and premium cable network in the U.S., getting exposure in the rest of the world has not been easy. Distributors made a deal to show it on the BBC, on the condition that it not describe Hamas as a terrorist organization.

Several film festivals rejected ""We Will Dance Again,"" in part because they worried about political fallout, and the rushed effort to make it publicly available for the first anniversary meant some deadlines were missed, said Michael Schmidt, president of the Sipur, an Israel-based studio that has worked on the project.

Its only film festival appearance was in New Zealand, said Schmidt, who would not name the festivals that had rejected it.

One European buyer expressed interest but said it needed to be approved by its board. That was the last he heard from them. Some interested in showing the film wanted changes to reflect a Palestinian point of view, or required that it be aired together with a Palestinian documentary, he said.

Streaming services, which unlike many cable television networks have a direct-to-consumer subscriber relationship, were particularly reluctant to get involved, Schmidt said. Again, he would not specify who rejected the film.

The goal wasn't to create a political controversy, but to document a moment in history. ""We are in this for the long game,"" he said.

See It Now is open to projects that approach the war in Gaza from a Palestinian point of view, and has already taken some pitches. ""Our only qualification is that it's excellent,"" Wrong said.

The company has resisted outreach from Israeli groups, including one effort by the Israeli foreign ministry to show the film at the United Nations, Zirinsky said. The idea is to avoid any appearance that the work could be used as a propaganda film.

Despite the complications involved, she said, ""I am very happy that we stood up to do this.""

Toward the end of the film, one of the survivors says friends lost that day that ""I'm hoping that wherever they are, they're partying like crazy. And one day, we will, too.""

Such a day seemed in the distant future for Eitan Halley, one of the survivors interviewed who attended a recent screening of the film in New York. He said he's determined that the truth of what happened that day get out, particularly when conspiracy theories suggest it didn't happen. He admitted to his emotional struggles, including survivor's guilt. Zirinsky suggested keeping the memories alive serve an important purpose.

"Palestinian, Filipino and Mozambican activists and a London research agency given human rights award",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/right-livelihood-award-palestinian-territories-philippines-mozambique-b697fdc373c6c5408ef511ab0884644f,2024-10-03T06:37:22Z,"STOCKHOLM (AP) -- The Right Livelihood Award was awarded Thursday to three activists from the Palestinian territories, the Philippines and Mozambique and to a U.K. pioneering research agency who ""have each made a profound impact on their communities and the global stage.""

""Their unwavering commitment to speaking out against forces of oppression and exploitation, while strictly adhering to non-violent methods, resonates far beyond their communities,"" the Stockholm-based foundation said about the laureates. It considered 176 nominees from 72 countries this year.

Issa Amro, a human rights activist in the occupied West Bank and his group, Youth Against Settlements, were awarded the prize ""for their steadfast non-violent resistance to Israel's illegal occupation, promoting Palestinian civic action through peaceful means.""

In the Philippines, Indigenous activist Joan Carling was cited ""for raising Indigenous voices in the face of the global ecological breakdown and her leadership in defending people, lands and culture.""

Anabela Lemos, a Mozambican environmental activist and director of Justiça Ambiental!, was honored for ""empowering communities to stand up for their right to say no to exploitative mega-projects and demand environmental justice."" It is the first time the award went to Mozambique.

Based at University of London, Forensic Architecture was cited ""for pioneering digital forensic methods to ensure justice and accountability for victims and survivors of human and environmental rights violations.""

Created in 1980, the annual Right Livelihood Award honors efforts that the prize founder, Swedish-German philanthropist Jakob von Uexkull, felt were being ignored by the Nobel Prizes. To date, 198 laureates from 77 countries have received the distinction.

""The 2024 laureates demonstrate the power of non-violent resistance and truth-telling, placing decision-making into the hands of local communities,"" said Ole von Uexkull, the nephew of the prize founder and the organization's executive director.

Previous winners include Ukrainian human rights defender Oleksandra Matviichuk, Congolese surgeon Denis Mukwege and Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg. Matviichuk and Mukwege received the Nobel Peace Prize in 2022 and 2018, respectively.

The 2024 laureates will be given their awards on Dec. 4 in Stockholm. The size of the prize amount was not announced. The foundation said that ""the award comes with long-term support to highlight and expand laureates' work."""
UN calls Israel's ban on its top leader a political statement in long-running rift,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/united-nations-israel-secretary-general-guterres-a929dda6e7c211cf3c2c8277dd88dffe,2024-10-02T20:53:42Z,"UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations on Wednesday called Israel's ban on Secretary-General Antonio Guterres entering the country a political statement by its foreign minister and stressed that the world body's contacts with Israel will continue ""because they have to.""

U.N. spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters that Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz deeming the U.N. chief ""persona non grata"" is also ""one more attack on the United Nations staff that we've seen from the government of Israel.""

Israel's accusations of U.N. bias and antisemitism date back decades, but the rift has intensified since Hamas' Oct. 7 attacks in the country's south killed about 1,200 people and launched the war in Gaza. Israel's offensive against the militant group has killed over 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not say how many were fighters but that a little more than half were women and children.

An Israeli ground incursion in Lebanon and other attacks against Hezbollah, a Lebanese militant group also backed by Iran, and an Iranian missile strike against Israel on Tuesday have threatened to plunge the Middle East into all-out war. The U.N. Security Council held an emergency meeting Wednesday on the Middle East.

Guterres didn't respond to a question about the ban as he headed to the meeting, where he demanded a halt to the escalation of ""tit-for-tat violence"" that he warned is leading people in the Middle East ""straight over the cliff.""

Earlier in the day, Katz accused Guterres of being biased against Israel and claimed the U.N. chief never condemned the Hamas attacks and sexual violence committed by its fighters.

Dujarric strongly disagreed, saying Guterres has condemned ""over and over again the terror attacks, the acts of sexual violence and other horrors that we've seen.""

But the Israeli government strongly objected to the secretary-general's phrase in his initial condemnation that said Hamas' attack didn't happen ""in a vacuum.""

Israel also has accused staff from the U.N. agency helping Palestinian refugees, called UNRWA -- the key provider of assistance in Gaza, of being Hamas members and participating in the Oct. 7 attacks and has curtailed their activities.

The U.N.'s internal watchdog has been investigating those Israeli allegations. UNRWA said Monday that a top Hamas commander killed in Lebanon was an employee who had been suspended since allegations of his ties to the militant group emerged in March.

UNRWA Commissioner-General Philippe Lazzarini has accused Israel of trying to destroy its operations. The agency provides education, health care, food and other services to several million Palestinians and their families.

Guterres also has accused Israel of ""collective punishment"" of Palestinians in its nearly yearlong military response to the Hamas attacks in Gaza, saying he has not seen so much death and destruction during his seven years as secretary-general.

Dujarric said that in his 24 years at the U.N., there have been U.N. staff declared persona non grata by a country but that he didn't know of a secretary-general being banned.

He stressed that the United Nations has never recognized the concept being applied to U.N. staff.

Under the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, the practice applies to a country declaring a diplomat persona non grata -- not an international organization.

""We continue our contacts with Israel at the operational level and other levels, because we need to,"" Dujarric said."
"Lawyer for keffiyeh-wearing, pro-Palestinian protester questions arrest under local face mask ban",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mask-ban-new-york-arrest-keffiyeh-protest-6c2ed98c3cb79047c35249dcc416d6ec,2024-10-02T18:21:49Z,"HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. (AP) -- A lawyer for a pro-Palestinian protester charged with violating a New York county's face mask ban for wearing a keffiyeh scarf questioned Wednesday whether his client's arrest was justified.

Xavier Roa was merely exercising his constitutionally protected free speech rights as he led others in protest chants last month outside Young Israel of Lawrence-Cedarhurst, an orthodox synagogue near the New York City borough of Queens, attorney Geoffrey Stewart said following Roa's arraignment in Nassau County District Court in Hempstead.

Stewart said the county's Mask Transparency Act, which was signed into law in August, bans mask wearing if police have reasonable suspicion to believe the person was involved in criminal activity or intends to ""intimidate, threaten, abuse, or harass"" anyone.

He questioned whether Roa had been attempting to conceal his identity, as police claim. Stewart noted his client had the Arab scarf draped around his neck and only pulled it over his face shortly before his arrest, meaning he was readily identifiable to officers for much of the demonstration.

Videosshared on social mediashow Roa wearing the keffiyeh around his neck as he's led away by officers in handcuffs.

""By all accounts, he complied and acted respectfully to officers,"" Stewart added.

Nassau County District Attorney Anne Donnelly's office, which is prosecuting the case, declined to comment Wednesday.

Nassau County police, in their complaint filed in court, said Roa acknowledged to officers at the time that he was wearing the scarf in solidarity with Palestinians and not for medical or religious purposes, which are the main exceptions to the new ban.

The 26-year-old North Bellmore resident is due back in court Oct. 17 and faces up to a year in jail and a $1,000 fine if convicted of the misdemeanor charge.

County lawmakers have said they enacted the ban in response to antisemitic incidents since the Oct. 7 start of the Israel-Hamas war.

Roa is the first protester among the handful so far arrested in connection with the new law, which has raised concerns from civil rights groups.

A federal judge last week dismissed a class action lawsuit claiming the ban was unconstitutional and discriminated against people with disabilities. In the ruling, U.S. District Judge Joan Azrack noted the ban exempts people who wear masks for health reasons."
Javier Bardem on Gaza: 'We cannot remain indifferent' in call for hostage release and cease-fire,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/javier-bardem-gaza-israel-c9366d69afd1395c2b09c09415c187ed,2024-10-02T16:15:22Z,"Javier Bardem was no longer comfortable being silent on Gaza.

The Spanish actor spoke out about the Israeli-Hamas conflict upon accepting an award at the San Sebastian Film Festival last week. In his nuanced remarks, Bardem condemned the Hamas attacks as well as the ""massive punishment that the Palestinian population is enduring.""

He called for immediate cease-fire, Hamas' release of hostages and for Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Hamas leaders -- some of whom are now dead -- who ordered the Oct. 7 attacks to be judged by the International Criminal Court.

In an interview with The Associated Press, Bardem explained why he chose to speak out.

""I believe that we can and must help bring peace. If we take a different approach, then we will get different results,"" Bardem told the AP, speaking prior to Iran's attack on Israel Tuesday. ""The security and prosperity of Israel and the health and future of a free Palestine will only be possible through a culture of peace, coexistence and respect.""

Israel's offensive has already killed over 40,000 Palestinians, according to Gaza health officials, displaced the vast majority of Gaza's 2.3 million residents and destroyed much of the impoverished territory. Palestinian militants are still holding some 110 hostages captured in the Oct. 7 attack that started the war, in which they killed around 1,200 people, mostly civilians. Around a third of the 110 are already dead, according to Israeli authorities.

The war has drawn sharp divisions in Hollywood over the past year, where public support of Israel or Palestine has provoked backlash and bullying, with accusations of antisemitism and Islamophobia, and cost people jobs. Even silence has had its consequences. The #blockout2024 movement pressured celebrities who hadn't said anything -- or enough -- to take a stand.

""Why now?"" Bardem said. ""Because to continue to stall negotiations and return to the previous status quo, as they say, or as we are seeing now, embark on a race to further violations of international law would be to perpetuate the war and eventually lead us off a cliff.""

Bardem stressed that while antisemitism and Islamophobia are real and serious problems in the U.S., Europe and beyond, that the terms are being used to divert attention away from the ""legitimate right to criticize the actions of the Israeli government and of Hamas.

""We're witnessing crimes against human rights, crimes under international law, such as, for example, the banning of food, water, medicines, electricity, using, as UNICEF says, war against children and the trauma that's being created for generations,"" Bardem said. ""We cannot remain indifferent to that.""

The Oscar-winner, who was born in the Canary Islands and raised Catholic but no longer practices, has spoken up on global issues before, signing an open letter calling for peace during a 2014 conflict between Israel and Hamas, and a few years earlier speaking to a United Nations committee about refugees in Western Sahara, which he narrated a documentary about. He's also an environmental advocate, and spoke to the UN in 2019 about protecting the oceans.

""My mother educated me on the importance of treating all human beings equally, regardless of skin color, ethnicity, religion, nationality, socio and economic status, ability or sexuality,"" Bardem said. ""Actions inform us and that alone interests me about people. That's why I have always been concerned about discrimination of any kind. That includes antisemitism and Islamophobia.""

Bardem is married to Penélope Cruz, with whom he shares two children.

He said that beyond a fear that the framework of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is in danger, he has seen the effects of the conflict up close and the promise of a different approach. Two of his close friends, one Israeli, one Palestinian, both lost daughters to violence years ago and have bonded together in their shared pain and desire to help create positive change.

Those fathers, Bassam Aramin and Rami Elhanan, are members of a nonprofit organization called The Parents Circle Families Forum that emphasizes reconciliation. They wrote a letter that Bardem shared: ""What happened to us is like nuclear energy. You can use it for more destruction. Or you can use it to bring light. Losing your daughter is painful in both situations. But we love our life. We want to exist. So we use this pain to support change. To build bridges, not to dig graves.""

Bardem added: ""That's what it should be about: Building bridges, not digging graves. That's why it's urgent and important."""
Republicans are more likely than Democrats to see Israel as a US ally: AP-NORC poll,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-hezbollah-iran-20b070612a8a76ee1d4d6c47864a2355,2024-10-02T04:13:57Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- After a year of war between Israel and Hamas, U.S. public opinion on the conflict remains polarized, a new survey by the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research finds, with Democrats more likely to be critical of Israel, while Republicans remain more supportive.

There are a few points of relative consensus -- about half of U.S. adults, for example, say Hamas bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war, while about one quarter says it has ""some"" responsibility and about 2 in 10 say it has ""not much"" responsibility or ""none at all.""

But U.S. adults remain divided on the extent to which the Israeli government is responsible for the conflict continuing. And the findings indicate that the past year of war hasn't done much to widen or narrow the partisan gulf that existed early in the conflict.

Democrats remain more sympathetic toward the Palestinians than Republicans and more critical of Israel, while Republicans are more likely to sympathize with the Israelis and view Israel as a U.S. ally that shares the United States' values and interests.

However, it's unclear from this survey if public opinion will shift as the war in the Middle East expands beyond Gaza. It was conducted from Sept. 12 to 16, before Israel's military significantly escalated its operations against Hezbollah in Lebanon and before Iran launched missiles at Israel on Tuesday. Hamas, based in Gaza, and Hezbollah, based in Lebanon, are militant groups allied with Iran.

President Joe Biden has maintained crucial U.S. military support to Israel throughout the Gaza war, while repeatedly trying -- and failing -- to broker a cease-fire. Americans are most likely to place ""a lot"" of blame on Hamas for the continuation of the war between Israel and the militant group, followed by the Israeli government, and the Iranian government and groups backed by Iran.

They place much less responsibility on their own country. Only about 1 in 10 Americans say the U.S. government bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war between Israel and Hamas, while about 4 in 10 say it bears ""some"" responsibility, and 45% say the U.S. bears ""not much"" or no responsibility at all.

Democrats are slightly more likely than Republicans to say the U.S. has ""some"" responsibility, but overall the partisan differences on this question are small.

Brian Grider, a 48-year-old Republican from Moscow, Ohio, isn't sure how the U.S. could defuse the conflict.

""I don't know if there's anything we can do,"" he said. ""It would be nice if we could and we might want to try, but is it going to work? Probably not.""

The year of fighting appears to have calcified the partisan divide on the war and the U.S. relationship with Israel.

About half of Republicans view Israel as an ally of the U.S. that shares its values and interests, while about half of Democrats think Israel is a partner that the U.S. should cooperate with but that doesn't share American values and interests.

More than half of Democrats also say the Israeli government bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war, compared to about 4 in 10 Republicans.

Brian Becker, a 49-year-old Democrat in Colorado, says his views of the war shifted after hearing more on social media about Palestinians and Palestinian Americans who were harmed by the war.

""I didn't feel like that was fair for them,"" Becker said. ""So that did start to change my mind a little bit, started to give that waver of support to Palestine,"" he said. ""Where before I probably would have been just, 'Yeah, go Israel.""'

On the other hand, about half of Republicans say they sympathize more with the Israelis than the Palestinians, while Democrats are more likely to say they sympathize with both groups equally.

Grider, the Ohio Republican, thinks Israel responded appropriately to the Oct. 7 attack, comparing it to the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks in the U.S.

""I definitely don't think Israel is doing too much in response to what happened to them,"" he said.

Views of the Israel-Hamas conflict, and the U.S. role in mediating it, haven't shifted much over the course of the year.

Support for the establishment of an independent Palestinian state rose slightly, from around 2 in 10 in August 2023 to about 3 in 10 now. (About half of Americans currently say they neither favor nor oppose an independent Palestinian state, and about 2 in 10 are opposed.) There was also a slight uptick in the share of Americans who think the U.S. is too supportive of Israel.

But about 4 in 10 U.S. adults continue to say the U.S. is spending ""too much"" on military aid to Israel in the war, while a similar share say the U.S. is spending ""the right amount."" About 1 in 10 say the U.S. is spending ""too little,"" which is in line with an AP-NORC poll conducted in early 2024.

The mix of U.S. opinions on the Gaza war reflects the complexity of a conflict where Americans may see bad actors and innocent victims on both sides, according to Paul Poast, a political scientist at the University of Chicago and a research affiliate of the Pearson Institute.

""This leads to people having very strong views on both sides, which, of course, we've seen,"" Poast said. And it doesn't, he added, make for ""a consistent narrative of, 'We've got to support Israel,' or 'We've got to support the Palestinians.'""

Hamas killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7 and took hostages, some of whom are still being held in Gaza. Israel's military campaign in Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians. Gaza health officials do not distinguish between civilians and combatants in their death toll but say many of those killed are women and children.

Charles Jolivette, a 42-year-old Democrat in New Orleans who developed concerns about Israel's offensive through discussions with friends and colleagues who have Palestinian heritage, has observed a kind of echo-chamber effect, where people on the different sides of the issue seem to only hear views that reflect their own beliefs.

""But I would love to have some more,"" Jolivette said, referring to exchanges of view with people who see the conflict differently. And for ""not only mainstream media, but the mainstream American populace, to have that ability to have these real conversations.""

The poll of 1,111 adults was conducted using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for all respondents is plus or minus 3.95 percentage points."
Palestinians in West Bank risk crossing Israel's separation barrier to flee failing economy,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jobs-palestinians-israel-barrier-economy-west-bank-2971f01fd6fd878399911cef00bfa087,2024-10-02T04:13:51Z,"YATTA, West Bank (AP) -- At dawn in mid-May, Sayyed Ayyed and dozens of other unemployed Palestinian men gathered at the foot of the towering wall of concrete and barbed wire dividing the occupied West Bank from Israel.

A smuggler was there with a ladder and ropes. Each man handed over the equivalent of $100. Ayyed waited his turn as others clambered over.

The 30-year-old father of two young daughters hadn't found work for a year. Debts were mounting. Rent had to be paid. On the Israeli side, there was the lure of work on a construction site. He just had to get over the wall.

""When we reach the point where you see that your children do not have food,"" he said, ""the barrier of fear is broken.""

A year of war in Gaza has reverberated across the West Bank, where the World Bank warns the economy is at risk of collapse because of Israeli restrictions barring Palestinian laborers from entering the country for work, and the biggest wave of violence in decades.

Unemployment has skyrocketed, reaching 30% from around 12% before the war. The past year, some 300,000 Palestinians in the West Bank, many of whom worked in Israel, have lost their jobs, the Palestinian Economy Ministry says. Over the first quarter of 2024, the territory's economy contracted by 25%, according to the World Bank.

Desperate for jobs, some Palestinians are resorting to smuggling themselves at great personal risk through the guarded barrier and into Israel.

When they find them, Israeli security forces arrest them -- or at times open fire. There are no official figures from Palestinian authorities about workers killed or injured by Israeli gunfire trying to cross the barrier. The Associated Press spoke to families of three Palestinians who said their relatives were killed trying to sneak across.

""These people are being shot at trying to go to work,"" said Assaf Adiv, director of MAAN, a worker's association that focuses on Palestinian labor rights.

Before the war, some 150,000 Palestinians from the West Bank were crossing legally every day into Israel to work, mainly in construction, manufacturing and agriculture.

After Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Israeli authorities barred entry to most Palestinians, saying it was necessary for security. Tens of thousands of Palestinians became jobless overnight.

Eyad al-Najjar, a 47-year-old laborer from a village near the West Bank town of Yatta, slipped into Israel through a barbed-wire section of the barrier in July, earning the equivalent of $650 for a week's work, his family said.

Then his son got married. The wedding set the family back $8,000. So al-Najjar tried his luck again.

He approached a hole in the barrier Aug. 26, three days after the wedding. Israeli troops spotted al-Najjar and opened fire, killing him with a shot to the head, his relatives said.

""His children will have to work to close this debt in the future,"" relative Jawadat al-Najjar said. ""No one helps in these difficult days.""

The Israeli military told the AP it couldn't comment on the shooting without specific coordinates of where relatives said it happened.

""The IDF forces work to prevent illegal infiltrations and to maintain the security of the barrier and the safety of residents,"" it said in a statement. ""The forces conduct proactive ambushes along the barrier, arresting infiltrators and infiltrator smugglers and operate both overtly and covertly to protect the barrier area.""

Labor rights experts say infiltrations happen daily, often involving dozens of Palestinians at a time.

Many Palestinians found their livelihoods gutted by the restrictions. Some sold possessions. On West Bank roadsides, children hawk tissues, bottled water and air fresheners. Some men have tried their hand at selling sandwiches at makeshift street stalls.

It isn't just the cutoff from jobs in Israel. The military also tightened its grip in the West Bank, implementing a network of new military checkpoints that have hampered the movement of commerce and workers.

Vehicles can wait for hours as soldiers inspect everyone, unlike before the war, when many were waved through. Other roads are shut off completely. In one case, the army closed a road linking 12 villages to the southern town of Dura, said local activist Badawi Jawaed. Many workers couldn't reach their jobs and were laid off, he said.

Violence has surged, with increased Israeli raids targeting armed groups. More than 700 West Bank Palestinians have been killed by Israeli fire, the Palestinian Health Ministry says. Many were shot dead in armed clashes, others for throwing stones at troops. But some appear to have posed no apparent threat.

In Israel, Palestinians can earn double or triple a West Bank salary. Standing in their way is Israel's barrier, running some 700 kilometers (400 miles) long and peaking at 7-meters (23-feet) tall.

Many climb over with ladders and ropes. Others hide in trucks that pass through checkpoints. Some slip through holes in fencing, workers and experts said.

Ayyed once worked for an Israeli construction company that paid 7,000 shekels ($1,850) monthly. Cut off from the job since the war began, he searched for work in his home city of Jenin, in the northern West Bank.

Ayyed said he tried grocery stores and restaurants, but no one was hiring.

To get by, he borrowed money from friends, racking up around $1,600 in debt. He cut back on water and electricity. By spring, he had no one left to borrow from and a $500 monthly rent bill to pay.

So he decided to risk it.

As he scaled the wall, the ladder slipped. Ayyed fell to the ground on the West Bank side, breaking his leg. He limped home penniless.

Palestinian smugglers or middlemen linked to gangs on both sides of the barrier arrange the crossings. They provide ladders and rope, as well as vehicles on the Israeli side to whisk workers away from the patrolled barrier.

They charge 300 to 1,000 shekels ($79 to $260), said Arafat Amro, a Palestinian labor rights expert.

Once through, work isn't hard to find, due to a labor shortage across Israel, mostly in construction and agriculture, Palestinian workers and Amro said.

To evade Israeli authorities, Palestinian workers are ""sleeping in the fields, they sleep in the farms, they sleep under the trees, at the construction sites,"" Amro said.

Raouf Adra, a laborer from Yatta, said he found two week's work on a construction site in the southern Israeli town of Dimona that would have paid 350 shekels ($65) daily. After climbing the barrier and reaching the site, he was told he was forbidden to leave after his shifts, to prevent discovery.

The next day, Israeli police stormed the site, arresting Adra and several other Palestinians. The Israeli site manager was nowhere to be seen.

""He ran away,"" Adra said.

Adra was handed a 40-day prison sentence and fined 1,500 shekels ($390). Once released, he was transported back to the West Bank and banned from entering Israel for three years.

Unable to walk after his fall in May, Ayyed said he had to sell the gold his family gave his wife as a wedding present and then his car.

""I know people who sold their furniture,"" he said.

Four months later, his broken leg is almost completely healed.

Asked if he would try again, he replied: ""If the situation remains the same, I will consider it."""

Another banner above showed a website link making clear the banners referred to Champions League reforms.

This season UEFA has changed the structure to Europe's premier competition to add four more teams. The group stage has been scrapped for a league system with each of the now 36 participating teams playing eight opponents once in a first phase of the competition.

US sanctions extremist West Bank settler group for violence against Palestinians,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hilltop-youth-sanctions-israel-gaza-settler-treasury-west-bank-extremist-53fb26077c8d88637b4bd366ad3343cb,2024-10-01T15:22:47Z,"In addition, the State Department placed diplomatic sanctions on two men -- Israeli settler Eitan Yardeni, for his connection to violence targeting West Bank civilians and Avichai Suissa, the leader of Hashomer Yosh, a sanctioned group that brings young volunteers to settler farms across the territory, including small farming outposts that rights groups say are the primary drivers of settler violence across the territory.

The sanctions, which expose people to asset freezes and travel and visa bans, come as violence against Palestinians in the West Bank has exploded since the start of the Israel-Hamas war, following the deadly terrorist attacks of October 7th.

Palestinians report verbal and physical harassment, restriction of movement, and face intimidation by settlers circling their properties on motorbikes, cars or horses and spying via drones.

The Treasury Department said Hilltop Youth has carried out killings and mass arson, while rights groups and Palestinians say the group is behind ""price tag"" attacks - attacks on Palestinian villages in retaliation for perceived efforts to hamper settlement construction.

The group may prove difficult to effectively sanction, as it is loosely organized and decentralized. In addition, Israel's finance minister has previously vowed to intervene on sanctioned settlers' behalf.

In the past, sanctioned settlers have told the AP that the measures have had little impact on their finances.

Hilltop Youth has already faced sanctions from the EU and UK.

The Biden administration has been criticized for imposing relatively few sanctions on Israeli extremists. According to the Office of Foreign Assets Control, 27 extremists and entities have been sanctioned by the U.S. under President Joe Biden 's February 2024 Executive Order related to maintaining West Bank stability.

The Treasury's Acting Under Secretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence Bradley T. Smith said that the U.S. ""will continue to hold accountable the individuals, groups, and organizations that facilitate these hateful and destabilizing acts.""

State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said ""the actions of these individuals have contributed to creating an environment where violence and instability thrive. Their actions, collectively and individually, undermine peace, security, and stability in the West Bank.""

"Book Review: Ta-Nehisi Coates visits Senegal, South Carolina and the Middle East for 'The Message'",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/message-tanehisi-coates-book-review-f4d0a229e869fb28602ce8219f2b8cfc,2024-10-01T14:43:03Z,"Ta-Nehisi Coates always writes with a purpose, so naming his latest collection ""The Message"" is nothing if not on-brand. But what's the actual message? Consisting of three pieces of non-fiction, the book is part memoir, part travelogue, and part writing primer. It covers his recent trips to Dakar, Senegal; Columbia, South Carolina; and various cities and towns in the Middle East.

He writes in the introduction that the essays fulfill a promise to a Howard University writing class he taught in 2022: ""I bring my belated assignment... I've addressed these notes directly to you, though I confess that I am thinking of young writers everywhere whose task is nothing less than doing their part to save the world.""

Coates features snippets of his biography in each essay, but always returns to lessons for writers, as in this reflection during his first ever visit to Africa: ""There are dimensions in your words -- rhythm, content, shape, feeling... The accretion of imperfect, discomfiting life must be seen and felt so that the space in your mind, gray, automatic, and square, fills with angle, color, and curve."" These pilgrimages, for him, help ground his powerful writing about race. As he reflects on his visit to Gorée Island, the place from which tens of millions of Africans departed into a lifetime of slavery, he confesses to ""welling up, grieving for something, in the grips of some feeling I am still, even as I write this, struggling to name.""

The second essay examines racism closer to home, as Coates journeys to a South Carolina town where the school board was considering banning his 2015 book ""Between the World and Me"" because, in part, students in an Advanced Placement English class felt ""ashamed to be Caucasian"" when they read it. Supporters of the teacher manage to show up in enough force to defeat the ban, but Coates sees in it the power of story. A middle-aged white teacher in Chapin, South Carolina, read his book -- a letter to his teenage-son about the realities of being Black in the United States -- and decided to use it as an example of how to write a persuasive essay. ""We have lived under a class of people who ruled American culture with a flaming cross for so long that we regularly cease to notice the import of being ruled at all,"" writes Coates.

The final, and longest, essay encompasses a 10-day trip Coates takes to the Middle East. Like his journey to Senegal, it's his first time in the region, and the experience really opens his eyes. ""Of all the worlds I have ever explored, I don't think any shone so bright, so intense, so immediately as Palestine."" That's because everywhere he looks he sees familiar signs of subjugation. The parallels between being Black in America and Palestinian in the Middle East are myriad. ""The state had one message to the Palestinians within its borders...'You'd really be better off somewhere else,'"" writes Coates. But while it's a message Coates clearly conveys in his essay, he realizes it's not his story to tell. ""If Palestinians are to be truly seen it will be through stories woven by their own hands -- not by their plunderers, not even by their comrades."""
Johannesburg considers naming a street after a Palestinian woman who hijacked a plane,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-sandton-street-renaming-palestine-bec02d2b06debe710a27d3871c91d865,2024-10-01T14:34:01Z,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) -- Officials in South Africa's biggest city of Johannesburg have proposed renaming a major street after a Palestinian woman who was involved in a hijacking more than 50 years ago, sparking criticism from several political parties and the city's Jewish community.

The city council is considering naming the street in its financial district of Sandton after Leila Khaled, a Palestinian militant and member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine group.

Khaled, who is now 80 years old, gained infamy in 1969 when she was part of a group who hijacked a Trans World Airlines flight on a journey from Rome to Tel Aviv, Israel. She became known as the first woman to hijack a plane.

She was also one of two people who attempted to hijack an Israeli Airlines flight from Amsterdam to New York City the following year, which resulted in the other hijacker being fatally shot by air marshals.

Israel considers Khaled a terrorist, but she is widely seen as a hero and freedom fighter by Palestinians and by some in South Africa who support the Palestinian cause. The PFLP is part of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the internationally recognized representative of the Palestinian people. While the main PLO faction, Fatah, recognizes Israel's right to exist, the PFLP doesn't, and Israel, the United States and other Western allies of Israel consider it a terrorist group.

South Africa has historically close ties to the Palestinians and has accused Israel of committing genocide in the war in Gaza in a highly sensitive case that's being heard by the United Nations' top court. South Africa and Israel have been fiercely critical of each other over that case.

Khaled has previously visited South Africa.

The street renaming controversy dates back to 2018, when it was first proposed and reportedly sparked a brawl among Johannesburg city officials, according to local media coverage at the time. It was initially proposed by Al Jama-ah, a pro-Palestinian minority party in the Johannesburg council, and supported by the African National Congress, South Africa's largest political party.

The name change is being considered again and members of the public have until mid-October to register their objections.

The South African Zionist Federation said the proposed change was partly aimed at the fact that the U.S. consulate in Johannesburg is located on the same street, which is currently called Sandton Drive. SAZF spokesperson Rolene Marks said renaming the street ""after a failed terrorist with ties to a globally recognized terrorist organization"" would sow division in South Africa.

Marks has also previously called the proposal ""an affront to peace-loving South Africans"" and ""deliberately provocative"" toward Johannesburg's Jewish community.

Sandton Drive is a major road in the district of Sandton, which is considered to be the richest square mile in Africa. It's also been the site of several pro-Palestinian protests in recent months outside the U.S. consulate.

Fana Mkhonza, a council member for the African Christian Democratic Party, a South African political party opposed to the proposal, said Khaled did not qualify to have the street renamed after her, according to the city's policies. South Africa has renamed some streets in recent years to remove colonial references and better reflect and recognize the country's majority Black population, especially those who fought against the apartheid system of white minority rule that ended in 1994.

""As much as Ms. Khaled could be seen as a freedom fighter in a thin slice of South African society, her fight has been for the Palestinian cause, not for the development of Johannesburg,"" Mkhonza said. ""The ACDP does not see any tolerance, reconciliation and peace in this proposed person's name to replace Sandton Drive.""

Al Jama-ah said renaming the street would show solidarity with the Palestinian people and be a recognition of their struggle.

""While some argue that we should focus on South African heroes, we should not ignore international figures who have fought for justice and freedom,"" said Thapelo Ahmad, the Johannesburg chairperson of Al Jama-ah and the former mayor of the city who originally proposed the name change in 2018."
Yemen's Houthi rebels are looking to gain from continuing conflict in the Middle East,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/yemen-houthis-gaza-israel-defe499e9df870381f078ad3e3b667b5,2024-10-01T14:24:00Z,"CAIRO (AP) -- In the days since Israel intensified its campaign against Hezbollah in Lebanon, including the strike that killed the militant group's leader Hassan Nasrallah, Yemen's Iran-backed Houthi rebels have been quick to show they are an important player in the complex conflicts convulsing the Middle East.

In a brazen attack on Saturday, the Houthis fired a ballistic missile at Israel's main airport as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was arriving back from New York, where he had addressed the United Nations. On Monday, they threatened ""escalating military operations"" to target Israel after apparently shooting down a U.S. military drone flying over Yemen.

And on Tuesday, an explosive-loaded drone crashed into one ship in the Red Sea as a missile exploded against another, the British military and private security officials said, the latest in the Houthis' assaults on commercial shipping in the key waterway.

The salvo of Houthi attacks has again drawn attention to the Yemeni rebels and raised questions about their goals and strategies.

The rebels, armed by Iran, seized most of Yemen's north and its capital, Sanaa, a decade ago, pushing the country's internationally recognized government into exile.

A Saudi-led coalition backing Yemen's government entered the war in 2015 and the Houthis have since been fighting what has become a long-running but now largely stalemated civil war in Yemen.

However, when the Israel-Hamas war erupted in the Gaza Strip a year ago, the Houthis began targeting shipping throughout the Red Sea corridor -- part of a campaign they say aims at pressuring Israel and the West over the war.

Analysts and observers say a widening conflict could boost the Houthis militarily and expand their already outsized role across the region -- despite retaliatory strikes by Israel, the United States and the United Kingdom.

Ahmed Nagi, a senior Yemen analyst at the Crisis Group, says that before the war in Gaza, the Houthis were seen as an often-forgotten and less-prominent faction in an axis that includes Iran, Syria's government forces, Lebanon's Hezbollah, the Palestinian Hamas and other groups in the region.

That changed when the Houthis began hitting ships in the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden making their way to the Suez Canal, suddenly posing a much wider threat.

""Over the past year, the Houthis have taken center stage,"" Nagi said.

After Hamas attacked southern Israel on Oct. 7, killing 1,200 people and taking some 250 hostages, Israel responded with a blistering offensive on the Gaza Strip, a coastal enclave run by the Palestinian militant group.

Israel's retaliatory invasion of Gaza has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians and wounded more than 95,000, according to Gaza's Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between civilians and militants in its count but says that over half of those killed are women and children.

The toll the war has taken and the extent of Gaza's destruction have shocked the world.

Meanwhile, the Houthis see the Yemenis' prevailing solidarity with Palestinians as a useful tool for recruiting new fighters and swelling their ranks, Nagi said

In June, the Houthis unveiled a new, solid-fuel missile in their arsenal that resembles aspects of one earlier one displayed by Iran, which Tehran described as flying at hypersonic speed.

The rebels fired their new ""Palestine"" missile -- complete with a warhead painted like a Palestinian keffiyeh checkered scarf -- at the southern port of Eilat in Israel, setting off air raid sirens but causing no damage or injuries.

The extent of the Houthis' actions was a surprise to some, mainly because of their limited resources and Yemen's own costly civil war.

Nagi described their strategy as one of ""gradual escalation"" towards Israel. As their prominence grows, the Houthis -- who have for years relied on portable missile launchers and hit-and-run tactics -- will likely be eager to get their hands on more advanced weapons, he added.

The Houthis initially targeted vessels claimed to be linked to Israel and later expanded their campaign to include all commercial shipping in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. They used small boats, short-range missiles and drones to carry out those attacks.

Their campaign prompted a response by an international coalition, led by the U.S. and U.K., which in February launched strikes on ""sites associated with the Houthis' deeply buried weapons storage facilities, missile systems and launchers, air defense systems and radars,"" U.S. defense officials said.

In July, an Iranian-made drone launched by the Houthis struck Tel Aviv, killing one person and wounding 10. Israel responded with a wave of airstrikes on Houthi-held areas of Yemen, including the port city of Hodeida.

The Houthis have since warned they could expand their campaign beyond Mideast waters, to target ships using the longer route around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, or those in the Mediterranean Sea heading to Israel.

According to Faozi al-Goidi, a fellow at the Middle East Council on Global Affairs, the rebels are not likely to be deterred anytime soon and could also target vessels further out in the Indian Ocean.

They may also seek to ""partner with other militias to build an alliance that would threaten security in the region,"" al-Goidi said.

The New York-based Soufan Center, a think tank, said in a September report that the Houthis were increasing ""operational autonomy"" and diversifying their alliances away from Iran by cooperating with Russia, pointing to alleged plans for Russian weapons shipments to the Houthis that fell through.

The Houthis remain in control of most of Yemen's north where they enjoy popular support despite a dire economic situation and a brutal crackdown on dissent that has included humanitarian workers.

Their fight against Israel is likely to play into that. Thousands of Houthi supporters come out to Sanaa streets to rally every Friday, demanding justice for Palestinians and denouncing Israel and the U.S.

""Yemenis of all political backgrounds and ideologies support Palestinians and have a deep connection with them,"" said Yemeni political analyst Abdel-Bari Taher. That will help grow support for the Houthis, despite the rebels' ""oppressive policies against Yemenis.""

The Houthis may also seek to exploit their new-found stature following strikes against Israel in any potential negotiations with Saudi Arabia over a resolution to Yemen's civil war.

The have raised ""their ceiling for negotiations,"" said al-Goido. ""No one will ignore them anymore."""
"A former hostage fought for her own life in Gaza. A year on, she fights for her husband's freedom",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hostages-gaza-tunnels-hamas-israel-war-d8ecb415268e911cea09518acdaf7ba2,2024-10-01T04:44:25Z,"TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) -- As a hostage in Gaza, Aviva Siegel found herself begging for food and water. Since her release, she has found herself begging for her husband to be set free from his own ongoing captivity.

Siegel has come to embody the disaster that befell Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. Armed Hamas militants snatched her from her home and thrust her into Gaza's web of tunnels. Released during a brief cease-fire in November, she returned to find her community destroyed and became one of tens of thousands of Israelis displaced by conflict. She has emerged as a prominent voice in the struggle to free the remaining hostages, fighting tirelessly for her husband's release.

But as her ordeal reaches the one-year mark, Israel's attention is focused not on the plight of the hostages and their families, but on fighting Hezbollah in Lebanon. It's the latest diversion to chip away at Siegel's hope that she may reunite with her husband of 43 years anytime soon.

""The hostages, they are being left to die. To die slowly. How can I handle that? I just don't know how to handle it anymore,"" she said, sitting beside a poster of her husband, Keith, a 65-year-old American Israeli originally from Chapel Hill, North Carolina.

Her torment is all the more acute because she knows firsthand what her husband is enduring.

""Hostages were chained, tortured, starved, beaten up into pieces. I saw that in front of my eyes. That's what they did to us,"" she said from a short-term rental apartment in Tel Aviv, one of the many places she has lived since her return during the November cease-fire, the first and only deal reached between Israel and Hamas during the war.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed to continue the war until ""total victory"" over Hamas and pledged to bring home the hostages, but has faced widespread criticism that dozens remain captive a year after the attack. Netanyahu has also argued that the pressure on Hezbollah will, in turn, lead to pressure on its ally Hamas and help speed up the release of the hostages.

The Siegels were jolted awake on Oct. 7 at their home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza, one of the hardest-hit communities that day, by a burst of air raid sirens. Like so many others, they took cover in their safe room, built to protect against rocket attacks, that turned out to be no match for the rifle- and grenade-toting Hamas militants who stormed their home.

In its attack, Hamas kidnapped roughly 250 people, including women, children and older people. It killed some 1,200 people -- most of them civilians -- according to Israeli authorities. The war the attack sparked has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, over half of them women and children, according to health officials in Gaza.

Hamas has said the hostages are treated humanely, but multiple accounts from freed hostages contradict that.

The militants led the Siegels out of their house, shoved her husband, breaking his ribs, and shot him in the hand, Siegel said. They were forced into their own car and driven into Gaza, where crowds of onlookers cheered at their capture.

Their first stop was a home with a living room that opened up into an underground tunnel.

""And there's somebody underneath the hole, in the hole underneath the ground, that's waiting with a smile, happy as can be. I'll never forget his face,"" she said.

They climbed down a steep ladder into the tunnel, one of several they were held in throughout Siegel's 51 days in captivity. All told, Siegel was moved around 13 times, held in both tunnels and militants' homes, she said.

On the first day, they were joined by other hostages and they were brought pita and cheese, which hardly anyone ate because they were all in shock. But throughout her captivity, food was scarce and Siegel said there were entire days when she wasn't brought anything to eat.

""They used to starve us while they ate in front of us and not bring us water for hours and days. I had an infection in my stomach, I was dehydrated. We had to beg -- beg -- for water. Beg and beg for food.""

The first tunnel had light -- others did not -- as well as a fan that labored to circulate the scant air. Seven hostages were held in a room Siegel described as being about the size of three yoga mats. She found comfort in having her husband by her side throughout.

She brushed her teeth four times over those weeks and washed herself the same amount, in salt water.

""It's disgusting. We were filthy. Dirty. The smell that came out of us is the worst that you can imagine,"" she said.

But worse was the treatment from the guards. Siegel, a 63-year-old grandmother of five, said she was pushed and yanked by the hair and shoved into cars.

Her captors told her that Hamas had taken over her kibbutz and that Israel didn't care about freeing her. So she was in disbelief when freedom came on Nov. 26. But it came at a price: Her husband was to remain behind.

Her parting words to him were, ""Be strong for me,"" and she promised to be strong for him.

Since their painful goodbye, she has crisscrossed Israel and the world, sharing her story and pleading for her husband's release. She has met Netanyahu, United States President Joe Biden and United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, among others. She has spoken repeatedly to Israeli lawmakers and become a fixture at weekly protests in support of the hostages.

But her energetic advocacy has been beaten down by the horrific twists and turns of the war. Since her release, she has watched multiple rounds of hostage negotiations collapse. Hostages have been killed by Hamas but also mistakenly by Israeli forces, and some have been rescued.

The fighting in Israel's north, and the stunning assassination of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah, feels like another blow to her struggle, which has faded from the public consciousness.

Siegel said she can't bring herself to watch a video of her husband that Hamas released in April. Clearly filmed under duress, he says he is OK, but breaks down in tears and lays his head on his knees, sobbing.

She finds the strength to soldier on by thinking about him, a vegetarian who loves reading books to his grandchildren and studied Arabic so he could converse with workers from Gaza who were employed in the kibbutz. But a year on, her hope is wearing thin.

""I don't know why I get up,"" she said. ""But I do know that I have to get up for Keith."""
'Abandon Harris' group endorses Jill Stein over 'pro-genocide candidate' Kamala,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/abandon-harris-group-endorses-jill-stein-over-pro-genocide-candidate-kamala,2024-10-08T23:08:07Z,"Former Navy SEAL Cameron Hamilton discusses Israel's position as war develops in the Middle East.

A group that has labeled Vice President Harris a ""pro-genocide candidate"" has endorsed third-party presidential candidate Jill Stein in the 2024 contest.

The Abandon Harris campaign says America, as well as presidential candidates Harris and former President Trump, is supporting an ""Israeli project of Palestinian annihilation"" and urges Muslim Americans and those who oppose genocide to cast their ballot for the Green Party this year.

""In October 2023, under the darkening shadow of the U.S.-backed Israeli project of Palestinian annihilation, the Abandon Harris campaign - formerly Abandon Biden - was born. Our movement remains dedicated to ensuring that the American people, especially the Muslim-American community, recognize the responsibility we share in standing up against oppression and using all our power to stop genocide - wherever it may arise,"" the group declared in a press release.

ABANDON BIDEN CAMPAIGN RELAUNCHES, TARGETS HARRIS IN KEY SWING STATES

""We are confronting two destructive forces: one currently overseeing a genocide and another equally committed to continuing it. Both are determined to see it through. We call on Muslim-Americans and all those who stand firmly against genocide to vote for the Green Party in 2024,"" the press release states.

Stein has expressed her gratitude to the group and its support of her candidacy.

The Abandon Harris campaign says on its website that its ""current goal is to hold Harris accountable for her continued support of genocide.""

""It's painfully obvious that Kamala Harris can only sound articulate and firm when parroting US support for Israel,"" the group wrote in an August post on X. ""She fumbles through everything else, but when it comes to endorsing the killing of Palestinians, she suddenly finds a pristine level of eloquence,"" the post added.

Israel launched a war effort last year in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks perpetrated by Hamas terrorists who committed atrocities that included rapes, kidnappings, and murders.

""What Hamas did that day was pure evil - it was brutal and sickening,"" Harris said in a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the attack on Monday. ""I will do everything in my power to ensure that the threat Hamas poses is eliminated, that it is never again able to govern Gaza, that it fails in its mission to annihilate Israel, and that the people of Gaza are free from the grip of Hamas,"" she declared in the statement.

""Hamas's terrorist attack on October 7 launched a war in Gaza. I am heartbroken over the scale of death and destruction in Gaza over the past year - tens of thousands of lives lost, children fleeing for safety over and over again, mothers and fathers struggling to obtain food, water, and medicine. It is far past time for a hostage and ceasefire deal to end the suffering of innocent people. And I will always fight for the Palestinian people to be able to realize their right to dignity, freedom, security, and self-determination,"" Harris said in the statement."
Prospects of a deal with Israel fade away as Saudis invite Iranian foreign minister to visit,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/iran-foreign-minister-saudi-arabia-deal-israel,2024-10-08T20:45:15Z,"One year ago, Saudi Arabia and Israel were supposedly on the brink of a deal to normalize relations.

That deal has seemingly evaporated as Iran's foreign minister visits the kingdom on Tuesday to discuss efforts to halt Israel's incursions into Gaza and Lebanon.

""Our dialogue continues regarding the developments in the region to prevent the shameless crimes of the Zionist regime in Lebanon, in continuation of the crimes in Gaza,"" Iran Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi said in a video broadcast on state media.

He added: ""Starting today, I'll begin a trip to the region, to Riyadh and other capitals, and we will strive for a collective movement from the countries of the region... to stop the brutal attacks in Lebanon.""

The Saudis share a longtime strategic partnership with the U.S. and are the largest purchaser of its weapons. But in recent years, they've had a political rapprochement with Iran.

9/11 FAMILIES URGE TRUMP, HARRIS TO OPPOSE SAUDI DEAL UNTIL KINGDOM ADMITS INVOLVEMENT IN TERROR ATTACK

Last week, Gulf states, including Saudi Arabia, reaffirmed their neutrality in the conflict between Israel and Iran. Iran has warned that if ""Israel supporters"" intervene directly, their interests in the region would be targeted. That could mean missile strikes on their oil facilities.

Iran rained some 200 missiles down on Israel last week, many of which were intercepted by Israel Defense Forces (IDF) with U.S. assistance.

""The Gulf states think it's unlikely that Iran will strike their oil facilities, but the Iranians are dropping hints they might from unofficial sources. It's a tool the Iranians have against the U.S. and the global economy,"" Ali Shihabi, a Saudi commentator close to the royal court, said.

In 2019, drones attacked Saudi Arabia's key refinery at Abqaiq, briefly shutting down around 5% of the world's oil supply. Those drones originated in Iran, according to U.S. intelligence.

Prior to Hamas' attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, the Biden administration considered a proposed deal, akin to the Abraham Accords, a major priority. This deal aimed to normalize relations between Saudi Arabia and Israel, including security guarantees and cooperation on civil nuclear matters. For months, the White House had been saying the deal was nearly done.

The prospect of a deal was largely blamed as a catalyst for the Hamas attacks.

OPINION: WHY SAUDI ARABIA MATTERS MORE THAN EVER TO THE US

""I don't think we were ever really that close,"" Robert Greenway, former senior director of the National Security Council, told Fox News Digital.

""We were closest probably in the waning days of the Trump administration, but we knew that that would be a second-term issue if there was to be one, and obviously that didn't play out. I don't know that the Biden-Harris administration ever took it that terribly seriously.""

Just before the Hamas attack, a group of 20 Democratic senators made clear their opposition to the treaty, voicing concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record and that a peaceful nuclear energy program might one day be converted to a military one to produce a nuclear weapon.

And Oct. 7 changed the Saudis' calculus: they now demand a plan for a Palestinian state.

""If anyone believes there was a chance of getting the House or Senate in an election year with virtually no majority, getting anything as controversial as a security treaty, with Saudi Arabia - permission for them to enrich with our blessing and support - I don't know if anyone credibly believes that that was ever possible.""

Former deputy national security adviser Victoria Coates was optimistic that the Saudis could be brought back into the fold.

""From what I'm hearing from both sides, it's when, not if,"" she said. ""There are various reasons you might want to wait to find out what the makeup of the Congress is going to be... you're going to need supportive majorities in the Senate to get [a civil nuclear agreement] through."""
5 key takeaways from Kamala Harris' '60 Minutes' interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/5-key-takeaways-from-kamala-harris-60-minutes-interview,2024-10-08T15:03:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.

Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, with Israel under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In her answers, Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current administration.

On Israel, Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end, though she acknowledged the Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.

""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end,"" Harris said.

Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in military aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over Netanyahu, Harris dodged the question and stayed on message, emphasizing the current administration's diplomatic efforts.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" she said.

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

Whitaker pressed, ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""

Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

On Europe, Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to the war with Russia.

""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in what that success looks like,"" she said.

In a definitive statement, Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However, she was less specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.

""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,"" Harris said. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration, noting that she supported Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed the border. Now, the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers,"" he said.

Whitaker asked, ""If that's the right answer, now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,"" she said.

However, Whitaker pushed back on the vice president, observing that in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or Harris.

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""

Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from day one, literally.""

""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,"" she said, again echoing Biden.

To fight inflation, Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6,000, give first-time homebuyers $25,000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small business.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.

""Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,"" Harris answered. ""But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""

HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND ECONOMIC PLAN

Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me, madam vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair,"" Harris asserted.

Whitaker followed up again, stating, ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.

""I disagree with you,"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

""None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy,"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that I am also a capitalist, and I know the limitations of government.""

After a discussion on foreign policy, Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her recent admission that she is a gun owner.

""I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she owns. ""And, I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.""

Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's 2020 running mate.

She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president, she remains a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago, when Biden decided to drop out of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you,"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

""It's an election, Bill,"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support."
"1 year after Hezbollah strikes, Israel reinforces troops and questions mount over 'limited' operation",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/one-year-after-hezbollah-strikes-israel-reinforces-troops-questions-mount-over-limited-operation,2024-10-08T08:10:46Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

One week after Israel launched a ground incursion into Lebanon and one year after Hezbollah fired rockets into northern Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, in support of Hamas, Jerusalem reinforced its troops fighting inside Lebanon with a third division, prompting immediate questions over the extent of its ""limited"" operations in Lebanon.

The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on Sunday sent troops from its 91st Division, also known as the Galilee Formation, to join forces already in Lebanon hunting down Hezbollah strongholds.

The 91st Division, traditionally responsible for overseeing security for the entirety of the border with Lebanon, will reinforce efforts already being carried out by two other divisions.

AMERICAN FATHER OF HAMAS HOSTAGE ITAY CHEN PUSHES US, ISRAEL ON 'PLAN B' AS NEGOTIATIONS FALTER

Israel's initial advance into Lebanon was led by soldiers from the 98th Division on Oct. 1, which encompassed paratroopers, elite commandos and the 7th Armored Brigade, who were transferred to northern Israel from the border with Gaza in early September for training, reported the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD) Long War Journal on Sunday ahead of the IDF announcement.

""Forces from the Commando Brigade, including soldiers from the Egoz Unit, located and destroyed a Hezbollah attack infrastructure, which included a rocket launcher, explosive stockpiles, and additional military equipment,"" the IDF said of the initial operation.

Though Hezbollah's response was fairly muted as many were believed to have retreated ahead of the incursion, at least nine IDF soldiers were killed between Oct. 1-2 during one of the opening battles in Lebanon, confirmed the Long War Journal.

Reinforcements from the IDF's 36th Division, including the Golani infantry, 188th Armored Brigade and the 6th Reserve Infantry Brigade were then sent in, according to reports last week.

Following the Israeli incursion - a security measure that the U.S. and other international allies warned Jerusalem against - IDF spokesperson Rear. Adm. Daniel Hagari said Israel would not push its ground forces north toward Beirut and would instead focus on securing the villages near the border.

Jerusalem has said the operation in Lebanon is necessary to secure the area so some 60,000 Israelis from northern Israel could return home, though data collected by the FDD shows that some 150,000 Israelis have evacuated from the northern border areas.

IDF MEETS LITTLE RESISTANCE FROM HEZBOLLAH AFTER WEEKS OF HITTING TERROR TARGETS, OFFICIALS SAY

Hagari said the incursion would be ""limited"" and take ""days"" to ""weeks"" to complete.

But the renewed support of additional troops on Monday prompted questions over the scope of Israel's plans in southern Lebanon, including from the U.S. State Department on Monday.

In response to questions from reporters regarding Israel's operations in Lebanon, State Department spokesperson Matthew Miller said, ""We're watching this very closely.""

""We support their ability to target militants, to degrade Hezbollah's infrastructure, to degrade Hezbollah's capability. But we are very cognizant of the many times in the past where Israel has gone in on what looked like limited operations and has stayed for months or for years,"" he added. ""And ultimately, that's not the outcome that we want to see.""

Israel has not announced any additional plans for its ground forces and said the IDF Divisions have engaged in ""targeted, limited, and localized operations"" in southern Lebanon to destroy Hezbollah's infrastructure.

But one security expert with the FDD pointed out that Israel could be taking precautionary steps to build up its force in the region should Israel decide it needs to bolster its ability to go after Hezbollah even further.

""What the Israelis have been doing is gradually ratcheting up pressure on Hezbollah to make the price of continuing to attack in support of Gaza too costly for the organization,"" David Daoud, senior fellow at FDD specializing in Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital.

Daoud explained that in the wake of the Oct. 8 attacks, Israel and Hezbollah engaged in ""mutual attrition,"" continuing to strike one another but rarely taking the level of attack beyond aerial bombardments, unlike the attacks carried out by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023.

ISRAEL'S GROUND INVASION INTO LEBANON IMMINENT AS CABINET APPROVES NEXT PHASE OF THE WAR

This level of engagement shifted after Israel's telecommunication device operation in which it allegedly detonated some 5,000 pagers previously distributed to Hezbollah operatives, killing more than three dozen and wounding nearly 3,000 others in a coordinated attack in late September.

Israel has not taken credit for the attacks, but according to open-source data compiled by the FDD in its latest interactive report dubbed ""Road to the Third Lebanon War, Mapping the War of Attrition,"" the event was a clear launching point in which Jerusalem drastically changed its modus operandi when it came to countering Hezbollah.

On Sept. 22, Israel carried out its most significant bombardment against the terrorist group than at any other point since the Oct. 8, 2023,attacks, firing some 1,182 strikes, nearly five times the number of attacks it fired during its second-heaviest strike campaign on Feb. 11, 2024, when 239 strikes were fired, the FDD found.

""I would call it a kind of proactive attrition,"" said Daoud, who co-authored the FDD report. ""The Israelis are no longer keeping a balance of attrition, they're really weighing heavily on Hezbollah without going to a full ground invasion.""

The expert explained that the IDF is ""ratcheting up pressure"" on Hezbollah in an attempt to get it to back off its support for Hamas, a similar strategy it has taken in Gaza in an attempt to persuade Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar to hand over the hostages.

The merits of this approach are debatable as hostages remain in Hamas captivity despite the immense pains the IDF has caused in the Gaza Strip, and Daoud questioned whether this tactic would be effective against Hezbollah, an organization that is more sophisticated, better armed, better financed and more entwined in Lebanese society.

""I don't see Hezbollah backing down, even at this level of pain that the Israelis are inflicting upon them,"" Daoud said. ""So a ground invasion may become necessary, and you want to make sure that your forces are in place for that to move into effect immediately, if that becomes the case.""

The expert highlighted that Israel may once again be considering the establishment of a ""security zone"" in Lebanon in order to create a buffer between Hezbollah strongholds and the Israeli border, a move that would replicate steps Israel took between 1985 and 2000 and one that would require a prolonged IDF stay in Lebanon.

It is unclear if Israel could be considering another buffer-zone scenario, though it would likely prove unpopular not only with the Lebanese government but with the international community, which has increasingly urged Israel to reduce its footprint in the region by embracing a two-state solution with the Palestinians in the south and along Israel's eastern border.

But Daoud argued that the threat Hezbollah poses isn't going away and that creating a buffer zone combined with continued air strikes could be the solution that appeases the international community best by avoiding an all-out ground invasion across Lebanon.

""There are ways to avoid a ground invasion,"" Daoud argued. ""It will take much longer, but given where international opinion is, this is probably a better option for Israel now than a full ground invasion up to Beirut.""

Though Israel has not announced any plans to engage in a ground operation to oust Hezbollah forces from strongholds like Beirut, it has ramped up the number of strikes on suburban areas outside the capital city, and since late September the U.S. has organized the departure of some 700 Americans from Lebanon."
"CBS News staff in uproar after host challenges guest's anti-Israel views, network leadership responds",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cbs-news-staff-uproar-after-host-challenges-guests-anti-israel-views-network-leadership-responds,2024-10-08T00:11:56Z,"CBS Mornings anchor Tony Dokoupil pressed author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates on whether he believed Israel had a right to exist in a Monday interview.

CBS News is in turmoil after an internal staff meeting addressed the concerns surrounding an interview featuring Ta-Nehisi Coates on Israel's ""right to exist.""

Last week, ""CBS Mornings"" anchor Tony Dokoupil grilled Coates, an author and journalist, on an anti-Israel portion in his new book, ""The Message,"" which describes his travels ""to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how easily we are misled by nationalist narratives, and the tragedy that lies in the clash between the stories we tell and the reality of life on the ground,"" the book summary reads.

Dokoupil brought up this section of the book, telling Coates bluntly that it read like something you would find in ""the backpack of an extremist.""

CBS HOST GRILLS TA-NEHISI COATES ON ANTI-ISRAEL VIEWS IN NEW BOOK: LOOKS LIKE IT CAME FROM AN 'EXTREMIST'

""I have to say, when I read the book, I imagine if I took your name out of it, took away the awards, the acclaim, took the cover off the book, publishing house goes away, the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,"" Dokoupil said.

""So then I found myself wondering, why does Ta'Nehisi Coates, who I've known for a long time, read his work for a long time, very talented, smart guy, leave out so much? Why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it? Why leave out that Israel deals with terror groups that want to eliminate it? Why not detail anything of the first and the second Intifada, the café bombings, the bus bombings, the little kids blown to bits. Is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?"" the CBS anchor continued.

Coates defended the book, saying he sought to give a voice to the Palestinian people, whose views he argued were underrepresented in the American media.

The interview prompted outcry from some CBS News staff, who felt Dokoupil pressed Coates too strongly on his anti-Israel stance. The network addressed the internal frenzy in a staff meeting Monday, which marked the one-year anniversary since the October 7th massacre in Israel. CBS leadership reassured offended staff members that following a review, they concluded that the interview did not meet the company's ""editorial standards,"" the Free Press reported, which obtained audio of the staff meeting.

Adrienne Roark, who oversees news-gathering at the network, told employees that covering an event like October 7 ""requires empathy, respect, and a commitment to truth,"" according to the Free Press.

""We will still ask tough questions. We will still hold people accountable. But we will do so objectively, which means checking our biases and opinions at the door,"" Roark reportedly said.

""We are here to report news without fear or favor,"" Roark added, according to the Free Press. ""There are times we fail our audiences and each other. We're in one of those times right now, and it's been growing. And we're at a tipping point. Many of you have reached out to express concerns about recent reporting. Specifically about the CBS Mornings Coates interview last week as well as comments made coming out of some of our correspondents' reporting.""

CBS NEWS CASTS A LONG SHADOW OF ANTI-TRUMP BIAS AHEAD OF ITS VICE-PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

She continued, ""I want to acknowledge and apologize that it's taken this long to have this conversation.""

But not everyone at CBS agreed with the leadership's decision to appease their staff.

CBS News chief legal correspondent Jan Crawford reportedly defended Dokoupil's handling of the interview, remarking during the meeting, ""I don't even understand how Tony's interview failed to meet our editorial standards... I thought our commitment was to truth. When someone comes on our air with a one-sided account of very complex situation -- which Coates himself acknowledges that he has -- it's my understanding that as a journalist we are obligated to challenge that worldview, so that our viewers can have access to the truth and can have a more balanced account...,"" Dylan Byers of Puck News reported her as saying.

""And that is what Tony did,"" Crawford added, according to Byers. ""He challenged Coates' one-sided worldview, Coates got to respond. It was civil... I don't see how we can say that it failed to meet our editorial standards.... Tony prevented a one-sided account from being broadcast on our network about a deeply complex situation that completely was devoid of history or fact. As journalists, that's what we have an obligation to do.""

An imminent ballistic missile strike from Iran looms, but the current alarm is different - more immediate, more dangerous.

It's a terror attack in Jaffa.

The details are still emerging, but we know this much: Several people have already lost their lives.

In a rush, we load up our gear and protective equipment into our vehicle. Just as we're pulling out of the hotel, orders from New York come through: Get back inside. They don't want us on the road with Iran's attack approaching.

FOUR AMERICAN HOSTAGES REMAIN IN HAMAS CAPTIVITY A YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 MASSACRE

Before my producer can even hang up, the car fills with a new sound: the blare of alarms. Iran has fired ballistic missiles - headed straight for us.

It takes about 12 minutes for a missile to travel from Iran to Israel. How far into those 12 minutes we are is anyone's guess.

Our photographer, doubling as our driver, floors the accelerator, weaving through traffic as we race back to the hotel.

We make it back and join about two dozen others in the hotel's shelter. Many of them are Israelis. A father plays with his two daughters, rolling on the ground, laughing. Nearby, people chat calmly, unbothered by the threat of nearly 200 ballistic missiles targeting Israel. I notice a young man standing calmly beside his girlfriend. He's missing a leg from the knee down but stands strong and composed.

""Hamas terrorists,"" he tells me when I ask about his injury. ""They hit us with an RPG.""

He credits his - and others' - composure during this attack to their faith in Israel's air defense systems.

From the shelter, I go live on Fox News Channel, describing those around me. As Israel's layered air defense - comprised of the Iron Dome, David's Sling and Arrow systems - intercepts incoming threats, it becomes clear why the soldier's confidence is well-placed.

HAMAS LAUNCHES ROCKETS FROM GAZA ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 ATTACKS, WHILE IDF STRIKES TERROR TARGETS

Iran is launching the largest ballistic missile barrage in history. Amid this, a Palestinian man in the West Bank dies from falling shrapnel, but not a single additional person in Israel is seriously harmed by the missiles.

It strikes me: the calm in the shelter is born of a tragic familiarity - being fired upon has become normal here.

Terror attacks, while common, rarely reach Tel Aviv.

When we're given the all-clear, we race to the scene of the attack in Jaffa, as originally planned.

Evidence of the brutality is everywhere along the light rail tracks: bloodstains and evidence markers hint at the horror that unfolded just before we arrived.

""When the train stopped and opened its doors, the terrorists walked inside, began firing their automatic weapons, then stepped back out and continued their killing spree,"" the Israeli Police International Spokesman, Dean Elsdunne, tells me.

""I even saw an image where the terrorists stood over a civilian who had clearly already been shot, and they continued shooting him,"" he adds.

Seven people lost their lives in the attack.

My mind flashes back to what I witnessed 63 miles south of Tel Aviv, in the devastated city of Rafah in southern Gaza.

Weeks earlier, I had embedded with the IDF in the evacuated city, where soldiers exchanged gunfire with militants.

There wasn't a single civilian in sight, but remnants of life before the war were scattered everywhere - a child's superhero mask, clothes, household goods buried beneath the rubble from Israeli airstrikes.

Four American hostages remain in Hamas captivity a year after Oct. 7 massacre,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/four-american-hostages-remain-hamas-captivity-year-after-oct-7-massacre,2024-10-07T19:46:31Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken vowed Monday that the U.S. ""will continue to work tirelessly"" to bring home the four American hostages who have now been held by Hamas for more than a year inside the Gaza Strip.

The four that remain -- Keith Siegel, 65, Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Omer Neutra, 22, and Edan Alexander, 21 -- were abducted by the Palestinian terrorist group exactly one year ago Monday on Oct. 7, 2023. The abductions took place alongside the murder of approximately 1,200 Israelis.

""Hamas also took 254 people hostage that day, including 12 Americans. Four of those Americans - Hersh Goldberg-Polin, Itay Chen, Judy Weinstein, and Gad Haggai - were murdered by Hamas. Four were released through an agreement the United States negotiated last November, but four remain in captivity in Gaza: Edan Alexander, Keith Siegel, Sagui Dekel-Chen, and Omer Neutra,"" Blinken said in a statement.

""There are also an estimated 97 other hostages who remain held in Gaza today. They include men, women, young boys, young girls, two babies, and elderly people from more than 25 nations,"" Blinken added. ""Hamas should release these hostages immediately. Every single one of them must be returned to their families, and the United States will continue to work tirelessly to bring them home.""

HAMAS LAUNCHES ROCKETS FROM GAZA ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7 ATTACKS, WHILE IDF STRIKES TERROR TARGETS

Blinken, who on Monday called Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel the ""largest massacre of Jews since the Holocaust,"" also said ""It is time to reach a ceasefire agreement that brings the hostages home, alleviates the suffering of the Israeli and Palestinian people, and ultimately brings an end to this war.""

The youngest of the hostages, 20-year-old Edan Alexander, graduated from Tenafly High School in New Jersey in 2022 before volunteering to serve with the IDF.

""He was kidnapped Oct. 7th from his post, from the IDF post, and since then, we have no additional information about this abduction,"" his father Adi has said.

Adi and his wife Yael wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times in September saying that for hundreds of days ""the world has failed our son and his fellow hostages: The Israeli government has abandoned them, too many countries have turned a blind eye, and while we're grateful for the U.S. government's steadfast support, its efforts have yet to yield results.

Omer Neutra, 22, also volunteered to serve in the IDF, according to his parents Orna and Ronen.

""He's like an all-American kid. He loved sports. He was accepted to Binghamton University, but decided to defer this school. And he went to Israel on a gap year, and he connected deeply with the country, with his peers, and he decided to volunteer to the IDF, and he was taken from his post,"" his mother Orna has said.

She recently told the New York Post from her home in Plainview, New York, ""Our kid is a bargaining chip in this geopolitical nightmare, and we, the families, we're just floating on this wave. We're trying not to sink.""

HEZBOLLAH ROCKET ATTACK ON ISRAEL HITS HAIFA FOR FIRST TIME

Jonathan Dekel-Chen, whose 36-year-old son Sagui is still being held in Gaza following Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, said in an interview with ""Fox & Friends"" in September, ""It is absolutely clear, the only way to get hostages home alive is by some kind of negotiated agreement with Satan.""

Dekel-Chen was abducted by Hamas in Kibbutz Nir Oz one year ago, according to the American Jewish Committee. The organization said he made sure his then-pregnant wife and his two daughters were safe in a shelter before confronting Hamas terrorists who had broken into his home.

Last November, Elan Siegel, the daughter of 65-year-old Keith Siegel, wrote in a column for Fox News Digital, ""They forced my parents, unassuming people filled with kindness and a quiet sensitivity, into my father's car and took them to Gaza.""

Siegel's wife Aviva later was released from captivity.

""It's just cruel to think that he's in such terrible conditions for so long,"" Aviva Siegel recently told the New York Post. ""What they're going through is the cruelest thing on Earth.""

Israel Soccer accuses Palestine of 'distorting reality' after suspension proposal,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/israel-soccer-accuses-palestine-distorting-reality-after-suspension-proposal,2024-10-07T18:52:45Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Israel Football Association (IFA) has responded to allegations of discrimination and a proposed suspension of its team from the Palestinian Football Association (PFA).

FIFA, the world's soccer governing body, launched an investigation into allegations of discrimination against the IFA last week. FIFA leaders made this decision when they ruled against suspending Israel from international play after the PFA proposed a suspension to Israel amid the war and humanitarian crisis in Gaza earlier this year.

In a statement provided to Fox News Digital by IFA head of communications Shlomi Barzell over the weekend, the IFA condemned the PFA for its recent proposal to FIFA.

""Whoever fantasized about the suspension of Israeli football from the international arena or sanctions through lies and false accusations, has suffered a defeat,"" the statement read. ""Again, we have acted over time in different channels, in a calculated and proactive manner in the face of the challenge of the Palestinian Association and its leader to distort reality, and the result today leaves no room for doubt.

""We respect the authors of the report submitted to the council members and the decision of the council members to consider transferring two issues to a legal examination, as long as there is any factual justification for it. Thanks to values that represent a glorious democracy and an independent and determined legal system of the Football Association, we have never violated and will not violate any of the FIFA/UEFA rules,"" the statement read.

The PFA has not responded to multiple requests for comment from Fox News Digital.

The PFA's original proposal claimed at least 92 non-professional Palestinian players have been killed in the war, football infrastructure has been destroyed, its leagues suspended and its national team required to play World Cup qualifiers abroad. The Palestinian federation wanted FIFA to adopt appropriate sanctions against Israeli teams, including the national side and clubs.

Katarina Pijetlovic, head of the PFA's legal department, addressed FIFA's decision not to suspend Israel in posts on X on Oct. 3.

""FIFA allowed Israel FA to continue using the Palestinian territory [occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem] as their own territory, and to use football under its umbrella as an instrument of colonial expansion,"" she wrote in a post on X. ""The decision is purely political. Will we wait 2 yrs again, as in 2015-17, for the committee to suggest the obvious and then have their suggestion rejected again? Why don't they just say it: Israel has impunity to destroy FIFA member associations & use their colonized territories.""

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S CHURCHILL MOMENT COMES AMID MULTIFRONT WAR AGAINST IRANIAN TERROR, EXPERT SAYS

Gaza-based soccer journalist Abubaker Abed previously told Al Jazeera that the Palestinian Federation ""acts as a form of resistance"" and alleged that more than 50 Palestinian sports facilities had been destroyed.

""The people of Palestine know this team acts as a form of resistance and is conveying a message to the world,"" Gaza-Abed said. ""More than 50 sports facilities have been reduced to rubble in Gaza, including nine out of 10 of Gaza's stadiums. Almost every club has been destroyed in this war, while one stadium in Deir el-Balah has been turned into a shelter for thousands of displaced people.""

FIFA's disciplinary committee will now be asked to look into the allegations of discrimination. The PFA has specifically accused the IFA of complicity in violations of international law by the Israeli government, discrimination against Arab players and inclusion in its league of clubs located in Palestinian territory.

""The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offense of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,"" FIFA said in a statement. ""FIFA's Governance, Audit and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate... the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.""

The PFA's proposal of suspension was enough to convince FIFA to seek an independent legal council and hold a landmark council meeting to make a decision on whether to suspend Israel from international soccer because of the conflict with Hamas, said FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the FIFA congress in May.

However, for the time being, it doesn't appear that Israel will be subject to a suspension. A suspension may have severely impacted its hopes to compete in the 2026 World Cup, which will be played in North America. The final will be played in East Rutherford, New Jersey, just across the Hudson River from New York City.

Countries have been banned from competing in the World Cup in the past based on the actions of their governments and national team administrations.

Germany and Japan were banned from the 1950 World Cup after the end of World War II. South Africa was banned from 1966 to 1992 for violating FIFA's anti-discrimination charter due to apartheid. Mexico was banned for two years after using overage players in qualifiers for the 1989 World Youth Championship.

Israel has only ever qualified for the World Cup once, in 1970, and it didn't make it out of the group stage. Israel won a championship in the 1964 Asian Games. However, they were moved from the Asian Football Federation to the the European Confederation UEFA in 1994, where they have struggled to compete. The team suffered its most lopsided loss in its history in a 7-1 blowout to Germany in 2002.

Israel is currently in the midst of its UEFA Nations League schedule. It will play France on Thursday after starting off 0-2.

Meanwhile, Palestine is currently in the midst of group play for the FIFA World Cup Asian qualifiers. It will play Iraq on Thursday after starting group play with one loss and one draw. Palestine has never qualified for the World Cup.

Monday marks the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023 Hamas terrorist attacks on Israel, which killed 1,195 people, including 815 civilians, and resulted in 251 people being taken hostage. At least 31 Americans were killed during the attacks and 13 others were missing.

On Aug. 15, at least 40,005 Palestinians were reported to have been killed in Gaza since the war began. Gaza's health ministry doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count, but says at least 5,956 women and at least 10,627 children have been killed.

One year after the attack, Hamas marked the anniversary by firing a barrage of rockets at Tel Aviv on Monday.

Israel's war in Gaza rages on even as Israel is now fighting a new war against Hezbollah, escalating its bombing campaign in Lebanon the past three weeks. Last week Israel faced additional attacks from Iran, which backs both Hamas and Hezbollah, in the form of missile strikes.

The strikes forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday, and even forced a pair of Israeli women's basketball teams to abandon their game and flee to shelter, per the Jerusalem Times."

Sen. JD Vance blasted the Biden-Harris administration on Monday for not doing enough to bring home the hostages that Hamas took from Israel during the deadly Oct. 7 attack one year ago.

Vance, R-Ohio, spoke during the Philos Project's Memorial Rally and March on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., briefly taking aim at President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

""I'm going to get a little political here. It is disgraceful that we have an American president and vice president who haven't done a thing,"" Vance said. ""Vice President Harris, our message is, 'Bring them home.' Use your authority to help bring them home. We can do it. We just need real leadership.""

Iran-backed Hamas terrorists launched a massacre against Israel in the Oct. 7 attack last year, killing about 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, and taking about 250 hostages. A year later, about 100 people, including several Americans, remain in Hamas captivity, as U.S.-led efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage release deal have sputtered out.

The attack sparked a war in Gaza, where Israel has moved to eliminate Hamas and return those taken hostage. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians.

Harris came under fire Sunday for a lengthy ""word salad"" answer in which she appeared unable to fully commit to Israel during an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes.""

Meanwhile, Vance gave full-throated support for Israel, saying that former President Trump will make sure Israel has the right to protect itself and that the hostages are returned home.

""I speak for Donald Trump and saying that when he is president, America will protect our American Jewish brothers and sisters. We will stop funding anti-American and anti-Jewish radicals.

The Iranian-backed Hamas and its supporters unleashed a scale of unprecedented barbarism, including beheadings and burning bodies, within the territory of the Jewish state, resulting in the mass murder of nearly 1,200 people, including over 30 Americans.

The U.S. designated terrorist movement Hamas also kidnapped more than 250 people on that fateful day that jolted Israel like none of the numerous wars against Iran-backed proxies that the tiny Jewish state has fought within this century. As of Monday, 101 hostages still remain in Hamas captivity, .

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

After a year of intense war with Hamas, including the opening of six additional fronts against the Islamic Republic of Iran's ""Axis of Resistance,"" Netanyahu has bounced back to take on the threat to Israel's very existence. He is in his prime as a modern war planner and head of state, a number of Israeli experts told Fox News Digital, including Israel's top diplomat to the United Nations.

""Prime Minister Netanyahu's leadership in this war is a case study in tenacity and courage.""

""Netanyahu was completely shocked during the first hours on the first day of the attack, but at the same time, he understood what was going on and controlled events. Netanyahu responded very quickly,"" Ariel Kahana, the senior diplomatic correspondent for the widely read Hebrew-language daily Israel Hayom, told Fox News Digital.

Kahana referenced Netanyahu's public announcement on Oct. 7, in which he declared, ""Citizens of Israel, we are at war, not in an operation or in rounds, but at war. This morning, Hamas launched a murderous surprise attack against the State of Israel and its citizens.""

FEDERAL AUTHORITIES ISSUE WARNING AHEAD OF OCT 7 ATTACKS ANNIVERSARY

Israel's ambassador to the U.N., Danny Danon, said, ""This isn't a war Israel started nor is it a war Israel wanted. But, under the leadership of Prime Minister Netanyahu, Israel has succeeded in mitigating the threat of Hamas by destroying its tunnel infrastructure and taking out its leaders. Israel is also successfully degrading Hezbollah in the north by eliminating its senior leadership and launching a targeted operation in southern Lebanon with the goal of pushing the group north of the Litani River and reducing the threat the terrorist organization poses to our northern border.""

Danon, who is a member of Netanyahu's conservative Likud party, added, ""While we are making progress, there is still work to be done. We still have 101 hostages who are held in brutal captivity in Gaza, and we still have 70,000 Israelis who are refugees in their own country, unable to return to their homes in the north.""

ISRAEL'S UN AMBASSADOR SLAMS WORLD BODY, SAYS UNRWA TAKEN OVER BY TERRORISTS IN GAZA

Prior to Oct. 7, Netanyahu was an embattled prime minister. His right-wing coalition government had suffered public humiliation when his administration was forced to abandon its judicial reform plan because of massive civil society protests.

Now, with a string of tactical victories over Hezbollah and Hamas' top leaders, including Israeli control over most of the Gaza Strip, Bibi, as he is known in Israel by his nickname, has gained popularity in political polling.

""Bibi made the right actions against Hamas and Hezbollah. That is why you see him rising in the polls.""

One key turning point for Israel is the near total decimation of the leadership of the U.S. classified terrorist movement Hezbollah, including its leader Hassan Nasrallah, in Lebanon.

ISRAEL WAS BEHIND LEBANON PAGER ATTACK TARGETING HEZBOLLAH, SENIOR US OFFICIAL SAYS, AS NEW BLASTS REPORTED

The de facto ruler over the Lebanese state, Hezbollah, launched missiles at Israel one day after the Hamas invasion, on Oct. 8. Last week, Israeli ground troops entered south Lebanon, with a view toward rooting out Hezbollah terrorists and missiles that sparked the flight of as many as 70,000 Israelis from their homes in the north.

Kahana noted, ""Bibi made the right actions against Hamas and Hezbollah. That is why you see him rising in the polls. He is the only one to use the term victory. You don't hear that from the security establishment."" He cited the examples of Bibi's defense minister, Yoav Gallant, and Herzi Halevi , the chief of staff of the Israel Defense Forces, who ""are not talking about a complete defeat of Hamas.""

The veteran Israeli commentator said Israel's seizure of the southern Gaza city of Rafah was a telling example of a clash between Bibi and his war planners, Gallant and Halevi. There was hesitation on the part of Gallant and Halevi while Netanyahu wanted to expedite the capture of Rafah, the last major holdout of sizeable Hamas terrorist forces. Kahana chalked up a possible explanation of delay from Gallant and Halevi to the Biden administration's interference in having expressed opposition to the IDF operation in Rafah.

After a four-month offensive in Rafah, the IDF, in September, declared victory over Hamas' Rafah brigade. The incursion into Rafah also secured the release of four Israeli hostages in June. From May to September, the IDF eliminated thousands of Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad terrorists in Rafah.

HEZBOLLAH'S NEIGHBORS: ISRAELI BORDER COMMUNITY UNDER CONSTANT ATTACK FROM TERROR GROUP

According to Kahana, ""Bibi had to push the army to act."" He compared Bibi to Britain's WWII prime minister, Winston Churchill, who demanded that his army do certain things but encountered resistance. Kahana noted, ""Netanyahu has full responsibility for what brought about Oct. 7, but he is leading the war better than Gallant, Halevi and Benny Gantz.""

""What is the strategy, what is the exit plan in the war against Hezbollah?""

Gantz, a retired general and leader of the main opposition party, left Bibi's war cabinet in June.

Yet Bibi still has many critics who believe he should have tendered his resignation on Oct. 7 or a few months into the war against Hamas. Netanyahu has also been accused of forgoing the hostages held by Hamas in Gaza and thousands of Israelis have protested on a near weekly basis against his policies since the war began.

Yossi Melman, a veteran Israeli columnist for the left-leaning Haaretz newspaper, is one of Bibi's sharpest critics. Melman said, ""His performance is very bad."" He said Bibi has ""no vision and no strategy."" Melman asked, ""What is the strategy, what is the exit plan in the war against Hezbollah?""

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

He claimed, ""Most of his decisions are about political and personal survival.""

Israel's then-attorney general, Avichai Mandelblit, charged Netanyahu with fraud, breach of trust and accepting bribes in a legal saga that started four years ago and is still unfolding. Netanyahu has vehemently denied all the allegations against him.

Melman also claimed that Netanyahu, along with his cabinet, military and security chiefs, refused to accept responsibility for Oct. 7.

As one of Israel's leading intelligence experts, he attributed the penetration of Hezbollah's leadership structure to the ""last four chiefs of the Mossad and the military chiefs. ""Israel's foreign intelligence agency, the Mossad, built these abilities over the years,"" he said.

He also claimed that Netanyahu also ""strained relations with the U.S. in an unprecedented way. His performance is full of ungratefulness. The U.S. sent air carriers and the U.S. provided $14 billion in extra military aid and resupplied ammunition. Without that, Israel could not sustain one year against Gaza and now Lebanon and also Iran.""

Melman also noted that Bibi has failed to secure the freedom of 101 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza.

Caroline Glick, who served as an adviser to Netanyahu, took issue with criticism against him, pointing out, ""Prime Minister Netanyahu's leadership in this war is a case study in tenacity and courage. Israel's other political leaders and military leadership all demanded that he capitulate to continuous pressure from the Biden-Harris administration to stand down and permit Hamas to survive and accept Hezbollah's continued presence on the border, sufficing with an entirely defensive posture.""

She continued, ""Had Israel agreed, its regional standing would have completely collapsed. He refused. His tenacious refusal to give up the fight and determination to fight to victory is the reason Israel has been able to turn the corner. Israel is winning today in a way that seemed unimaginable a year ago. We never would have made it to this turning point had it not been for Netanyahu."""

October 7th was the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust. Hamas invaded Israel, murdering people at random, raping, destroying homes and kidnapping people back to Gaza. There are more than 100 still held hostage, including four Americans.

Raw and hurting, American Jews watched the streets of U.S. cities fill up with crowds. The people in the streets weren't marching to stand with the slaughtered and the raped. They were gleeful, exuberant and there were many of them.

In New York's Times Square, hundreds of people gathered on October 8, while Israel was still sorting through their dead, and counting how many children and elderly had been kidnapped, to flash swastikas and chant ""death to Israel"" as well as ""700,"" the number of Israeli dead counted at the time. That number was later revised to 1,195.

AS OCTOBER 7TH ANNIVERSARY APPROACHES, JEWISH STUDENTS BRACE FOR PROTESTS, VOW TO 'WALK PROUDLY'

In Los Angeles, it's been nearly a year of violent protests outside synagogues and in Jewish neighborhoods. One Jewish man was killed after a confrontation in November.

It seemed like antisemitism was festering all over the country.

But a closer look showed that it wasn't, actually, happening everywhere, it was very specifically happening in places primarily run by Democrats. It's not that antisemitism can't exist in red areas. It can, it does. Vandalism, verbal harassment, even physical assault can happen in Republican-led places. But the occurrence is far rarer and the real difference is the consequences.

According to the Anti Defamation League (ADL) ""The states with the highest number of incidents were California (1,266), New York (1,218), New Jersey (830), Florida (463) and Massachusetts (440)."" Four of those states are blue states. In my red home state of Florida, we had approximately the same number of incidents as Massachusetts while having about three times the population and a third of the incidents of New York despite having over 2 million more people.

The ADL is a left-leaning Jewish organization, and yet they admit, ""On a per capita basis, the states with the highest concentration of antisemitic incidents were New Jersey - with 8.93 incidents per 100,000 residents - followed by Vermont (6.64), Massachusetts (6.28), New York (6.23), Maryland (5.49) and Connecticut (5.09). On the city level, two cities - Manhattan (26.84 per 100,000) and Washington, D.C. (25.75 per 100,000) - stood out with far and away the highest levels of incidents per capita. Brookyln [sic], NY, stood out specifically in terms of physical assault incidents, with 1.16 assaults per 100,000 residents."" Again, all deep blue states and cities.

The argument to defend the blue states, and their rampant antisemitism, is that Jews primarily live in those blue states, so of course, antisemitism will be higher. But that doesn't explain Florida's low count. It's also hard not to notice that Mississippi had 19 incidents of vandalism and harassment while New Hampshire had 35 when they each have under 1% of their population being Jewish and Mississippi is nearly double New Hampshire's population. There is a pattern, and it's related to whom the population elects.

Antisemitism simply does not thrive in red areas the same way as it does in areas dominated by Democrats. Jew-hatred, and the chaos that accompanies it onto our streets is put down as quickly as it surfaces in places like Florida.

Last October, Dr. Ahmed ElKoussa was fired from his job as a Miami dentist after ripping down posters of kidnapped hostages being held by Hamas. Anti-Israel agitators protested outside Real-Time Laboratories, an American company which is a subsidiary of an Israeli weapons manufacturer, in Boca Raton, but were met with even more pro-Israel protesters. When the anti-Israel protesters got violent, Boca Raton Police immediately took action and made arrests.

And in May, when anti-Israel protesters pulled their usual move of attempting to block a highway in Orlando, they lasted a total of 11 minutes before Florida Highway Patrol arrested them. Governor Ron DeSantis boasted, ""I think that's the world record.""

Meanwhile, in New York, the Manhattan district attorney has dropped all charges against the violent anti-Israel protesters who occupied Columbia University's Hamilton Hall. In California, protesters have spent the last year blocking traffic for the Palestinian cause. Only some incidents yielded arrests. In March, protesters stopped traffic outside San Francisco International Airport and blocked security lines inside for four hours. No one was arrested. This simply does not happen in red states.

School campuses in red states were relatively quiet, while Ivy League campuses in the northeast featured Jewish students being told to ""go back to Poland"" and assaulted. The protests that did spring up on red state campuses were quickly brought under control.

Antisemitism simply does not thrive in red areas the same way as it does in areas dominated by Democrats. Jew-hatred, and the chaos that accompanies it onto our streets is put down as quickly as it surfaces in places like Florida.

It was obvious to the students at some of the red-state universities that the protests were about Israel, yes, but they were about America too. U.S. flags were often torn down and replaced with Palestinian flags. At the University of North Carolina, fraternity brothers protected an American flag from being defaced, while at Princeton University, protesting students halted a Memorial Day parade because it featured an American flag.

Open antisemitism exposes a deep rot in societies and the hatred of Jews for the last year has caused many to notice that the same people hate America too. History is filled with examples of governments and societies that no longer exist because succumbing to the world's oldest hatred was a clear sign that their civilization was on a downhill trajectory. What is happening in blue cities is exposing their own decay.

Cities, like New York, that had been prospering not so long ago have had a hard time bouncing back from the bad policies enacted during the COVID-19 pandemic coupled with the rolling back of crime policies during the Bill de Blasio administration. Antisemitism is a symptom of a larger problem and places that control antisemitic activity can count on flourishing in a way that places that don't won't. Jew-hatred can happen anywhere, the acceptance of it does not."

One year ago, Iran took a gamble and started a war in Gaza with the attack by Hamas that killed nearly 1,200 Israelis, including over 40 Americans, and took more than 200 hostages

A year later, it is clear that Iran is losing this war.

For his part, Ayatollah Khamenei on Friday, October 4, 2024, remembered the massacre as ""logical and legal"" and used his first public Friday sermon in five years to proclaim that Iran ""won't back down."" He also had a rifle at the podium. He's that worried.

ISRAELI MILITARY KILLS 250 HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS SINCE START OF LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN LEBANON

You can measure the defeat of Iran in two ways. The first is restoring Israel's security and carrying out the military destruction of Iran's terror agents Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and more.

Israeli strikes of the past several weeks have brought this goal closer.

Second, getting Israel and Saudi Arabia back on track toward normalizing relations will be the ultimate defeat for Iran.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

Iran couldn't stand it.

Last fall, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman were in serious, quiet negotiations. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan wrote in his Foreign Affairs article that the work toward joint infrastructure projects and new partnerships between Israel and its Arab neighbors was ""bearing fruit.""

""Every day we get closer,"" bin Salman said in an interview aired Sep. 20, 2023.

""We can forge a historic peace between Israel and Saudi Arabia,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said to President Joe Biden during a televised meeting in New York on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly sessions that same day.

The impending deal included a significant Palestinian component of concessions by Israel. ""It is not a done deal and there are many variables, but the odds are more than 50%,"" a senior Israeli official told Axios at the time.

Diplomacy was bubbling along, with Netanyahu invited to Washington, D.C., at the end of the year.

You can imagine how that went over in Tehran.

Less than two weeks later, Iran gave ""the green light for the assault at a meeting in Beirut"" on Monday, Oct. 2, 2023, sending word to Hamas and Hezbollah, according to the Wall Street Journal.

The objective was to force Israel into a war to blacken its reputation and scorch any path to peace.

To do it, Iran coached Hamas to change tactics.

Just three years earlier, in May 2021, Hamas waged an all-out missile war with huge salvoes to overwhelm Israel's missile defenses, to no avail. Even with the incredibly brief warning times characteristic of short-range launches, Israel's multi-layered defensive system held. Of course, the Israeli Air Force hit weapons caches and launch sites. Egypt stepped in to broker the ceasefire.

This time, the kind of war sought by Iran would have to go beyond missile attacks.

Officers of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps began specific planning with Hamas for the attack in August 2023. The goal was ""the most significant breach of Israel's borders since the 1973 Yom Kippur War,"" the Journal reported Oct. 8, 2023.

And so it was. Note Iran was content to let the civilians of Gaza pay a terrible price being caught of the middle of a war zone.

Most of the Hamas military structure in Gaza was destroyed by the spring of 2024. Biden offered a ceasefire on May 30. Hamas toyed with agreement, but this time there would be no ceasefire despite strenuous efforts by Egypt and Qatar. Iran wasn't ready.

Enter Hezbollah. A surge in rocket attacks across the alleged UN ""blue line"" effectively saw Hezbollah take the lead in fighting. Now, Israel would have to contend with Hezbollah, too. The war entered a new phase with the July 30 killing of Ismail Haniyeh, head of the Hamas Politburo, in Tehran itself.

Israel's systematic campaign has decimated Hezbollah's leadership, culminating with the pager attacks and the death of Hassan Nasrallah. Israel's strikes in Lebanon are now attempting to restore border safety.

A year after the initial attack, Iran is the loser by any military standard. Two big missile attacks on Israel have been thwarted. The military advantage rests with Israel. However, I suspect more strikes on legitimate military and infrastructure targets to reduce Iran's power may be required.

Despite Israel's military successes, dangers remain. For a year, the American military has done everything President Joe Biden asked in the name of deterrence. This includes steps that made sense: U.S. Navy destroyers intercepting Iran's missiles, aircraft carriers and F-22s deployed with strike options. And measures that didn't, such as the Gaza aid pier. The bottom line is 40,000 U.S. forces deployed to the U.S. Central Command region, all to keep a lid on Iran. That can't go on forever (although China would like it).

The path ahead depends on restoring Israel's security and taking out Iran's capabilities. After that, the goal is to get back to the normalization of relations between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a goal shared by the Trump and Biden administrations. It's not easy - the two-state dilemma remains. But it is the one sure way to defeat Iran, for good.

Of all the vile causes for the Hamas attack, the strategic tipping point came because Saudi Arabia and Israel were close to a historic normalization of relations.

And it's important for Americans to stay committed to Israel's security and to the diplomatic goals, despite the pain caused by the shock unleashing of antisemitism. Too many 21st Century Americans turned out to be biased, ignorant, susceptible to foreign instigation, or all of the above. We Americans have to do better than this.

Don't forget that in the words of the Justice Department's Indictment of Hamas, the government of Iran's regional and global campaign of terrorism aims to ""weaken and ultimately destroy both the United States and Israel.""

America's best interest remains to support Israel - and take all military steps necessary to get back to the regional diplomacy that will shut down Iran for good."
New Jersey high school allegedly banned yellow ribbons honoring Israeli hostages: 'Deeply offensive',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/new-jersey-high-school-allegedly-banned-yellow-ribbons-honoring-israeli-hostages-deeply-offensive,2024-10-07T09:06:55Z,"October 7th Nova festival survivor Millet Ben Haim shares the harsh reality of the Israel-Hamas war as the one-year anniversary nears.

A New Jersey high school is accused of banning yellow ribbons, aimed at honoring Israeli hostages abducted by Hamas, at a club fair, a move critics described as ""deeply offensive"" and ""blatant antisemitism.""

Fair Lawn High School also prohibited Israeli flags at the event, because administrators believed the flags were too political, some parents and the group StopAntisemitism allege, noting that members of the Muslim Student Association were permitted to display a keffiyeh, a traditional headdress worn by men from parts of the Middle East, according to the New York Post.

The event, according to the report, was partly promoting a trip to Israel.

""What happened at Fair Lawn High School is an alarming case of hypocrisy and blatant antisemitism,"" StopAntisemitism founder Liora Rez told the outlet. ""This incident is nothing short of a direct violation of Jewish students' rights to express their identity and humanitarian concerns.""

AMERICAN FATHER OF HAMAS HOSTAGE ITAY CHEN PUSHES US, ISRAEL ON 'PLAN B' AS NEGOTIATIONS FALTER

Between 33% to 40% of the 35,000 residents in Fair Lawn are Jewish. Fair Lawn in Bergen County is located about 17 miles from New York City.

This comes a year after Hamas terrorists' Oct. 7, 2023, attacks against Israel, which led to military retaliation from Israel and sparked a still-ongoing war in the Middle East. More than 250 people, including some Americans, were abducted by Hamas during the Oct. 7 attacks. Many hostages have since been released, rescued or killed, while dozens are still held by Hamas.

One parent said the school district's failure to address complaints about alleged antisemitism is not a new concern.

""The incident at Fair Lawn High School's Club Fair is not an isolated event but part of a disturbing pattern of antisemitism that I and other parents have been battling for years,"" Adi Vaxman, founder and president of Operation Israel, which provides humanitarian relief to Israel, told the New York Post.

""Despite numerous meetings with the board of education and the superintendent, promises of inclusion in anti-antisemitism efforts have gone unfulfilled,"" added Vaxman, whose daughter Maya attends the school.

Vaxman continued: ""The administrator's claim that the yellow hostage ribbon -- a humanitarian symbol calling for the release of innocent civilians abducted from their homes and held in subhuman conditions by Hamas -- is 'political' is deeply offensive and unacceptable.""

ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF OCT. 7 ATTACKS ARRIVES WITH LASTING TRAUMA FOR ISRAELIS, AMERICAN JEWS: EXPERT

Claiming a double standard, Vaxman said that the black-and-white keffiyeh, which she says is ""a symbol of the armed resistance against Israelis,"" was allowed to remain on display at the club event for hours.

""This glaring double standard exposes the bias of the school and the administrator in question,"" she said. ""It's alarming that the school supports the Muslim Student Association identifying as Palestinian while censoring the Israeli flag for the Jewish Student Union. Israel is the world's only Jewish state, naturally associated with Judaism and relevant to the [Jewish Student Union's] advertised trip to Israel.""

Fair Lawn High Principal Paul Gorski released a statement defending the school's response to ribbons and flags.

""We take pride in our Student Activities program as well as the leadership shown by both students and faculty,"" Gorski wrote. ""During this year's event, both the Muslim Student Association and the Jewish Student Union were asked to adjust items that were not part of their original displays. Both groups received the same instruction and were treated equally.""

Gorski said no students were disciplined in connection with their participation at the club fair.

The principal also said the high school participates in the Anti-Defamation League's ""No Place for Hate"" initiative and that the school was ""proudly recognized"" with a Gold Star distinction from the group during a ceremony earlier this year.

""We condemn antisemitism and remain steadfast in our commitment to creating an inclusive community where hate is not tolerated,"" he said. ""When we return to school after being closed for the Jewish holidays, we will engage in dialogue with our students and community. Hate has no home at Fair Lawn High School.""

Vaxman, however, maintains that the school discriminated against Jewish students during the club fair.

""This selective application of rules further demonstrates the discriminatory treatment of Jewish students,"" Vaxman said. ""The school's response is extremely disappointing and fails to address these core issues. Their participation in the 'No Place for Hate' initiative rings hollow when Jewish students face such blatant discrimination and intimidation in their school on a regular basis. We demand concrete actions, not empty platitudes, to combat antisemitism and ensure true equality for 'all' students."""
"American father of Hamas hostage Itay Chen pushes US, Israel on 'Plan B' as negotiations falter",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-father-hamas-hostage-itay-chen-pushes-us-israel-plan-b-negotiations-falter,2024-10-07T08:16:30Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

""When was the last time you talked to your kid? Do you know where he slept last night? Do you know what he ate? Do you know if he had a blanket on him?"" Ruby Chen, father of Itay Chen who was taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, asked in a sit-down interview with Fox News Digital.

""All those types of questions are questions that we ask ourselves constantly,"" he said. ""The feeling is that we've been failed.""

Itay,19 years old when he was taken, has remained a hostage held in Gaza for 365 days after his unit in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was attacked in southern Israel when Hamas terrorists flooded the border in a series of mass assaults.

Chen, a New York City native, said he and his wife have been given ""unprecedented"" access to the White House, the CIA and other top agencies throughout the last year to discuss ongoing strategies to try and get the hostages out of Gaza.

ISRAEL SAYS TOP HAMAS RAFAH BRIGADE 'DISMANTLED' ON PHILADELPHI CORRIDOR, 2,000 TERRORISTS KILLED

The Chens have not only met with national security adviser Jake Sullivan a dozen times, as well as CIA Director William Burns and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, they also hold a weekly call with the White House.

But ultimately, these supportive efforts have fallen flat when it comes to the real needs of American families whose loved ones are still held hostage by Hamas.

""We have been failed by the Israeli government, we, as U.S. citizens, feel we've been failed by the Biden administration despite all of the access that they've provided us,"" he explained. ""They share as much as they can. But at the end of the day, it's... very black and white.

""Where is he?""

Chen explained that following the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, the Israeli government pushed a strategy to secure the release of the then 251 hostages by bombarding suspected Hamas positions in Gaza.

In the initial weeks following the deadly Hamas attacks, Israel began pounding northern Gaza - a move Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believed would bring Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar ""to his knees"" and make him be ""willing to release hostages.""

A week-long cease-fire in November saw the release of 105 hostages. Twelve other hostages have been freed following negotiations during the immediate aftermath of the attack, or because of IDF rescue operations between February and August.

YAZIDI WOMAN HELD HOSTAGE FOR 10 YEARS IN GAZA RESCUED IN ISRAEL, US OPERATION

None of the eight American hostages that were kidnapped have been released, and only seven continue to be held by Hamas after the body of Hersh Goldberg-Polin was discovered by IDF forces in late August, after he along with five others were killed by the terrorist group.

More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in the Gaza Strip - 97 of whom were abducted on Oct. 7, 2023.

The Chens, other American families and the international community have repeatedly urged Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire agreement and return all hostages to their families.

But disagreements over security corridors in Gaza have created a seemingly insurmountable hurdle as U.S., Egyptian and Qatari officials work to get Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement.

The father of the IDF soldier pointed out that so long as no one is discussing a ""day after"" plan for the Gaza Strip and the Palestinians there, Hamas will continue to hold tightly to its most powerful bargaining chip, the hostages.

""Where is Hamas in the day-after? And if no one is willing to talk about it, then Hamas believes that they are better off holding on to the hostages until something changes,"" he explained. ""It's a jihad organization. They wish to have chaos. They are looking for a regional conflict.

""When they see that there's now a conflict with Lebanon, that does not motivate them to get into a cease-fire agreement. On the contrary, they wish to belong, and have other players join in this jihad against Israel,"" Chen continued. ""So I question, what is the plan?""

""I am very critical of the time,"" Itay's father said. ""The last 10 months, I've been asking Mr. Sullivan, What's plan B?

""I haven't heard of a Plan B. And that's unacceptable,"" he added.

BLINKEN TRAVELS TO EGYPT FOR CEASE-FIRE TALKS AS ISRAEL ADDS NEW WAR GOAL

Securing peace in the region became even more precarious last week after Israel, against the objections of the U.S. and its international allies, launched an incursion into southern Lebanon with the expressed intent of dismantling the threat posed by Hezbollah.

Chen pointed out that this second front not only added another dimension to securing the release of the hostages, but it also seemingly pushed talks with Hamas on the backburner as concerns remain high over a broader regional conflict.

""If you could follow the news, you could see that the hostage issue has been less prioritized,"" he said. ""And that's a very difficult feeling for us and the families.""

Netanyahu has said his top priority is securing the release of the hostages, but his refusal to withdraw from the Philidelphi Corridor due to security reasons has created a negotiation impasse and questions have begun to mount over whether the prime minister is truly prioritizing the hostages over his push to ""eliminate Hamas.""

But the parents of Itay - who has been described as a ""fun-loving kid,"" the ""sandwich"" of the family with an older sibling and younger sibling, everybody's ""best friend,"" and a former Boy Scout turned a young man with a loving girlfriend - cannot allow for him, or the others still in Gaza, to be at the mercy of any political agenda.

""I'm a guy that comes from New York City - and we talk less, we look at actions. The actions of the last year show the opposite."" Chen said. ""He can say whatever he wants. I don't believe a thing that comes out of his mouth, I believe in what he does.""

The father of three also urged the Biden administration to question whether it is still in the U.S.'s strategic interest to unequivocally back Netanyahu.

""There is no accountability from either side for failed negotiation. You do not see any equation that says, 'OK, if you do not do A, then there's a consequence' on either side,"" Chen said in reference to both Israel and Hamas. ""There's no consequence associated with a negative action to a strategic interest of the United States.""

Chen also argued that ""effective pressure"" needs to be put on Hamas by reevaluating what other ""pressure points"" can be utilized.

The father pointed to the clear need for tougher economic and diplomatic involvement when it comes to international aid sent to Gaza - including tougher sanctions not only on adversarial nations but on partner countries that allow aid to flow into Gaza.

This includes stricter oversight of United Nations-provided humanitarian aid, which though intended for the Palestinian people, is falling into the hands of Hamas, a group that is not designated as a terrorist organization by the UN.

Hamas has long been accused of seizing basic goods in Gaza and then reselling them in a black-market scheme at exuberant prices.

Reports have further indicated that Hamas for years has had substantial access to monetary aid siphoned from funds provided by top organizations like the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which has been directly used for combatant operations against Israel, including tunnel building and access to arms.

But aside from the substantial need to address aid-based concerns, Chen also argued that diplomatic solutions are not being fully recognized by the U.S.

Nations like Russia and Thailand secured the release of their citizens taken by Hamas, and Chen argued Washington - which was able to negotiate with its biggest adversary just months ago to free U.S. citizens from Russian prisons - should be working to do the same to secure the release of those held in Gaza.

""So, it's possible,"" Chen said. ""Complicated, yep. Doable, yep.""

""The assumption that was put in front of us at the beginning was that U.S. hostages will come out via a larger deal that Israel will be a part of. And if that assumption is not working out after a year, then yes, we need to challenge the administration and look at that assumption."
Fox Nation's 'Black Saturday' with Trey Yingst takes viewers inside horrific events of October 7,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/fox-nations-black-saturday-trey-yingst-takes-viewers-inside-horrific-events-october-7,2024-10-06T12:20:32Z,"Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst's new book, which is available now, provides a riveting, on-the-ground account of the devastating Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel.

A three-part docuseries of the same name, based on Yingst's book, is streaming now on Fox Nation, with a condensed version airing on Fox News Channel on Sunday night at 10 pm ET.

Yingst began writing ""Black Saturday: An Unfiltered Account of the October 7th Attack on Israel and the War in Gaza"" during the immediate aftermath of Hamas' horrific assault. At the same time, he was also working to provide Fox News viewers with the latest information from southern Israel and Gaza.

Yingst told Fox News Digital he feels the book is unique because it was penned in the field by a correspondent who was ""living this story"" in real time.

ANTONY BLINKEN DOES VICTORY LAP ON BIDEN-HARRIS 'STRONGER' FOREIGN POLICY SAME DAY IRAN ATTACKS ISRAEL

""'Black Saturday' is the gold standard in storytelling when it comes to what took place on October 7 in southern Israel and the war that followed,"" Yingst said from Tel Aviv.

""A massacre against the civilian population of Israel unfolded in the early hours of October 7, when Hamas militants crossed the border from the Gaza Strip into the communities that line Gaza in southern Israel, and it killed soldiers and civilians alike and dragged more than 240 hostages back into Gaza,"" he continued. ""'Black Saturday' talks about our experience, the Fox News team in Jerusalem responding to that attack.""

Yingst and his team reported from the Gaza border area as the attack unfolded.

""'Black Saturday' tells that story, and then the stories of the soldiers and the police officers and the civilians in southern Israel who were trying to make sense of what was unfolding, and then take the fight back to Hamas inside Gaza, along with the stories of Palestinian civilians who were directly affected by this conflict and continue to be affected today,"" he said.

Yingst has extensive sources inside the Israeli military, along with inside Hamas' senior leadership. He also speaks to Palestinian civilians in Gaza on a regular basis, and Israeli civilians who are waiting for their loved ones to come home after being taken hostage.

""This book really captures all of those angles. It is a book about Israelis. It is a book about Palestinians. It is a book about October 7 and the war that followed, and it is a book about humans,"" Yingst said.

He details the horrifying ordeal at the start of the book and shows readers the risks that reporters take to bring critical information to the world.

""The soldiers that we were with got lost, and they were driving through areas that hadn't been cleared, that Hamas was routinely operating in, firing RPGs, anti-tank missiles and small arms fire at Israeli soldiers in the weeks prior, and we had no way out. We were stuck in that moment, and as I open this book, 'Black Saturday,' I talk about this moment,"" he said.

""I truly thought this could be it,"" Yingst continued. ""This could be the moment that I die.""

For the project, Yingst interviewed a range of people to include multiple perspectives, including Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant, high-ranking IDF soldiers, Hamas official Dr. Basem Naim and Gazan journalist Nael Ghaboun.

""I think that when you read it, you will learn more about what that morning was like for Israelis who were living through hell on Earth. You'll learn more about the behind-the-scenes reporting that we did to bring that story to our viewers under fire in real time,"" Yingst said.

""Black Saturday,"" the latest offering from Fox News Books, also includes 16 pages of full-color photographs.

The Fox Nation series based on the book of the same name includes Yingst and the Fox Jerusalem Bureau team racing to cover the devastating terror attack, the team experiencing the haunting aftermath of horrific massacres throughout the Israeli communities along the Gaza border and the Fox News chief foreign correspondent entering the Gaza Strip during the Israeli ground invasion."
'There is no life' after Oct 7: An Israeli mother grapples with grief one year after Hamas' devastating attack,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/there-no-life-after-oct-7-israeli-mother-grapples-grief-one-year-after-hamas-devastating-attack,2024-10-06T11:06:34Z,"Sigal Shemer, an Israeli mother from Lod, Israel, opens up about the murder of her eldest son on Oct. 7 and how she's navigating her grief one year later.

Sigal Shemer headed to the cemetery in Lod, a city in central Israel, in late September to wash her son's headstone and place flowers on his grave.

Ron, her eldest son, was murdered by Hamas terrorists on Oct. 7, 2023, after the militant group launched an early morning attack on southern Israel, killing roughly 1,200 people and taking more than 250 as hostages, according to estimates from Israeli authorities.

Numbers compiled by Fox News indicate an estimated 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza, almost 365 days later, including seven Americans.

Sigal reflected on the death of her son and the enduring impact of Oct. 7, one year later, in an interview with Fox News Digital.

Trauma has reshaped her life and left an indelible mark on her family, but she's found some solace and hope through the Jerusalem-based nonprofit OneFamily, which offers support and resources to victims of terror. Through community outreach, the organization has become a lifeline, helping her navigate the complexities of her sorrow while honoring her son's memory, amid a background of ongoing violence and loss.

Ron had been attending the Nova music festival in Re'im when the carnage unfolded, running with his friends to a car to escape the sound of gunshots in the area and the horror that was beginning to take place.

But the 23-year-old didn't want to leave without two of his close friends. He opted not to get into the car and instead went to look for Dan and Omar. Soon after he found them, the trio went inside a shelter not far from the festival.

HAMAS TERRORISTS 'SYSTEMATICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY' COMMITTED SEXUAL VIOLENCE DURING OCT. 7 ATTACK: REPORT

""He told to a friend, 'Don't be afraid. I will attack if someone will come in. I will attack them, and I will take care of you.' But the terrorists dropped three grenades into the shelter,"" his mother told Fox News Digital.

Dan was killed, Omar survived and Ron was taken outside, where he was heard fighting and struggling with Hamas militants. He wasn't heard from for days and his family feared he had been taken hostage.

""One week after, there was a knock on the door, and they told us -- the army and the police told us -- that Ron is... is not... is not alive because they shot him in the head,"" Sigal said.

She took a moment to remove her glasses and wipe away the tears from her eyes. The death of her son is still palpable and raw for the mother of two, who is survived by her husband Oren, and younger son Bari.

Sigal remembered Ron as a young man who loved people and animals, loved to travel and loved to help others.

He was a counselor at a Jewish youth summer camp in Pennsylvania, where he taught children Muay Thai, a form of boxing and the national sport of Thailand.

Since his murder, the Shemer family has returned to the camp, meeting with those who knew Ron and visiting all of his favorite places in the United States.

Before Oct. 7, Ron was on a 10-month trip to South America and Sigal feared for his safety.

""All the time, I was afraid that something will happen to him because it's, you know, in Brazil, the Amazonas, Colombia -- places that -- they're not so safe. And I tell him, please come home, please come home. It's not safe there. So, he came home and it's not safe here. It's not safe to be here,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""The terrorists, the monster... came inside the country and killed and murdered and raped and burned a lot of people, innocent people.""

""There is no life. I think there is no life. There is no life from the 7th of October,"" she added.

Sigal was working as an event producer prior to the day that's now known as ""Black Saturday."" She's since left her job, consumed by grief, and now works two days a week taking care of dogs, something her son loved to do.

""I want people to know that my son and all of the murdered boys and girls on the 7th of October are lost for the world,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""Many people in Israel lost their sons and daughters for nothing. Just for nothing.""

OneFamily Fund has provided support to many families whose loved ones were murdered in the worst attack on the Jewish people since the Holocaust.

Naomi Nussbaum, OneFamily's executive director, told Fox News Digital how they use different types of therapy to help families cope with the loss of a loved one.

""We offer three types of support: Emotional support, financial support and legal aid. We've given out much, much more financial aid now than before because of the kind of devastation, you know, the nature of the attack on October 7th,"" she said.

""There's traditional therapy with psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers, trauma-informed therapists tackling PTSD throughout all the categories. Dealing with PTSD is the most insidious and difficult part of the terror attacks to deal with. Then, we have the social network, which is really the heart and soul of OneFamily.""

Sigal has met with other mothers whose children were murdered and said it's not an easy thing to do, but it's helpful to speak with someone who's suffering from a similar situation and going through the same stages of grief.

""We're like professional friends for life. And the other people in the group that we put her with will be there also. You know, she can call anybody at any time to have dinner or to go for a walk or for a birthday or the anniversary of a death. They'll be there for each other forever,"" said Nussbaum.

""It takes a lot of courage and strength to smile again for the first time or to take a little bit of joy to say, let's go out to dinner tonight. Sometimes, the guilt and the grief and bereavement is too strong, and people can't do that. So, OneFamily, really with open arms and a lot of love, does everything they can to get them to want to come back to life again.""

A State Department spokesperson told Fox News Digital in Israel's nearly 12-month-long war against Hamas, more than 41,000 Palestinians have been killed, including more than 6,200 women and 11,300 children.

The Hamas-run Gaza Ministry of Health does not distinguish between civilians and combatants in its count.

Political commentator and Democratic strategist Ameshia Cross warned that Vice President Harris is facing warning signs among Arab and Muslim communities, especially in key battleground states like Michigan.

""It's very tenuous at this point,"" Cross said of Harris' support among the Arab community on CNN Friday. ""I think that what we saw over the summer and prior to that with the campus uprisings across the country, we heard from young people who are very concerned, but also saw that certain college presidents lost their jobs and we've seen the community over and over again, specifically the uncommitted vote, call out where President Biden as well as Vice President Harris are on this issue.""

Some Harris allies have also signaled concern at Harris' support in Michigan, with Democratic Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin telling donors that Harris is ""underwater"" with voters in Michigan, per audio obtained by Axios.

""I think that at this point there has to be especially a concern in Michigan because you have such a large population of Arab voters,"" she said.

""But in addition to that, we've seen this really affect younger voters and their preferences as well,"" Cross continued, also advising Harris that she should ""take a very clear stance on what will happen, how the U.S. will continue to move forward, are we in support of watching thousands of innocent Palestinians continue to die in this war?""

Some recent polls also indicate that former President Donald Trump may be closing in on Harris in the key battleground states of both Michigan and neighboring Wisconsin. Harris received 48% of support among likely Michigan voters in a New York Times/Siena College poll this week, while Trump garnered 47% support in the poll -- effectively locking the pair in a tie well within the poll's margin of error.

Newly revealed emails show senior military officials raised concerns with the White House within days of Israel commencing its operation in Gaza.

Reuters obtained and examined emails between senior State Department and Pentagon officials between Oct. 11-14 that showed concern and alarm as Israel started hitting the Gaza Strip with missile strikes.

The emails specifically focused on the mass evacuation of Palestinians as a potential legal issue. Dana Stroul, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East at the time, wrote to senior Biden aides Oct. 13 and warned that Israel could face war crime charges for its actions.

The emails also include pressure to include messages of sympathy for the Palestinian people and to allow more aid into Gaza while seeking to remain in solidarity with Israel.

ISRAELI MILITARY KILLS 250 HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS SINCE START OF LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN LEBANON

Israel's invasion of Gaza has proven polarizing and painful for the Democrats. The progressive wing and younger voters are trying to hold the Biden administration to account for its support of Israel as tens of thousands of Palestinians die.

The invasion also made it difficult -- if not impossible -- for aid groups to help the displaced residents of Gaza who fled their homes to avoid getting caught up in Israel's operations.

Stroul outright alleged that Israel could be ""close to committing war crimes"" after the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) dropped leaflets over northern Gaza urging residents to flee their homes ahead of the military rolling into the territory as part of the early ""targeted incursions.""

""Their main line is that it is impossible for one million civilians to move this fast,"" Stroul wrote. One official said that such an operation was not possible without creating a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""

Three senior U.S. officials argued the White House was slow to address these problems, with Biden's team at one point arguing that the U.S. was ""leading international efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza,"" which would remain a ""top priority.""

Bill Russo, at the time an assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of Global Public Affairs, attempted to drive home the long-term impact of the U.S.'s ""lack of response on the humanitarian conditions"" in Gaza, calling it ""ineffective and counterproductive"" while also harming relations with Arab nations.

""If this course is not quickly reversed by not only messaging, but action, it risks damaging our stance in the region for years to come,"" Russo wrote in one email, according to Reuters. A colleague forwarded his emails to White House officials and warned that ""otherwise would-be stalwart"" Arab partners might think twice about relations with the U.S.

Russo eventually resigned from his post in March 2024, citing personal reasons for his decision.

Far-left voters have placed the fate of Gaza front and center of their concerns approaching November's election. The voters of Michigan started an ""uncommitted"" protest vote during the Democratic primary as a means of venting frustration at the Biden administration's handling of the crisis.

Those same voters shredded Harris for her DNC speech in August, calling it ""horrible"" and accusing Harris of ""downplaying"" U.S. complicity in the Gaza invasion by providing Israel funding and weapons.

TOP STORY: With the first anniversary of October 7 fast approaching, universities and college students are bracing for renewed anti-Israel demonstrations on campuses across the United States. In particular, the National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) is orchestrating a nationwide ""Week of Rage"" on campuses beginning Monday.

VIDEO: Comedian and pro-Israel influencer Zach Sage Fox believes an interview he filmed in the West Bank could show Americans how Palestinian civilians truly feel about Jewish people - but it took him months to recover the footage after he was threatened to delete it. Watch it here:

COME AGAIN, CHRISTINE?: CNN chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour insisted Tuesday that Iran does not want conflict to escalate with Israel or the United States, and that Tehran felt it had ""no choice"" but to strike the Jewish state after Israel took out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon last week. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan disagreed, calling the attack ""a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event.""

GRADING ON A CURVE: Harvard University went easy on students whose antisemitic conduct violated its own policies, according to the House Education and the Workforce Committee, which probed anti-Israel college protests in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. Of 68 students disciplined, none are currently suspended, 52 remain in ""good standing,"" 15 are not, and one is on leave. The committee said it believes Harvard is in violation of Title VI, which forbids ""a hostile environment based on race, color, or national origin.""

HUGH HEWITT: Vice President Kamala Harris sent a very public message to her anti-Israel supporters when she skipped Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit this summer. And ever since, Netanyahu has embraced a different strategy, from his fiery address the United Nations General Assembly last week, to taking the war to Hamas and Hezbollah.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: ""This October 7, as I mourn the innocent lives lost and pray for the brave men and women of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who continue to fight, I will walk proudly and be a tribute, a public voice of remembrance, for all those beautiful souls who were stolen from us too soon.""

"FIFA to investigate Israel, days after Iran attacks, for alleged discrimination due to Palestinian complaints",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/fifa-investigate-israel-alleged-discrimination-after-palestinian-complaints,2024-10-03T22:49:54Z,"Rep. Tim Burchett, R-Tenn., says the Biden-Harris administration is ""out of step"" with the conflict in the Middle East.

FIFA, the world governing body of soccer, intends to launch an investigation against the Israel Football Association (IFA) over allegations raised by the Palestinian Football Association (PFA), it announced on Thursday.

FIFA's disciplinary committee will be asked to look into allegations of discrimination as the PFA has accused the IFA of complicity in violations of international law by the Israeli government, discrimination against Arab players and inclusion in its league of clubs located in Palestinian territory.

""The FIFA Disciplinary Committee will be mandated to initiate an investigation into the alleged offense of discrimination raised by the Palestine Football Association,"" FIFA said in a statement. ""FIFA's Governance, Audit and Compliance Committee will be entrusted with the mission to investigate... the participation in Israeli competitions of Israeli football teams allegedly based in the territory of Palestine.""

Fox News has reached out to the PFA and IFA for comment.

The PFA previously proposed a suspension for Israel over the war in Gaza. The PFA proposal to 211 member federations called for ""appropriate sanctions, with immediate effect, against Israeli teams,"" according to FIFA documents released this year.

The proposal cited ""international law violations committed by the Israeli occupation in Palestine, particularly in Gaza"" and cited FIFA statutory commitments on human rights and against discrimination.

""All the football infrastructure in Gaza has been either destroyed, or seriously damaged, including the historic stadium of Al-Yarmuk,"" the PFA wrote, adding that it had support for the motion from the federations of Algeria, Iraq, Jordan, Syria and Yemen.

The PFA's proposal was enough to convince FIFA to seek an independent legal council and hold a landmark council meeting to make a decision on whether to suspend Israel from international soccer because of the conflict with Hamas, said FIFA President Gianni Infantino at the FIFA congress in May.

""FIFA will mandate as of now, independent legal expertise to [analyze] the three requests [from the Palestinian FA] and ensure the statutes of FIFA are applied in the right way,"" Infantino said. ""Due to the urgency of the situation, an extraordinary FIFA Council will be convened and will take place before July 20 to review the results of the legal assessment and to take the decisions that are appropriate.""

FIFA said on Thursday that it won't suspend Israel but that the investigation into alleged discrimination will be carried out.

The most recent and prominent example of a country to have its athletes banned from major international sports competition was Russia at the Paris Olympics this summer.

ISRAELI WOMEN'S BASKETBALL TEAMS FLEE GAME AFTER IRANIAN MISSILE STRIKES

Russia was banned because it had invaded Ukraine just four days after the end of the 2022 Winter Olympics. The International Olympic Committee considered this attack a violation of the Olympic truce, which is a resolution that calls for all nations to lay down arms and not engage in conflict starting one week before the Olympics begin and ending one week after the end. The Russian Olympic Committee lost its appeal against its suspension by the International Olympic Committee in February.

Belarus, which was used as a staging ground for the invasion, was also not allowed to compete in Paris.

However, a total of 32 athletes from Russia and Belarus competed in Paris as neutral participants; 17 previously represented Belarus and 15 represented Russia. They were not allowed to boast their country's flag, but they were able to attend the closing ceremony.

Countries have also been banned from competing in the World Cup in the past, but those nation's players were never allowed to compete as neutrals.

Germany and Japan were banned from the 1950 World Cup after the end of World War II. South Africa was banned from 1966 to 1992 for violating FIFA's anti-discrimination charter due to apartheid. Mexico was even banned for two years after using overage players in qualifiers for the 1989 World Youth Championship.

FIFA's announcement comes the same week that Iran launched a massive missile strike against Israeli cities.

Iran's strikes on Israel forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday.

The barrage of aerial warfare was the first time in Israeli history that the country's densely populated cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - in the center of the biblical nation, faced such potentially devastating attacks. The Israeli military said most of the missiles were intercepted, per the Associated Press.

Iran also warned that a retaliatory strike could warrant further ballistic response.

Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said during the Asia Cooperation Dialogue summit this week that Israel must not believe it can act with ""impunity,"" according to Reuters.

""Any type of military attack, terrorist act or crossing our red lines will be met with a decisive response by our armed forces,"" said Pezeshkian.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the heads of the country's security establishment on Wednesday following Iran's firing of 181 missiles into Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

Emir Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani of Qatar was also in attendance at the summit in Doha, where he called the ongoing violence in the Middle East a ""collective genocide"" perpetuated by Israel, according to Reuters.

""It has become crystal clear that what is happening is genocide, in addition to turning the Gaza Strip into an area unfit for human habitation, in preparation for displacement,"" the Qatari monarch said.

The barrage of aerial warfare was the first time in Israeli history that the country's densely populated cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - in the center of the biblical nation, faced such devastating attacks.

The only fatality from the Iranian barrage was the murder of a Palestinian man in the West Bank (known in Israel by its biblical regional name of Judea and Samaria).

President Biden said Wednesday that he would not support an attack by Israel on Iranian nuclear sites in retaliation for Iran's firing of 181 missiles at Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

""We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but all seven of us [G7 nations] agree that they have a right to respond, but they should respond proportionally,"" he said.

But when asked whether he would back Israel striking Iranian nuclear sites as it has long threatened, Biden told reporters, ""The answer is no.""

Watch: Pro-Israel influencer recovers West Bank interview with Palestinian woman he was threatened to delete,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/pro-israel-influencer-recovers-west-bank-interview-with-palestinian-woman-that-he-was-threatened-to-delete,2024-10-03T09:09:30Z,"Zach Sage Fox traveled to the West Bank to see if Palestinian people truly support the Hamas terror group, but he almost didn't make it out alive.

Comedian and pro-Israel influencer Zach Sage Fox believes an interview he filmed in the West Bank could show Americans how Palestinian civilians truly feel about Jewish people - but it took him months to recover the footage after he was threatened to delete it.

Fox has been on a crusade to educate his followers since the terror attacks of October 7. He went viral earlier this year when his ""Gaza Graduation"" video featured anti-Israel protesters in New York City struggling to correctly answer basic questions about the Israel-Hamas war and decided to take his popular man-on-the-street style interviews to the West Bank, a contentious territory that Palestinians hope to establish as an independent state along with the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.

Fox, a ""loud and proud"" Jewish American, told anyone who asked that he was an Italian American and was able to cross the border into the West Bank without issue, because Israelis and Jewish people are not welcomed in the region.

INFLUENCER WENT TO THE WEST BANK TO SEE IF PALESTINIANS SUPPORT HAMAS - HE ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT ALIVE

Fox found several people walking West Bank streets who were quick to express support for the Hamas terror group and declared Israeli hostages should not be released, but things got dicey when he tried to interview a woman whose hair was fully covered. A ""very upset"" Palestinian man approached him and asked him to delete the footage.

""They're not used to anybody questioning their narrative that they've been brainwashed to believe. And you can see it ... I'm interviewing that girl just for several minutes and these men watching it, they can't even accept that you would be asking questions because it's not a free society,"" Fox told Fox News Digital.

Fox recalled the man yelling ""something about modesty,"" and that females shouldn't speak for all Palestinians. Fox attempted to ignore the man, but he only grew more agitated and started calling additional Palestinian men for support. He explained that he caved and deleted the footage when his Muslim cameraman said the angry group was threatening their lives.

Fox initially enlisted a team of IT specialists who were able to recover some of the footage, and every interview that was salvaged made the viral ""Wild West Bank"" video. But his conversation with the woman who sparked the conversation remained lost.

""Dozens of cyberhackers,"" additional IT specialists and even an Israel Defense Forces veteran with a passion for technology all tried unsuccessfully to restore the video. Fox was beginning to lose hope, but was eager to show the world what this woman had to say because she was ""emblematic of the mindset"" in the region.

She was ""clearly educated"" and spoke perfect English, dressed in designer clothes and said she was an engineer. Yet, she believed all Zionist should be killed.

FOX NEWS MEDIA DRAWS 10.4 MILLION FOR SIMULCAST OF THE CBS VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Another technology expert caught wind of the story and offered to help recover the video. Fox thought it was impossible and was reluctant to set himself up for further disappointment but eventually said ""f -- k it"" and gave them a shot.

""A week later I got a call that they recovered almost all of it. It was a miracle,"" Fox said.

Fox then watched the footage and ""couldn't believe his eyes.""

""To see that interview back after three months was insane... I didn't know when my cameraman stopped filming, so I didn't realize, one, that you could see the men starting to pull the other men in the into the thing. I didn't realize you could see that behind me,"" he said.

""I also didn't realize that my cameraman kept the camera going long enough so that you actually saw the people cut the camera off and stop the shoot,"" Fox added. ""So, that was like wild to me.""

Fox then published ""Wild West Bank: Deleted Scenes Exploded,"" allowing the world to see the footage the angry Palestinian men tried to scrub.

VIRAL INFLUENCER ZACH SAGE FOX PUT SPOTLIGHT ON CLUELESS ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS: 'NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING'

In the shocking video, the woman told him that most Palestinians support Hamas, she proudly declared being ""really satisfied"" with footage Hamas terrorists took on Oct. 7. She also denied Hamas killed babies and women during the attack and said no Israelis are ""innocent civilians."" She suggested she is a ""refugee"" despite her family living in the West Bank for multiple generations and flatly dismissed a two-state solution. Along the way, Fox politely pushed back on antisemitic claims and absurd talking points.

""I am an educated person, it's either us or us,"" she said when suggesting Jewish people need to leave Israel for good. When Fox told her there would ""never be peace"" with that mindset, she fired back, ""It's their problem.""

As a man began lurking in the background, Fox asked if she believes Zionists deserve to die.

""Cut, cut real quick,"" the man said. ""What side are you on?""

Fox calmly responded that he was simply asking questions, but the man demanded to know where he was from.

""I'm from the states,"" Fox answered as the man demanded the cameraman stop recording.

The video abruptly cuts off.

NETANYAHU RESPONDS TO HEZBOLLAH ATTACK THAT KILLED CHILDREN AT SOCCER FIELD: 'THIS WILL NOT GO UNANSWERED

Fox feels ""vindicated"" that he was able to share the footage.

""I just think this girl is really representative of how these people think,"" Fox said.

""I feel bad for her, I know that sounds crazy cause she's literally sitting there saying everyone who I love deserves to die,"" he continued. ""But my takeaway is that she's the perfect example of somebody who's not stupid. She's an engineer, she's a smart girl, but she's been brainwashed by the propaganda they're taught in Palestine.""

Earlier this year, the Department of State urged Americans to avoid the West Bank because of ""terrorism and civil unrest.""

Fox remains one of the only Americans to enter the West Bank and try to ask tough questions, but he doesn't believe State Department warnings are the thing keeping America journalists out of the region.

""I genuinely think that they know deep down, whether they want to admit it or not, that they would find... it totally negates their narrative, which is that, you know, 'Hamas is bad, but the Palestinians are separate,'"" Fox said.

""I wish that was the case. I truthfully didn't believe it myself until I went there that day,"" he added. ""They love Hamas."""
Israel bans UN secretary-general over anti-Israel actions: 'Doesn't deserve to set foot on Israeli soil',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israel-bans-un-secretary-general-over-anti-israel-actions-doesnt-deserve-set-foot-israeli-soil,2024-10-02T17:45:29Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The United Nations Security Council (UNSC) met on Wednesday following Iran's unprecedented attack on Israel, but overshadowing the meeting was Israel's announcement that it had banned the U.N. secretary-general due to his failure to condemn Iran.

""Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel does not deserve to step foot on Israeli soil,"" Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz said about the decision to declare U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres as persona non grata.

""This is an anti-Israel secretary-general who lends support to terrorists, rapists and murderers,"" Katz argued. ""Guterres will be remembered as a stain on the history of the U.N. for generations to come.""

Iran on Tuesday fired over 180 ballistic missiles at Israel after the death of Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah and after the Israel Defense Forces began focused incursions into Lebanon to hit the terrorist group.

ISRAEL URGES UN TO CONDEMN IRAN AFTER LATESTS ATTACKS

Guterres on Tuesday issued a brief statement following Iran's attack, calling it the ""latest attacks in the Middle East"" and broadly condemned the conflict as ""escalation after escalation.""

He also slammed Israel for its actions in Gaza and the West Bank, claiming that Israel has ""conducted in Gaza the most deadly and destructive military campaign in my years.""

""The suffering endured by the Palestinian people in Gaza is beyond imagination,"" Guterres said. ""At the same time, the situation in the occupied West Bank, including East Jerusalem, continues to deteriorate, with Israeli military operations.""

""Construction of settlements, evictions, land grabs and the intensification of settler attacks progressively undermine any possibility of a two-state solution, and simultaneously, armed Palestinian groups have also used violence,"" he said.

HAMAS LEADER KILLED IN LEBANON WAS UN EMPLOYEE, AGENCY CONFIRMS

Israel blasted Guterres for failing to ""unequivocally"" condemn Iran's attack or even name Iran while discussing the attack. Israel responded with the persona non grata declaration, effectively banning him from entering its borders.

""Anyone who cannot unequivocally condemn Iran's heinous attack on Israel, as nearly all the countries of the world have done, does not deserve to set foot on Israeli soil,"" Katz said.

""This is a secretary-general who has yet to denounce the massacre and sexual atrocities committed by Hamas murderers on Oct. 7 and has not led any resolutions to declare them a terrorist organization,"" Katz continued.

""A secretary-general who provides support to the terrorists, rapists and murderers of Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis, and now Iran, the mothership of global terror, will be remembered as a stain on the history of the U.N. for generations to come,"" he added. ""Israel will continue to defend its citizens and uphold its national dignity, with or without António Guterres.""

BBC NEWS SPURS OUTRAGE AFTER COMMENTATOR DEFENDS HEZBOLLAH, IRAN: 'OPENLY PRO-TERRORIST'

And while it took nearly a day following the attacks to condemn Iran, Guterres seemed to get the message, telling council members: ""As I did in relation to the Iranian attack in April - and as should have been obvious yesterday in the context of the condemnation I expressed - I again strongly condemn yesterday's massive missile attack by Iran on Israel.""

Israel's decision to ban Guterres prompted anger from Algeria, which first expressed ""sincere gratitude... solidarity, admiration and support for the secretary-general.""

""This decision reflects a clear disdain of the U.N. system and the entire international community,"" the representative from Algeria said. ""For the Israeli authorities, no narrative nor truth exists except their own.""

However, some permanent members of the council expressed clear support for Israel and condemned Iran for the attack while urging Tehran to cease its support for terrorism through its proxy forces.

U.S. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield ""unequivocally"" condemned Iran's attack and called for further sanctions against Tehran. She also explicitly tied Iran to the Oct. 7 attack on Israel, arguing that ""Iran was complicit... through its funding, training, capabilities and support for the military wing of Hamas.""

ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS REGULAR INFANTRY, ARMORED UNITS JOINING LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN SOUTHERN LEBANON

""After Hamas's horrific attack carried out nearly a year ago today, the United States sent a clear message to Iran: Don't exploit the situation in ways that would risk propelling the region into a broader war,"" Thomas-Greenfield said.

""The IRGC flagrantly and repeatedly ignored this warning by encouraging and enabling the Houthis in Yemen to disrupt global shipping and launch attacks against Israel by supporting militant groups in Syria and Iraq,"" she continued.

""Iran's stated intention was to avenge the deaths of two IRGC-supported terrorist leaders and an IRGC commander by inflicting significant damage and death in Israel,"" she added. ""Thankfully, and through close coordination between the United States and Israel, Iran failed to achieve its objectives.""

""This outcome does not diminish the fact that this attack, intended to cause significant death and destruction, marked a significant escalation by Iran,"" she stressed.

The United Kingdom also condemned Iran's attack and expressed ""full support"" for Israel ""in exercising its right to defend itself against Iranian aggression.""

France urged Iran to ""abstain from any action that could lead to additional destabilization,"" going further to condemn the ""attack that targeted civilians in Jaffa.""

""Civilian populations are the first victims of this horrible situation,"" the French representative said. ""The situation is serious.""

Iran ultimately pleaded its case before the council, arguing that the Security Council has ""remained paralyzed due to the United States obstruction"" and accused permanent members France and the United Kingdom of acing as ""serious enablers"" of Israel who ""attempt to justify Israeli heinous crimes under the guise of self-defense, shifting the blame onto Iran."""
Will Netanyahu 'take the fight directly to Iran' after massive missile strike across Israel?,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-weighs-israeli-response-irans-massive-missile-attack-amid-fears-all-out-war,2024-10-02T15:11:46Z,"JERUSALEM -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the heads of the country's security establishment on Wednesday following Iran's firing of 181 missiles into Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

Fox News Digital spoke to military and Iran experts about the growing chance of a wider confrontation between the Jewish state and the clerical regime in Tehran breaking out.

""After the Iranian missile attack against Israel there is no questioning anymore the basic understanding that Iran is the greatest generator of terror and death in the Middle East. Until now, Israel has been playing a whack-a-mole game with Iran's proxies - fighting Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and others,"" Yaakov Katz, the author of ""Shadow Strike: Inside Israel's Secret Mission to Eliminate Syrian Nuclear Power,"" told Fox News Digital.

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER TELLS US ONLY 'MILITARY ACTION' CAN RETURN PEOPLE TO HOMES AMID HEZBOLLAH THREAT

Katz, who is a senior fellow at the global think tank Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI), added, ""With Iran again attacking Israel directly, the time has come to take the fight directly to Iran. The ayatollahs there need to be made to pay a price.""

The headline by military analyst Amos Harel in the left-wing Haaretz paper read on Wednesday: ""After an unprecedented Iranian attack, we are in a regional war.""

The Islamic republic has been recognized as the center of Mideast volatility, terrorism and jingoism for decades. In 2010, Saudi Arabian King Abdullah told the United States to ""cut off the head of the snake"" by launching military strikes to eradicate Iran's reported nuclear weapons facilities.

Iran's strikes on Israel forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday. The barrage of aerial warfare was the first time in Israeli history that the country's densely populated cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - in the center of the biblical nation, faced such devastating attacks. The Israelis did not panic and stayed relatively calm under the pressure of the largely surprise attack.

The only fatality from the Iranian barrage was the murder of a Palestinian man in the West Bank (known in Israel by its biblical regional name of Judea and Samaria).

""Tonight Iran attempted to kill thousands of Israeli men, women and children but thanks to our miraculous defense system Iran failed miserably. Tehran is hurting after seeing its proxies in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen get crushed by Israel. Tehran made a huge mistake tonight and will pay a heavy price at the time and place of our choosing,"" Lt. Col. Yoni Chetboun, former deputy speaker of the Knesset and an IDF special forces operator in reserves, told Fox News Digital.

IRAN'S 'NUCLEAR ENERGY MOUNTAIN' IS 'FULLY SAFE' AFTER ISRAELI STRIKE: STATE MEDIA

Chetboun was a decorated special forces operator from the second Lebanon war, when Israel fought the Iran-backed terrorist movement Hezbollah in 2006.

Prior to Iran's military strike on Israel in April, Fox News Digital reported that the Biden-Harris administration released billions in sanctions relief to Iran that will flow into its proxies' war machines, according to experts.

The topic of funneling billions to Iran's regime surfaced during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday. Republican Sen. JD Vance said, ""Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration.

""What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies. And God forbid, launching against the United States as well.""

BIDEN ADMIN UNDER PRESSURE TO STOP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SANCTIONS RELIEF TO IRAN

Lisa Daftari, an expert on Iran, said, ""The conflict between the Iran regime and Israel did not commence today, in April, or on Oct. 7 of the previous year. Its origins trace back to 1979, when the mullahs ascended to power, promulgating a doctrine that demonized the 'Great Satan,' a term for the United States, and the 'Little Satan,' referring to Israel.

""Over the past 45 years, the Iran regime has persistently targeted American and Israeli interests, orchestrating terror proxies to execute its strategic objectives against both nations. More recently, U.S. policies that have enriched the mullahs have facilitated billions of dollars on establishing a formidable encirclement around Israel, via the regime's various proxies in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza and the West Bank.""

In April, Iran's regime launched a sprawling aerial attack, with over 300 suicide drones and missiles, on Israel. Jerusalem countered the Iranian swarm of missiles with a targeted strike against military installations in the Iranian province of Isfahan.

Daftari, editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk news website, added, ""Israel's recent military actions signal a departure from the more restrained posture observed in April, when the nation's defense capabilities against missile threats were deemed a victory. The recent strategic strikes in Lebanon underscore Israel's heightened efforts to neutralize enduring existential threats.""

She noted that it historically has engaged in tit-for-tat-like responses but noted, ""Israel is now poised to take decisive measures aimed at neutralizing this looming risk, with its focus now entirely on the regime in Tehran.""

NETANYAHU CALLS MIDEAST CONFLICTS CHOICE BETWEEN 'BLESSING OR A CURSE,' WARNS ABOUT ISRAEL'S 'LONG ARM'

David Wurmser, a former senior adviser for nonproliferation and Middle East strategy for former Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital, ""This is a war between Israel and Iran which began as a direct war on April 14. The war is a twilight struggle between a nation run by a tyranny that seeks to extinguish the other. Either Iran or Israel, but not both, will emerge from this war not only as victor but survivor.""

He said the so-called ""ring of fire that Iran built around Israel not only had an aggressive aim - to choke Israel to death by initiating a violent war of attrition and isolation, including closing ports and ending international airlines' flying to Israel - but also acted as a defensive deterrent against Israel, shielding Iran from any potential Israeli proactive action against Iran. With the destruction of Hezbollah, the strategic linchpin of the proxy network at the center of that ring of fire, as the greatest threat Israel faces, Iran was left fully exposed to the full weight of Israeli power.""

He echoed the strong language of Israel's military and political leadership, which ""promised to inflict severe pain on the regime of the Iran's supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Ali Khamenei... Iran will surely now feel the vulnerability as the Israelis without fear any more of Hezbollah or Iran will take the war from the defensive to the offensive against Iran's regime, "" said Wurmser.

He added ""The mistake Iran made, as do its proxies and its minions in the West protesting on campuses, is not that they underestimate Israel's capabilities and its unity, but that they internalized their own ideology that Israel is a fake, fragile colonial entity rather than a deeply rooted civilization. Israel has shown that despite its mistakes and setbacks, its internal strength transcend that of any of their neighbors."""

Two Palestinian men from the Israeli-occupied West Bank town of Hebron opened fire, including shooting directly into a light rail carriage crowded with passengers that was stopped at a station.

The suspects -- who police say had no prior arrests, although one had been involved in disturbing the peace at a demonstration -- were later shot and killed by security guards and armed pedestrians, according to The Associated Press. Police and paramedics who responded to the scene treated another 16 people injured from the shooting.

Segev-Vigder lived in Tel Aviv and operated a fitness and Pilates studio, while her husband, Yaari Vigder, is an Israeli reservist soldier, The Jerusalem Post reports.

""Ari was in a carrier that covered Inbar's entire upper body during the attack, he was not injured at all,"" the website cited Yaari Vigder as telling Israel's Channel 11 news.

A witness told Ynetnews that the 33-year-old mother was gunned down while stepping off a train in Jaffa, according to The Jerusalem Post.

The website identified four other victims as Revital Bronstein, 24, Shahar Goldman, 30, Nadia Sokolenko, 40, and Ilya Nozadze, 42.

Sokolenko's family told Israel's TPS news agency that they were waiting for her to return home from grocery shopping Tuesday night and her friends started checking area hospitals after her phone stopped answering calls.

Sokolenko, a native of Moldova who worked as an office manager, was described by friends as ""a very creative person and very caring mom"" of a 6-year-old daughter, TPS added.

Greece's foreign ministry also said Wednesday that a Greek national who lived in Jerusalem was among the dead.

Israel Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich wrote on X in the wake of the attack that ""I will now demand in the cabinet discussion that the family members of the abominable terrorists from Hebron who carried out the heinous attack in Jaffa be deported to Gaza tonight and their homes should be turned into ruins for them to see and see."""

As Israeli forces prepare for what officials characterize as a limited ground incursion into Lebanon, the world is bracing for the possibility that the conflict will expand into a larger regional war, a greater likelihood in the wake of Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

The two sides have clashed for close to a year, dating back to Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The skirmishes have led to hundreds of deaths along the border and the displacement of thousands more.

The violence reflects the damage that Iranian-backed militant groups, like Hamas and Hezbollah, have done in the Middle East for four decades. The roots of their capacity to inflict harm lie in the October 1983 suicide bombing of the U.S. Marine headquarters in Beirut, which was the largest non-nuclear blast the FBI ever investigated.

Though the attack, which killed 241 soldiers, sailors, and Marines, horrified President Ronald Reagan, he never retaliated against the then-fledgling Hezbollah.

ISRAEL UNBOUND

This decision to forego a military response, coupled with America's withdrawal from Lebanon, sent a message that terrorism worked. Small and relatively inexpensive acts of extraordinary violence could effectively defeat major militaries and superpowers. This emboldened these groups, as well as their Iranian sponsors. The results have been catastrophic for the region and the cause of peace.

By the early 1980s, Lebanon had been torn apart by years of civil war and sectarian violence that had resulted from a political tug-of-war between the nation's Christians, Sunnis and Shiites. Adding to the bloodshed was the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had moved into Beirut after being driven out of Jordan in 1971.

The PLO, upset over the loss of land during Israel's 1967 war against its Arab neighbors, fought a guerrilla campaign against Israel in an effort to obtain a homeland for the Palestinian people.

END US FUNDING FOR UN AGENCY GIVING IMMUNITY TO ITS MURDEROUS HAMAS MEMBERS

In June 1982, Israel invaded, pummeling Beirut with artillery in an attempt to eradicate the PLO, which had been attacking it from Lebanese territory. The rain of Israeli fire devastated entire city blocks. ""Even in Lebanon,"" wrote columnist Jack Anderson, ""a land inured to catastrophe, the bombardment of West Beirut was a horror beyond endurance.""

Israel's bloody war in Lebanon alarmed many, including Reagan, who worked to broker a deal to end the violence, remove the PLO, and send in U.S. Marines as peacekeepers to stabilize the region.

But American troops were not the only foreign military force to arrive in Lebanon that year. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Shiite religious leader who rose to power in Iran in 1979, saw an opportunity to capitalize on the chaos, to export and propagate his revolution.

UN ABDICATES ROLE OF MIDDLE EAST PEACEMAKER BY BACKING TERRORISTS

With that goal in mind, Khomeini sent an army of 800 elite Revolutionary Guards into Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, a lawless region near Syria. The Iranian soldiers fanned out through the impoverished Shiite communities in southern Lebanon, attending mosque, giving speeches, and recruiting disenfranchised young men to fight against American and Israeli forces.

These efforts helped produce two homegrown Shiite terror organizations: Islamic Amal and the Islamic Jihad Organization. These two Iranian-backed groups would soon merge, however, and become known simply as Hezbollah or the Party of God, aided by Iranian money, training and weapons.

Hezbollah's first strike against the U.S. came on April 18, 1983, when a suicide car bomber crashed into the front of the American Embassy in Beirut. The blast collapsed the entire front of the building, killing 63 people including 17 Americans.

IRAN'S OPTIONS DWINDLE AS IT PREPARES RETALIATION FOR DEATH OF NASRALLAH

But that attack paled in comparison to the one that would follow 188 days later.

At dawn on a Sunday morning in October 1983, a bomber in a Mercedes truck crashed through security and penetrated the lobby of the four-story Battalion Landing Team headquarters in Beirut, where some 350 American soldiers, sailors and Marines were asleep.

The blast, which investigators later determined exceeded 12,000 pounds of TNT, collapsed the building into a pile of broken concrete and twisted rebar. ""It was,"" as one survivor later recounted, ""like every atom in the universe blew apart.""

The screams from buried victims prompted one of the greatest rescue efforts in modern memory, as troops attacked the rubble pile with shovels, Ka-Bar knives and their bare hands.

IRAN SUPPORTS KAMALA HARRIS, BUT AMERICANS WHO WANT A SAFER WORLD HAVE A BETTER CHOICE

For those Marines trapped underground, it was hell. Among them was Chaplain Danny Wheeler, who spent five hours buried in a concrete crypt before rescuers finally found him. ""The next thing I knew, I felt a hand on my hand,"" Wheeler recalled. ""I held it.""

Wheeler was the last survivor rescued, and one of the lucky few. All told, the bombing killed 220 Marines, 18 sailors and three soldiers, wounding another 112.

The attack shocked Reagan, who initially resisted pressure from many in Congress and the public to pull American forces out of Lebanon. In a nationally televised speech on Oct. 27, the president instead recommitted America to stabilizing the area.

""Brave young men have been taken away from us. Many others have been grievously wounded. Are we to tell them their sacrifice was wasted?"" Reagan said. ""We're a nation with global responsibilities.""

WHY BIDEN'S SPEECH AT UNGA SHOULD SET OFF ALARM BELLS ACROSS THE GLOBE

But that resolve faded in early 1984, when the Lebanese national government and military ultimately collapsed. On Feb. 7, Reagan announced that he planned to send American troops back to their ships.

In an effort to avoid drawing attention to America's sudden reversal and withdrawal, he skipped the televised speech, instead releasing a written statement to reporters. On March 30, Reagan notified Congress that he planned to officially terminate America's peacekeeping mission.

This withdrawal created a vacuum that Hezbollah capitalized on to gain power and influence, eventually becoming the dominant political party in Lebanon.

WHAT IF ISRAELIS COULD VOTE IN US ELECTIONS?

Additionally, America's abrupt departure coincided with the administration's refusal to retaliate for the bombing of the U.S. Embassy or the Marine headquarters. In the wake of the October bombing, members of the National Security Council drew up a plan to target Iran's terror camp in the Bekaa Valley.

Reagan initially supported it, but Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger convinced the president to backtrack, arguing that retaliatory action demanded the type of conclusive proof of the identity of the attackers that is often elusive in terror attacks. ""I'm not,"" Weinberger later said, ""an eye for an eye man.""

Whatever the merits of Weinberger's thinking, the results of Reagan's decision were calamitous. For the small cost of a truck, some explosives and the single life of a terrorist, Iran successfully drove the U.S. from Lebanon and suffered no consequences.

That was the critical lesson our enemies learned from this tragedy, a fact the CIA zeroed in on in a 1987 report. ""Many Iranian leaders use this precedent as proof that terrorism can break U.S. resolve.""

The agency also concluded that Iranian leaders exploited the uncertainty that had troubled Weinberger. ""Compared with overt military attacks, terrorism and sabotage also offer a degree of plausible deniability and present the United States with a less clear-cut justification for retaliation.""

America's failure to respond to the killing and wounding of hundreds of our diplomats and service members in Beirut served as a green light for Iran to continue and even escalate its proxy war of terrorism that menaces the region.

And it is a price America, Israel and our allies continue to pay four decades later.

Col. Timothy Geraghty, who was the commander of the Marines in Lebanon in October 1983 and later worked for the CIA, understands that better than anyone. ""Our timidity,"" he concluded, ""whetted the jihadists' appetite.""

Hours before the vice presidential debate, former President Donald Trump addressed a crowd at his campaign rally in Wisconsin and bashed the Biden administration over Iran's historic attack on Israel.

""A short time ago, Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at Israel... I've been talking about World War III for a long time, and I don't want to make predictions because the predictions always come true. We're not going to make [predictions]... but they are very close to global catastrophe,"" Trump said. ""We have a non-existent president and a non-existent vice president who should be in charge, but nobody knows what's going on.""

Trump's comments come after Israel said Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at the country, marking the largest ballistic missile attack in history.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike late last week and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst.

Trump claimed Biden and Harris made Iran rich in a very short period of time.

""They have $300 billion now. They're rich. I mean, they pay 6 billion every time they have somebody that was kidnaped, it's always $6 billion,"" Trump said.

""Iran was on the verge of bankruptcy. They had no money left. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. The people they're fighting now, they would have been willing to make any deal. You could have made any deal. But Kamala flooded them with American cash and everything.

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the Iranian missile attack on Israel was ""defeated and ineffective"" and that the U.S. military coordinated with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to repel the strikes.

""U.S. naval destroyers joined Israeli Air Defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles. President Biden and Vice President Harris monitored the attack and the response from the White House Situation Room, joined in person and remotely by their national security team,"" Sullivan said.

Sullivan characterized the attack as a ""significant escalation"" while speaking at a White House briefing on Tuesday.

Sullivan said no deaths were reported on the Israeli side, although the White House is monitoring the reported death of a Palestinian civilian in Jericho in the West Bank.

Antony Blinken does victory lap on Biden-Harris' 'stronger' foreign policy same day Iran attacks Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/antony-blinken-op-ed-touts-biden-harris-foreign-policy-renewal-same-day-iran-attacks-israel,2024-10-01T22:09:19Z,"Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst has the latest on Israel's possible response after the Iran missile attack on 'Your World.'

Secretary of State Antony Blinken published an op-ed Tuesday touting the Biden-Harris administration's foreign policy record, stating they took drastic deviations from former President Trump, the same day Iran directly attacked Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles.

Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel Tuesday evening local time in what the administration called a ""signigicant escalation by Iran."" The indiscriminate rocket fire were part of the Shia regime's response to Israel assassinating nearly all of Hezbollah senior leadership, including long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Hours before Iran's attack, Blinken's op-ed touted how Biden-Harris' ""renewal"" strategy post-Trump was working and strengthening America's interests abroad.

""The Biden administration's strategy has put the United States in a much stronger geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,"" Blinken said.

PENTAGON SENDING A 'FEW THOUSAND' PERSONNEL TO MIDDLE EAST DAY AFTER BIDEN SAID HE WOULDN'T ADD COMBAT TROOPS

Blinken said the administration prioritized international cooperation and avoided making decisions abroad in isolation.

""From day one, President Biden and Vice President Harris made a foundational choice that in a more competitive and combustible world, the United States cannot go it alone. If America wants to protect its security and create opportunities for its people, it must stand with those who have a stake in a free, open, secure, and prosperous world and stand up to those who threaten that world,"" he wrote. ""President Biden and Vice President Harris pursued a strategy of renewal, pairing historic investments in competitiveness at home with an intensive diplomatic campaign to revitalize partnerships abroad,"" he said. ""This twin-pillared strategy, they believed, was the best way to disabuse competitors of their assumptions that the United States was declining and diffident.""

Blinken also stated the war in Gaza is interconnected to Iran's maligned behavior.

""Without an end to the war in Gaza and a time-bound, credible path to statehood that addresses the Palestinians' legitimate aspirations and Israel's security needs, normalization cannot move forward. But if these efforts succeed, normalization would join Israel to a regional security architecture, unlock economic opportunities across the region, and isolate Iran and its proxies,"" he continued. ""Glimmers of such integration were on display in the coalition of countries, including Arab states, that helped Israel defend itself against an unprecedented direct attack from Iran in April.""

The State Department referred Fox News Digital to the department's briefing when asked for comment.

House Republicans have described Biden-Harris foreign policy as one aiming at ""appeasement,"" particularly towards Iran.

""CBS Mornings"" anchor Tony Dokoupil grilled author and journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates over whether he believed Israel had ""a right to exist"" in a tense interview on Monday.

Coates appeared on the show to preview his new book, ""The Message,"" which is a collection of new essays by the best-selling author about his travels to different parts of the world.

""In the book's longest section, Coates travels to Palestine, where he sees with devastating clarity how easily we are misled by nationalist narratives, and the tragedy that lies in the clash between the stories we tell and the reality of life on the ground,"" the book summary says.

Dokoupil confronted Coates on this section of the book, telling him bluntly that it read like something you would find in ""the backpack of an extremist.""

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES ACROSS ISRAEL

""I have to say, when I read the book, I imagine if I took your name out of it, took away the awards, the acclaim, took the cover off the book, publishing house goes away, the content of that section would not be out of place in the backpack of an extremist,"" Dokoupil said.

""So then I found myself wondering, why does Ta'Nehisi Coates, who I've known for a long time, read his work for a long time, very talented, smart guy, leave out so much? Why leave out that Israel is surrounded by countries that want to eliminate it? Why leave out that Israel deals with terror groups that want to eliminate it? Why not detail anything of the first and the second Intifada, the café bombings, the bus bombings, the little kids blown to bits. Is it because you just don't believe that Israel in any condition has a right to exist?"" the CBS anchor continued.

Coates defended the book, saying he sought to give a voice to the Palestinian people, whose views he argued were underrepresented in the American media.

""I would say the perspective that you just outlined, there is no shortage of that perspective in American media,"" Coates replied.

""I have asked repeatedly in my interviews whether there is a single network, mainstream organization, in America with a Palestinian-American bureau chief or correspondent who actually has a voice to articulate that part the world. I've been a reporter for 20 years. The reporters are those who believe more sympathetically about Israel and its right to exist don't have a problem getting their voice out. But what I saw in Palestine, what I saw on the West Bank, what I saw in Haifa in Israel, what I saw in the South Hebron Hills, those were the stories I have not heard. Those were the stories that I was most occupied with,"" he continued.

Coates also said the 260-page book was not meant to be a ""treatise on the entirety of the conflict between the Palestinians and the Israelis.""

Dokoupil continued to press the far-left author, claiming his book would leave readers questioning why Israel even existed.

""But if you were to read this book you would be left wondering why does any of Israel exist? What a horrific place committing horrific acts on a daily basis. So I think the question is central and key: If Israel has a right to exist. And if your answer is no, then I guess the question becomes why do the Palestinians have a right to exist? Why do 20 different Muslim countries have a right to exist?"" Dokoupil asked.

Coates rejected the question, saying that countries are established by force, not rights, and that Israel already exists.

Dokoupil said the author's book ""delegitimizes"" Israel's foundation and ""seems like an effort to topple the whole building of it.""

""What is it that so particularly offends you about the existence of a Jewish state, that is a Jewish safe place, and not any of the other states out there?"" he asked Coates.

""There's nothing that offends me about a Jewish state,"" Coates retorted. ""I am offended by the idea of states built on ethnocracy, no matter where they are.""

""Muslim included?"" Dokoupil asked.

""I would not want a state where any group of people laid down their citizenship rights based on ethnicity,"" Coates said. He explained how he personally witnessed the ""two-tier system"" in Israel, where Palestinians had less freedom and access to resources in ""occupied territories"" than Israelis.

""I'm working with the person that is guiding me, a Palestinian whose father, whose grandfather and grandmother was born in this town. And I have more freedom to walk than he does. He can't ride on certain roads. He can't get water in the same way that Israeli citizens who live less than a mile away from him can,"" Coates said.

The two continued to spar as Dokoupil suggested Coates had portrayed a one-sided view of the conflict.

""But why is that?"" the anchor pressed. ""Why is there no agency in this book for the Palestinians? They exist in your narrative merely as victims of the Israelis, as though they were not offered peace at any juncture, as though they don't have a stake in this -- "" he asked.

Coates appealed to his own ancestry and America's history with racism to defend his particular viewpoint on the conflict in Gaza.

""I have a very, very, very moral compass about this. Again, perhaps it's because of my ancestry. Either apartheid is right or it's wrong. It's really, really simple. Either what I saw was right or it's wrong,"" he explained.

""I am against a state that discriminates against people on the basis of ethnicity. I'm against that. There is nothing the Palestinians could do that would make that okay for me. My book is not based on the hyper-morality of the Palestinian people,"" he went on to say.

We are now going to look at what the appropriate next steps are to secure, first and foremost, American interests and then to promote stability to the maximum extent possible as we go forward,"" Sullivan said.

He said the U.S. will consult with the Israelis on next steps in terms of response and how to deal with the Iranian attack.

The White House is particularly focused on protecting U.S. service members in the region and implored American citizens in Lebanon to follow the State Department's guidance of finding civilian commercial means to leave the country, Sullivan said.

Sullivan also expressed his condolences to the victims who were killed in a shooting in the Israeli city of Jaffa, located near Tel Aviv on Tuesday. At least eight people were killed and at least seven injured, local officials have told Fox News.

The incident, which is believed to be a terror attack, took place Tuesday outside a newly built light rail station on Jerusalem Street. Authorities say at least two individuals who opened fire on a crowd of people have been neutralized.

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) had warned citizens to shelter in place and follow instructions from the Home Front Command as the Jewish State's Iron Dome anti-missile defense system worked to intercept the incoming rockets on Tuesday.

The Israel Defense Force (IDF) has met little resistance since announcing its ""limited"" invasion of southern Lebanon early Tuesday morning local time, a move aimed to subvert Hezbollah's buildup along the shared border.

Israel has been increasing its strikes for weeks against the terrorist organization in southern Lebanon, as well as with targeted strikes in Beirut.

On Tuesday, the IDF confirmed in a statement shared with Fox News Digital that since the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attacks in Israel - after which Hezbollah began striking military posts along Israel's northern border - the IDF has conducted dozens of ""targeted operations"" to ""dismantle Hezbollah's terrorist capabilities"" that pose a threat to civilians in the north.

ISRAELI MINISTERS FRUSTRATED OVER US, IDF LEAK ON LEBANON OPERATION: REPORT

IDF spokesman Rear Adm. Daniel Hagari said Tuesday that IDF special forces have entered Hezbollah compounds in ""dozens of locations"" along the Israel-Lebanon border, collected intelligence and dismantled positional strongholds.

""Our soldiers entered Hezbollah's underground infrastructures, exposed Hezbollah's hidden weapon caches, and seized and destroyed the weapons, including advanced Iranian-made weapons,"" Hagari said. ""Overall, IDF soldiers exposed and dismantled over 700 Hezbollah terror assets during these operations. And there's a lot more work to do.""

Since the war began nearly a year ago, Israeli special forces reportedly began conducting small raids in southern Lebanon, in some cases utilizing the very tunnels Israel seized from the terrorist group years prior, and renewed attention has been brought to how the Hezbollah network operates.

The terrorist group for years has relied on its heavy entanglement in civilian life, particularly in southern Lebanon, where it has rented civilian infrastructure to serve as weapons depots and even missile launcher sites. Civilian buildings have also been used to cover entrances to the group's sophisticated tunnel network that is estimated to stretch over 100 miles in length cumulatively across the region.

But despite the feared all-out war that had the potential to erupt upon Israel's invasion of its northern neighbor, Hezbollah's resistance has been minimal.

PENTAGON SENDING A 'FEW THOUSAND' PERSONNEL TO MIDDLE EAST DAY AFTER BIDEN SAID HE WOULDN'T ADD COMBAT TROOPS

Security experts feared Hezbollah's longtime backing from Iran would enable it to levy as many as 8,000 rockets per day in a worse case scenario, and its more than 50,000 operatives, including the elite Radwan forces, could pose a significant threat against an Israeli ground campaign.

Hagari confirmed to reporters Tuesday that IDF forces were actively working to dismantle Radwan infrastructure near the border in southern Lebanon.

""We need to take care of it because we will not let another 7th of October occur next to our border,"" he said.

In the aftermath of the Oct. 7 attacks, the IDF assessed that some 2,400 Radwan terrorists, along with another 500 Palestinian Jihadists trained by the elite force, were positioned in villages across southern Lebanon poised to attack.

But the IDF on Tuesday also highlighted that Hezbollah failed to mount a counter force in response to Israel's incursion.

Jonathan Conricus, former IDF spokesperson and current senior fellow for the Foundation for Defense of Democracies (FDD), told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah's near-complete lack of a counter force could be explained by several reasons.

""The IDF conducted hundreds of special operations during the last months to map and analyze Hezbollah's hostile infrastructure in civilian houses in southern Lebanon, as well as targeted aerial campaigns against Hezbollah personnel,"" he said. ""Hezbollah terrorists sustained severe casualties and started to flee from southern Lebanon.

""It remains unclear how many Hezbollah militants remain in the south,"" he added.

Given the unknown number of terrorists who fled the south, most likely to other strongholds in Beirut and in central Lebanon, reporters questioned the current IDF spokesman if this could mean that Israel will need to expand its operations north.

""We're not going to Beirut,"" Hagari told reporters, emphasizing Israel's stated goal to return its citizens to their northern homes. ""We are focusing in the area of those villages, the area next to [the] border. And we will do, in this area, what is necessary to dismantle and demolish Hezbollah's infrastructure.""

Hagari would not provide specifics on the operational timeline but said Israel's campaign in Lebanon would be conducted in ""days [to] weeks."""

The text harshly criticizes attempts to reform traditional Islam, calling modernism ""an object of derision and ridicule [that] is scorned by traditional Muslims and fundamentalists alike.""

STATE DEPARTMENT MANDATES SUPPORT FOR DEI IDEOLOGY AS PREREQUISITE FOR PROMOTIONS: 'YOU ARE JUDGED'

Ghazi worked on the textbook while she studied abroad in Amman, Jordan, at the ""Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre"" from 2009-2010, according to her LinkedIn.

Ghazi went abroad as a participant in an international exchange program sponsored by the Clinton Global Initaitive and the office of Queen Rania of Jordan.

The academic work at times used soft language surrounding America-hating terrorists, like Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

The publication Ghazi worked on described the terror group Hezbollah as a ""social justice"" movement and an ""International Symbol of Resistance Against Israel,"" according to the publication.

""Hezbollah is a Shi'a Islamic political party and paramilitary organization based in Lebanon. Hezbollah's ideology is based on seeking social justice through Islamic ideals,"" the publication spotlighting the influence of Hassan Nasrallah said.

The long-time Hezbollah leader Nasrallah was killed last week in an Israeli airstrike.

""Political and military successes have made Nasrallah a vastly influential figure in Lebanon, and in the Middle East more broadly. Nasrallah and Hezbollah are also controversial; the US and Canada list Hezbollah as a terrorist organization,"" the description continued.

It then went on to tout Hezbollah's social justice mission.

""Israel remains a key issue for the Muslim world and Hezbollah's aim to achieve social justice there is central to its activities,"" the text said.

""Hezbollah has also won significant grassroots support by cultivating a social welfare system that provides schools, clinics, and housing in the predominantly Shi'a parts of Lebanon, and also in others. These welfare activities are run with efficiency and rival those carried out by the state, giving the organization even broader appeal,"" it continued.

The State Department said its position on Hezbollah was ""quite clear"" and referred Fox News Digital to Monday's State Department briefing, where spokesperson Matt Miller condemned the group as a terrorist organization and stressed Israel's right to defend itself.

PENTAGON EQUITY CHIEF PRAISES BOOK CALLING 9/11 FIRST RESPONDERS 'MENACES' AS SHE PUSHES FOR 'REVOLUTION'

The 2009 edition of ""500 Most Influential Muslims"" spotlighted Khaled Mashaal, describing him as one of the most prominent leaders of Hamas, as a ""Fighter for Social Justice"" and ""Pioneer."" The blurb did mention, as the one noted above, that the U.S. considers Hamas a terrorist organization.

""Since becoming head of Hamas, Mashaal has seen the organization through multiple attempts at a roadmap to peace and a major Israeli siege of the Gaza Strip,"" it said.

""Mashaal has been recognized for his persistence with Hamas's efforts -- at present leading in exile from Syria. His determination is combined with a unique effort at diplomacy,"" it said. ""Mashaal has been one of the most direct, and candid leaders in dialogue and confrontation with Israel and this has garnered international recognition.""

In addition to working at the State Department, Ghazi is currently involved in ""America Indivisible"" as a senior adviser, according to her LinkedIn. She was previously its director from 2018-2019. America Indivisible currently promotes its publication from 2020 on its site, recommending that people read ""credible sources"" like ""MuslimGirl"" in order to combat religious intolerance.

MuslimGirl's objective is to draw awareness ""to the Qur'an's message of gender equality and Islam's principle of peace,"" according to the website's description.

Fox News Digital's previous review of MuslimGirl found that it was filled with articles containing pro-Palestinian propaganda from 2016 to the present.

NEW STATE DEPARTMENT DIVERSITY CHIEF BELIEVES US IS A 'FAILED HISTORIC MODEL' WITH A 'COLONIZING PAST'

For example, one week after the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attack on Israel, MuslimGirl published an article which said, ""Was it plausible to believe that [the Palestinians] would remain passive forever?""

The piece also questioned whether associating Hamas with terrorism was political.

""The term 'terrorist'... warrants careful consideration,"" the article said. ""How... can this label be applied to those defending their homeland...""

""MuslimGirl Staff"" published an article in May 2021 that said that evangelical Christians were a ""threat,"" while also claiming that evangelicals are more dangerous to Jews than Palestinians.

Fox News Digital contacted the State Department for comment in March asking questions about Ghazi's affiliation with America Indivisible, particularly given its recommendation of MuslimGirl. In the months that followed, Ghazi had not changed her public affiliation with America Indivisible."
Morning Glory: Israel unbound,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-israel-unbound,2024-10-01T09:20:06Z,"'Special Report' panelists discuss the latest presidential polling in key battleground states as Election Day inches closer.

When Israeli Prime Minister visited the United States at the invitation of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) this past summer, the Congressional leaders intended the visit to be a gesture of support for our embattled ally.

But Vice President Harris, who ought to have presided at the joint session of Congress in her role as President of the Senate along with Speaker Johnson -- with both seated behind Netanyahu -- instead skipped the Israeli PM's address to the joint session of Congress on July 24. Harris thus sent a very public message to her supporters -- she did not care to reschedule previous commitments though Netanyahu's visit was long in planning -- and then met with Netanyahu privately as did President Biden.

Whatever the President and Vice President said to the Prime Minister after what the Vice President did by way of very visible messaging, Netanyahu embraced a different strategy for Israel after his return to Jerusalem. Two months later, when Netanyahu returned to the states to deliver a fiery address the United Nations General Assembly last week, that new strategy had already rolled out in large part in the region, though it is crescendoing still.

First, Israel took the war everywhere in Gaza, and Hamas is all but obliterated as an organized fighting force though 101 hostages remain in the terrorists' tunnel network and the condition of Yahya Sinwar is unknown. Sinwar's military commander, Mohammed Deif, was killed in an Israeli air raid in southern Gaza on July 13, though that news was not confirmed until after Netanyahu's visit to Congress.

Not long after Netanyahu's return to Israel, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated on July 31 along with his personal bodyguard while in the Iran's capital of Tehran.

Fuad Shukr, a senior commander in Iran's proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, was killed by the Israeli Air Force a day earlier, on July 30. Hezbollah's top military commander thereafter, Ibrahim Aqil, and 10 other senior commanders of Hezbollah's elite ""Radwan Force"" -- structured as special operation forces trained to invade Israel and hold terriroty -- were killed in an air strike on September 20.

On September 28 the leader of Hezbollah, its ""Secretary General"" for four decades, Hassan Nasrallah, and at least 10 other senior members of the terror organization were killed in a massive Israeli air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Among the dead was also at least one senior general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iranian state media confirmed General Abbas Nilforoushan, 58, had been at the doomed conference in Nasrallah's underground bunker.

HAMAS LEADER KILLED IN LEBANON WAS UN EMPLOYEE, AGENCY CONFIRMS

In the middle of these strikes at all of the senior terror leadership in Lebanon, hundreds if not thousands of Hezbollah terrorists and their accomplices in Lebanon were killed or wounded in the beeper and walkie-talkie attack that astonished the world. (Israel has not claimed responsibility for this attack.)

Over the weekend, strikes continued on the remaining senior leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and other terror groups and a second round of punishing air strikes on significant assets in Yemen were conducted by the Israeli Air Force in reprisals for that country's ruling terrorists attacks on Israeli via ballistic missiles.

There were also reports on Monday that the Israeli special forces had been conducting raids in southern Lebanon, including inside of Hezbollah's vast tunnel network, in preparation for ground operations to secure northern Israel from the threat of ongoing attacks against the Jewish State which began on October 8th, the day after the barbaric Hamas massacre of 1,200 inside the southern border of Israel (and the kidnapping of 250 more, more than a hundred of whom have been rescued or released via negotiations last fall.) A desperate and disorganized Hamas seems incapable of even responding to proposals for hostage exchanges and the IDF is going about methodically destroying Gaza's 500 miles of terrorist tunnels.

Netanyahu and his governing coalition got stronger this weekend as a former ally turned rival became an ally again as Gideon Saar brought his ""New Hope"" party into the governing coalition led by Netanyahu and his Likud party.

What this week and the next four that follow right up to the United States presidential election will bring in Israel, Lebanon, Gaza and the entire region is unknown, but what is clear is that Israel does not feel in the least constrained by President Biden and his team and their mantra of ""de-escalation.""

Israel tried every tactic requested by the United States, did its best to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage deal, and was repeatedly spurned by the terrorists in Gaza. (The consequences of the U.S.-enforced delays will be assessed after the wars conclude.) Though Vice President Harris had ""studied the maps"" of Rafah and publicly concluded that Israel could not evacuate the more than a million Palestinians taking refuge there, Israel in fact did just that, and without loss of innocent life save those of the soldiers of the IDF killed in the Rafah operations and six hostages Hamas terrorists ruthlessly executed, including an American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin.

At the same time as the Gaza War intensified, Israel hammered Iran's other proxies in Lebanon and Yemen, both of which -- Hezbollah and the Houthis -- had kept up a barrage of rocket, drone and missile strikes on the Jewish State.

After Netanyahu's visit to the Congress and his snub by the possible next president, it seems clear he returned to Israel resolved to prosecute Israel's seven front war on his terms, not those of the United States, which itself continues to be subject to missile and drone barrages against its fleet and land forces in the region and to reply only intermittently. Nothing the United States has done can compare with Israel's withering counter-attacks. Israel is restoring deterrence in the region and Iran, which threatened to strike back against Israel, has not yet attempted a reprise of its direct assault on Israel in April.

Whatever Biden and Harris and all their senior officials intended Israel to do, unless they recommended Netanyahu do all of the above, then Israel has shrugged off the demands made of it by the appeasement-driven Biden-Harris administration.

Perhaps Netanyahu is simply unwilling to risk what are widely expected to be the anti-Israel policies of Harris should she win. Perhaps he took the measure of President Biden and concluded the American Commander-on-Chief is spent and not really in command at all.

Correlation is, of course, not causation. But whatever Biden and Harris said to Netanyahu in July, unless it was ""Go get them,"" the Israeli Prime Minister has decided to protect his people and not his friendships with the clueless foreign policy blob inside the Beltway."
Pentagon sending a 'few thousand' personnel to Middle East day after Biden said he wouldn't add combat troops,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pentagon-sending-few-thousand-us-troops-middle-east-one-day-after-biden-promised-he-wouldnt,2024-10-01T02:00:03Z,"DOD spokesperson Sabrina Singh said Monday the additional troops are to augment U.S. forces already there on heightened alert.

The Pentagon announced on Monday that it is sending a ""few thousand"" U.S. personnel to the Middle East to support Air Force squadrons a day after President Biden vowed not to send combat troops to the region.

Speaking at a press gaggle with reporters on Monday, Pentagon spokesperson Sabrina Singh said the U.S. was sending a ""few thousand"" more troops to the Middle East to bolster security and to defend Israel, if needed.

Biden gave a firm ""no"" when asked Sunday if he planned to deploy additional combat troops to the Middle East.

This increased presence is to include multiple warplane squadrons, complimenting the F-15s, F-16s, A-10s and F-22s already stationed in the region.

ISRAEL WILL LAUNCH 'LIMITED' GROUND INVASION IN LEBANON 'IMMINENTLY' US OFFICIAL SAYS

The planes were initially supposed to rotate in and replace the squadrons stationed there. Instead, both the current and new squadrons are to remain in place to double the available airpower because of increased tensions in the region and concern that Iran might respond to Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader last week in Lebanon.

Singh said Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin has ""increased the readiness of additional U.S. forces to deploy, elevating our preparedness to respond to various contingencies. And DOD (Department of Defense) maintains robust and integrated air-defense capabilities across the Middle East, ensuring the protection of U.S. forces operating in the region.""

The few thousand additional personnel are not combat troops but rather maintenance crews and those who can help with the air defense mission and refueling. The additional forces would raise the total number of U.S. personnel in the region to as many as 43,000.

The Pentagon's announcement follows word that Israel has already launched limited raids across its northern border into Lebanon amid an anticipated wider ground invasion.

It also follows recent strikes into Lebanon and the assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, a significant escalation in the war in the Middle East, this time between Israel and Hezbollah, a Lebanese terrorist organization. Israel is also engaged in an ongoing war in the south against Hamas in the Gaza Strip after the Palestinian terrorist group sparked the conflict with its bloody incursion into southern Israel in October 2023.

Secretary Austin announced Sunday he was temporarily extending the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group and its embarked air wing in the region. A U.S. official said the extension would be for about a month.

HEZBOLLAH SAYS IT WILL CHOOSE NASRALLAH'S SUCCESSOR 'AT THE EARLIEST OPPORTUNITY'

A second U.S. aircraft carrier, the USS Harry S. Truman, sailed from Virginia last week and is en route to Europe. It will head to the Mediterranean Sea and again provide a two-carrier presence in the broader region. It's not expected to arrive for at least another week.

Biden told reporters on Monday, ""I'm more aware than you might know"" about reports that Israel is planning a limited ground campaign in Lebanon after nearly a year of trading attacks with Hezbollah in the wake of the Israel-Hamas war, and he said he wants an immediate cease-fire.

Today marks one year since Hamas' October 7 attack on Israel, in which about 1,200 people were killed, leading Israel to retaliate and catalyzing the war in Gaza. Nearly 42,000 Palestinians have been killed in the conflict, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, which does not differentiate between fighters and civilians.

Despite calls for a ceasefire from the U.S. and allies, the Middle East is on the precipice of a broader war as tensions escalate between Israel and Iran. About 31% of Americans believe Israel's military operations in Gaza are going too far, a slight increase from last December, according to a new Pew Research Center poll.

Meanwhile, the share of Americans who believe Israel is doing enough or should be doing more has fallen in the last 10 months.

The U.S. added far more jobs than expected in September, and the unemployment rate dipped to 4.1%. The Labor Department data delivered good news for investors on edge after July and August saw far weaker labor market expansion than expected.

MORE: Leading stock indexes saw gains Friday on the heels of the jobs report: The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose as much as 0.8%, the S&P 500 climbed as much as 0.9% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq bounced as much as 1.2%. But labor market resilience dampened hopes for a second aggressive interest rate cut from the Federal Reserve next month.

Tencent Holdings is considering acquiring Ubisoft Entertainment with the Guillemot family, which founded the French video game publisher, sending Ubisoft's stock soaring Friday after it falling to a decade-low in late September. Rumors about a takeover of Ubisoft, behind video games like Assassin's Creed and Just Dance, have swirled for years, and private equity firms like Blackstone and KKR & Co. have previously considered buying out the company.

Compare price/earnings to a growth rate and you get PEG, the classic formula for measuring the price tag of a growth stock. But PEG has deep flaws. The superior Super PEG measures how much you pay now to get a certain level of earning power down the road, and then compares that to what you pay to get future earning power from the S&P 500 index.

The ultra-swank Yellowstone Club, located on a remote patch of Montana wilderness, is one of the world's most exclusive clubs: Those who want to be admitted must buy land, a home or a condo, which will set you back $10 million, even for the least expensive undeveloped plot. The club has fewer than 900 homeowners, worth more than a combined $290 billion, including Melinda French Gates and hedge fund tycoon Bill Ackman.

The Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest people has been published every year since 1982, and out of the total 1,739 featured, just 11 have made the list every year. They include Warren Buffett, worth $145.5 billion; Charles Koch, worth $67.5 billion; and Nike's Phil Knight, with a net worth of $36.5 billion.

Alphabet's self-driving car venture Waymo, the only commercial robotaxi service in the U.S., signed a ""multiyear"" agreement with Hyundai Motor to add electric Ioniq 5 hatchbacks to its Waymo One fleet starting next year. Currently, its U.S. fleet includes at least 1,000 electric Jaguar I-PACE SUVs, and reducing costs is critical for Waymo to reach profitability, as it is quickly expanding its service area.

At a recruitment event for his fledgling AI company xAI, billionaire Elon Musk pitched the firm as the anti-OpenAI, calling the ChatGPT maker ""closed"" and profit-obsessed. Musk cofounded OpenAI with Sam Altman, but he has since left and sued the company twice, accusing OpenAI of abandoning its mission to build artificial intelligence to benefit humanity.

Out of office and back on the campaign trail, former President Donald Trump earned an estimated $218 million in operating income last year, roughly double what he made during his final year in the White House. Trump's golf portfolio now generates huge profits, with his golf-connected properties generating $74 million more in operating income last year than they did in 2020.

Perpetua Resources is set to resurrect a shuttered Idaho mine that will once again supply the Pentagon with vital weapons-grade antimony, bust a Chinese monopoly, and underwrite the rehabilitation of 20 miles of backcountry salmon streams. The surge in the price of gold since the pandemic is also propelling Perpetua, which expects to produce an average 300,000 ounces of gold per year at an average all-in cost of $650/oz and eventually generate hundreds of millions of dollars in annual profits.

Shares of Spirit Airlines fell 26% Friday after reports indicated the low-cost airline was exploring bankruptcy. In January, a federal judge blocked a $3.8 billion merger between Spirit and JetBlue, ruling it would eliminate the airline industry's popular discounted flight options and drive up prices.

If you need to renew your passport, now is the time: The average wait time is the shortest it's been in decades. The State Department said Thursday that the average processing time for passports has dropped to four to six weeks, which is a third as long as it took in 2021 during the pandemic backlog.

TOPLINE Over the last several months, joint state and federal task forces have raided more than 100 vape and smoke shops, hemp product manufacturers and distributors in North Carolina, alleging that they are selling marijuana disguised as hemp.

The 2018 Farm Bill allows the production of hemp and all its derivatives so long as it contains 0.3% of THC or less. In 2022, hemp-derived cannabinoid product sales hit $28 billion overall, while legal marijuana products generated $26 billion in sales during that same period, according to cannabis data firm Whitney Economics.

But hemp farmers, Whitney Economics estimates, have lost about $3.1 billion in annual sales due to the state bans and legal confusion that has followed.

Despite what the Farm Bill states, there is plenty of debate about whether hemp-derived THC products are legal under federal law. That's because hemp-derived cannabinoids -- including delta-9 THC and delta-8 THC (a less potent compound that is affectionately called ""weed lite"" or ""decaf kush"") -- are legal under the Farm Bill if those compounds are found naturally in the plant.

Yet most intoxicating hemp products on the market are made by converting hemp-derived CBD isolate into delta-9 THC or delta-8 THC using a chemical process.

North Carolina's crusade against hemp is not the only front in this war on drugs. Late last month, California Governor Gavin Newsom banned hemp-derived THC through an emergency order. Newsom said that the move was to prevent the sale of intoxicating hemp products to children.

But California also views hemp products as a threat to its struggling $5 billion legal marijuana market.

WHY IT MATTERS ""What's going on in the hemp industry right now shows how complicated and nuanced the legalization of cannabis can be,"" says Forbes staff writer Will Yakowicz. ""Even though marijuana and hemp are variations of the same plant -- Cannabis sativa L -- marijuana is still illegal at the federal level while hemp is legal.""

It's important not only to save for retirement but also to plan for the non-financial aspects. For instance, if you enjoy what you are doing or the social aspect of your job, consider working part-time to transition to full retirement. Take the time to build social connections outside of work, join community groups and develop hobbies. And don't wait until you retire to start traveling: Go when you can, because no one's health is guaranteed.

Why The Israel-Hamas War Death Toll Is Uncertain -- 1 Year After Start Of War,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/06/why-the-israel-hamas-war-death-toll-is-uncertain-1-year-after-start-of-war/,2024-10-06T19:18:56Z,"A year after Hamas attacked Israel, prompting a counterattack on Gaza and a regional conflict that recently bled into Lebanon, the death toll continues to grow, but remains uncertain amid discrepancies in figures reported by the Hamas-run Gaza Health Ministry and logistical challenges in tracking the dead.

The Gaza Health Ministry has struggled to maintain accurate tallies due to the destruction of data-keeping technology and infrastructure in the war, according to analysis published by The Lancet, which noted an estimated 10,000 victims are likely still buried in the rubble of destroyed buildings. Some of the dead also go uncounted because ""what we've seen in Gaza is entire families just being wiped out,"" so there is no one to report them dead, Emily Tripp, the director of Airwars, a watchdog group that tracks war casualties, told Nature.

The non-governmental organization, Airwars, has also determined the death toll is likely underestimated after finding some victims' names are missing from the list released by the Ministry. Some experts, including Israel-based independent researcher Mark Zlochin, believe the death toll is overcounted because it likely includes people who are missing, but not dead, he told the scientific journal Nature.

The Ministry updated its breakdown of the fatalities in May to clarify that approximately 25,000 of the 35,000 reported dead at the time were ""people who have been fully identified."" The Ministry revised its count of women and children estimated to be dead to about 60% of all reported fatalities, down from a previous estimate of about 70%, sparking allegations of inaccuracies from Israeli officials. The World Health Organization, however, expressed confidence in the new tally amid the dispute, noting that it's a ""step forward"" that 25,000 bodies have been identified, World Health Organization spokesperson Christian Lindmeier said during a press briefing at the time that it's ""normal"" for death tolls to shift in conflict.

Nearly every day. The death toll doesn't distinguish between civilians and combatants. The death toll includes nearly 16,756 children and more than 10,000 people who are missing.

More than 97,000, according to the Gaza Health Ministry.

1,139 have been killed and at least 8,730 have been injured, as of Sunday, according to Israeli officials.

At least 742 people, according to the Gaza Health Ministry, and more than 6,250 have been injured.

Hamas invaded Israel in a surprise land, sea and air attack launched from the Gaza Strip in what was the deadliest day in Israeli history, and for Jews since the Holocaust, following decades of conflict between Israelis and Palestinians. Hamas militants took more than 240 people hostage; 154 of whom have been freed or rescued, with 97 remaining in Gaza, including 33 believed to be dead. Israel declared a state of war the day after the attack and launched air strikes, followed by a ground invasion, on Gaza. The Israeli invasion has spawned a humanitarian crisis as the dismantling of critical infrastructure and the Israeli occupation has blocked routes into Gaza, restricting the flow of aid. The outpouring of international support for Israel has dwindled since the start of the war as a broad coalition of its allies, including the U.S., have called for a cease-fire. The war has since expanded to Lebanon as tensions between Hezbollah and Israel reached a tipping point in July when a rocket attack Israel says Hezbollah carried out killed 12 children playing soccer in the Golan Heights region. Israel has retaliated with air strikes followed by a ground invasion, killing Hezbollah's' longtime leader and other top officials, and Hezbollah has vowed its strikes will continue unless there's a cease-fire in Gaza.

56%. That's the share of Israelis who want to see an end to the war if all hostages are returned, according to a July poll by the Israel Democracy Institute.

About 3 in 10 (31%) Americans believe Israel's military operations in Gaza are going too far, a slight increase from last December, according to a new Pew Research Center poll, which shows a plurality of Americans, 36% to be exact, are unsure about Israel's handling of its war with Hamas. Meanwhile, 20% of Americans believe Israel is doing enough while 12% say Israel should be doing more -- but both of those numbers have declined in the past 10 months, from 25% and 16%, respectively.

The Pew Research Center poll also found more Americans in September said the U.S. should play a role in resolving the war diplomatically (61%) than they did in February (55%). And Republicans in September remained more likely than Democrats (25% vs. 13%) to say the U.S. should not be involved in the diplomatic resolution of the war, according to the Pew Research Center, a drop from the 32% of Republicans and 21% of Democrats who said in February there should be no U.S. involvement in the war's resolution.

A new survey from the Pearson Institute and The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research found that 25% sympathize more with Israelis, and 15% sympathize more with Palestinians. Most -- 31% -- claimed to have equal sympathy for both sides, and another 26% report having no sympathy for either. These numbers also have not changed much since before the attack on Israel last year.

The Associated Press-NORC survey marked an increase in the number of Americans who support the establishment of an independent Palestinian state, up to about 29% now compared to 22% before the Oct. 7 attacks, in August 2023. Around half of the Americans surveyed said they neither favor or oppose an independent state (a drop from 58% in August 2023), while 17% were opposed, about what it was (15%) in 2023.

About 4 in 10 Americans say the U.S. is spending too much on military aid for Israel, very consistent with polls in February and November, according to the Pearson and AP survey.

Even before the Oct. 7 attack -- and Israel's two-front war in Gaza and Lebanon -- a whopping 79% of Americans were either concerned or very concerned about the Israel-Hamas war leading to a larger Middle East conflict, according to a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll published a year ago.

""The mix of U.S. opinions on the Gaza war reflects the complexity of a conflict where Americans may see bad actors and innocent victims on both sides,"" the Associated Press reported, citing Paul Poast, a political scientist at the University of Chicago and a research affiliate of the Pearson Institute. Poast added the conflict's nuances have lended to ""very strong views on both sides.""

The U.S. has remained a large player in the Israel-Hamas war despite stopping short of putting American boots on the ground in Gaza or Lebanon. President Joe Biden has laid out multiple ceasefire proposals in the last year that have largely failed to materialize, while also trying to walk the rope between supporting Israel's war against Hamas and providing humanitarian support for the people of Gaza, who continue to face strikes from Israel, famine and mass displacement. American concern about a larger conflict in the Middle East has proven relevant, as Israel's attacks against Hamas in Gaza and Hezbollah in Lebanon have raised the ire of Iran, which launched missile strikes at Israel this week. Biden has continued calling for ceasefires as the conflicts escalate, though it remains unclear how much influence the U.S. will have on Israeli military operations given that the two allies have seemingly been on different pages multiple times in the last year. The White House said last month it was not notified about Israel's strikes in Lebanon that killed longtime Hezbollah leader, Hassan Nasrallah, and provoked retaliatory strikes from Iran.

Iran Launches Missile Strike On Israel, Israeli Military Says (Forbes)"
Iran Refuses To Back Down As Its Proxies Endure Unprecedented Attacks,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pauliddon/2024/10/04/iran-refuses-to-back-down-as-its-proxies-endure-unprecedented-attacks/,2024-10-04T16:03:18Z,"Iran's Supreme Leader, Ali Khamenei, appeared in public on Friday to announce Iran will continue supporting its regional proxies against Israel despite them coming under unprecedented attack and pressure.

""The resistance in the region will not back down even with the killing of its leaders,"" Khamenei declared at Friday prayers in Tehran.

The supreme leader, who has the final say in all affairs in Iran since 1989, also dubiously claimed that Israel ""cannot seriously harm"" neither Hezbollah nor Hamas and said the latter's fight against Israel provides a ""vital service for the entire region.""

His appearance came less than a week after Iran launched its largest-ever ballistic missile strike against Israel on Tuesday. It also follows a deadly Israeli air and ground campaign in Lebanon, suspected Israeli sabotage of Hezbollah communications with explosive-packed pagers, the assassination of longtime Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, and airstrikes and a rare commando raid in Syria.

These actions badly hurt Iran's most militarily powerful regional proxy, prompting Tehran to lash out with Tuesday's strike, launching a massive barrage of at least 180 ballistic missiles, including some of its most advanced models. That attack ultimately caused minor damage to Israeli homes and a large airbase but no casualties inside Israel -- although falling shrapnel did kill a 38-year-old Palestinian in the West Bank. While none of its military capabilities, the targeted airbase houses many of Israel's most advanced fifth-generation F-35 aircraft, were destroyed in the attack, Israel had to expend several multi-million-dollar Arrow interceptor missiles to counter the incoming missiles.

Following the attack, a senior Israeli military official said, ""We should expect to strike government centers and possibly eliminate figures like Khamenei in Iran."" Pro-government media in Iran lauded the supreme leader for appearing in public in light of such threats and Israel's more general track record of successfully assassinating senior figures inside Iran.

Khamenei reportedly warned Nasrallah in the days leading up to his September 27 assassination to leave Lebanon. Following the simultaneous detonation of thousands of Hezbollah pagers and walkie-talkies on September 17-18 -- injuring thousands of members and disrupting the group's communications -- Khamenei sent a brigadier general in Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, Abbas Nilforoushan, to Beirut to convince Nasrallah. Nilforoushan subsequently perished in the same devastating Israeli strike that killed Nasrallah.

As Hezbollah's secretary-general since February 1992, Nasrallah was undoubtedly and the single most important figure in Iran's regional militia proxies, the self-styled Axis of Resistance. For Khamenei, his loss was as consequential, if not more so, than the US assassination of the IRGC extraterritorial Quds Force commander, Qassem Soleimani, in a January 2020 US drone strike in Baghdad.

Israel is also believed to have targeted Nasrallah's presumed successor, Hashem Safieddine, in heavy airstrikes on a bunker in Beirut on Thursday night.

Israel has also been busy afflicting potentially mortal blows against Hezbollah's powerful rocket and missile arsenal, estimated to number anywhere from 150,000 to 200,000 surface-to-surface projectiles, including long-range and precision-guided munitions.

Israel launched its current offensive against Hezbollah -- dubbed Operation Northern Arrows -- on September 23, with the Israeli Air Force executing its most extensive airstrikes ever, using 250 fighter jets to strike 1,600 Hezbollah targets on that day. While undoubtedly devastating, the Israeli military said at the beginning of the campaign that reports of these airstrikes destroying 50 percent of Hezbollah's rockets were most likely exaggerated.

However, by October 1, senior Israeli and American officials assessed that the Israeli air campaign has destroyed half of the militia's missiles and rockets. However, they again noted that the surviving half of arsenal could still pose a significant threat to Israel.

For years, analysts assessed that a Third Lebanon War could see Hezbollah unleash an enormous missile and rocket barrage, overwhelming Israel's multilayered air defense and causing significant casualties and extensive damage. For example, veteran journalist and Hezbollah expert Nicholas Blanford predicted that such a scenario could see Israel's home front ""experience its greatest destruction and loss of life since the 1948 war"" while Lebanon would become a parking lot.

Since September 23, as it potentially faces a ""use it or lose it"" scenario with its arsenal, Hezbollah has mainly used short-range rockets, only launching a single ballistic missile toward Tel Aviv on September 25, which Israeli air defenses swiftly intercepted. Iran had helped Hezbollah to build up this arsenal primarily to deter an Israeli airstrike against its nuclear program. It's widely speculated that one reason Hezbollah did not unleash more missiles since it was awaiting authorization from Tehran. On the other hand, Israeli attacks on and sabotage of its command, control, and communications could have also been the primary factor.

While Israel is unlikely to prove capable of destroying this entire arsenal with airstrikes alone, it could severely cripple it, stripping Hezbollah of its main strategic asset and Iran of its main regional deterrent against Israel. Furthermore, Hezbollah may find it difficult to replenish its losses in the short term if the current fighting stops soon.

As The New York Times reported, the current Israeli campaign -- which also includes an ongoing ground incursion into South Lebanon that has already resulted in deadly clashes, with eight Israeli soldiers killed on Wednesday -- did not begin in Lebanon but next door in Syria.

More than a week before the pager explosions, Israel launched airstrikes against Syria on September 8, itself not unusual. However, this time, an estimated 100 helicopter-borne commandos raided an underground Hezbollah missile production facility deep near northwestern Syria's Masyaf, not far from the Lebanese border.

The facility previously belonged to the Syrian Scientific Studies and Research Center, which manufactured Syria's notorious chemical weapons. It was built too deep underground for bunker-buster bombs, like the ones believed to have been used to kill Nasrallah in his Beirut bunker, to damage sufficiently. So, the commandos raided the facility, planting explosives to destroy the equipment used to manufacture Hezbollah missile components. They were in and out in only 15 minutes.

""It initially looked to be a one-off attack on a Hezbollah weapons facility, but it now appears to have been the opening salvo in a covert-in-name-only campaign against the Iranian proxy group,"" the Times report noted.

How all of this ends is impossible to predict. Khamenei's reiteration on Friday that his regime won't back down comes as Israel has vowed to retaliate directly against Iran for Tuesday's missile attack, which could see this already deadly Middle East conflagration spread even further.

For now, it seems clear that Iran's regional proxies may well have endured their deadliest days ever and mightn't fully recuperate their former strength and many of the military capabilities they possessed just over a mere week ago."
Iranian Media Claims Israeli F-35 Fighters Destroyed In Missile Strike,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/02/iranian-media-claims-israeli-f-35-fighters-destroyed-in-missile-strike/,2024-10-02T16:46:50Z,"Iran launched its largest attack on Israel to date, firing upwards of 180 missiles on Tuesday. Experts have suggested it was larger and more complex than the strikes conducted in April, and the attack employed the Islamic Republic's Fattah-1 and Kheybarshekan missiles. Israel has claimed that most of the incoming missiles were shot down, and no Israelis were killed -- although Palestinian officials reported that a Palestinian man was killed by falling debris.

Damage was also reported to be minimal, but on social media on Wednesday, many pro-Iranian supporters echoed reports from Iranian state media that the missiles successfully struck Israeli airbases. Claims were made that the attack destroyed entire squadrons of the Lockheed Martin F-35I Adir -- the Israeli Air Force's fifth-generation fighter.

Videos on social media showed missiles targeting Tel Aviv, and showing the devastation that the IAF's F-35s were purported to cause in Gaza. Iranian propagandists have also alleged that Nevatim Air Base, the home of two F-35I squadrons, was also ""completely destroyed"" in the attack.

Yet another post claimed Palestinian activists disrupted domestic F-35 production by damaging a manufacturing facility. When and where the video was filmed hasn't been confirmed.

Together, these are the latest attempts to spread misinformation and propaganda without supporting evidence.

""Some of the missiles fired at Israel seem to have hit Israeli airbases, but the claim that dozens of F-35s were destroyed appears to be completely fabricated,"" explained Dr. Kurt Braddock, assistant professor of public communication in the School of Communication at American University. ""The protest at Teledyne seems to have been very minor in scope, and there is no evidence that it will slow down production of any materials.""

Though it would appear that Tuesday's missile strike was largely thwarted, the commentary on social media suggested it was a huge military success. The news was shared by those who may have believed the original posts, making it seem even more credible.

""The spread of these posts can be considered either misinformation or disinformation. In the case of the former, people on social media may see the videos/images and simply think they are true, and re-post them because they feel they are sharing true news without critiquing it,"" added Braddock.

Iranian state media presented a fictional narrative, and it also likely employed operatives on social media to post their own claims -- which served to provide confirmation for an event that didn't occur.

""The originators of the posts are engaged in spreading disinformation -- the purposeful spread of false information for strategic purposes,"" Braddock suggested.

""The goal of most mis/dis-information is not to convince people that something that didn't happen -- dozens of F-35s destroyed -- happened,"" explained Dr. Matthew Schmidt, associate professor in the National Security Department at the University of New Haven.

""It's designed to flood the mediascape with false information that causes a psychological response where people are overloaded with contradictory information and respond to this cognitively by questioning all the information in the mediascape, true and outlandishly false alike,"" warned Schmidt. ""The attackers hack our brains by flooding us with information and trigger a cognitive response based on the volume of data coming at us, regardless of its veracity.""

The result is that even easily verifiable true information may be doubted, including any factual information that reaches the target audience. Moreover, facts can be attacked and dismissed.

Schmidt said it can be exhausting, and many simply quit trying to find any truth in the ocean of disinformation.

""This creates a benefit for the attacker, because it creates a psychological environment where future lies will be ignored, because the audience has been made too exhausted to do the work to identify and counter them,"" he added.

Even if Israel offers its own social media response that shows largely undamaged bases, such photos and videos are to be equally dismissed as misinformation/disinformation. And that could play into Tehran's favor, at least in the short term.

""The goal was largely to sow doubt about claims by the Israelis that the Iranian attack was largely ineffective -- which is what seems to be the truth,"" said Braddock.

""Reports indicate that although not all Iranian missiles were intercepted, the ones that did land did minimal damage with no Israeli casualties,"" Braddock emphasized. ""That could be seen as an embarrassment for Iran and a show of strength for the Israeli defensive measures. By spreading disinformation that seems to suggest the missiles were more effective than they actually were, the posters are trying to communicate the 'effectiveness' of the Iranian attack."""
