"Trump secretly sent Putin COVID-19 tests during pandemic shortage, a new book reports",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5146501/trump-putin-covid-tests,2024-10-08T23:07:08Z,"Russian President Vladimir Putin and then President Donald Trump shake hands before a meeting in Helsinki, on July 16, 2018.

Vice President Harris is criticizing Donald Trump following new reporting by the journalist Bob Woodward that the former president secretly shared COVID-19 test machines with Russia's Vladimir Putin at a moment in 2020 when tests were out of reach for most Americans.

The revelation, first reported by CNN and The Washington Post on Tuesday, is detailed in a forthcoming book called War book by the famed Watergate journalist, about Trump's record on the international stage, as well as President Biden's.

According to the book, Trump sent the secret shipment of testing equipment to the Russian leader at the height of the pandemic in 2020, even as the U.S. and other nations were facing crippling shortages of testing kits.

""I don't want you to tell anybody because people will get mad at you, not me. They don't care about me,"" Putin told Trump, according to the book. Trump responded, ""I don't care. Fine,"" according to Woodward.

NPR has not independently verified the account, which was based on interviews with unnamed sources.

Asked about the report during an interview Tuesday with Howard Stern, Harris said Woodward's reporting was an example of why Trump cannot be trusted as commander-in-chief, because she said he is easily manipulated by authoritarians he hopes to befriend.

""He admires strong men, and he gets played by them because he thinks that they're his friends, and they are manipulating him full time and manipulating him by flattery and with favor,"" Harris said. ""Remember, people were dying by the hundreds, everybody was scrambling to get these kits ... and this guy, who was President of the United States, is sending them to Russia to a murderous dictator for his personal use.""

The Trump campaign has dismissed the book as ""made up stories"" written by a ""deranged man,"" according to a statement by its communications director, Steven Cheung.

""President Trump gave him absolutely no access for this trash book that either belongs in the bargain bin of the fiction section of a discount bookstore or used as toilet tissue,"" the statement read.

Woodward's reporting adds to the swirl of questions that have surrounded Trump about his relationship with Putin dating back to his 2016 campaign for the White House, when he publicly called on Russia to find Hillary Clinton's missing emails. Trump has defended his stance toward Putin, maintaining that had he still been in office Russia would not have invaded Ukraine in 2022.

It is a relationship that appears to have continued even after Trump left the White House, according to Woodward, who reports that the former president may have spoken with Putin as many as seven times since Biden took office.

In one episode reported by Woodward, Trump ordered an aide away from his office at Mar-a-Lago in order to take a private call with Putin early in 2024.

The book also details pivotal moments in the Biden presidency, including the administration's response to the war in Ukraine and Biden's fractious relationship with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Woodward recounts the president's frustrations with Netanyahu amid the ongoing war in Gaza as he concluded that Netanyahu's instincts for political survival outweighed his interest in defeating Hamas.

""That son of a b****, Bibi Netanyahu, he's a bad guy. He's a bad f****** guy!"" Biden reportedly told advisers, according to Woodward.

Asked about the anecdote, the White House declined comment, but deputy press secretary Emilie Simons said the U.S-Israel relationship is ""as strong as ever"" and said Biden and Netanyahu have a long and candid relationship.

""They can have very honest and straightforward conversations with each other,"" Simons said."
Some Indian American Democrats see themselves in Harris. Others see the limits,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5131223/some-indian-american-democrats-see-themselves-in-harris-others-see-the-limits,2024-10-08T21:57:10Z,"In the warm Georgia heat, Kannan Udayarajan is sipping chai and talking politics at an Indian restaurant in a small strip mall in suburban Atlanta.

There used to be only one Indian restaurant here, Udayarajan says, in this corner of adjoining suburbs at the edge of Forsyth County.

""Now in a 10 mile radius we probably have 40 to 50 at a minimum.""

The exponential rise in Indian restaurants follows a wave of Desi immigrants here. Desi is a term many people from the South Asian diaspora use to describe themselves. These immigrants are no longer primarily landing in traditional South Asian strongholds, like California and New York, but are also reshaping states like Texas and Georgia, helping transform metropolitan suburbs into some of the most diverse spaces in American life. Indian Americans now make up the second largest immigrant population in the United States.

Udayarajan says he's been a political junkie ever since he came to America for work in 2007. He hadn't planned to stay, but he got married and had kids, and in 2018 he became a citizen. Still, he didn't get involved in local politics until 2020, when former President Donald Trump was running for his second term. Udayarajan organized in his own community, helping register Indian Americans to vote, sometimes teaching them about American democracy.

""Joe Biden won Georgia by 11,780 votes,"" he says. ""And Forsyth County polled16,000 brand new Democratic votes in that election. So we made an impact.""

South Asians are one of the most progressive Asian American communities, a realignment that dates back to 9/11 and the policies and racial animus that followed. A recent Pew Research Center study found that 68 percent of Indian registered voters identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning.

Two years ago, Udayarajan became the head of the Forsyth County Democratic Party. He says this year, he believes Desis could again make the difference in a battleground state like Georgia.

Udayarajan is joined at the restaurant by Ashwin Ramaswami, a 25-year-old who was born and raised just a few blocks away in Johns Creek. Udayarajan asks Ramaswami if he thinks the South Asians here are excited about Vice President Kamala Harris' nomination for president.

""I see a huge amount of excitement,"" Ramaswami tells him. Udayarajan asks if it's more among the immigrant community or among folks who were born here?

""I think everyone,"" Ramaswami says. ""It's so different to have a presidential nominee called Kamala, right? Kamala is a Sanskrit word.""

A meme circulating on messaging apps and other social media has been hard to miss. The meme goes that in Sanskrit, Kamala means ""lotus,"" but in America Kamala means POTUS -- President of the United States.

""The ticket's been supercharged for the Desi community,"" Ramaswami says. He points out a personal overlap: Harris' mother is from the same village as his mother in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

""People can see the connections, they can see their own stories in her, because politics -- a lot of it is about the policy, but it's also about can you trust the person you're going to be electing.""

Ramaswami left John's Creek to go off to school, and then work. Now he's returned and is making a run for Georgia state Senate. He's part of another growing group -- young South Asian Americans running for office.

At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this past summer, South Asians gathered everywhere: Delegate meetups and happy hours and networking lunches.

""For all the years that I've been involved in politics, I've been part of the broader Asian American community,"" says Ann Lata Kalayil, co-founder of the South Asian American Policy and Research Institute. ""But more recently, we've started talking about South Asian Americans."" She points out the number of times she heard ""Indian American"" mentioned on the DNC stage and in the media to describe Harris. ""There's a real sense of pride, you know?""

Deep Singh Badhesha grew up in predominantly white Colorado Springs, Colo.

""I was the only South Asian there,"" he says. ""I was always trying to find my identity, but it was hard,"" he says, because no one at school looked like him. He describes experiencing a classic Asian American childhood experience -- the lunchbox moment. ""Your mother will make you a deliciously cooked Indian dish"" Badhesha explains, ""and you'll bring it to school and you open it up and everyone's like, oh, what the hell is that gross food?""

He says when it happened to him he felt like an outsider, so he broke off parts of himself to fit in.

""I used to actually be a super Republican and libertarian person because I used to look for folks like Bobby Jindal or Nikki Haley. And I'm like -- 'oh this is where South Asians look like they're having acceptance, right?'""

Then he went to college and met South Asian peers.

""They instilled a lot more pride in who I was,"" he says.

Badhesha believes things are different now.

""Being in this moment and seeing a lot of young folks in particular who see themselves in the Democratic Party -- who see themselves in Ro Khanna or Pramila Jayapal -- and of course Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, you know, it's like a huge moment for South Asians.""

Back in the Atlanta suburbs, another group of South Asians are meeting to talk politics, but there is no celebration over Harris' nomination.

""It stings, right?"" says Anjali Enjeti. ""I mean, boy, would I love to celebrate a Black, Jamaican, Indian woman.""

Enjeti says she cannot support Harris because of the Democratic party's political, military and financial support for Israel, and what is happening in Gaza and in other parts of the Middle East.

""It feels like a betrayal that when we finally get somebody who we can relate to in some way, to have them support and enforce a genocide is -- it's just devastating.""

Israel stands accused of war crimes and genocide in front of the International Criminal Court, whose preliminary finding is that it is plausible Israel has violated the convention against genocide. Israel and the Biden administration strongly deny the charges.

Enjeti and Harris are both half Indian, and they can each trace their roots back to southern India. Enjeti says that is where the similarities to Harris end.

""I think identity politics is a trap,"" she says. ""It is a trap to think that somebody's shared demographics or community has anything to do with your values.""

Enjeti is sitting with Farhana Rahman, remembering 2020. They registered voters and knocked on doors and drove people to the polls.

""We were screamed at,"" Enjeti says. ""We faced very real physical threats. We risked it all for Biden to win in Georgia.""

""That same me has done nothing this election cycle,"" Rahman adds.

Rahman says as an Indian American Muslim, she believes another Trump presidency is a ""existential threat to democracy,"" even potentially to her own safety. But she says she doesn't feel safe now. She says she's afraid to speak out against the conflict in Gaza and she's reluctant to tell colleagues and acquaintances that she is Muslim.

""I feel like I have to hide my identity,"" she says. ""It's unfortunate, but the level of Islamophobia, just making it so prevalent -- people can say horrible things to Muslims, and it's completely okay.""

She believes she has faced more Islamophobia and repression in the past year than she did after 9/11.

""After October 7th, it has become extremely dividing to the point where being a Muslim automatically means you are pro-Hamas and [an] anti-Semite.""

Rahman says she still doesn't know who she will vote for on Election Day, but she says the options only fill her with sadness and fear."

I went to a classic Wisconsin supper club to talk politics. This is what I learned,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5138314/wisconsin-supper-club-harris-trump,2024-10-08T15:11:27Z,"The Packing House in Milwaukee caters to diners of all political persuasions. Keren Carrión/NPR hide caption

When we started planning an election reporting trip to swing state Wisconsin, locals told us we had to include a visit to a supper club to experience a unique part of the state's culture. So when I finally met Chris Wiken, whose family opened The Packing House in Milwaukee 50 years ago, my first question was, ""What on earth is a supper club?""

""This is the elusive question,"" he says. ""The whole idea of a supper club is somewhere that you're going to come and spend the evening at.""

Typically, a supper club will include a few things: a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned cocktail at the bar, seafood or prime rib in the dining room and then live music and a boozy ice cream drink to close out the night.

Even though The Packing House was remodeled about a decade ago, it still has a classic old-time aesthetic with dark wood and dim lighting. Walking through the doors feels like going back in time.

Milwaukee's main airport terminal was just across the street when The Packing House opened in 1974. Now, that terminal serves private jets where former President Donald Trump, Vice President Harris or their running mates park every time they come to town.

""The police and Secret Service come over and go, 'Hey, Chris, they have to close down the street again.' And then I go and shake my fist at them,"" he says, joking that he'll vote for whoever shuts down the street in front of his restaurant fewer times.

You won't see a Harris or Trump sign in front of The Packing House. Wiken doesn't want to alienate his customers, who have a wide range of views, as the All Things Considered crew and I discovered when we started chatting people up at the bar.

Janine Collette, having dinner with an old friend, remembers growing up in Wisconsin before Roe v. Wade legalized abortion in the state.

""In high school, we used to raise money in the girls' bathrooms to help girls go to the state of New York to get an abortion,"" she says. ""We're not going back."" Collette is excited to cast her vote for the candidate she expects to become the first female U.S. president.

At the other end of the bar, Ron Raasch says that he has voted for Democrats his whole life and that this election may be the first time he doesn't. He's disillusioned with the two-party system and is considering a vote for Green Party candidate Jill Stein.

""It's very hard to see the difference when both of the major parties are going to continue shipping arms all over the world and especially to Gaza,"" he says. Raasch isn't concerned that in 2016 and 2020 the margin of victory in Wisconsin for Trump and Biden, respectively, was less than 1% of the vote. ""People are throwing that as a fear tactic,"" he says. ""And I'm trying to [more so] make a statement that the two-party system is showing its age and its frailties.""

Wearing a Packers hat at the bar, Lee Cielonko is nursing a beer while he waits for his food to arrive. ""I want the economy to be put back together. I want energy. I want to drill, baby, drill, man,"" he says.

He's supporting Trump and is concerned about immigration, saying: ""People come here and they don't have the same culture as us. They don't understand and know a lot of the way our culture works.""

So much about the future, as well as this election, is uncertain; there can be something comforting in the familiar: fish fry Friday, a Wisconsin brandy old-fashioned at the bar and live music in a place that has been doing pretty much the same thing since before most Americans were born."

As Hurricane Milton intensifies and heads toward Florida's Gulf Coast, residents are not only preparing for weather impacts but also dealing with misinformation about FEMA. The disaster relief agency has provided hundreds of millions of dollars in aid so far to help those affected by Hurricane Helene. Former President Donald Trump claims FEMA is running out of money after spending it on undocumented migrants. However, FEMA's administrator says those false claims are discouraging people from applying for the federal funds they desperately need.

Israelis yesterday observed a day of grief and reflection to mark one year since the Hamas-led attacks on communities near the country's border. Multiple memorials took place, partly due to disagreements over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's insistence on continuing the war in Gaza. Families of hostages and their supporters boycotted the official government memorial service. They're seeking an immediate cease-fire deal to end the war and secure the release of the remaining 101 hostages.

In a wide-ranging interview with 60 Minutes yesterday, Vice President Harris was pressed for specifics on how she would pay for her economic plans and work to end the war in Ukraine. Her appearance on the show is part of a long tradition of presidential candidates sitting for interviews with 60 Minutes, dating back to 1968. Trump has criticized Harris for being unwilling to sit for difficult interviews with the press. The show says Trump was scheduled to appear for an interview as well, but his campaign canceled last week. Here's a deeper dive into Harris' responses during the interview.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Michigan to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

In 2017, Trump introduced ""Opportunity Zones,"" a tax incentive program aimed at encouraging investment in low-income and distressed communities like Detroit. Some were concerned at the time that investors would benefit more from the program than residents. Detroit Public Radio's Russ McNamara says it's a ""firm maybe"" that the program has reached its goal. Listen to hear more about what the program has achieved so far and how development in Opportunity Zones can be measured.

Vice President Harris on Tuesday will lay out a new proposal to expand Medicare coverage to help cover the costs of home health care aides for seniors.

Her campaign said Harris plans to discuss the measure on ABC's The View, a daytime television talk show popular with middle-aged and older women.

The proposal is squarely aimed at ""sandwich generation"" women who take care of aging parents as well as their own kids.

Internal campaign data shows this demographic, comprising nearly a quarter of Americans, has a relatively large percentage of undecided voters, a senior campaign official told reporters on condition of anonymity ahead of the public release of the plan.

In its current form, Medicare doesn't widely cover assistance like home health aides for seniors, which can be costly. And nursing home facilities are also expensive.

Harris' plan to expand Medicare to cover at-home care for seniors would be paid for in part by expanding Medicare drug price negotiations, her campaign said."
Harris is trying to reach new voters with a media blitz both traditional  --  and not,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5144874/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-alex-cooper-howard-stern-60-minutes-colbert-the-view,2024-10-08T09:02:42Z,"Vice President Harris is making a number of high-profile media appearances this week on some of the most popular news and entertainment programs in the country.

On Tuesday, she's slated to appear on The View on ABC, The Howard Stern Show and The Late Show With Stephen Colbert on CBS. On Thursday, she will take part in a Univision Town Hall in Nevada.

Harris also spoke with CBS News's Bill Whitaker for an interview that aired Monday on 60 Minutes and sat down with podcast host Alex Cooper for her show Call Her Daddy, which aired on Sunday.

It's a string of media appearances that the vice president's campaign says is purposefully geared at reaching a wide variety of audiences on different platforms, especially as voting begins in many states around the country and Election Day inches closer.

""Vice President Harris is seizing this opportunity to reach voters where they are,"" a Harris campaign official said in a statement ahead of the vice president's interview with Cooper, adding that the appearance ""underscores the importance of connecting with younger audiences, especially those who will play a crucial role in determining the outcome of the election.""

Major party candidates have sat down with 60 Minutes dating back to 1968. The show has a traditionally older audience and a massive reach, remaining the highest-ranked news program for decades.

But with her interview with Cooper, who is a millennial, Harris became the first presidential candidate to ever appear on Call Her Daddy, one of the most popular podcasts in the country, especially among women, where nearly 8 in 10 of the show's listeners are under 35, according to metrics from Edison Research.

It's a podcast known for celebrity interviews and frank discussions, tailored to women, about topics like sex and relationships -- not politics. But that didn't stop Harris, who is banking on support from young voters this fall.

""I think you and your listeners have really got this thing right, which is, one of the best ways to communicate with people is to be real,"" Harris told Cooper after being asked why she wanted to come on the show.

""I think, especially now, this is a moment in the country and in life where people really want to know they're seen and heard,"" she added. ""And that they're part of a community. That they're not out there alone.""

Harris spoke with Cooper for about 40 minutes, spending the most time on the topic of protecting abortion access. The interview was an opportunity for Harris to try to reach a key voting bloc -- Gen Z and millennial voters, who have turned out at lower numbers than older generations.

Cooper has also built a massive fan base online, with more than 11 million followers across her show and personal accounts on Instagram and TikTok. Plus, Call Her Daddy has a politically and geographically diverse following, according to Edison.

Nearly half of the audience identifies as Democrats, compared to a quarter who are Republicans and 20% who are Independents. Plus, the largest portion of Cooper's listeners -- a third -- live in the South, an area with key swing states like Georgia and North Carolina.

It isn't the first time Harris has veered outside of mainstream news media to appeal to voting blocs key to her potential victory. Last month, she went on the sports podcast All the Smoke, a show geared towards Black men, hosted by former NBA players Stephen Jackson and Matt Barnes.

These moves are not unique to the Harris campaign. Former President Trump has also put an emphasis on reaching voters outside of traditional news outlets and on social media -- a strategy that has been central to the campaign's youth outreach.

While Trump has largely done interviews with news outlets that are friendly to conservatives, over the past few months, he and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have also appeared with a number of popular influencers and sat down for podcast interviews that have largely younger, male-dominated audiences.

That's included conversations with influencers who also have some of the top-ranked podcasts in the country, like Logan Paul -- who has a combined following of 46 million across TikTok and Instagram -- and Theo Von, who has collectively 14 million followers on the same platforms."

Vice President Harris sat for a wide-ranging interview that aired on 60 Minutes Monday, during which she was pressed for specifics on how she would pay for her economic plans and how she would bring an end to the war in Ukraine.

The interview with correspondent Bill Whitaker followed weeks of criticism from her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, that Harris has been unwilling to sit for difficult interviews with the press. Her appearance on 60 Minutes was part of a week-long media blitz that will see Harris appear on programs that include The View, The Late Show with Stephen Colbert and The Howard Stern Show.

On the economy, Harris was pressed on how she would pay for economic promises like an expanded child tax credit and tax breaks for first time home buyers and new businesses. A new report from the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget found that Harris' estimated proposals would cost the government around $3.5 trillion, but Harris said she would offset that by raising taxes on corporations and the highest-earning Americans.

Her answer led interviewer Whitaker to push back, saying, ""We're dealing with the real world here."" Harris responded by saying she believes leaders in Congress are privately ready to listen to her.

""When you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about,"" she said, adding that there are ""plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

On the issue of immigration, Harris was asked why the Biden administration to did not move sooner to crack down on illegal immigration - a recurring criticism on the campaign trail from Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance.

""The policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem,"" Harris said. Illegal border crossings have fallen off by half, she said, ""but we need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem.""

Harris was also asked about criticism from her Republican opponents that she has morphed from a relatively liberal candidate during her first run for the White House in 2020 to a more centrist candidate today. She responded by saying that her evolution is result of traveling the nation as vice president ""and seeking what is possible in terms of common ground.""

""I believe in building consensus,"" Harris said. ""We are a diverse people, geographically, regionally, in terms of where we are in our backgrounds, and what the American people do want is that we have leaders who can build consensus, where we can figure out compromise and understand it's not a bad thing, as long as you don't compromise your values.""

On foreign policy, Harris said she would not meet unilaterally with President Vladimir Putin of Russia about ending the war in in Ukraine, suggesting Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelenskyy would need to be involved. ""Ukraine must have a say in the future of Ukraine,"" Harris said.

The vice president also shared new details about a surprising admission she made during her debate with Trump: that she is a gun owner. -- that she was a gun owner.

She told Oprah Winfrey last month that she had long owned a gun for protection, because of her history in law enforcement. ""If somebody breaks in my house, they're getting shot."" She told Whitaker she owned a Glock and that she'd ""had it for quite some time."" Asked if she had ever fired it, she said, ""Yes, of course I have, at a shooting range.""

Harris and Trump marked 1 year since the Oct. 7 attacks with tributes to the victims,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5144699/kamala-harris-donald-trump-october-7,2024-10-07T22:25:41Z,"One year after Hamas attacked Israel, both major-party presidential candidates marked the date on Monday with promises of continued support for the Jewish state.

Vice President Harris remembered the victims of the Oct. 7 attack by planting a memorial tree at her residence at the Naval Observatory in Washington, D.C., while former President Trump visited a sacred site for Hasidic Jews in Queens, N.Y.

""I will never forget October 7, and the world must never forget,"" Harris said during a tree-planting ceremony on the grounds of the vice president's residence. ""We must work to ensure nothing like the horrors of October 7 can ever happen again.""

Hamas, which controls Gaza, killed about 1,200 people in Israel on Oct. 7 and took some 250 hostage in Gaza, according to Israel. A year later, more than 100 hostages are still unaccounted for. Israel's response to the attack has killed at least 41,000 people in Gaza, according to Gaza health officials.

Harris reiterated her support for Israel's defense, and promised the Biden administration would continue working to free the remaining hostages in Gaza. She then read the names of seven missing American citizens.

Harris also called for efforts to ""relieve the immense suffering of innocent Palestinians in Gaza who have experienced so much pain and loss over the year.""

She appeared alongside her husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish and and who has led White House efforts to fight antisemitism.

Trump met with members of an Orthodox Jewish community in New York on Monday morning, and visited the grave of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, an influential orthodox rabbi who died in 1994. Trump was then scheduled to attend an Oct. 7 remembrance event Monday evening with Jewish leaders, according to Trump campaign officials.

Hamas' stated goal is the elimination of Israel and the establishment of a Palestinian state. Israel says the objective of the war in Gaza is to eliminate Hamas.

The war has exposed rifts within the Democratic Party over the Biden-Harris administration's support for Israel. Those divides are particularly pronounced among younger voters -- a key voting bloc for Democrats and a group more likely than older voters to express sympathy for the Palestinian people. According to the Pew Research Center, voters ages 18-29 also are less supportive of U.S. military aid to Israel.

Trump has sought to capitalize on those tensions within his rival's party, saying recently that any Jewish voter who supports a Democrat is a ""fool."" Those remarks drew widespread criticism from Jewish organizations across the ideological spectrum.

He continued emphasizing the message in an interview Monday with radio host Hugh Hewitt. ""I did more for Israel than anybody, I did more for the Jewish people than anybody, and it's not a reciprocal, as they say,"" Trump said."

Rumors, misinformation and lies about the federal government's response to Hurricane Helene in the southeastern United States have run rampant since the storm made landfall, especially around funding for the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

The claims have become so widespread that FEMA set up a response page to debunk many falsehoods around how disaster funding works and what the agency's response has been.

As of Sunday, FEMA says it has provided more than $137 million in assistance to six states in the southeast, including 7,000 federal personnel, nearly 15 million meals, 14 million liters of water, 157 generators and more than half a million tarps.

The agency also says more than 3,000 North Carolina residents have been rescued or supported by more than 1,200 urban search and rescue personnel, with recovery efforts aided by National Guard and active-duty troops. North Carolina has also received $100 million in federal transportation funds to rebuild roads and bridges washed out by the storm.

Republicans, especially former President Donald Trump, have sought to wield the storm as a political tool against Vice President Harris with less than a month to go before Election Day. Trump has repeatedly attacked Harris and President Biden as doing a ""bad job"" handling the storm's aftermath without specifics, instead using misleading math to complain about immigration and foreign aid.

""They're offering them $750 to people whose homes have been washed away,"" Trump said Saturday at a rally in Butler, Pa. ""And yet we send tens of billions of dollars to foreign countries that most people have never heard of. They're offering them $750. They've been destroyed. These people have been destroyed.""

The $750 Trump refers to is what's called Serious Needs Assistance, an initial direct relief payment intended to help cover emergency supplies like food, water, baby formula and other basics

The serious needs assistance is one of many changes to FEMA's individual assistance programs that took effect earlier this year, along with displacement assistance to cover immediate housing needs while residents sort out long-term options. FEMA assistance also covers storm-related damage to homes and personal property.

Another popular refrain that has gained traction on the right in recent days is the claim that FEMA has no money for hurricane recovery because of money spent on migrants, something that is not true.

The money used in the aftermath of Helene and other major disasters is not part of FEMA's operating budget, but instead comes from the Disaster Relief Fund, which is appropriated by Congress.

Last week, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas reportedly said the agency ""does not have the funds to make it through"" the rest of hurricane season.

FEMA is required to share monthly status reports on the DRF, and before the end of the fiscal year the agency had to implement ""Immediate Needs Funding"" that puts a pause on some of the agency's spending that is not tied to lifesaving and life-sustaining efforts when the needs of the DRF could be more than the remaining balance.

The most recent report that runs through August showed a projected deficit by the end of September -- and that's before Helene made landfall.

October is the start of the federal government's fiscal year, and a stopgap spending measure approved by lawmakers last month replenished the DRF at last year's baseline level of $20 billion, though some of that money is reserved for ongoing recovery efforts from previous disasters and projects to mitigate future impacts.

The DRF is often considered the first line of response while FEMA and other agencies assess the damage and needs related to a specific disaster. Once that information is compiled, the president typically sends a formal request to Congress for supplemental appropriations to provide more closely tailored funding and programs for any given response.

Congress has not yet passed supplemental funding for other disasters that occurred earlier in the year, much to the frustration of members in communities recovering from floods, fires and other major events. Even if they had approved the existing funding request, the money would not have been directed to Helene relief since the storm damage happened after Congress left Washington at the end of September.

Lawmakers could return to Washington to try to pass more aid but they are waiting for the White House to send an updated funding request. President Biden wrote a letter to Congress last week that said FEMA ""has the resources needed for the immediate emergency response phase.""

Biden went on to say an updated request is on its way.

""My Administration will keep the Congress apprised of efforts to assess the full resource requirements associated with Hurricane Helene, including for long-term rebuilding and resilience efforts, as those estimates become available,"" he wrote.

One continuing resolution proposed in the House last month would have included an additional $10 billion for the fund, but that version failed because it was tied to a controversial Republican-backed election bill that focused on further cracking down on already-illegal non-citizen voting.

An August report from the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General argues that billions of dollars earmarked for disasters that occurred more than a decade ago could be returned to the Disaster Relief Fund.

But the false argument from Trump and other Republicans has been that the Biden administration diverted disaster money to take care of migrants.

""They stole the FEMA money, just like they stole it from a bank, so they could give it to their illegal immigrants that they want to have vote for them this season,"" Trump said in Michigan last week.

Non-citizens cannot vote in the election, and no disaster funds have been diverted. Instead, Trump and his allies are referring to the Shelter and Services Program that saw FEMA disseminate hundreds of millions in grants from Customs and Border Protection to municipalities that saw an influx of migrants.

That program was a separate funding source with a separate purpose covering separate years - and not relevant to the current hurricane recovery efforts.

Meanwhile, Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson said Sunday he had no plans to bring lawmakers back from recess before the election to address requests for additional disaster relief as Hurricane Milton approaches the Florida coast as a Category 5 storm."
"1 year after Hamas attacked Israel, the conflict grows more dangerous than ever",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/g-s1-26381/hamas-israel-hezbollah-gaza-lebanon,2024-10-07T16:07:28Z,"A girl walks through the rubble of a collapsed building in Khan Younis, in the southern Gaza Strip, on Oct. 2, amid the war in the Palestinian territory between Israel and Hamas. Bashar Taleb/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

Thousands breached a border fence. Others arrived in speedboats. Some even came by paraglider in a dawn attack by Hamas fighters a year ago that caught Israel by surprise, leaving 1,200 people dead and another 250 as hostages. It also set in motion events that now threaten to turn Israel's long-running conflict with Iran's proxies into a direct and dangerous war with Tehran.

Saturday, Oct. 7, 2023, marked the deadliest day in the history of modern Israel, triggering a devastating attack on Palestinians. The result has been a humanitarian catastrophe for Gaza. Beginning in the days after the Hamas attack, Israeli warplanes began punishing airstrikes inside the narrow strip of Palestinian territory that also lies adjacent to Egypt and the Mediterranean Sea. By the end of the month, Israeli forces had launched a full-scale ground invasion of Gaza.

At the one-year mark in the Israel-Hamas war, here are four things that are key to where things stand today.

In the aftermath of the Hamas attack, as Israelis mourned those killed, they also feared for the safety of the hostages. A central plaza in downtown Tel Aviv, unofficially dubbed Hostages Square, was quickly transformed into a gathering place for the families, friends and supporters of the captives. ""Bring them home now!"" emerged as a potent rallying cry, and posters showing the faces and names of the hostages became ubiquitous. Many Israelis began wearing special necklaces, bracelets and T-shirts to show their support for the captives. Daily vigils in Hostages Square drew large crowds.

Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu -- already weathering intense criticism for intelligence failures in the lead-up to the surprise attack -- came under intense pressure to halt the fighting in Gaza and secure the release of the hostages.

Although Israel and Hamas managed a brief cease-fire in November that allowed for the exchange of more than 100 hostages for nearly 250 Palestinian prisoners, the truce lasted just a week. Hamas did unilaterally release four hostages, and eight others were rescued by Israeli forces. Israel's military also recovered the bodies of several hostages.

The fate of the remaining captives in Gaza has remained an open wound for many Israelis. Netanyahu's office believes that of the 101 hostages still unaccounted for in Gaza, about a third are likely dead.

The hostages question continues to shape Israel's public response to the conflict.

Since the start of Israel's military response, the country's attacks have killed at least 41,000 Palestinians in Gaza, including 16,500 children, according to Gaza's Health Ministry. Another 95,000 people have been injured, the ministry says.

Israel's military began its assault on Hamas in the north of Gaza, and as Palestinian civilians sought to escape the fighting, most of them fled southward, displacing them from their homes and cutting them off from critical infrastructure needed for daily survival.

Recent data from the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, the World Health Organization and Palestinian officials in Gaza indicate the attacks have damaged or destroyed more than half of Gaza's homes, 80% of its commercial facilities and 85% of the territory's schools.

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres has called the humanitarian situation in Gaza a ""moral stain on us all,"" and the aid group Refugees International has said that Israel's military response ""has wrought disproportionate death and suffering among civilians in Gaza, generating famine-like conditions while obstructing and undermining the humanitarian response.""

Khan Younis, Gaza's second-largest city, which Israeli authorities considered to be a Hamas stronghold, experienced some of the most intense bombardment of the conflict.

In the first few months of fighting, Rafah, near the border with Egypt in southern Gaza, was designated as a ""safe zone"" by the Israeli military -- meant as a place where civilians could shelter and get access to desperately needed international humanitarian aid. Even so, Israel continued to carry out airstrikes on Rafah, some targeted at Hamas fighters or facilities, while others aimed to free Israeli hostages, according to the Israeli military. Some of those airstrikes hit homes, killing and injuring dozens of civilians, and others destroyed food distribution sites. More than half of Gaza's prewar population of 2.2 million was believed to be sheltering in Rafah. In May, Israel issued evacuation orders for the city and launched an offensive that sealed the border with Egypt, which until then was one of the main entry points for humanitarian aid.

Food, drinking water and materials for temporary shelters are in short supply and are being carried in by trucks operated by international relief organizations. People in Gaza are down to one meal every other day, and an estimated 50,000 children between the ages of 6 months and 5 years are in urgent need of treatment for malnutrition.

U.S. efforts to speed aid to Gaza have also floundered. A special $230 million temporary floating pier known as the Joint Logistics Over-the-Shore system (JLOTS) operated only intermittently as damage from high winds and rough seas in the eastern Mediterranean repeatedly rendered it inoperable.

Besides the brief cease-fire to facilitate a hostages-for-prisoners swap, repeated rounds of peace talks -- some mediated by Qatar -- have failed to make much progress. Deep-seated animosities and the fragmented nature of the Palestinian leadership have played a part in preventing any lasting peace deal.

Meanwhile, the U.S. has tried to walk a fine line between diplomatic and military support for its long-term ally, Israel, and a desire to mitigate the suffering in Gaza while trying to contain a wider war that increasingly has dragged Iran and Israel into direct conflict and could engulf the rest of the Middle East.

For the moment, cease-fire talks that at times sparked optimism have fallen silent.

In late September, Secretary of State Antony Blinken summed up the U.S. position, saying, ""Israel has the right to defend itself against terrorism. The way it does so matters.""

Meanwhile, public opinion in the U.S. has been split largely along partisan lines, with conservatives showing support for Israel, but some people, younger and more liberal, turning out for pro-Palestinian rallies on college campuses.

Among Democrats, more than half say that Israel bears ""a lot"" of responsibility for the continuation of the war in Gaza, while only about 4 in 10 Republicans do, according to a Pearson Institute/AP-NORC poll published last week.

That political dichotomy could influence the outcome of a likely tight U.S. presidential race, with some Democrats suggesting that Netanyahu is ignoring the Biden administration's peace entreaties in an effort to tip the election toward former President Donald Trump. Meanwhile, voters in key battleground states give Trump higher marks than his opponent, Vice President Harris, on foreign policy matters, according to a recent poll by the New York-based Institute for Global Affairs.

From the opening days of the conflict in Gaza, the Biden administration warned against allowing the Hamas attack to morph into a war that could bring in Hezbollah -- the Lebanon-based, Iran-backed militant group -- as a primary combatant and could eventually lead to a direct conflict with Tehran.

But increasingly in recent weeks, that's exactly what seems to be happening.

On Oct. 8, 2023, Hezbollah began launching rockets against Israel in support of the Palestinian militants fighting in Gaza. Israel hit back, and for months, low-level conflict simmered along the Lebanon-Israel border. Iran, Hezbollah's main backer, mostly stayed out of the conflict. But an Israeli attack in April against an Iranian diplomatic base in Syria that killed several of Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps officers changed the dynamic. Less than two weeks later, Iran retaliated with a large-scale drone and missile strike on Israel. The attack, heavily telegraphed by Tehran in an apparent effort to contain the fallout, was easily repulsed by Israeli air defenses, assisted by the United States.

Fast-forward to last month: In an operation credited to Mossad, Israel's intelligence agency, in synchronized attacks over two days, electronic pagers belonging to members of Hezbollah suddenly exploded across Lebanon, killing more than a dozen people -- including two children -- and wounding thousands more, according to Lebanese health authorities.

Soon after, Israel launched hundreds of airstrikes against southern Lebanon that it said were aimed at Hezbollah targets. One that hit a residential building in downtown Beirut killed a top Hezbollah commander.

As Israeli airstrikes continued days later, multiple residential buildings in southern Beirut were demolished. On Sept. 27, Israel announced that Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah, who led the militant group for more than three decades, was killed in one of the strikes. Hezbollah later confirmed his death.

Israel also hit ports and power stations in Yemen operated by another Iran-backed group, the Houthis.

The United Nations says about 1 million Lebanese have fled their homes amid the Israeli airstrikes. Israeli authorities say about 63,000 Israelis remain displaced from the border area with Lebanon due to Hezbollah rocket fire.

On Oct. 1, Israel opened a ground offensive in southern Lebanon, a move that hearkened back to a similar 1982 invasion of the country's south by Israeli forces, which led to an 18-year occupation and to a monthlong war that Israel fought against Hezbollah in 2006. Less than 24 hours later, Iran launched a massive ballistic missile attack on Israel. The country's extensive defenses -- bolstered by two U.S. destroyers deployed in the region -- intercepted most of the Iranian missiles. However, Israeli officials acknowledge that some of the Iranian missiles did hit an air base."

One year ago today, Hamas launched an ambush attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking hostages. This unleashed the deadliest war in Palestinian history. According to the Gaza health ministry, at least 41,000 people in Gaza have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and fire. Now, Israel is bombing Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Hear directly from people in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank as they describe how one year of this war has upended their lives. For more coverage marking this anniversary, check out NPR's special series page.

The war in the Middle East is personal in the swing state of Michigan. The GOP and Democrats are focused on the Arab and Muslim American voting bloc, and the state has the largest Lebanese American population in the country. Many in the state have families living in the areas of Lebanon that are being bombed right now.

A new report has found that both Harris' and Trump's economic plans would increase the national debt. According to the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, Trump's plan would add an estimated $7.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, while Harris' proposals would cost the government an estimated $3.5 trillion. The committee has cautioned that there could be a future fiscal crisis if politicians do not take more decisive action on the national debt. Let's take a closer look at the details of both economic plans.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Michigan to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

Michigan, a ""blue wall"" state, is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House. But the victory won't be easy. Harris and former President Donald Trump remain in a close battle. Here are key factors that could decide which way Michigan swings:

This essay was written by Daniel Estrin, NPR's international correspondent in Jerusalem.

""The day still keeps surprising us,"" my colleague Anas Baba in Gaza texted me last Oct. 7, close to midnight.

I was at a hospital in southern Israel. The waiting room was full of parents in a daze, waiting for word about their children who had come under attack at an outdoor techno rave near the Gaza border. In Gaza, our producer Anas was taking photos of families fleeing their homes as Israeli airstrikes rained down.

It was the deadliest day in Israeli history. It sparked the deadliest war in Palestinian history. One year later, it has grown into a regional war. Every day keeps surprising us.

A year later, I find myself thinking about where the survivors and witnesses of this war draw strength.

I think about Batya Ofir, a woman my colleague Itay Stern and I met the other day at Kibbutz Be'eri, the Israeli village that suffered the greatest loss -- 102 people there were killed. Her brother was killed along with his family. She felt survivor's guilt, and she told us she asked herself whether she wanted to keep on living.

""I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she said. Today, she is learning how to kayak in the sea to help her face her fears. ""I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

Our colleague Anas Baba in Gaza has been reporting for NPR in Gaza all year. Again and again, he has videotaped bodies brought into the morgue after Israeli airstrikes. He always trains his camera on young children, sheltering near the morgue, standing alone and watching silently as bodies are laid out.

What gives him strength, he said, is collecting biscuits and fruit to give to the children he meets. ""I can help them survive,"" he told me.

He often meets a young girl named Habiba at the hospital in central Gaza. She's been colorblind since birth. One day, she told Anas she saw a man drowning with water coming out of his nose. It wasn't water; it was blood.

""This girl does not know the color of blood,"" Anas told me. ""I wish all the children in Gaza were colorblind now."""
It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich. Sylvia Jarrus for NPR hide caption

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."
"Medical debt snares millions of people. States, red and blue are passing laws to help",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5135641/medical-debt-solutions-hospitals-republicans-democrats-state-laws,2024-10-07T09:02:28Z,"While hot-button health care issues such as abortion and the Affordable Care Act roil the presidential race, Democrats and Republicans in statehouses around the country have been quietly working together to tackle the nation's medical debt crisis.

New laws to curb aggressive hospital billing, to expand charity care for lower-income patients, and to rein in debt collectors have been enacted in more than 20 states since 2021.

Democrats championed most measures. But the legislative efforts often passed with Republican support. In a few states, GOP lawmakers led the push to expand patient protections.

""Regardless of their party, regardless of their background ... any significant medical procedure can place people into bankruptcy,"" Florida House Speaker Paul Renner, a conservative Republican, said in an interview. ""This is a real issue.""

Renner, who has shepherded controversial measures to curb abortion rights and expand the death penalty in Florida, this year also led an effort to limit when hospitals could send patients to collections. It garnered unanimous support in the Florida Legislature.

Bipartisan measures in other states have gone further, barring unpaid medical bills from consumer credit reports and restricting medical providers from placing liens on patients' homes.

About 100 million people in the U.S. are burdened by some form of health care debt, forcing millions to drain savings, take out second mortgages, or cut back on food and other essentials, KFF Health News has found. A quarter of those with debt owed more than $5,000 in 2022.

""Republicans in the legislature seem more open to protecting people from medical debt than from other kinds of debt,"" said Marceline White, executive director of Economic Action Maryland, which helped lead efforts in that state to stop medical providers from garnishing the wages of low-income patients. That bill drew unanimous support from Democrats and Republicans

""There seems to be broad agreement that you shouldn't lose your home or your life savings because you got ill,"" White said. ""That's just a basic level of fairness.""

Medical debt remains a more polarizing issue in Washington, where the Biden administration has pushed several efforts to tackle the issue, including a proposed rule by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, or CFPB, to bar all medical debt from consumer credit reports.

Vice President Harris, who is spearheading the administration's medical debt campaign, has touted the work on the presidential campaign trail while calling for new efforts to retire health care debt for millions of Americans.

Former President Donald Trump doesn't typically talk about medical debt while stumping. But congressional Republicans have blasted the CFPB proposal, which House Financial Services Committee Chairman Patrick McHenry (R-N.C.) called ""regulatory overreach.""

Nevertheless, pollster Michael Perry, who has surveyed Americans extensively about health care, said that conservative voters typically wary of government seem to view medical debt through another lens. ""I think they feel it's so stacked against them that they, as patients, don't really have a voice,"" he said. ""The partisan divides we normally see just aren't there.""

When Arizona consumer advocates put a measure on the ballot in 2022 to cap interest rates on medical debt, 72% of voters backed the initiative.

Similarly, nationwide polls have found more than 80% of Republicans and Democrats back limits on medical debt collections and stronger requirements that hospitals provide financial aid to patients.

Perry surfaced something else that may be driving bipartisan interest in medical debt: growing mistrust as health systems get bigger and act more like major corporations. ""Hospitals aren't what they used to be,"" he said. ""That is making it clear that profit and greed are driving lots of the decision-making.""

Not every state effort to address medical debt has garnered broad bipartisan support.

When Colorado last year became the first state to bar medical debt from residents' credit reports, just one Republican lawmaker backed the measure. A Minnesota bill that did the same thing this year passed without a single GOP vote.

But elsewhere, similarly tough measures have sailed through.

A 2024 Illinois bill to bar credit reporting for medical debt passed unanimously in the state Senate and cleared the House of Representatives 109-2. In Rhode Island, not a single GOP lawmaker opposed a credit reporting ban.

And when the California Legislature took up a 2021 bill to require hospitals in the state to provide more financial assistance to patients, it passed 72-0 in the state Assembly and 39-0 in the Senate.

Even some conservative states, such as Oklahoma, have taken steps, albeit more modest. A new law there bars medical providers from pursuing patients for debts if the provider has not publicly posted its prices. The measure, signed by the state's Republican governor, passed unanimously.

New Mexico state Sen. Steve Neville, a Republican who backed legislation to restrict aggressive collections against low-income patients in that state, said he was simply being pragmatic.

""There was not much advantage to spending a lot of time trying to do collections on indigent patients,"" Neville said. ""If they don't have the money, they don't have the money."" Three of 12 GOP senators supported the measure.

North Carolina state Treasurer Dale Folwell, a Republican who as a state legislator spearheaded a 2012 effort to ban same-sex marriage, said all elected officials, no matter their party, should care about what medical debt is doing to patients.

With less than a month left until Election Day, both the Harris and Trump campaigns have presented their economic visions to the American people -- including proposed tax cuts, border security spending, and affordable housing policies. But it's still unclear how much these plans will cost, and how they will be paid for.

A new report from the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget finds that both former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris will deepen the national debt to pay for their initiatives. Trump's estimated economic plan would sink the nation $7.5 trillion further into to debt over the next decade, while Harris' estimated proposals would cost the government half that -- around $3.5 trillion.

""Whoever wins the 2024 presidential election will face an unprecedented fiscal situation upon taking office,"" according to the Committee for Responsible Federal Budget's report. ""Both the Republican and Democratic candidates for President have put forward campaign plans that would, at best, maintain the status quo and, at worst, add tremendously to our debt and deficits.""

The report said their estimates come with ""a high degree of uncertainty"" because of lack of specifics from both campaigns; the estimates for Harris' plans range from adding $0 to $8.1 trillion to the debt, while the forecasts for Trump range from $1.5 trillion to $15.2 trillion.

The committee warned of ""an eventual fiscal crisis"" if politicians don't address the national debt more forcefully. The nonprofit also provided an overview of the candidates' competing economic visions -- pulled from campaign websites, emails, speeches, social media posts and discussions with campaign staff.

Both Harris and Trump plan to extend portions of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) -- a law passed in 2017 that made major changes to the tax code. The law is set to expire in 2025.

Extending the TCJA is the most expensive portion of both campaigns' economic plans, totaling $3 trillion for Harris and $5.4 trillion for Trump, according to the report.

The difference between the two costs comes from Harris' promise that ""no one earning less than $400,000 a year will pay more in taxes,"" meaning Americans earning less than that will continue to benefit from the TCJA tax cuts while those making more than that will not.

Meanwhile, Trump has promised to ""make the Trump tax cuts permanent"" for all those who benefited from the law initially. Notably, Trump has promised to end the $10,000 cap on deductions for state and local taxes, known as SALT, which has become a contentious political issue.

Both the Harris and Trump campaigns have promised to eliminate taxes on tips -- despite the shaking heads of economists.

Trump proposed the policy first after a visit to Las Vegas. But the Harris campaign told NPR their plan is distinct as their policy would have caps on salary, meant to prevent high-earners from marking all their salary as tipped wages and taking ""advantage of the policy."" The Harris campaign said it also plans to increase the minimum wage in tandem with not taxing tips.

The Committee for Responsible Federal Budget estimated Harris' no-tax-on tips policy would cost $200 billion over 10 years, while Trump's would cost $300 billion.

The former president has also proposed a blanket tax exemption for overtime pay. The committee listed this as the second-most expensive portion of his economic vision, costing the U.S. government some $2 trillion over 10 years in lost taxes.

Trump's call for an end to taxes on Social Security benefits is the third-most costly part of his plan. Between 50% to 85% of Social Security benefits are taxed, the committee said. Cutting those funds would increase the deficit by $1.3 trillion, it found.

Harris has no plans to cut taxes on overtime pay or on Social Security benefits, according to the report.

The second-most expensive portion of Harris' economic plan is her proposed expansion of the Child Tax Credit, which currently gives most parents a $2,000 per-child tax credit.

As president, Harris ""would make the CTC fully refundable; expand eligibility to 17-year-olds; and increase the size of the CTC to $6,000 for newborns, $3,600 for other children under six, and $3,000 for children six and over,"" the report said.

This expansion of the CTC would cost $1.4 trillion over ten years.

While Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, said he supports a child tax credit increase, the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget didn't include it in its analysis.

Both Harris and Trump promise to increase border security.

The Democratic presidential candidate said she would sign the bipartisan border security bill if passed -- which would hire more border patrol agents, asylum officers, immigration judges, and others. The bill failed to pass in a divided Congress earlier this year, and would have cost $100 billion over a decade.

On border security, Trump said he would implement the ""largest deportation program in American history,"" while also finishing the border wall and strengthening the Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency.

The committee estimated Trump's immigration plan would cost $350 billion over 10 years, but it also noted significant uncertainty, given few details on Trump's mass deportation plans.

Both Harris and Trump plan to address the high cost of housing, but their methods differ.

Harris plans to give first-time home buyers a tax credit and would seek to boost housing construction through tax incentives for new homes, while also expanding the low-income housing tax credit.

These plans have a $250 billion price tag, according to the committee.

Meanwhile, Trump plans to lean solely on tax incentives to help homeowners. The campaign hasn't released any details of exactly how.

""While the Trump campaign has not provided specifics on these tax credits, one option would be to revive the $8,000 first-time homebuyer tax credit that was in effect in 2009 and 2010,"" the committee's report said.

With this assumption, the committee forecasted Trump's housing plan would cost $150 billion over the next decade.

Harris' planned expansion of Affordable Care Act subsidies is estimated to cost $550 billion over 10 years. The ACA allows Americans without employer-provided or government-sponsored health insurance to get covered with income-based tax credit subsidies, lowering the overall cost of getting coverage.

Harris plans to make recent increases in these subsidies permanent, according to the deficit analysis.

Meanwhile, Trump promised his administration will have the government or insurers pay for in vitro fertilization treatments and ""we will also allow new parents to deduct major newborn expenses from their taxes,"" Trump said this summer.

The group said it did not receive specifics from the Trump campaign; based on public statements, it estimated this plan would cost $150 billion over a decade.

Both Harris and Trump intend to offset the massive costs of their plans by making the government money elsewhere.

Harris intended to generate revenue through taxes on corporations and high-earners: those making more that $400,000 per year. These actions would bring in $4.3 trillion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. The Harris White House would bring in another $250 billion in reduced spending on prescription drugs, it estimated.

Trump, on the other hand, intends to raise revenue with heavy tariffs on foreign imports and with a reduction of policies to protect the environment, which is expected to allow oil companies to drill on protected lands and generate tax revenue. The committee said these plans would generate $3.7 trillion over 10 years.

Neither Harris or Trump's revenue plans would fully cover their projected costs, the group found."
Can someone find out who you voted for? No. Here is what you should know,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5129679/can-someone-find-out-whom-you-voted-for-explained,2024-10-05T12:03:36Z,"With less than 35 days until Election Day and with early voting taking place across the U.S., many Americans are questioning the secrecy of their ballots.

Election officials, voter registration organizations and election law experts -- including New Mexico Secretary of State Maggie Toulouse Oliver -- have been fielding these questions from Americans.

Toulouse Oliver addressed concerns over ballot privacy for voters in a social media post, citing a study released in April that found 70% of New Mexico voters believe a person can find out someone's vote choices without their consent.

No one can find out whom someone voted for without their consent.

Tappan Vickery, senior director of programming and strategy for HeadCount, a voter registration organization, said they also receive questions on ballot privacy.

Vickery said news coverage surrounding election observers in recent years and Americans becoming more conscious about what information is available online are a few factors driving concerns over ballot privacy. Another one is today's political climate.

""Hyperpartisanship and the anger that is driving a lot of the partisanship in our country right now makes people feel afraid sometimes for having their own opinions and in spaces where they don't feel like they're welcome,"" Vickery said.

The concern over ballot privacy has also extended to personal relationships. Olivia Dreizen Howell, co-founder of Fresh Starts Registry, an organization that helps people start over after a major life change, said she has received questions from women on whether their partner could find out whom they voted for.

""For many women, especially in this election, with so many critical topics on the table, they may choose to vote across their registered party lines for Kamala Harris -- and this may be the first time they have made this decision -- and it may be going against what their husband is doing voting-wise,"" Dreizen Howell said.

Here is what you should know about privacy and casting a ballot.

Whom you vote for is not public; the only way someone will know exactly whom you vote for is by telling them.

Voting secretly is a cornerstone of democracy, and the secret ballot dates back to the late 1800s, election law experts told NPR.

""In every state, voters have the right to a secret ballot either in the state constitution or a state statute. So when you go to vote, your name is not associated with your ballot. The ballot is anonymous. When it is tabulated, it won't be connected back to you,"" Michael Morse, an assistant law professor at the University of Pennsylvania Carey Law School, told NPR.

While whom you cast your ballot for is a secret, some of your voter information may be available to the public, depending on where you live.

Your name, address and party affiliation all may be included on voter registration lists known as voter rolls. Morse said these lists are public records and may show the last election you participated in. Campaigns also can gather data from these lists over time and use it when canvassing. And while certain information regarding your voter information is public record, Morse said other information you submit, such as your Social Security number and driver's license number, are not public.

If you donate to a candidate or political campaign, how much you give and where you work may also be public, depending on how much money you donate. The Federal Election Commission has a public database of individual contributions to campaigns and candidates.

This information may give people clues about how you voted, but it still does not show whom you voted for.

Your ballot is also secret if you vote by mail. If you vote by mail, you can cast your vote in a private setting, and when your ballot is received by an election official, it is still private.

""Even in states where they're going through a mail-in ballot, those envelopes are secure until they're tabulated,"" Vickery said. ""So, it's not like the folks who are receiving the ballot see your name and see who you voted for. There are secrecy sleeves.""

Election administration includes a mix of both voter privacy and public transparency, Morse said.

""You should not be concerned that your vote choice will be disclosed, but there must be some amount of public transparency too, for confidence in the process,"" he said. For example, he said that ""whether you are registered to vote, whether you participated in the past or if you gave certain campaign contributions will typically be public, not private.""

There are options, depending on where you live, that will allow you to limit how much of your voter information is public. Many states have an ""address confidentiality program"" for victims of domestic violence, human trafficking or sexual assault and those in fear for their safety, according to the U.S. Election Assistance Commission.

In states such as Alaska and Nevada, voters can request in writing that their residential address or phone number not be open to the public. Law enforcement officers, judges and others in certain professions may also have certain information removed from public databases.

There are also federal and state laws that protect voters and their privacy when they cast a ballot and that prevent election officials from disclosing your information.

""No election observer should be looking over your shoulder to see who you're voting for. If that is happening, you should report it because that is not legal,"" Vickery said.

While whom you vote for is anonymous, consider the privacy policies at the place where you register to vote regarding the public disclosure of some of your voter information.

""Just make sure that the privacy policy holds up with your comfort level of how the data is being used and how we're in touch with people,"" Vickery said."

Anna Moneymaker/Getty Images hide caption

Former President Donald Trump returns to Butler, Penn., on Saturday for a rally on the site where he was nearly killed in a deadly July 13 shooting.

Speaking to NewsNation's Ali Bradley this week, Trump said he felt he had to return to the Pennsylvania town.

""I'm going back to Butler because I feel I have an obligation to go back to Butler. We never finished what we were supposed to do. And I said that day when I was shot, I said, 'We're coming back. We're gonna come back.'""

The event will be on the grounds of the Butler Farm Show -- the same location where the July assassination attempt took place. All signs point to a Trump rally that will be bigger and longer than even a standard Trump event. What's unclear is how inflammatory of a tone Trump will take in front of a friendly crowd on a site where he narrowly escaped death, or whether he plans a more somber message.

When asked what Trump plans for his speech, campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt gave few details.

""President Trump looks forward to returning to Butler, Pennsylvania to honor the victims from that tragic day,"" she said in a statement. ""The willingness of Pennsylvanians to join President Trump in his return to Butler represents the strength and resiliency of the American people.

On Friday, the Trump campaign team sent out a list of more than 60 special guests for the event. It includes the family of Corey Comperatore, who died in the July 13 shooting, as well as David Dutch, who was injured in the shooting. (The other person injured that day, James Copenhaver, was not listed among the guests.)

The list also includes both typical Trump rally guests -- an array of politicians, local sheriffs and Trump family members -- as well as unusual additions. SpaceX CEO Elon Musk will be in attendance, as well as the Frog-X Parachute Team, which bills itself as a ""veteran-owned, extreme aerial demonstration team.""

All of this sets up the rally to be an all-day affair. Usually, doors have opened for recent Trump rallies three or four hours ahead of time. On Saturday, they will open at 10 a.m. ET -- a full seven hours before Trump is set to speak, at 5 p.m. Three hours have been allotted before Trump's speech for the pre-program.

The looming question is what all those people -- and especially former President Trump -- will have to say about the shooting, not to mention last month's apparent assassination attempt in Florida.

In announcing the rally, the Trump campaign struck a positive tone: ""President Trump will return to the site, joined by tens of thousands of proud citizens, and together, they will celebrate a unifying vision for America's future in an event like the world has never seen before.""

But Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, have not matched that tone when speaking about the shooting since then.

When asked by NewsNation's Bradley about his return to Butler, Trump's immediate response was to cast blame on the White House for recent security difficulties.

""I think that the White House isn't treating us very good,"" he said. ""I get crowds that are 10 times bigger than anybody else, 20 times bigger than anybody else. And we're entitled to security. The White House makes it very difficult.""

A Wisconsin Trump rally was recently moved indoors due to a shortage of Secret Service officers, a fact that Trump has complained about in multiple recent appearances.

In the aftermath of the assassination attempt in Butler, the Secret Service has come under intense scrutiny for the security failures that allowed a gunman to fire multiple shots toward Trump in Butler, and then a second alleged gunman who was able to make it within several hundred yards of Trump at his West Palm Beach, Fla., golf course on Sept. 15.

The Secret Service has since increased security for Trump to a presidential level, and late last month Congress voted to boost funding for the agency by $231 million.

Meanwhile, Vance has blamed Trump's political opponents for recent threats to the former president.

Vance at one point blamed an unnamed ""they"" for the Butler assassination attempt.

""They couldn't beat him politically, so they tried to bankrupt him,"" he said at an August rally in Atlanta. ""They failed at that, so they tried to impeach him. They failed at that, so they tried to put him in prison. They even tried to kill him.""

In an August appearance on the Full Send Podcast, Vance also expressed anger -- and suggested a partisan conspiracy -- because of his perception that the assassination attempt hadn't received sustained-enough attention.

""The people, the senior leadership, the people who run the search algorithms, it is effectively a left wing propaganda machine,"" he said of Google, which he alleged was making it harder to search for content about the Butler assassination attempt.

The Butler shooting took place just two days before the Republican National Convention opened in Milwaukee, and it lent the gathering an ecstatic tone, as attendees celebrated Trump's survival. For a brief period, it seemed that the event could reshape the race.

But the shooting proved not to have lasting effects -- especially because just over a week later, President Biden dropped out of the presidential race, eventually handing the torch to Vice President Harris. The race has been essentially deadlocked ever since."

Mandel Ngan/AFP hide caption

President Biden sent a formal letter to Congress late Friday night saying that a key loans program for helping disaster victims will run out of money within weeks at a time when Americans hit by Hurricane Helene need the relief.

The Small Business Administration disaster loans program helps renters and homeowners repair properties and helps businesses cover basic operation expenses. But the agency needs about $1.6 billion to keep running for the year, an administration official said, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss nonpublic information.

Congress is on recess until Nov. 12. But Biden said the program would run out of funds before then.

""I warned the Congress of this potential shortfall even before Hurricane Helene landed on America's shores,"" Biden said in his letter, saying the White House had asked for more funding for the SBA ""multiple times over the past several months"" including during the recent negotiations over a stop-gap funding bill.

""The Congress must act to restore this funding,"" said Biden, who traveled to four states this week to survey damage.

Hurricane Helene ravaged a huge swath of North Carolina and big parts of Georgia, two critical states for the upcoming federal election.

The federal response to the disaster has become an issue in the campaign. The administration is going to great lengths to demonstrate it was both prepared for the storm and has pulled out the stops to help people hurt by it.

Biden said the response has been ""robust and well-coordinated"" and said the Federal Emergency Management Agency has enough resources for now, though it will need more money by the end of the year, when Congress gets back. How much more is still to be determined, he said.

Vice President Harris went to Georgia earlier this week to reassure victims and talk to community leaders, and tomorrow she heads to North Carolina to see the damage there.

Former President Donald Trump has also been to Georgia and North Carolina this week. On Friday night in Fayetteville, N.C., he said: ""This is Katrina,"" alluding to the deadly 2005 hurricane response botched by the government. ""They are doing the worst job on a hurricane that any administration has ever done.""

Trump has repeatedly made false claims about the disaster response, including that FEMA is running out of money because it has spent it on migrants, and that Biden had not been in touch with the Republican governor of Georgia."
"In Michigan, Harris hits back against Trump over his electric car attack lines",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5140654/kamala-harris-trump-electric-vehicles-flint,2024-10-05T00:42:24Z,"FLINT, Mich. - Vice President Harris pushed back against a barrage of attacks from her Republican opponent falsely alleging that she intends to ban gas-powered cars.

""Let us be clear, contrary to what my opponent is suggesting, I will never tell you what kind of car you have to drive,"" Harris said at a rally on Friday, countering that former President Donald Trump would hurt the auto industry and the union workers that power it in this critical swing state.

Trump and Republicans have long railed against policies and incentives championed by President Biden aimed at boosting electric vehicles, measures he has said would be good for the environment and for advanced manufacturing jobs.

Trump regularly slams Harris at his rallies over the issue. Lately, his campaign has spent more than $1 million airing a television ad in Michigan that tells autoworkers that ""Kamala Harris wants to end all gas-powered cars"" and that ""massive layoffs already started.""

Harris - who was introduced by the president of the United Auto Workers, a union that has endorsed her - said six auto plants closed when Trump was in office and accused him of making ""empty promises"" about supporting the sector.

""We will not be gaslighted,"" she said.

""We will ensure that the next generation of breakthroughs, from advanced batteries to electric vehicles are not only invented, but built right here in America by American union workers,"" Harris said.

She pointed to a Detroit News report that Trump's running mate JD Vance was noncommittal about a grant to a GM plant in Lansing, Michigan. The Biden administration gave the company $500 million to convert the plant to make electric vehicles. ""He might let the Grand River assembly plant in Lansing close down,"" she said."

President Biden told reporters Friday he is confident the election will be free and fair, but he said he was concerned about the potential for violence if former President Donald Trump again refuses to accept the will of the voters.

""I'm confident it will be free and fair. I don't know whether it'll be peaceful,"" Biden said during a surprise appearance at the White House daily briefing. ""The things that Trump has said and the things that he said last time out, when he didn't like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous.""

Biden noted that during this week's vice presidential debate, Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, would not say whether Trump would accept the outcome of the election. When asked if he and Trump would challenge the election results -- even if every governor in the nation certified them -- Vance demurred, saying he and Trump were ""focused on the future.""

""I don't know anything about what [Biden] said,"" Trump told reporters in Georgia on Friday following the president's remarks. ""I only can hope that it's going to be free and fair, and I think in this state it will be, and I hope in every state it will be, and I think we're going to do very well.""

Trump often links himself winning with fairness.

Speaking to reporters earlier this week, Trump said, ""All I want is a fair election. That's all. Just a fair, honest election. I hope we're going to get that.""

But when pressed on whether he trusts the process this year, he responded, ""I'll let you know in 33 days."" Two days later, in Michigan, Trump again lied about the results of the 2020 election.

""We won. We won. We did win,"" Trump said. ""It was a rigged election. It was a rigged election. You have to tell Kamala Harris. That's why I'm doing it again. If I'd thought I lost, I wouldn't be doing this again.""

Trump's remarks came during a week in which a newly unsealed court filing by special counsel Jack Smith offered perhaps the most detailed picture to date about the former president's alleged efforts to overturn the 2020 election.

The 165-page document, released Wednesday by the U.S. District judge presiding over the case, says that after Trump lost in 2020, he ""resorted to crimes to try to stay in office,"" and ""launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn election results in seven states he had lost."""

Vice President Harris plans to meet briefly on Friday with a group of Arab Americans in Flint, Mich., before she rallies supporters there.

The meeting comes as her campaign works to build support with Arab Americans who have been frustrated with the Biden administration's response to the ongoing war in Gaza and the expanding conflict into Lebanon.

The key swing state of Michigan has one of the largest Arab American populations in the country.

A poll published this week by the Arab American Institute found Harris and her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, at roughly even levels of support among Arab Americans. In recent years, the group had favored Democrats by large margins.

""In our 30 years of polling Arab American voters, we have not witnessed anything like the role that the war on Gaza is having on voter behavior,"" said James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, in a statement.

Yesterday, the Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz spoke to a Muslim group focused on getting out the vote activities. And earlier this week, Harris' national security adviser Phil Gordon met virtually with Muslim and Arab community leaders to reiterate that the Biden administration is working to bring about a cease-fire."

""You have to work, work, work,"" she said with a smile. ""It's not easy.""

Conteh is an immigrant from Sierra Leone who lives just outside Philadelphia. She has been a U.S. citizen for two years, but this fall marks the first time she can vote in an election, and she plans to cast her ballot for Vice President Harris.

""She will... treat immigrants the same. Talk about wages, talking about mortgage,"" Conteh said, explaining she is worried about rising prices. ""We are on the same page,"" she added.

Conteh is one of more than half a million naturalized citizens living in Pennsylvania. And she is part of a growing portion of the U.S. electorate, making up about one in ten eligible voters nationwide as of 2022.

It's a voting bloc that could be crucial in the presidential race, especially in key battleground states like Pennsylvania, where President Biden won last time by a margin of about 1%, or 80,000 votes.

Those stakes were ever-present to a small group of immigrant advocates and new citizens, including Conteh, who recently gathered at a community center in the Philadelphia commuter town of Lansdale, Pa.

""We know that Pennsylvania will be one of the most critical states during this election, and new American voters have the power to sway the outcome,"" Laila Martín García said to the group. Martín García is an organizer with the nonpartisan group National Partnership of New Americans or NPNA.

""We have the numbers,"" she added. ""Are we ready to translate those numbers into impact?""

It's unclear how many new citizens are already registered to vote, however, roughly eight in 10 naturalized Pennsylvanians say they're definitely planning on casting a ballot, according to NPNA's latest state-wide polling from Aug.

Similar levels of enthusiasm were reflected in NPNA's surveys from other crucial swing states, including Arizona, Georgia, Michigan and Nevada.

But deadlines are creeping up. Pennsylvania has until Oct. 21 to register to vote. So after the event ended, Huascar Aragonés didn't wait a second longer.

Aragones first came to the U.S. 16 years ago from the Dominican Republic. He works for his union, the Service Employees International Union, SEIU, and as he filled out his registration form, a few of his colleagues excitedly watched close by.

When it was complete, the room erupted in applause.

""When I became a citizen, I did it out of the fear I have about politics,"" Aragonés said in Spanish. ""Especially the politics of former President Donald Trump -- I was afraid that he would separate me from my family because I am an immigrant worker.""

The topic of immigration has remained a big issue throughout the campaign. Trump has made it central to his reelection bid, vowing to deport millions of undocumented immigrants.

For Aragonés, Harris is the best candidate right now.

""What I feel is something really beautiful,"" he said. ""When you are a citizen of the United States, you feel like you are a part of this country. And that you can vote for the candidate that you would like, for the changes you want to see.""

But other new voters aren't as excited about the matchup.

NPNA's Laila Martín García, an immigrant from Spain also recently naturalized, is gearing up for her first presidential election as a citizen.

""The joy that voting brings to me, I wish I had the same joy because a candidate is giving me reasons to vote for them,"" she said. ""I feel like I'm going to head to the polls on Nov. 5 to vote against somebody more than voting for somebody.""

Speaking outside her role with NPNA, she's backing Harris. However, there's a caveat: Martín García disagrees with how Harris has approached immigration issues, particularly the vice president's support for the bipartisan bill in Congress that -- if passed -- would have expanded restrictions and given money for a border wall. The legislation failed but Harris has vowed to sign it if it were to pass while she was in office.

That being the case, to Martín García, it's a vote for Harris, but a reluctant one. A feeling she shares with many other new voters around the country.

""To be honest, [as] a first-time voter, that breaks my heart,"" she said. ""It's just not how you want to vote for the first time or really ever."""

With only a month left until Election Day, Vice President Harris is navigating a pair of external challenges in the month of October that pose risk to her campaign.

At home, there's the recovery efforts in the wake of Hurricane Helene -- including in the vital swing states of North Carolina and Georgia. And abroad, there's the real risk of escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The twin crises present a unique challenge for the Biden administration and, by extension, Harris -- who is a key part of that team. So her campaign and the White House are pulling out the stops to try to show voters they're on top of things, even as Harris pushes ahead on the campaign trail.

For Harris, there's the fear that these ""October surprises"" go sideways and she gets some blame. In a race this close, every vote matters.

But these kinds of high-profile crises also present an opportunity to demonstrate leadership, said Democratic political strategist Ian Russell.

""What she has to do, and what she is doing, is showing up and showing that she's engaged, showing that she's capable of stepping up to the challenges that the country and the world face and I think she's doing that very well,"" Russell said.

Harris took a break from the campaign on Wednesday to visit a Georgia neighborhood ravaged by Hurricane Helene where more than half of residents don't have power and many don't have running water.

""The president and I have been paying close attention from the beginning to what we need to do to make sure the federal resources hit the ground as quickly as possible,"" Harris said. ""That includes what was necessary to make sure that we provided direct federal assistance. And that work has been happening.""

President Biden also surveyed Asheville, N.C., where some of the most severe storm damage occurred, as he and Harris try to reassure voters in the critical state that their administration is up to the task. Harris' campaign has said she plans to tour storm damage in North Carolina soon, too.

Her opponent, former President Donald Trump, is slated to be it the state on Friday for a town hall.

The International Longshoremen's Association decision to go on strike on Tuesday had been another challenge for Harris, threatening to upend the economy heading into the election.

But on Thursday, the union dockworkers and port operators reached a tentative agreement on wages and agreed to extend their contract to Jan. 15. Harris and Biden had sided firmly with the union, and on Thursday Biden said both sides had acted ""patriotically"" to reopen the ports to ensure supplies were available for hurricane rebuilding efforts.

The Trump campaign is on the lookout for anything they can use against Harris in the closely contested race -- including the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

On Tuesday, Trump told his supporters that he was the person to take on Iran after it attacked Israel. ""We have a nonexistent president and a nonexistent vice president, who should be in charge, but nobody knows what's going on,"" Trump said.

Harris made sure to get out in front of cameras this week to reaffirm her support for Israel. ""As I have said, I will always ensure Israel has the ability to defend itself against Iran and Iran-backed terrorist militias,"" she said.

""And let us be clear: Iran is not only a threat to Israel; Iran is also a threat to American personnel in the region, American interests, and innocent civilians across the region who suffer at the hands of Iran-based and -backed terrorist proxies.""

How the White House, Harris and her campaign are able to navigate these ""October surprises"" is critical in a race this close, with only a month left.

""There's always going to be something that could go wrong at home or abroad,"" Russell said. ""And our leaders need to be able to step up and deliver while also being politicians."""
We visited a Sikh temple that sits at the intersection of multiple election issues,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5136995/wisconsin-election-harris-trump-sikh-temple-oak-creek,2024-10-04T09:08:47Z,"The Sikh Temple of Wisconsin was the scene of a deadly mass shooting in 2012. Angela Major/Wisconsin Public Radio/NPR hide caption

It's Sunday morning at the Sikh Temple of Wisconsin, in the Milwaukee suburb of Oak Creek, and hundreds of worshippers are showing up for prayers.

They walk into the main hall where people are praying, passing by a bullet hole in the door frame. It's a reminder of what happened here on another Sunday morning 12 years ago, when a gunman who was affiliated with white supremacist groups came and opened fire on the people who were praying.

""We were on our way to go to the gurdwara when one of our family members called and said, 'Don't go there, there had been a shooting,'"" recalls Kulwant Dhaliwal, the chairman of the board here at the gurdwara, or Sikh temple.

Dhaliwal immigrated to the United States from India in 1968 and worked as a doctor in Wisconsin for decades until he retired.

""I couldn't believe it. Hard to believe somebody will come and shoot people at the place of worship,"" he said. ""We don't bother anybody. We haven't done anything wrong.""

Six people were killed that day and four others were wounded, one of whom died of his injuries years later.

All Things Considered recently spent a week reporting from Wisconsin as part of an NPR series focusing on swing states ahead of the election. And this gurdwara sits at the intersection of several election-season topics.

Immigration is one. Most of the people at this temple are immigrants.

Identity is another. Sikhism originated in India, and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is half Indian.

This community also experienced the deadly white supremacist attack, years before mass shootings at a Black church in Charleston, a synagogue in Pittsburgh and many other places. Gun violence and extremism have also come up for both Harris and former President Donald Trump this year.

On the morning the shooter arrived at the gurdwara in 2012, women were in the kitchen stirring big pots of curry and lentils.

Sundays are when the temple opens its doors to feed anyone who's hungry, to give back to the community at a free meal called langar. It's the same scene now, more than a decade later.

Prabhjot Singh is our escort and host and says that anywhere from 700 to 800 people come on a Sunday for the meal, which is prepared from scratch each week at the gurdwara.

By day, Singh is a banker raising two young kids with his wife. He's also secretary here at the gurdwara.

This temple is a sacred place, where they discourage public talk of politics. So while worshippers sit on the floor praying in the main hall, Singh leads us into the basement, where kids in Sunday school are learning Punjabi.

Singh came to the U.S. to get his MBA when he was 23. One big reason he stayed in Wisconsin was this temple. So when a shooter arrived, it felt unbelievable to him.

""We knew shootings were normal in the U.S. but ... but we never thought someone could target a religious place,"" he said. ""That was one thing which took a long time to forget about and feel safe again to come back.""

The U.S. is now in the final weeks of an intense election season, and it's not lost on Singh that immigration has become a focus of much of the conversation. Yet while he estimates that about 80% of the members of his congregation are immigrants, he doesn't believe it's the most important issue to many of them.

""They're already here, you know. They are part of this country now,"" he said. ""Now they are trying to achieve the American dream, which is getting the best education for their children, getting food on the table every day, making sure everyone is healthy and safe.""

Singh adds that while some people in his community showed excitement at having a candidate of South Asian descent at the top of the Democratic ticket, for many others, Harris' ethnicity doesn't matter more than any other candidate's ethnicity. And he can recall speaking to business owners at the temple after Trump won in 2016 and discovering they voted for him.

Still, for Singh, the rhetoric matters. And he said it's the reason he won't be voting for Trump.

""The words he uses are very aggressive, harassing words for others,"" Singh said. ""Whether it's for immigrants -- I think lately he gave a speech about eating cats and dogs by migrants ... maybe if that happened one incident, it doesn't mean all of the 25 million immigrants are eating cats and dogs.""

The rumor has been debunked, but Singh believes the narrative was still damaging for immigrants everywhere.

And this is a community that knows how easily fear of immigrants can turn into violence against immigrants. But they refuse to barricade themselves and hide.

The day before we met Singh, he joined other Sikhs at a city-wide cultural event with the mayor of Oak Creek. They taught people how to tie the turbans that so many Sikh people wear as a sign of their faith.

Singh said one of the most important principles of his religion is sharing what you have with others.

So on this Sunday, just past the security cameras and the hired guard at the door, anyone is invited to sit and eat for free as volunteers circle with seemingly endless ladles of curry, rice, lentils and more."
"Driven by Republicans, most Americans are concerned about fraud in the 2024 election",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5130284/election-concerns-voter-fraud-trump-harris-poll,2024-10-03T20:01:24Z,"Former President Donald Trump stands on stage after speaking at a campaign event in Indiana, Pa., on Sept. 23. Behind Trump, Republicans are urged to vote in numbers that are ""too big to rig."" Alex Brandon/AP hide caption

A majority of Americans worry this year's general election will be tainted by fraud, according to a new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll out Thursday -- an ominous finding for the thousands of local election officials across the country tasked with administering voting.

Almost 6-in-10 Americans say they're concerned or very concerned that there will be voter fraud this election, a number that experts say is driven in large part by Donald Trump's continued false insistence that elections can't be trusted. Eighty-eight percent of voters who say they support the former president say they are concerned there will be fraud, compared with 29% of those who support the Democratic nominee, Kamala Harris.

In the four years since the 2020 election, there has never been any evidence of widespread voter fraud in that contest, and numerous audits, studies and investigations (including those led by Republicans) have confirmed the results many times over.

Still, as voting has begun in many parts of the country, election officials are struggling to persuade voters listening to political figures who insist the results will be tainted.

Local election officials say they've spent countless hours trying to educate voters on the checks and balances that make fraud unlikely and rare, but it's unclear those efforts have made much of a dent. And they worry the stage is set for Trump again to try to overturn the results, or for his followers to commit violence, if they feel the election was stolen from him.

""This conversation is so much deeper than even the mechanics of election administration,"" said Stephen Richer, the Republican county recorder in Maricopa County, Ariz. ""It's more about, how do you convince someone of the truth?""

Richer, who lost a reelection bid earlier this year to a GOP challenger, has continuously pushed back against baseless fraud claims since he took office after Trump's loss in 2020. And he's talked openly about the threats he's received, including from a number of men who have been charged for threatening to kill him.

In an interview with NPR last month, Richer said the specific voting conspiracy theory that has ""spiked"" in recent months is about non-U.S. citizens illegally voting and influencing results.

The new NPR/PBS News/Marist poll confirmed that trend, with 52% of respondents saying they were concerned noncitizens would vote for president in this year's election, even though that is illegal, and there has never been evidence to support the idea that noncitizens register and vote in anything but microscopic numbers.

NPR reported in the spring that far-right figures -- including Trump, X owner Elon Musk and conservative attorney Cleta Mitchell -- were beginning to center their voting messaging around noncitizens ahead of the presidential election. The new survey found that 85% of Trump supporters said they were concerned about noncitizen voting.

Ninety percent of Trump supporters also think all immigrants who came into the country illegally should be deported.

The mass deportation idea, a draconian step favored by Trump, is now mainstream, with 59% of voters agreeing with the idea.

Marist interviewed 1,628 adults for the survey, which was conducted Friday through Tuesday. The overall poll sample has a margin of error of +/- 3.3 percentage points, with larger margins of error for subgroups.

It's long been a truism in elections that voters have much less trust in elections in other places, but have more faith in the voting system where they live. The new poll results bear that out as well.

Close to 80% of voters surveyed said they were confident that their state or local government would run a fair and accurate election this November.

Tina Barton, a Republican former election official from Rochester Hills, Mich., told NPR that the most effective way to build confidence in elections is to keep reminding people that voting is a local activity and election officials are human beings in their community as well.

""These are people who live and work in your neighborhood, go to the same church you do, your kids play soccer together,"" Barton said. ""This is still a neighborhood transaction.""

The poll also provided more insight into how people plan to cast ballots this year, with the long-term trend of more and more early voting seeming poised to continue.

Roughly half of registered voters said they planned to vote early, either in-person at a polling place or by mail, and half said they planned to vote in-person on Election Day.

Some partisan differences in those methods still exist, after Trump's efforts in 2020 to demonize absentee voting during the pandemic. About 71% of likely voters who say they plan to vote by mail support Harris, while 58% of planned Election Day voters say they back Trump.

The presidential race continues to be a toss-up.

Among likely voters -- which Marist describes as voters who say they are definitely voting this year -- Harris holds a slim lead over Trump, 50% to 48%. That lines up with the previous NPR/PBS News/Marist survey, in September, and national polling averages.

Trump holds a narrow, 4-point edge with independents, and the survey points to a vast gender gap: Trump leads Harris by 16 percentage points with men, while Harris outpaces Trump with women by 18 points."
Kamala Harris is making an unusual pilgrimage today -- to the birthplace of the GOP,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5137349/kamala-harris-liz-cheney-wisconsin-little-white-schoolhouse,2024-10-03T09:04:59Z,"The town known as the birthplace of the Republican Party is an unlikely campaign stop for a Democratic presidential candidate.

But on Thursday, Vice President Harris will be holding an event in Ripon, Wisc. -- home to the Little White Schoolhouse, where an 1854 meeting led to the formation of the Republican Party.

Harris will be joined in Ripon by former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, who endorsed her last month. Harris' campaign says they will speak about the history of the GOP and appeal to Republicans and independent voters disillusioned with her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump.

""I will always put country above party, and I will be a president for all Americans,"" Harris said at a rally in Charlotte, N.C., last month, noting that more than 200 prominent Republicans had backed her campaign.

Cheney and her father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, are staunch conservatives who have said they will vote for Harris because they believe former President Donald Trump poses a danger to American democracy.

Liz Cheney became a vocal opponent of Trump after the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. She voted to impeach him and later served on a House committee that investigated the attack. She lost her primary race in 2022 to a candidate backed by Trump.

Dick Cheney said in a statement last month that Trump ""can never be trusted with power again"" because he ""tried to steal the last election using lies and violence to keep himself in power after the voters had rejected him."""
PolitiFact founder says both parties need factchecking. But they don't lie equally,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5133743/politifact-founder-says-both-parties-need-factchecking-but-they-dont-lie-equally,2024-10-03T01:38:35Z,"CBS said that its moderators would largely leave fact checking up to the vice presidential candidates in Tuesday's debate. Journalist Bill Adair said the network sent a powerful message, though.

Last night's vice presidential debate stirred controversy before it even started as CBS announced the network's moderators would largely leave fact-checking up to the candidates themselves. That led NPR's David Folkenflik to seek out the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Bill Adair, founder of PolitiFact and author of a forthcoming book that argues fact-checking is not always up to the moment.

DAVID FOLKENFLIK, BYLINE: Bill Adair paid close attention to last night's vice presidential debate, especially the moderators.

BILL ADAIR: The boldest moment, of course, was when they silenced the mics when JD Vance was going on.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

MARGARET BRENNAN: And just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.

FOLKENFLIK: That was CBS' Margaret Brennan. Republican candidate JD Vance wasn't having it.

JD VANCE: Margaret, the rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check. And since you're fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.

FOLKENFLIK: And then the moderators silenced the candidates.

(SOUNDBITE OF ARCHIVED RECORDING)

BRENNAN: Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut. We have so much we want to get to. Thank you for explaining the legal process.

ADAIR: It was a moment when the network stepped in and said, enough. And I think that was a really important moment that said to the viewers, we're not going to just let these guys keep talking and spewing things that are of questionable accuracy. We're putting you first, viewers. And a lot of us sitting at home watching these things have felt like the networks have been too passive in letting the candidates go on and on and on.

FOLKENFLIK: As a veteran political reporter in 2007, Adair founded PolitiFact to offer reported assessments - ratings, really - of the truthfulness of claims from public officials and politicians, pants on fire being the worst of it. Others, including The Washington Post, joined the fray. Adair says that when he started, he simply wanted people to have these assessments as a resource to draw upon.

ADAIR: I've evolved a little bit. We see every day that these false beliefs become serious problems, whether it's a huge number of people that believe false claims about Haitian immigrants eating dogs and cats in Springfield, Ohio, - something that is false - or more recently in Western North Carolina where there were false claims about dams breaching, and people freaked out. And so it's really important that fact-checking journalism get to people quickly and correct this misinformation.

FOLKENFLIK: While both major political parties peddle falsehoods, Adair argues that Republicans lie more and they lie worse than Democrats, and then they lie some more to discredit the people trying to hold them to account.

ADAIR: Any fact-checker would, in a moment of candor, tell you that that's very true, this asymmetry, that Republicans lie more. And to be clear, this was true before Donald Trump came on the scene. And it's even more true now.

FOLKENFLIK: As a result, Adair says, reporters and fact-checkers have often pulled their punches because they fear partisan blowback. After ABC put on the sole debate between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump called for ABC to lose its local TV licenses because its moderators pushed back when he made false claims. Adair argues that journalists cannot shy away from making such calls.

ADAIR: Journalism just can't sit back and wait for people to come to it. I think we need to become a little more active in stepping forward and saying, that's wrong.

FOLKENFLIK: Even so, Adair says fact-checking is part of the public discourse in a way that just wasn't 10 or 15 years ago. And he says he takes hope from a surprising source.

ADAIR: Every now and then, Donald Trump will cite fact-checkers (laughter) in attacking his opponents, and I take that as an odd but small victory.

FOLKENFLIK: Adair's book is called ""Beyond The Big Lie."" It's scheduled for publication on October 15.

Harris and Biden surveyed damage wrought by Hurricane Helene in 2 swing states,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5136749/kamala-harris-joe-biden-hurricane-helene-north-carolina-georgia,2024-10-02T23:26:55Z,"AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Vice President Harris took a pause from the campaign trail on Wednesday to visit a neighborhood ravaged by Hurricane Helene where more than half of residents don't have power and many don't have running water, consoling a woman who she said had lost her husband.

""There is real pain and trauma that has resulted because of this hurricane,"" Harris said.

Meanwhile, President Biden spent about an hour flying over Asheville, N.C., by helicopter. ""You can see homes that are moved, clearly, from one side of the river, down the river to another side,"" he said. ""Communities like Chimney Rock are reduced to piles of wood and debris.""

Biden and Harris are trying to reassure residents hurt by the massive storm that the federal government will help the region recover. Making good on that promise is a critical test for the administration in this election year, particularly in the swing states of North Carolina and Georgia, where Biden and Harris visited.

But Biden said it wasn't about politics. ""At a moment like this, we put politics aside -- at least, we should put it all aside, and we have, here,"" Biden said at a briefing at an emergency operations center in Raleigh, N.C.

""There are no Democrats, Republicans -- only Americans -- and our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can,"" he said.

Biden announced that the federal government would cover 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for six months for North Carolina, as requested by its Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.

He also directed up to 1,000 active-duty soldiers to be deployed to help the North Carolina National Guard deliver food, water and medicine.

In Georgia, Harris said the federal government would cover 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for three months for the state, as requested by its Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Kemp was not with her for the tour.

The White House also announced that Biden had authorized 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for three months for Florida -- a state he plans to visit on Thursday.

Biden will also make a stop on Thursday in Valdosta, Ga. That's where former President Donald Trump was on Monday, where he, too, said that disasters transcend politics.

""As you know, our country is in the final weeks of a hard-fought national election. But in a time like this, when a crisis hits, when our fellow citizens cry out in need, none of that matters. We're not talking about politics now. We have to all get together and get this solved,"" Trump said.

But during his stop, Trump falsely said Gov. Kemp had not been able to reach Biden. ""He's been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him. But they'll come through, I'm sure,"" Trump said. Biden later that day angrily criticized Trump.

""He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying,"" Biden said, noting he had spoken with Kemp. ""I don't know why he [Trump] does this. And the reason I get so angry about it -- I don't care about what he says about me, but I care what he communicates to the people that are in need. He implies that we're not doing everything possible. We are,"" Biden said."
Neighbors have been helping neighbors recover from hurricane Helene : Consider This from NPR,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/1202966849/neighbors-have-been-helping-neighbors-recover-from-hurricane-helene,2024-10-02T21:27:54Z,"An aerial view of people clearing away debris in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene flooding in Asheville, North Carolina. President Joe Biden has ordered the deployment of 1,000 active duty U.S. soldiers to assist with storm relief efforts.

Today, the White House announced that 1,000 active duty troops would be deploying to help speed up delivery of food, water and medicine to communities most impacted by hurricane Helene. Both President Biden and Vice President Harris visited the region Wednesday.

Though recovery in the isolated and mountainous areas of North Carolina and Tennessee has been slow, NPR's Jennifer Ludden reports strangers who were not affected have been lending helping hands. Like 22-year-old Tyler Venerable in Newport, Tennessee, who's been using his orange forklift to clear out people's flood-ruined belongings.

""I have a business here, have this equipment,"" he says. ""There's people in need, so we're just going to give back to the community.""

He tells NPR that he's been sharing his number at the dump, offering to help people lug more than one item at a time. Other people have been connecting on Facebook, creating an informal network to help their affected neighbors. Venerable has even seen others pass out jugs of water so people can flush their toilets.

""I just think that's what we're supposed to do. I'd be upset if I was sitting at the house.""

Meanwhile, 56-year-old Trudy Hall watches her ruined belongings get carted away. She says she's gotten help from strangers since the day of the storm. A neighbor connected her with a man who took her in. Hall's coworkers have stepped up with support, even helping to clean out her house.

""How about that,"" she says. ""People are good.""

Team Rubicon is a nonprofit led by military veterans, and one of the organizations helping in the relief efforts. CEO Art delaCruz is on his way to Pasco County, Florida, which experienced a storm surge that caused flooding, but he says there are Team Rubicon members spread across affected areas in the southeast.

In early phases of recovery, delaCruz tells NPR they send route clearance teams with heavy equipment and chainsaws.

""They were able to clear enough debris on these roads across Florida, South Carolina, Georgia to fill up a convoy of 1,050 dump trucks,"" he says. ""In this long marathon process of restoration of services, all of those can occur once the roads are cleared.""

Now, he says they're transitioning to helping individual homeowners and helping restore people's lives.

""It's important to note that we've literally sprinted into the beginning of a marathon. This will take months to recover across this entire region.""

Beyond sending money to aid organizations helping with recovery efforts, delaCruz suggests people reach out to their friends and family and make disaster plans.

""This is one of those times where - the idea of neighbors helping neighbors, it should go from West Coast to East Coast and come together to be able to help the people impacted.""

The flooding in Western North Carolina has also left election officials scrambling to prepare for voting. WFAE member station reporter Steve Harrison reports that state election officials are confident that early voting will begin on time - October 17 - in all counties. They just can't really say what early voting will look like.

""There may be polling places impacted by mudslides, there may be polling places inaccessible because of damaged roads and there may be polling places with trees that have fallen on them,"" said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections.

Mail-in voting will also be impacted: presumably many of those ballots are lost and won't be found. Amanda Allen, elections director in Jackson County which is part of the disaster area, tells NPR she and her colleagues are dealing with questions like:

Besides the process of voting, reporter Steve Harrison spoke with Republicans who are concerned that turnout will be significantly down in the mountains - counties which Trump won in 2020. This year though, thousands of people are displaced and living elsewhere and, while they can vote by mail, it's unclear whether that will be a priority."
Trump and Harris plan to end taxes on tips. The reaction is mixed in Las Vegas,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/26/nx-s1-5125788/trump-and-harris-plan-to-end-taxes-on-tips-the-reaction-is-mixed-in-las-vegas,2024-10-02T20:47:24Z,"Clark County, Nevada, runs on the hospitality industry. How will a plan to eliminate income tax on tips affect workers decision on who to vote for, or whether to vote at all?

I'm in the swing state of Nevada this week, asking voters about the issues that matter most to them this election. Hospitality, gambling and entertainment are the economic engine of this state. A lot of the workers here in Las Vegas rely on tips to help pay their bills, so it's no surprise that former President Donald Trump chose a campaign rally in Las Vegas to make this announcement in June.

DONALD TRUMP: For those hotel workers and people that get tips - you're going to be very happy because, when I get to office, we are going to not charge taxes on tips - people making tips.

MARTÍNEZ: When Kamala Harris made the same promise, she also did it in Las Vegas.

VICE PRESIDENT KAMALA HARRIS: We will continue our fight for working families of America...

HARRIS: ...And eliminate taxes on tips for service and hospitality workers.

MARTÍNEZ: So what do the people who earn tips think?

MICHAEL WAGNER: My name's Michael Wagner. I'm a Las Vegas native. I'm a bartender.

MARTÍNEZ: He says he makes up to $120,000 a year and that at least 75% of his income comes from tips. His biggest tip ever? - $10,000, which was split with colleagues.

WAGNER: I'm not very invested into politics. I'm 41. I've never voted. This would definitely be the thing. If this was something that was going to actually get me to register, go out and actually do it.

KIMBERLI YELLE: My name's Kimberli Yelle. I am one of the servers here at Artesian Cellars Winery.

MARTÍNEZ: In Pahrump, 90 minutes west of Las Vegas, she told us she makes minimum wage, which is 12 bucks an hour here, and that 75% of her income is tips. She is skeptical about these campaign promises.

YELLE: I'm just worried about the back end. What other taxes are they going to raise to make up for losing that taxed income?

ALLAN SCHLEICH: Hi, I'm Allan Schleich. I'm a bartender in the Arts District, Downtown Las Vegas. That would definitely help with rent, groceries. You know, maybe I'd be able to go to the dentist for once.

MARTÍNEZ: He says he plans to vote Democratic, but not because of tips.

SCHLEICH: As Democrats always do, they tend to pander to the left and the working class without actually fulfilling their promises, while the right wing definitely just only supports the rich.

LASHAWNDA PARRISH: I'm Lashawnda Parrish (ph). I'm a Uber and Lyft driver in Las Vegas, Nev.

MARTÍNEZ: She says she makes around $100,000 a year, about 20% in tips. She likes the candidates' proposal on tipping, but it isn't affecting her vote. She says she plans to vote for Kamala Harris.

PARRISH: I would say it would be on my radar. It wouldn't be, like, one of the most important issues to me. I'm a independent, and I tend to vote both Republican and Democratic - split my vote sometimes.

SUMMER BUNNY: My name is Summer Bunny. I'm an adult entertainer here in Las Vegas.

MARTÍNEZ: That is a stage name. She asks that we not use her legal name for safety reasons. She says she makes between 10- and $20,000 a month. Her biggest tip so far? - a thousand bucks. She told us she would vote for Harris because of her support of reproductive rights. She wasn't impressed, though, with the proposals on tips.

SUMMER BUNNY: All my income is tips. I understand that there has to be order, like, in some way. So I can get away without paying taxes, which doesn't seem fair at the same time.

MARTÍNEZ: All right. So is killing the income tax on tips something that could actually happen? I'm here with David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution, to hear about the economics behind this campaign promise.

So David, we know the President cannot change tax law without Congress. But if Congress voted to exempt tips from taxes, who would benefit?

DAVID WESSEL: Well, not very many people. There are, of course, a lot of tip workers in Las Vegas. Ernie Tedeschi, an economist at the Yale Budget Lab, estimates about 2.5% of all workers in the U.S. - waiters, bartenders, hairdressers - routinely get tips. Maybe it's a little higher if you add in the growing number of Uber drivers and DoorDash drivers. But even among the lowest-paid workers, very few are in jobs where tipping is common. Moreover, nearly 90% of all tip workers make so little money that already they don't pay any federal income taxes under current law.

MARTÍNEZ: Though, you know, David, most of the tip workers we spoke to were skeptical or pessimistic, like another shoe would drop - like, nothing good could happen or could come out of this. So they wondered whether taxes maybe would be raised to offset. What do you think?

WESSEL: Right. So there are two bills already in Congress to exempt tips from taxes - nine cosponsors in the House, 10 in the Senate, mostly Republicans, but the three Democrats from Nevada are on the case. They don't say how they're going to make up the money. If this actually happens - and I don't think it's likely - if it does happen, it'll be rolled into a big tax bill next year. And it's not clear at all whether that will be offset by higher taxes or spending cuts somewhere.

MARTÍNEZ: What about employers? What are employers likely to do if tips are exempt from taxes?

WESSEL: Well, certainly, some employers are simply going to pay their workers lower wages since they know the employees will be able to keep more of their tip income. But another issue is likely to come up - and one of your people you talked to raised this - is the question of fairness. Why should a waitress who makes 30 grand a year in wages and tips pay less in federal taxes than a cafeteria worker who doesn't get any tips? And that bartender you talked to who said he makes 120 grand a year - 75% of it from tips - is that really what President Trump and Kamala Harris have in mind - giving someone like him a tax cut? Indeed, the Harris campaign tells reporters that they're going to limit this to people who make up to 75 grand.

MARTÍNEZ: Polls in Nevada show that Harris and Trump are pretty much dead even here. They both made those announcements here - just a way to get some votes - to get some extra votes, David?

WESSEL: Yeah, it seems to me that the only rationale for this proposal is to win votes in Nevada. And I suspect that Kamala Harris isn't in love with this idea, but she figured she would match President Trump and then move on. If the goal was really to help hard-pressed, low-wage workers, there are more efficient ways to do it. Make the Earned Income Tax Credit bigger. Expand the Child Tax Credit. Raise the minimum wage, which, by the way, all - Harris wants to do all those things.

I don't think this is the big issue that Nevada voters are going to work a vote on. And with both President Trump and Vice President Harris saying the same thing, it's hard for me to see how many votes this will swing. But in a close election, you had one guy who says he's going to register for vote for the first time if he thinks this is going to really happen.

MARTÍNEZ: David Wessel, director of the Hutchins Center at the Brookings Institution - David, thank you.

This story first appeared in the NPR Network's live blog of the 2024 vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz. For the latest on the campaign, head to NPR's Elections page.

Vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz faced off onstage in New York Tuesday for what is the last scheduled debate of election season.

The tone was largely collegial -- in contrast to much of the campaign so far -- as the two Midwestern men tackled issues like the economy, immigration and health care.

NPR reporters fact-checked the candidates' claims in real time. Here's what they found:

VANCE: ""If you believe [that carbon emissions drive climate change], what would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America ... Unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.

Under the Biden-Harris administration, the U.S. produced a record amount of oil last year -- averaging 12.9 million barrels per day. That eclipsed the previous record of 12.3 million barrels per day, set under former President Donald Trump in 2019.

Last year was also a record year for domestic production of natural gas. Much of the domestic boom in oil and gas production is the result of hydraulic fracturing or ""fracking"" techniques. While campaigning for president in 2019, Kamala Harris said she would ban fracking, but she changed course when she joined the Biden administration.

In addition to record oil and gas production, the Biden-Harris administration has also coincided with rapid growth of solar and wind power. Meanwhile, coal has declined as a source of electricity.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

MODERATOR: ""[Gov. Walz] mentioned that President Trump has called climate change a hoax. Do you agree? ""

VANCE: ""Look, what the president has said is that if the Democrats, in particular Kamala Harris and her leadership, if they really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America, and that's not what they're doing.""

VANCE: ""I've noticed some of our Democratic friends talking a lot about ... this idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change. Let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument.""

Former President Trump has, in fact, repeatedly called climate change a hoax and made light of its effects.

His rhetoric on climate change has shifted over the years, with the former president at times saying he believed the issue was real but did not know if it was driven by human activity.

Scientists agree that the climate is changing, and that change is being driven by human activity, specifically burning fossil fuels which increases carbon emissions.

-- NPR producer Lexie Schapitl

VANCE: ""And then I think you make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers. A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country, and by the way, that will be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing a good day's work.""

As the vice presidential candidates discuss how to address concerns over immigration, increased migration -- both legal and illegal -- has helped to grow the labor force in recent years, allowing employers to keep adding jobs at a rapid clip without putting much upward pressure on prices.

Over the last 12 months, for example, the foreign-born workforce has grown by nearly 1.5 million people while the native-born workforce has shrunk by 768,000 people -- mostly due to retirements, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Were it not for the influx of immigrant workers, the U.S. economy would likely be shrinking.

They do not appear to be displacing native-born workers.

The share of working-age men who were in the workforce in August was 89.5% -- higher than all but one month during the Trump administration. The share of working-age women who were in the workforce last month was the highest ever -- 78.4%.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

VANCE: ""A lot of fentanyl is coming into our country ... Kamala Harris let fentanyl into our communities at record levels.""

Once again we heard that undocumented immigrants are bringing fentanyl into the country -- a myth which has been debunked.

In reality, close to 90% of illicit fentanyl is seized at official border crossings. Immigration authorities say nearly all of that is smuggled by people who are legally authorized to cross the border, and more than half by U.S. citizens. Virtually none is seized from migrants seeking asylum.

Also, NPR has reported that the U.S. is currently seeing significantly less fentanyl in circulation and fewer overdoses. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that fentanyl-related deaths dropped by roughly 10% last year.

-- NPR immigration correspondent Jasmine Garsd

VANCE: ""If you look at what was so different about Donald Trump's tax cuts, even from previous Republican tax cut plans, is that a lot of those resources went to giving more take-home pay to middle class and working class Americans. It was passed in 2017 and you saw an American economic boom unlike we've seen in a generation this country.""

Despite Trump's frequent claims to the contrary, the 2017 tax cut was not the largest in U.S. history. However, it was big enough to blow a large hole in the federal budget. Tax revenues as a share of GDP dropped to 16.3% in the year after the tax cut was passed, down from 17.1% the year before and an average of 17.7% over the past 40 years. Even though federal spending also declined as a share of GDP in 2018, the deficit topped $785 billion that year, and approached a trillion dollars in 2019 -- the year before the pandemic.

According to the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center, more than half the savings from the 2017 tax cut went to the top 10% of earners, and more than a quarter went to the top 1%.

Large parts of the 2017 tax cut are due to expire next year. Trump has proposed extending all of them, while also calling for an additional cut in the corporate tax rate. Harris has proposed extending the tax cuts for everyone making less than $400,000 a year (97% of the population) while raising taxes on corporations and the wealthy.

While Harris' tax proposals are similar to those made by President Biden, her plan differs from the president's in some respects. For example, she called for a 28% tax on millionaires' investment income -- which is lower than the 39.6% rate Biden has proposed.

Under the Biden-Harris administration, the IRS has also beefed up tax enforcement to ensure that wealthier people and businesses pay what they owe. GOP lawmakers have criticized that effort, and it could be reversed in a second Trump administration.

-- NPR economics correspondent Scott Horsley

VANCE: ""I think you can make a really good argument that [Trump] salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came about. ... Donald Trump could have destroyed the program -- instead, he worked in a bipartisan way to ensure that Americans had access to affordable care.""

During his presidency, Trump undermined the Affordable Care Act in many ways -- for instance, by slashing funding for advertising and free ""navigators"" who help people sign up for a health insurance plan on HealthCare.gov. And rather than deciding to ""save"" the ACA, he tried hard to get Congress to repeal it, and failed.

The Biden administration has reversed course from Trump's management of the Affordable Care Act. Increased subsidies have made premiums more affordable in the marketplaces, and enrollment has surged. The uninsurance rate has dropped to its lowest point ever during the Biden administration.

The Affordable Care Act was passed in 2010 and is entrenched in the health care system. Republicans successfully ran against Obamacare for about a decade, but it has faded as a campaign issue this year.

-- NPR health policy correspondent Selena Simmons-Duffin

MODERATOR: ""Senator, you have not yet explained how you would protect people with preexisting conditions or laid out that plan.""

JD VANCE: ""Look, we currently have laws and regulations in place right now that protect people with preexisting conditions. We want to keep those regulations in place, but we also want to make the health insurance marketplace function a little bit better.""

Vance was asked about comments he's made recently, trying to fill in the details of Trump's comments during the presidential debate that he had the ""concepts of a plan"" when it comes to replacing the Affordable Care Act. (The Harris-Walz campaign needled the Republican ticket ahead of the debate about not having anything clearer to say on health policy.)

But when Vance refers to ""laws and regulations in place"" protecting people with preexisting conditions, those laws and regulations are the Affordable Care Act.

For context: Before the Affordable Care Act, insurance companies could deny coverage or charge higher premiums when people had ""preexisting conditions,"" which could be anything from diabetes or cancer to acne or back problems. The ACA made that illegal, and now everyone has to be covered and their premiums are based on their income, not how healthy they are.

Risk pools previously could essentially sort people into a ""healthy"" bucket, where you pay less for a health plan, and ""sick"" bucket, where you pay more or can't get coverage at all. The ACA requires insurance companies to take all people into the risk pool.

Health policy experts across the political spectrum say it's a terrible idea to go back to pre-ACA policies.

Of Vance's idea, conservative health policy expert Joe Antos told Roll Call last week, it ""doesn't make any sense,"" adding, ""you need some healthy people in there with some sick people, otherwise you're going to have a financially unsustainable system.""

Cynthia Cox of KFF, a nonpartisan research group, tweeted a thread enumerating how perilous things were when insurance companies could consider your ""preexisting conditions"" when deciding what coverage to offer you, if any.

""Cops, firefighters, miners, offshore drillers and pro athletes were denied plans,"" she wrote, because their jobs made some insurers think they were too risky to cover. And if your kid had more than three ear infections in the previous year, that could be grounds for denial, too.

-- NPR health policy correspondent Selena Simmons-Duffin

VANCE: ""Thanks to Kamala Harris's open border, we've seen a massive influx in the number of illegal guns run by the Mexican drug cartel.""

Actually, there is long standing evidence showing the gun smuggling route is going in the opposite direction.

Most recently, the Mexican Attorney General of the Republic and the United States Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) made an effort to trace the origin and number of firearms in Mexico coming from or through the United States. Mexico's Secretariat of Foreign Relations found that 70-90% of traced firearms originated from and passed through the U.S. The ATF and U.S. Government Accountability Office (GAO) estimated a lower rate of 68%.

-- NPR immigration correspondent Jasmine Garsd

VANCE: ""Another driver of the gun violence epidemic ... is the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities, and this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, and take gun offenders off the streets.""

Of course, crime rates vary by city, but overall across the country, violent crime dropped nationwide in 2023, with murder falling by around 10% from the year before, according to data released just last week from the FBI. More than 16,000 law enforcement agencies sent their crime data to the FBI, covering around 94% of the country's population.

This year-end data, released each fall by the FBI, is the most complete look at national crime rates we have, but it is a little dated. Still, according to preliminary FBI data, violent crime has continued to drop nationwide in the first half of 2024 compared to the first half of 2023.

MODERATOR: ""Governor, you said you were in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests 1989, but Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are reporting that you actually didn't travel to Asia until August of that year. Can you explain that discrepancy?""

WALZ: ""I've not been perfect, and I'm a knucklehead at times ... I got there that summer and misspoke on this.""

Walz has a long relationship with China and claimed he'd been there ""about 30"" or ""dozens"" of times, but after APM Reports questioned how that was possible, his campaign acknowledged the real number of trips from the U.S. to China was ""closer to 15.""

Walz lived in China for about a year, teaching in the southern city of Foshan. His stint with the nonprofit organization WorldTeach started in the summer of 1989, just two months after the Tiananmen Square massacre.

Starting in 1993, he led annual summer trips to China for students in the Nebraska and Minnesota high schools where he taught.

Walz also once described being in Hong Kong in May 1989, during the student uprising that culminated in the Tiananmen Square massacre, the reporting from APM Reports notes -- an assertion that is belied by newspaper accounts at the time."

In Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance shied away from bombastic untrue claims about immigrants eating people's pets and instead tackled issues such as the impact of immigrants on U.S.-born worker's wages.

""You make it harder for illegal aliens to undercut the wages of American workers,"" he promised. ""A lot of people will go home if they can't work for less than minimum wage in our own country. And by the way, that will be really good for our workers who just want to earn a fair wage for doing a good day's work.""

Most labor economists disagree with the claim that immigrants depress native-born worker wages.

Vance carefully dodged questions regarding family separation, a policy that caused uproar during former President Donald Trump's administration. He falsely claimed guns are smuggled into the U.S. over the border with Mexico (in fact, it's the other way around), and spoke about immigrants as being responsible for the housing crisis -- a complex issue that even conservative analysts say pre-existed the current wave of migration, but has been exacerbated by it.

Both candidates spoke about fentanyl as related to immigration, which remains a pervasive myth: Fentanyl is overwhelmingly brought into the U.S. by people crossing legally, through ports of entry. The street supply of fentanyl is also drying up.

For his part, vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz reminded debate viewers of the bipartisan bill that would have strengthened border enforcement. It was killed at the behest of Trump, and Walz repeated the Democratic vow that if elected, Kamala Harris will sign it ""on her first day in office.""

Video credit: CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

Immigration is one of the top concerns for voters and seen as a weak spot for Democrats, who, in response, have been flexing their muscle. On her recent trip to the Arizona border, Harrris vowed to ""set rules at our border and to enforce them, and I take that responsibility very seriously.""

Still, on several occasions at Tuesday's debate, Walz was critical of the Republican campaign's rhetoric on immigration. He criticized Vance for how he spoke about Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""When it becomes a talking point like this, we dehumanize and villainize other human beings,"" he said.

Vance did not repeat the false rumors that he helped amplify earlier this month regarding Haitian immigrants eating dogs and cats.

""""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio are the American citizens,"" Vance responded."

This story first appeared in the NPR Network's live blog of the 2024 vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz. For the latest on the campaign, head to NPR's Elections page.

The CBS news program 60 Minutes announced on Tuesday that former President Donald Trump has backed out of an interview he had agreed to do as part of its prime-time election special next week.

""For over half a century, 60 Minutes has invited the Democratic and Republican tickets to appear on our broadcast as Americans head to the polls,"" the newsmagazine posted on X. ""This year, both the Harris and Trump campaigns agreed to sit down with 60 Minutes.""

It went on to say that ""after initially accepting 60 Minutes' request for an interview"" with Scott Pelley, Trump's campaign ""has decided not to participate.""

The election special will air Monday at 8 p.m. ET as planned, and include Vice President Harris' interview with correspondent Bill Whitaker.

""Our original invitation to former President Donald Trump to be interviewed on 60 Minutes stands,"" the statement added.

Trump campaign spokesperson Steven Cheung responded shortly after on X, calling the program's version of events ""fake news.""

He said the show ""begged for an interview,"" and despite initial discussions, ""nothing was ever scheduled or locked in.""

""They also insisted on doing live fact checking, which is unprecedented,"" Cheung added.

Trump has run into trouble with 60 Minutes before, notably cutting short a 2020 interview with correspondent Lesley Stahl -- and backing out of a second that had been previously scheduled -- after becoming visibly frustrated with her ""tough"" line of questioning about the COVID-19 pandemic and other topics.

The Harris campaign was quick to criticize Trump on Tuesday night. Senior adviser David Plouffe posted on X that the former president is ""afraid"" of the debate stage and of 60 Minutes.

""And his campaign team -- after the last three days of increasingly unhinged and unstable ranting at his rallies -- is clearly afraid of exposing him beyond comfortable confines,"" he wrote.

He appeared to be referencing Trump's increasingly threatening and insulting rhetoric at rallies over the weekend, in which he described Harris as ""mentally impaired"" and said police should be allowed to be ""real rough"" on criminals for one hour to send a message.

The prime-time special would have been one of voters' final chances to see Trump and Harris side-by-side before Election Day. While the Harris campaign has called for a second debate, Trump's team has not agreed to one.

Tuesday night's debate between vice presidential candidates Tim Walz and JD Vance is the last one on the schedule."
Hurricane Helene upends election planning in some parts of North Carolina,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5135564/north-carolina-helene-voting,2024-10-01T22:01:27Z,"CHARLOTTE, N.C. -- North Carolina election officials said Tuesday that early voting would start as planned on Oct. 17, including in counties that were devastated by flooding from Hurricane Helene.

But they don't know how many early voting sites and Election Day polling places might be unusable in the swing state because of the storm.

""There may be polling places impacted by mudslides, there may be polling places inaccessible because of damaged roads, and there may be polling places with trees that have fallen on them,"" said Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections.

North Carolina is still trying to assess the damage from Helene, which caused massive flooding in the mountainous western part of the state.

Twelve county elections offices were still closed because of the storm, as of Tuesday evening. That means elections officials there can't process new registrations, and they can't send out or receive mail ballots.

The state's registration deadline is Oct. 11 -- though eligible voters can register in person at early voting sites during the early voting period, from Oct. 17-Nov. 2.

Brinson Bell said she hopes to know by the end of the week whether any polling places need to be moved. She said it's possible the board could set up temporary early voting sites in tents in parking lots -- something it did after Hurricane Dorian in eastern North Carolina in 2019.

She is confident the election will move forward as planned.

""It's not without consideration that I or someone else will go in that community and knock on doors if that's what it takes,"" she said.

North Carolina is considered one of seven swing states that could decide the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Harris have made numerous visits to the state this year, and polls show it's a toss-up.

It's unclear how the storm will impact who turns out to vote.

One of the hardest-hit counties is Buncombe, home to Asheville, which is a Democratic stronghold. But overall, most of the impacted counties are conservative and gave Trump large margins in the 2020 election.

North Carolinians have already started voting by mail. Generally, small shares of the state's voters cast mail ballots -- in the 2022 election, just about 5% voted by mail.

The state elections board said about 250,000 mail ballots have already been sent out for the 2024 election. It didn't know how many of those ballots went to western North Carolina.

It's possible some of those ballots were washed away in the storm. Others are probably waiting in post offices, unable to be delivered. Postal service in the region is widely disrupted.

Brinson Bell said North Carolina voters can track the status of their mail ballots online, if they have internet access. They can request a new mail ballot and the state will void the old one, or they can simply ignore their requested mail ballot, and vote in person.

The state's mail ballots were already delayed by more than two weeks after the North Carolina Supreme Court ordered the elections board to reprint ballots to remove Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s name from the presidential race. The ballots were sent out in late September to voters who requested them.

In addition to the delay in getting mail ballots sent, there also is a tighter window for those ballots to be returned. The Republican-led General Assembly eliminated a three-day grace period for mail ballots to arrive after Election Day. For ballots to count, they must arrive at county elections boards by 7:30 p.m. on Nov. 5. (Military ballots and ballots from overseas civilians can arrive later.)

Brinson Bell said she doesn't know if she will ask state lawmakers to restore the three-day grace period.

She said it might make more sense to ask for more flexibility in where voters can return their mail ballots. Under current state law, voters can only drop off mail ballots at voting sites during early voting. She said she might seek permission to allow voters to drop off mail ballots at polling places on Election Day.

""[We're] seeing whether that's something that's more realistic and beneficial,"" she said.

Voters in affected counties do have more flexibility when it comes to the state's new voter identification requirements. According to the state elections board: ""One of the permitted exceptions is for voters who are unable to provide ID because of a natural disaster that occurred within 100 days of an election. ... This means that voters in or from the 25 counties under a disaster declaration may use this exception to the photo ID requirement, if they are unable to show ID when voting because of the natural disaster."""
More than 165 'Artists for Kamala' auction their work in support of Harris,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5134860/kamala-harris-art-auction,2024-10-01T21:18:10Z,"The bidding has begun. Leading contemporary artists including Carrie Mae Weems, Judy Chicago, Jeff Koons and Shepard Fairey have donated works for an auction intended to raise money for Kamala Harris' campaign for president.

Many of the works that have been donated will remain open for bidding through Oct. 8 on the platform Artsy. Proceeds from the Artists for Kamala: Benefit Auction will go to the Harris Victory Fund.

Among the lots with the most bids as of this afternoon are works by Amy Sherald, Rashid Johnson and Christine Sun Kim.

The auction also includes a silkscreen from Hank Willis Thomas that reads: ""FRAGILE DEMOCRACY HANDLE WITH CARE,"" and a selection from one of Jenny Holzer's Truisms that says, ""There are too few immutable truths today.""

Like President Biden, who called for an increase in funding for the National Endowment for the Arts, Vice President Harris has championed the arts.

As reported by Hyperallergic, Harris has supported legislation that would help further the work of cultural institutions. She was on the board of the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art and once posted on social media, ""It's a no-brainer that if we want our children to thrive, we need to reinvest in America's public education system -- including the arts."""
"This new MacArthur ""genius"" says she defied caste prejudice thanks to Dad and Mom",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/goats-and-soda/2024/10/01/g-s1-25437/macarthur-genius-grant-caste-dalit-india-shailaja-paik,2024-10-01T16:07:00Z,"Shailaja Paik was born into India's Dalit community -- one of the millions who belong to historically marginalized and oppressed castes due to their professions. They're so scorned that they were for centuries known as ""untouchables."" And even though modern India is changing, caste discrimination refuses to go away.

Paik faced prejudice both as a Dalit and a woman. She credits her parents, especially her father, for helping her (and her three sisters) defy the prejudices they faced as Dalits and as women. He made sure they got an education.

For Paik, schooling was a path to teaching history in the U.S., writing books about the untold plight of the Dalits -- and now being dubbed a genius.

She's one of 22 recipients of the 2024 MacArthur fellowship, one of the most prestigious awards for creative and intellectual achievement -- informally known as ""the genius grant.""

MacArthur fellows receive $800,000 over five years to spend however they want -- one of the few no-strings attached grants. The fellows do not apply nor are they officially interviewed for it. The call informing them of the fellowship comes out of the blue.

A research professor of history at the University of Cincinnati, Paik is not a public figure as some recipients are. She has documented the deep social inequity rising from India's repressive caste system that she is a part of. Her focus is the plight of Dalit women like herself.

In a video interview with NPR, Paik, age 50, shares key findings from her years of research -- and why this achievement is such a milestone. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

When you received the news that you'd won the MacArthur grant, what was that moment like?

The call came around 5 p.m. I was resting after a full day of classes. I was tired and couldn't really believe what I was hearing. The Foundation congratulated me, explained the details of the award and how it related to my work. It was such an exhilarating, ecstatic moment.

How does it feel to be called a genius? Growing up, did you ever think that this kind of recognition would be yours?

I've worked very hard all my life against odds, and while every success I've had has been appreciated and celebrated by parents, friends, and extended family, I've never been called a ""genius"" before. It's overwhelming, but when I think of how I got here -- an often rocky journey -- I'm going to embrace it with gratitude.

Tell us about those early years.

Growing up, I had to fight hard to survive. I was born in Pohegaon, a small village in [the western Indian state of] Maharashtra.

My family moved to Pune, the nearest city [four hours away by road] in the 1960s, where I grew up. We lived in a one-room house in a slum area in Yerawada, on the Ahmednagar highway, which made it easier for my father to make trips to our native village so he could keep in touch with his family. Our house was about 20 by 20 feet, and we didn't have access to toilets.

The neighborhood where we lived in was a densely populated, underserved area, full of underprivileged people, some labeled disruptive or dangerous. I have three sisters and if it weren't for our father, who was determined to give us an education, these opportunities wouldn't have been ours. My mother, educated until grade 6, introduced me to the English alphabet. She worked very hard at domestic drudgery to enable me and my sisters to devote ourselves to our education. She protected us and taught us to protect ourselves. She has been a model of fortitude, standing by me, teaching me to pursue my interests singlemindedly and believing in my endeavors.

My father struggled for an education himself. He attended what we call night school and worked during the day, waiting tables and cleaning at restaurants. He put up pandals [temporary scaffolding, used for weddings or religious events] and learnt to play [pre-recorded] music during events. In this way, somehow, he educated himself -- and got a bachelor's degree in Agricultural Sciences, the first Dalit man from his village to do so.

Did his emphasis on education encourage you to pursue a career in academia?

Dalits have been excluded from education and seeking out knowledge for centuries. I mention this in my first book, Dalit Women's Education in Modern India, Double Discrimination. Women faced double discrimination -- for being Dalits and because of their gender.

So that became an important motivation for me too. To escape the slum, I had to get education and employment -- it was key to living a better life.

It became especially important after my father's death in 1996, because I had to support my family -- my mother and sisters .

Soon after, in the same year, I got my masters' degree from the Savitribai Phule university in Pune. I started out as a lecturer teaching history in Mumbai. The Ford Foundation fellowship provided me support to pursue a doctoral degree in Warwick University in the U.K. I arrived in the U.S. in 2005 after securing a fellowship from Emory University.

For people encountering your work in South Asian history for the first time, what can they expect?

My work explores the role of power and identity. It shines a light on the fundamental inequalities in our lives that make some people more equal than others.

Broadly speaking, it documents the inequalities that we inherit. My teaching and research focuses on systemic mechanisms of stigmatization and exploitation.

Those who are privileged elites have pushed the burden of [making amends for prejudices like] caste onto Dalits, of race to Black people and of gender to women, thus holding the oppressed responsible for fighting for their rights and addressing their difficulties on their own. My work shows that everyone -- the oppressed and oppressors -- need to work together to fight for liberation.

Through the course of your career, you've championed the cause of Tamasha women, dancing artists from the Western Indian state of Maharashtra -- some of whom are Dalits. What drew you to their stories?

Tamasha brings together drama, dance, mime, song, and it is considered a traditional art performed predominantly by women from the Dalit community. However, it was often branded ashleel or vulgar by the larger society. The performance and the performers were regarded as loud, pretentious, showy and considered indecent, rude, dishonest.

So growing up, I've watched these performances in both my village and the city and I understood how intensely these women performers were stigmatized. I found literary evidence that dates back to the 10th century calling the art vulgar and saying that no one should be engaging in it or watching it.

When I began the fieldwork for my Ph.D. dissertation in 2002 and 2003, I interviewed about 180 women from different social backgrounds -- from middle-class apartments and slums, from different castes and different Dalit castes. Among these interviewees were many Tamasha women.

Little was known about the caste prejudice and violence that Tamasha girls face.

It amazed me how their voice was so completely erased after being branded as vulgar, and so I set about creating an archive, filled with newspaper clips, magazines, pamphlets, films, music and fieldwork that centered on the experiences of Tamasha women.

So this topic has been on my mind for the last 20 years and became the subject of my second book, The Vulgarity of Caste: Dalits, Sexuality and Humanity in Modern India.

In your book, you discuss the vicious cycle that Tamasha women must endure. Many despise their own line of work because of the bawdry, sensual nature of the dance. They know others don't respect them for it and worse, it leaves them vulnerable to sexual assault -- seen by society as sex workers even though that is not the case. Yet they cannot stop performing, because discrimination against them will not allow them to take on other jobs or switch careers. You call this the sex, gender and caste complex. Could you elaborate?

In the caste system, women are rigidly regulated in terms of their sexuality -- it is used as a means of controlling and branding them. Gender and sexuality are used to deny Dalit women dignity.

For instance, the sex-gender-caste complex very cunningly labels a range of dancers, singers and Tamasha women as prostitutes [as a result of their low caste status].

In my book, Mangalatai Bansode, a well-known Tamasha artist who continues to dance to this day, has discussed the ways the sex-gender-caste complex created so many difficulties for her. She recalled an incident that happened to her as a 16-year-old. She was forced to dance in an ox cart by the people in her village. She was the lead dancer, and she and other women were crammed into an ox cart and had to dance as it made its way around her village. A wild crowd gathered, and men danced and cheered around the ox cart, trying to grab at her and pull at her saree. You can imagine how frightening this experience would have been for a 16-year-old, and yet she could not refuse because she would have to face violence if she did.

In recent years, have things changed? Have modern Tamasha girls found a way out of this cycle of suppression and violence?

As I show in my book the sex-gender-caste complex exploited Dalit Tamasha women, but some women like Bansode have made it work. She created business opportunities and propelled social mobility for herself, her family members and her troupe. Her granddaughter is now a medical doctor.

Tamasha women have also pursued different opportunities in terms of recording CDs, uploading YouTube videos, reels, entering films -- but still these numbers are very small.

Many Tamasha women continue to live in poverty, do not get the pensions promised by the government, do not get support from local authorities and continue to struggle. COVID was particularly challenging for many.

Though it isn't easy, is there any way to build a more equitable society for people who still endure caste prejudice?

It's a centuries-old discrimination so certainly not easy. There are a number of ways we can work on fighting this discrimination and the system. But primarily, we need to acknowledge that caste divisions and prejudice exist.

This is something that especially high-caste elite liberals do not want to talk about. Some [Indians] are quick to talk about the racial discrimination that they face but do not want to talk about the caste discrimination that they perpetuate.

So we should talk about it and stop pretending that there is no caste, in India and elsewhere. There are very intense conversations taking place in the U.S. today, especially [around] caste and race.

The MacArthur grant comes with $800,000 disbursed over five years. Is there a beach chair with your name on it? How does it factor in your future plans?

(Laughs). To be honest, it's going to take some time to sink in.

But I do know that it will help me conduct my research and write on historical inequities and social barriers with greater ease and to expose my students to these different perspectives.

You know -- history isn't a dead subject. Our attitude to the past shapes how we think about the present and how we build our future.

What do you think the fellowship means to other Dalits?

This fellowship is a celebration of the enormous contributions of Dalits -- their ideas, actions, history and fight for human rights -- as much as it is of me as a Dalit woman scholar. I am indebted to the Dalit women who shared their lives with me and I hope this achievement will strengthen the fight of both Dalits and non-Dalits against caste discrimination, in and beyond South Asia.

"In Nevada, Latinos could pick the next president. They aren't sold on either candidate",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25479/nevada-latino-voters-trump-harris-culinary-union,2024-10-01T12:02:30Z,"LAS VEGAS -- Walking out of a grocery store in a Latino neighborhood on the east side of the city, Flor Elena Fernandez says she's wrestling with who to vote for in this year's election.

The 36-year old housekeeping manager worries about the cost of food. She worries about the cost of living.

""We're all waiting for what is going to happen, especially us Hispanics, says Fernandez, who is originally from Cuba. ""The economy is bad. We're waiting to see what happens.""

Her one and a half year old son, dressed in a red Flash superhero shirt is riding in the cart. Her mom also walks along, smiling knowingly.

Flor Maria Parra, Fernandez' mother, explains that she's already decided.

""Yes, for Kamala Harris,"" Parra, explains. ""At least with Hispanics, she defends the Hispanics a lot, while Trump throws them out.""

Around 1 in 5 voters in the Silver State are Latino. Now, that's more political power than the group has in almost any of the other 7 key states in the electoral college count.

President Biden barely eked out a victory in Nevada, in part by winning 60% of the Latino vote, but polls suggest Trump has stronger Latino support than previous Republican campaigns.

It's here in Las Vegas where Trump unveiled his plan to eliminate taxes on tips, seen as a direct pitch largely to Latino workers who make up the backbone of the state's casino and hospitality industry.

Looking to regain their advantage, the Harris campaign is spending $3 million in Spanish-language radio this month, which it says is the largest investment in Hispanic media ever.

The Democrats have also launched their not-so-secret weapon in the state -- an army of service workers from the Culinary Workers Union who have been helping deliver the party victories for several elections.

Ted Pappageorge, secretary-treasurer for the Culinary Workers Union, admits Nevada, ""to be honest, should be Trump territory.""

""At the end of the day, we're competitive, and we outwork everybody,"" he said, adding, ""there's a pathway to win if we really can get workers talking to workers face to face at the doors.""

That's exactly what they do. Thousands of cooks and servers and room cleaners will take a leave of absence to knock on doors, six days a week for Harris and the Democrats. The Culinary Union will help cover their missed wages as they undertake this different kind of work.

The Trump campaign is also increasing its efforts to reach Latino voters. In Nevada, it's hosting Spanish phone banking sessions, postcard writing nights and trainings for local volunteers.

Tony Fabrizio, Trump's lead pollster, argues that Harris' team is spending so much money on Latinos because they've lost so much ground within the community, especially in Nevada and Arizona.

""I don't care whose national poll you look at -- even yours, from NPR -- it is really very clear that she is underperforming with Hispanics, not only nationally, but in these two key states,"" Fabrizio said.

Back at the supermarket, views of Trump are widely mixed. Alfredo Alcasar is a maintenance worker. He says he doesn't like how Trump talks about Latinos.

""I don't like to be minimized. Trump always minimizes us, he said. ""And why, if we've done nothing bad? All we've done is try to contribute to the country as best we can.""

But Pedro Fernandez, a carpenter -- who is not related to Flor Elena and her mom -- is less worried about Trump's rhetoric and more concerned about inflation and the cost of living.

""We've been here 18 years, and when Trump was in power, the economy was stronger,"" he said.

As for Flor Elena Fernandez, she's torn. It will be her first time voting after recently becoming a citizen, and she wants to make the right choice. She agrees the economy is bad, but she also sees her mother's perspective.

""We know that she has a plan, but we don't know how good it will be,"" Fernandez says of Harris."
"Justice Department No. 3 official pledges to fight hate crimes, fueled by personal story",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/g-s1-25489/justice-department-hate-crimes-ben-mizer,2024-10-01T09:17:21Z,"Benjamin Mizer, with Attorney General Merrick Garland (left), speaks during a press conference announcing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in March 2024. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

When the Justice Department's third-in-command announced nearly $30 million in new federal funds to fight the rise in hate crimes last week, he paused to share a personal reflection.

Ben Mizer told the audience he was ""almost exactly the same age"" as Matthew Shepard would have been, another young gay man living in a small college town in the late 1990s. Attackers beat Shepard, tied him to a fence and left him to die in 1998, striking fear and horror across the nation. The law named after him -- and passed more than a decade later -- gave the federal government new tools to prosecute people who are fueled by hate.

""What I would say to members of the LGBTQ community is that the Justice Department is working day and day out on their behalf to ensure that their rights and dignity are protected,"" Mizer said in a recent interview. ""And I'm proud to be a member of that community and at a senior level of the department.""

The FBI reported more than 11,000 hate crimes in 2023, including a steep increase in anti-Jewish and anti-Black incidents. Mizer and other Justice Department leaders have been targeting those and other crime problems with a two-pronged approach: prosecuting offenders and making financial investments in public safety. The Justice Department administers billions in federal grants. Its Office of Justice Programs has already invested more than $70 million into fighting hate crimes over the past several years.

Mizer, 47, oversees an enormous portfolio at the DOJ, from antitrust and the environment to civil rights. In recent weeks, he's helped launch a lawsuit against the operators of a ship that brought down Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge; announce a settlement over the Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals that derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, not far from where he spent his childhood; and bring blockbuster antitrust cases against Apple, Ticketmaster and Visa.

""I think economic justice means ensuring that everyone has a fair shake, that the playing field is level and that corporations are not using their power in unfair ways to harm competition or to harm consumers,"" Mizer said.

The son of two union workers, Mizer said he went to law school at the University of Michigan to ""help the little guy."" Since then, Mizer has served as solicitor general in his home state of Ohio, and had two separate stints at the Justice Department in Washington.

In the Obama years, Mizer helped implement a U.S. Supreme Court decision that invalidated the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. He sat in on the oral argument at the high court for another case, Obergefell v. Hodges, that ultimately legalized same-sex marriage.

""My husband and I enjoy the benefits of the tremendous advances that were made with respect to gay rights during the Obama era,"" Mizer said. ""But that is not to say that those battles are completely won.""

Mizer said he's proud of the work the DOJ has done to challenge state laws that could deprive transgender people of gender-affirming care -- and to protect women's rights to travel to secure health care including abortion services.

It's not clear whether Mizer will stick around at Justice, in the event Vice President Harris wins the White House. But he said working at DOJ has been ""the honor of a lifetime."""
JD Vance's time on the trail has often been overshadowed by self-made controversy,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5060281/vp-debate-jd-vance-haitian-migrants-abortion-childless-cat-ladies,2024-10-01T09:10:12Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance speaks to a crowd during a rally at the Berks County Fairgrounds on Sept. 21, in Leesport, Penn. Matthew Hatcher/Getty Images hide caption

Republican vice presidential nominee Ohio Sen. JD Vance has been an aggressive messenger for Donald Trump's campaign vision for the future and is a constant fixture on the trail, doing interviews and taking questions from the press.

But in the 11 weeks since Vance joined the GOP presidential ticket, that message has been overshadowed by controversy -- often of Vance's own making.

His acceptance speech in Milwaukee at the Republican National Convention was heavy on biography and nodded towards a more polished take on Trump's often dire rhetoric.

""My friends, tonight is a night of hope,"" he said. ""A celebration of what America once was, and with God's grace, what it will soon be again. And it is a reminder of the sacred duty we have to preserve the American experiment, to choose a new path for our children and grandchildren.""

Vance's selection came at a moment when Trump was leading in key battleground polls after President Biden's poor debate performance and the GOP was rallying around Trump after an assassination attempt in Pennsylvania. The freshman Ohio senator was viewed as the MAGA heir apparent to the party's future.

But in the run-up to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, there have been two conflicting forces at work on the trail: the message that Vance wants to get out, and what actually sticks.

Take his first solo campaign rally in his hometown, just days after the RNC, where he delivered a populist speech vowing to help lift up ""forgotten communities all across our country.""

""We're going to fight for every single worker in this country,"" he said. ""If you work hard and play by the rules, you ought to be able to put a good dinner on the table and send your kids to whatever vacation and whatever school you want to.""

But another line that broke through to the public -- and not for good reason -- was a comment about Diet Mountain Dew.

""Democrats say that it is racist to believe -- well, they say it's racist to do anything,"" he said. ""I had a Diet Mountain Dew yesterday and one today. I'm sure they're going to call that racist, too.""

In the days that followed, Trump struggled to quickly pivot his campaign message to address Vice President Harris after President Biden dropped out of the race, but Vance was quick to fill in the gaps to question her record and make her the focus of attacks on immigration, inflation and other top Republican issues.

When Harris named Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate and the pair embarked on a swing state blitz, Vance was there, too, countering the Democratic message with the case for a Republican presidency.

""It is normal people who suffer when Kamala Harris refuses to do her job, and it is normal people who stand to benefit the most when we re-elect Donald J. Trump president of the United States,"" he said in Philadelphia.

But Vance's rapid ascension in politics means he has relatively less experience as a campaigner, delivering stump speeches or handling the intense scrutiny on past and present statements.

So the prebuttal tour came as Vance was also dealing with uproar over old comments he made deriding Democrats in charge as quote ""childless cat ladies.""

""It's not a criticism of people who don't have children,"" Vance said in an interview with Megyn Kelly. ""I explicitly said in my remarks despite the fact the media has lied about this that this is not about criticizing people who for various reasons didn't have kids. This is about criticizing the Democratic Party for becoming anti-family and anti-child.""

But the damage was done, as Vance's old comments provided Democrats an opening to attack the GOP ticket as sexist and out of touch.

Then, there's more recent remarks, like a weeks-long inflammatory crusade against Haitian migrants living in Springfield, Ohio that Vance has sought to use as a cudgel to attack Democrats over immigration.

""The American media totally ignored this stuff until Donald Trump and I started talking about cat memes,"" Vance said in a Sept. 15 CNN interview. ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do.""

State and local Republican leaders in Ohio have rejected claims made by Trump and Vance about Haitian migrants in Springfield. The city's mayor told news outlets that Vance's staff knew the conspiracies about eating pets were false before Trump uttered the lies on the debate stage last month.

Several times, Vance has also staked out policy positions for the ticket that Trump has later disagreed with or shot down, like when Vance said that Trump would veto a national abortion ban.

""I didn't discuss it with JD, in all fairness,"" Trump said on the debate stage. ""And I don't mind if he has a certain view, but I don't think he was speaking for me.""

Where Trump offered a ""concept of a plan"" for health care, Vance answered a question after a Raleigh, North Carolina campaign speech with more details of how Republicans would overhaul health insurance risk pools under the Affordable Care Act, a broadly unpopular proposal.

Elsewhere on the campaign trail, Vance has also been prolific when it comes to messaging campaign goals, frequently doing media interviews, delivering speeches and taking questions after most every stop -- prioritizing local journalists.

But those Q and A sessions can turn contentious, with the crowd often booing questions from journalists as Vance takes the opportunity to paint himself as a pugilist for Trump, whether it be queries about interest rate cuts or questions about the campaign's support of North Carolina Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, who allegedly called himself a ""Black Nazi"" among other things on a porn forum more than a decade ago. (Robinson has denied the allegation.)

Vance, who was a combat correspondent in the Marine Corps, regularly lectures reporters about what he perceives to be unfair coverage of him and frequently directs them to ask Harris questions instead.

Even in more casual campaign settings, Vance has struggled at times to connect. At one stop at a doughnut shop in Valdosta, Georgia, an employee was awkwardly put on the spot by the candidate -- she then asked not to be filmed on camera. On another visit to a Pennsylvania sandwich shop last weekend, Vance was left standing outside in a parking lot after some initial confusion because staff at the shop were never given advance notice of his visit.

All of these things have contributed to Vance having the lowest favorability rating on this year's presidential ballot -- and one of the lowest of any VP pick in recent history."
Tim Walz's state became a 'trans refuge.' Here's what that means and how it happened,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5103113/minnesota-trans-refuge-walz-vance-transgender-rights,2024-10-01T09:07:05Z,"MINNEAPOLIS -- As Gov. Tim Walz prepares to debate Sen. JD Vance Tuesday night, Minnesota's status as a ""trans refuge"" state will likely be in the spotlight.

""He's very heavy into transgender, anything transgender he thinks is great,"" former President Trump said on Fox the day after Walz was announced as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate. (Trump has pledged, if elected, to end gender-affirming care for youth nationally.)

In Arizona earlier this month, Vance falsely claimed the ""trans refuge"" law Walz signed allows the state to ""take children away from their parents if their parents don't want to do sex changes."" He added, ""that is not small government, that is disgusting, and he should be ashamed of himself.""

Here's what the ""trans refuge"" law in Minnesota is, how it's working, and how involved Walz was in getting the law passed.

The first thing to understand about how politically purple Minnesota came to pass this law, is that in 2022, voters elected Democratic majorities in both houses of the legislature and the governorship. It was the first Democratic trifecta in a decade, and lawmakers came in with a list of priorities.

Making the state a ""trans refuge"" wasn't on that list. But freshman Rep. Leigh Finke, the first transgender member of Minnesota's state legislature, made sure it was added.

""I knew that we had to do something because the national, coordinated anti-trans wave was building steam,"" Finke says. In 2023, between January and May, 15 states across the country enacted laws banning gender-affirming care for youth, including Minnesota's neighboring states of Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota.

""The dominoes fell in 2023,"" Finke says. ""The self-evident urgency became clear to the members of the Minnesota legislature.""

Walz, from the governor's mansion, was an active ally in the effort to protect transgender people in the state and not a newcomer to the issues, Finke says. ""Walz is a teacher and his history includes being the Gay Straight Alliance advisor at Mankato West [high school],"" she points out. ""People who are around young people and have seen what it means to deny people their authentic fullness -- they understand it.""

He was ""clear eyed in his support for this all along,"" Finke says, and quickly signed an executive order to put some protections in place in case the bill didn't get through the legislature. Because her party had only a very slim majority, Finke says she spoke to ""every single Democrat in the legislature -- and some of them for hours and hours,"" about the bill and its importance.

The day of the vote in the House, protestors arguing for and against the bill filled the state house. Debate on the floor was contentious and many hours long. ""We voted at 5:45 in the morning in the House -- it was a filibuster situation -- and everybody stayed up and made it happen,"" she said. In the end, the bill passed in both the house and the senate, and only two Democrats across the legislature voted against it, she says. ""I feel incredibly proud and grateful.""

Walz signed the bill in front of cameras. As he signed, he said ""Love wins,"" and handed one pen to preteen Hildie Edwards, who had testified in support of the law, and another to Rep. Finke.

The text of the law protects the privacy of both patients and clinicians when it comes to gender-affirming care in Minnesota.

""If you are trying to access health care for transition-related reasons, you can access that care in the state of Minnesota no matter where you live, and while you are in the state of Minnesota, our laws will protect you,"" Finke explains.

The law also protects medical providers from out-of-state subpoenas. Finke points to how Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton tried to get medical records for transgender Texans from Seattle Children's Hospital. ""Under our bill, the attorney general is tasked with protecting people in Minnesota to receive gender-affirming care,"" she says, so hospitals and doctors in the state don't need to worry about that kind of effort.

The law does not regulate the care itself -- it was already legal in Minnesota, and the details of a patient's treatment are governed by standards of care, and by an individual's choices, made in consultation with their family and doctor.

One provision of the law concerns custody cases, which Vance pointed to when he claimed the state of Minnesota could kidnap kids. ""There's nothing like that anywhere around this law -- it's a made up lie,"" Finke says. The bill allows certain custody cases to be heard in family court in Minnesota and judges to issue temporary orders, but it does not determine which parent gets custody or hand custody to the state. ""The state cannot claim jurisdiction or custody of a child,"" she says. ""Of course it can't.""

Since Minnesota's trans refuge law was in response to anti-trans legislation in states across the country, the circumstances are ""much more tragic than celebratory,"" Finke says.

Many trans people and their families living in states with bans feel like they're being driven out. ""Hundreds of people and families within the first six months moved to Minnesota -- I'm sure that's a major undercount,"" Finke says. ""And I know as the election comes, we're getting more and more."" She says trans people and their families are worried about what another Trump presidency could mean for their rights, not just in relation to health care access, but also military service, housing and employment discrimination, among other issues.

Since Minnesota's law took effect last spring, it has affected health care providers in the state. Children's Minnesota, which runs a gender program for youth, has seen an increase of about 30% in calls from patients in neighboring states. The hospital tells NPR their waitlist is about a year long for new patients, and they have hired new clinicians to keep up with demand. Family Tree Clinic, a Minneapolis provider of gender-affirming care, has begun a program to help train more physicians on this kind of care around the state.

Some families who can't relocate end up driving hundreds of miles to see gender-affirming care providers in Minnesota. One Minneapolis doctor told NPR he currently has 15 patients who do so.

On the presidential campaign trail, Walz isn't shy about his support for LGBTQ+ rights.

He headlined the recent Human Rights Campaign annual dinner and proudly enumerated the ways that both he and Harris have supported LGBTQ+ rights through their careers. He told the crowd, as he has said many times on the campaign trail, that there's a saying in Minnesota: ""Everything works better if you just mind your own damn business and I'll mind mine.""

""That's truly a long standing Minnesota value here,"" says Finke, who was born and raised in the state. ""People don't necessarily want to get involved, for better or worse, in their neighbors' lives, and that has allowed us to do a lot of good progressive work.""

""Some of the earliest trans action for civil rights was done here,"" she adds. ""In 1978, there was a case argued by the ACLU for a trans woman in the Army to be able to stay and keep her job. We were the first state to protect trans people in our Human Rights Act. It's always just been a part of the fabric here.""

Rep. Leigh Finke has faced fierce opposition to her trans legislative work -- including threats and harassment. In a way, that has helped fuel her own political rise. ""I'm a little bit famous in the Midwest,"" she grins.

""There were some viral moments from the House floor from conservatives going on tirades against me and against trans people, and it provided an opportunity for us to be able to stand strong, to be able to say, 'Here we are, queer forever, you can't just yell at us and have us go away,'"" she says.

She's had positive attention, too. Last year, she was named the USA Today ""Woman of the Year"" for Minnesota, and she was recognized as a ""Health Hero"" by Children's Minnesota.

And she is happy that there is more representation of trans people in public life than when she was growing up in the 80s and 90s in suburban Minnesota. ""You can't be what you can't see,"" she says, noting that she didn't come out as trans until adulthood. ""And I'm so grateful that I did. And I'm so grateful that I get to be in a position now where other people can see not just that there are trans people, but that we're succeeding.""

But when she knocks on doors for her re-election bid this fall, Finke says trans issues are not what voters are concerned about. ""I think that, in general, people don't want to be talking about trans kids, they would rather just let us live our lives.""

She's happy to talk about her other political priorities, like housing and the arts and urban tree policy, instead."
How young Republicans and Democrats are whipping up votes in key districts,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/nx-s1-5123646/donald-trump-kamala-harris-georgia-election-young-voters,2024-10-01T09:06:16Z,"A member of the Young Republicans fills out a postcard asking for support for GOP candidates in Georgia. Nydia Blas for NPR hide caption

In a bustling restaurant in northwest Atlanta, roughly a dozen young Republicans are surrounded by pitchers, chips and salsa, chatting and laughing as they fill out postcards.

""Anybody need a drink?"" calls Winslow Jones, the president of Atlanta Young Republicans.

The group has met for what they're calling Margaritas and Mailers, and today they are handwriting postcards asking for support for two down-ballot GOP candidates running in nearby districts.

""Margaritas help,"" Jones laughs. ""This is an environment where people can come and connect with likeminded people.""

As election day nears, all eyes are once again on Georgia and its 16 electoral votes. And this time, one essential voting bloc is getting a lot of attention: millennials and Gen Z.

Voters under 44 years old will make up about half the eligible voting population in the U.S. this fall, according to population projections from the U.S. Census Bureau. NPR traveled to Atlanta to see how different groups of young organizers are approaching this moment.

At the Young Republican meet-up, Jones points to the intellectual diversity among its members, including the varying opinions on former President Donald Trump.

""I think across the board there can be mixed feelings about Trump,"" she says. ""But I think what we're all united on is this is a much bigger picture here that we need to look at ... issues that are affecting people at large.""

Jones says the issues resonating with younger conservatives like herself include the economy, the U.S.-Mexico border and crime.

Nearby, Jacquelyn Harn is also busy writing postcards. She's the chairwoman of the statewide group, Young Republicans of Georgia.

""We're excited for a change,"" Harn says when asked about Trump's 2024 run. ""We want the life that we had four years ago when President Trump was president. And his policies -- his conservative policies -- we need those back, and we want those to be able to achieve our version of the American dream again.""

Harn says young people have been hit hard by the economy and inflation. She points to housing and the fact that she can't afford to buy a house because she's ""paying rent out the wazoo every month."" And she doesn't see that changing if Kamala Harris wins.

""She's saying day one, she's going to fix the housing crisis and the pricing and inflation,"" Harn says. ""She's had three-and-a-half years to do that, so no one's buying it.""

Yet while younger Republicans in Atlanta are mobilizing, young conservatives in general are becoming increasingly rare, says Kerwin Swint, a political science professor at Kennesaw State University.

""Since the Obama years, the youth vote really has sided with the Democratic presidential candidate more often than not,"" Swint told NPR. ""The only question has been, what's the size of that turnout for the Democratic candidate?""

Back at the Margaritas and Mailers event, NPR asks Harn if it's harder for Republican groups to fire up younger voters who may be watching Harris, who is nearly 20 years younger than Trump and has landed high-profile endorsements likely to resonate with young people, like from Taylor Swift.

Harn says she isn't fazed: ""Taylor Swift is a billionaire who doesn't have to worry about how much groceries costs ... you can't tell me she relates to the average person around this table tonight. So if the best they can do is a celebrity endorsement that is not relatable at all, I don't see what they're doing.""

In the two months since President Biden stepped aside and Harris took the top of the ticket, Democratic groups in Georgia have shifted their campaigning into overdrive.

""Things just got crazy out of nowhere,"" says Davante Jennings, the president of Young Democrats of Georgia. ""Like, more people involved, more support, more work, more canvassing, more text banking. But it's good.""

When we meet Jennings recently at the Atlanta headquarters of the Harris-Walz campaign, he is joined by a dozen 20-somethings all typing on laptops set up on white folding tables, surrounded by pizza boxes. At the front of the room, a screen shows dozens more joining via Zoom. This is a joint text banking event, co-hosted by Young Democrats of Georgia, Men4Choice and Reproductive Freedom for All.

For organizers like Jennings, the goal is to hold onto the wave of enthusiasm Harris' candidacy generated and use it to mobilize all Georgians. At this event, they sent about 64,000 texts, all aimed at a very specific group: men of color, 27 to 50 years old.

""The backbone of the Democratic Party is the Black vote, which is why the Republicans are heavily focused on Black men specifically,"" Jennings says. ""When we show up ... elections seem to kind of flip. And right now it's not 100% guaranteed that we're going to get all of the Black vote.""

Jennings is also acutely aware of how seemingly small moments can build momentum. He just took over as the Young Democrats president from Parker Short, who recently went viral for lip-syncing Kendrick Lamar at a Harris rally in Atlanta. Jennings says the group got a lot more inquiries from potential organizers after that.

Yet while the Harris-Walz campaign is leaning hard into online messaging, embracing memes and viral moments on platforms like TikTok, political science professor Bernard Fraga of Emory University says it may have its limits. It's one thing to have that support from young people online, he says, it's another to turn that into ballots.

""It still remains to be seen whether the Harris campaign can continue that momentum all the way into November and make sure that Gen Z and younger voters are mobilized and active participants in our democracy,"" he told NPR.

Outside of campaigning for either party, a swathe of nonpartisan groups operate in Georgia and are working to simply make sure young people are politically engaged.

Among them is Rise, a nonprofit organization specifically targeting Gen Z students. It recruits ambassadors and pays them $3 for every person they get to pledge to vote. We met Rise's Georgia organizers recently in an area of Atlanta that includes a number of HBCUs, like Morehouse, Spelman and Clark Atlanta University.

In a presentation to a group of college students interested in becoming ambassadors, Rise's leaders tell them to highlight issues that are likely to resonate.

""How many folks in here have been impacted by gun violence?"" asks Aunna Dennis, Rise's director of Georgia. Nearly every hand in the room goes up.

Dennis tells NPR the aim is to mobilize millions of young voters across the country, but specifically in Georgia.

""We got 12 million voters here in this area alone, we have over five million registered voters. And we can unleash the youth wave on each of these campus communities,"" she says. ""That's a win for us.""

Meanwhile, at Kennesaw State University, nonprofit Poder Latinx has come to campus for National Voter Registration day. On the campus lawn, organizers are handing out pins, stickers, drinks -- even bottles of Tajin -- waving students over to the tent and encouraging them to register. By the end of the day, 81 new voters had registered, taking the total to more than 1,100 since Poder Latinx started doing this in March.

One of the students that came by the table was 19-year-old Iambianze Jackson. She told us she is planning to vote for Harris this November, but is less than enthusiastic.

""She doesn't really explain her policies well,"" Jackson says. ""She mainly talks about tax cuts for the middle class but like, she doesn't really have policies.""

And then Jackson says something we heard from a few people in this battleground state: The election can't come fast enough.

""I'm ready for it to be over,"" Jackson says with a laugh. ""I'm ready for the results to come out so we can just proceed from there, whatever happens."""
"Dockworkers begin walking picket lines, risking to snarl East and Gulf Coast ports",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5133391/dockworkers-strike-east-gulf-coast-ports-shipping,2024-10-01T05:17:07Z,"BALTIMORE -- Union dockworkers along East Coast ports began walking picket lines early Tuesday, threatening to halt the movement of billions of dollars' worth of goods including furniture, paper, shoes, manufacturing components, farm machinery and much more.

Workers began forming picket lines outside of East Coast ports shortly after midnight, even though the International Longshoremen's Association had not yet released a statement. The pickets began just after midnight, after talks between the ILA and the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents ocean carriers and port operators, apparently failed to yield a new contract. Workers were seen picketing near the Dundalk Marine Terminal in Baltimore, Maryland.

The two sides have not met face-to-face since June. They appear to be far apart on key issues. The alliance asked for an extension Monday, a request that went unanswered by the union.

Despite pressure from House Republicans and more than 170 industry groups, who warned that a strike will have a devastating impact on the economy, the Biden administration is standing firm in its decision to let the collective bargaining process play out.

""I don't believe in Taft-Hartley,"" President Biden told reporters on Sunday, citing the federal law that allows the President to call for an 80-day cooling off period when the nation's safety is at risk.

How big an economic impact the strike will have depends on how long it lasts.

The strike affects work at 14 ports along the East and Gulf Coasts, according to the U.S. Maritime Alliance. They are the Ports of Boston, New York/New Jersey, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Norfolk, Wilmington, Charleston, Savannah, Jacksonville, Miami, Tampa, Mobile, New Orleans and Houston.

More than $2 billion worth of goods typically flow through these ports daily, from cars and clothing to bourbon and bananas.

That includes more than half of all cargo containers coming into the U.S., or about a million containers a month. It also includes more than three-quarters of the containers carrying exports out -- about 327,000 per month -- according to the freight-tracking company Vizion.

Those volumes dropped sharply in recent days in anticipation of the strike.

""If it goes on for weeks, it's going to be a massive headache,"" said Vizion CEO Kyle Henderson. ""If it's just days, it's probably just a blip.""

Trade groups warned in a letter to President Biden that an extended strike would have dire consequences for the U.S. economy.

""It is imperative that the parties return to the table without engaging in disruptive activities that could harm the economy and the millions of businesses, workers and consumers who rely on the seamless flow of goods, both imports and exports, through our East Coast and Gulf Coast ports,"" the groups' letter said.

The Distilled Spirits Council of the United States notes more than three-quarters of imported liquor typically flows through the affected ports, along with more than 40% of the American spirits sold overseas. Halting those shipments could be particularly costly in the run-up to the Christmas shopping season.

""Consumers love to buy your favorite bottle of American whiskey or scotch or Irish whiskey or cognac as holiday gifts,"" says Chris Swonger, the council's CEO. ""Even a day's strike could have repercussions along the line.""

Companies have made contingency plans to blunt some of the economic impact.

Ryan Petersen, CEO of Flexport, a freight forwarding company, says customers already have diverted cargo to the West Coast in anticipation of the work stoppage.

""Really starting at the beginning of the year, it became very clear that this was going to be a major issue,"" says Petersen.

In recent days, he says, Flexport's focus has been on getting cargo out, so as not to incur hefty fees for containers left at East and Gulf Coast ports, and shoring up operations at West Coast ports in anticipation of a surge of activity.

Goods that are already on ships headed to ports affected by the strike will just have to sit offshore until the strike is over, Petersen says.

""The reality is, there's only so much you can do,"" says Jeff Sloan of the American Chemistry Council, whose members rely heavily on ports along the Gulf Coast and in New Jersey and New York. ""For large volume materials like plastic resins, there's just no way to feasibly divert that to other ports or to ship it in some other way.""

Two major sticking points are wages and automation.

In a statement Monday, the U.S. Maritime Alliance says the two sides had traded counteroffers on wages in the past 24 hours.

The alliance said its latest offer would increase wages by nearly 50% and triple contributions to employee retirement plans.

The International Longshoremen's Association had rejected earlier offers, calling them ""stingy,"" given the shipping industry's massive profits in recent years.

""Even a $5.00 an hour increase in wages for each year of a six-year agreement only amounts to an average annual increase of approximately 9.98 percent,"" ILA President Harold Daggett said in a statement last week.

Wage increases under the last contract, signed in 2018, were far more modest, with only $1-an-hour increases in four of the six years, bringing the top hourly wage to $39.

Jobs at the ports have traditionally been among the best-paying blue-collar jobs in the country, often topping $100,000 a year. But Daggett says the port operators should pay workers more.

""When they made their most money was during Covid, when my men had to go to work on those piers every single day,"" he says in a video posted by the union. ""They died out there with the virus. We all got sick with the virus. We kept them going.""

On automation, Daggett has been warning dockworkers that the foreign companies that operate the ports are seeking to replace them with machines.

The U.S. Maritime Alliance has said it's offered to keep the current ban on fully automated equipment and the requirement that any use of semi-automated equipment be negotiated.

At ports around the world and even on the West Coast, advanced technology is already being used to move shipping containers.

But at East and Gulf Coast ports, the International Longshoremen's Association remains staunchly opposed.

How many jobs would be lost in a transition to automated terminals isn't entirely clear. The shipping industry, backed by researchers at UC Berkeley, argues that automation helps ports stay competitive and handle more goods, which in turn creates demand for highly skilled workers.

The Biden administration says it's encouraged all parties to keep negotiating and to do so in good faith.

On Friday, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg and Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su met with the shipping companies' representatives. They'd also ""been in touch"" with the dockworkers' union throughout last week, according to the White House.

It's clear the union has not been happy with Biden.

""Where's the president of the United States? He's not fighting for us,"" Daggett said in the union video posted in September.

The sharp rebuke came nearly four years after Daggett endorsed Biden in the 2020 election, citing his friendship and support while criticizing former President Trump for filling courts with anti-union judges and supporting so-called right-to-work laws, aimed at weakening unions.

In July, shortly after the first assassination attempt on Trump, Daggett posted a photo of himself with Trump, offered prayers on behalf of the union membership, and recalled ""a wonderful, productive 90-minute meeting"" at Mar-a-Lago with Trump in November 2023.

""I expressed to President Trump the threat of automation to American workers,"" he wrote. ""President Trump promised to support the ILA in its opposition to automated terminals in the U.S. Mr. Trump also listened to my concerns about Federal 'Right To Work' laws.""

While Biden and Vice President Harris have the support of the leaders of most labor unions, the same is not true for many rank-and-file union members.

In 2022, freight rail workers were deeply angry with Biden for signing a measure that imposed a contract on them, blocking a nationwide rail strike.

Now with dockworkers on strike and the presidential election five weeks away, the administration likely does not want to risk major blowback from labor groups."
Jen Psaki: The strategy behind Harris' untraditional media blitz,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/harris-interview-call-her-daddy-media-rcna174531,2024-10-08T20:55:56Z,"For weeks, Republicans have been hemming and hawing about how Vice President Kamala Harris is avoiding the press. Well, it seems they're going to have to find something else to complain about because Harris is in the middle of a media blitz.

On Monday, CBS' ""60 Minutes"" aired an in-depth interview with the vice president, which came a day after Harris appeared on the popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, hosted by Alex Cooper. On Tuesday, Harris' whirlwind day of media appearances includes ""The View"" on ABC, ""The Howard Stern Show"" on SiriusXM radio, and ""The Late Show With Stephen Colbert"" on CBS.

And yet, perhaps predictably, the more traditional, legacy Washington, D.C.-based media outlets are still spitting mad. Politico Playbook is complaining that ""Harris is ... still largely avoiding the media,"" noting ""Most of these are not the types of interviews that are going to press her on issues she may not want to talk about."" The New York Times also focused on the ""friendly"" nature of the interviews, stating the Harris campaign was ""unlikely to place her in front of many aggressive inquisitors.""

Let me give you a little insight into why traditional media is so upset about this. It's not because they think they reach more people; they don't. It's not because they're going to ask different questions than ""60 Minutes."" It's definitely not because they're going to ask more creative or outside-the-box questions than Cooper, the hosts of ""The View"" or Colbert. It's because their relevance relies on being the sole arbiters of asking the questions.

But the problem for them is that the way people consume information and the way the public looks for information have completely evolved -- and I don't say that lightly.

I stood at the front of the White House briefing room and answered questions from a room full of legacy, Washington-based journalists every day because I respect what they do and the role of the press. I also suffered through years of criticism for what was considered a less traditional media strategy, including when I was the communications director for President Barack Obama.

We did things that the traditional press did not deem hard-hitting or presidential enough. Like an interview with Bear Grylls to talk about climate change or an interview with Vice inside a prison to talk about criminal justice reform or, of course, the biggest violation: sitting down with Zach Galifianakis on ""Between Two Ferns"" to talk about health care. Now, I wish I could take credit for that one -- hats off to former Obama adviser Dan Pfeiffer -- because it drove hundreds of thousands of people to the online portal where they could sign up for affordable insurance plans.

My point is this: The job of a president is not to satisfy the demands of the major networks or the major daily newspapers. It's to connect with the people who may not be clicking refresh on WhiteHouse.gov or subscribing to any Washington insider newsletters.

And for a presidential candidate, especially when people are already voting, your job is to excite and engage more people to support your candidacy -- people who probably don't watch my show, frankly.

I'm not saying that press conferences or interviews with major networks are bad. They are all important parts of our democracy. But this notion that the only people capable of asking a presidential candidate a question are credentialed members of the White House press corps is, well, as insane as it sounds.

So, if you are the Harris campaign and you know there are no more debates, no more conventions, and have fewer than 30 days left to reach more voters, this plan makes a lot of sense. And right now, having a conversation with Alex Cooper, who has about 5 million listeners per episode, is far more valuable than any interview with a more traditional outlet, maybe even ""60 Minutes."""
Opinion | I'm a Republican strategist. Here's why Kamala Harris' campaign gives me confidence.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-campaign-election-close-race-rcna174311,2024-10-08T17:45:17Z,"The vice president has set herself up well but she'll need to finish strong.

There is no playbook for a three-month presidential campaign but, if there were, it would look like what Vice President Kamala Harris has done so far.

The closeness of the race has led some Monday-morning quarterbacks to argue that the problem is Harris has not done enough interviews. She has actually done quite a few, including tough ones with CNN's Dana Bash, the National Association of Black Journalists and ""60 Minutes""; and less hard-hitting ones with local news outlets in swing states and popular podcasts targeted at key demographics, such as Hispanics and young women.

Still, this complaint has circulated enough through the news and social media, the Harris campaign has scheduled more national media interviews for her and her running mate, Tim Walz, who even went on ""Fox News Sunday.""

It's possible that these interviews may help sway the sliver of undecided voters who are still looking for a sign. At the least, they may keep the pundits and pontificators at bay, especially if they prove to be uneventful. At a minimum, it's another chance for Harris to get her message out in the final weeks of the campaign.

But let's be clear: This is not how the race will be won. The campaign has internal polling that shows much more than the publicly available polls what the head-to-head race looks like, which voters are still gettable and what messages are motivating them. It has behind-the-scenes efforts to reach out to supporters by email, text message, social media, phone calls and knocking on doors. And it has millions of dollars in ads rolling out daily.

What the public and the press see of a campaign are just the tip of the iceberg. And in my 35 years of experience as a strategist, I've learned that things look much different on the inside. A campaign is like a marriage; you never really know what's going on unless you're in it. And while I don't know what it's like inside the Harris headquarters any more than the next pundit, the way the campaign has gone so far gives me confidence in how things are going there."
A new foreign policy dividing line emerges in Republican politics,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/new-foreign-policy-dividing-line-emerges-republican-politics-rcna174507,2024-10-08T16:49:53Z,"As Donald Trump and JD Vance celebrate Hungary's Viktor Orbán, a growing number of Republican senators are pushing back in the opposite direction.

In last month's presidential debate, Kamala Harris bested her Republican rival on a variety of fronts, but one point seemed especially brutal. ""I have traveled the world as vice president of the United States,"" the Democratic nominee said, ""and world leaders are laughing at Donald Trump.""

Given a chance to respond, Trump clung to a curious defense. ""Let me just tell you about world leaders,"" he replied. ""Viktor Orbán, one of the most respected men -- they call him a strongman. He's a tough person. Smart. Prime minister of Hungary.""

In other words, the former president wanted to present proof that he wasn't an international laughingstock, and he immediately touted the support he's received from Orbán -- a Russia-aligned leader who's aggressively chipped away at Hungary's democracy.

Trump's rhetoric was not, however, surprising: The Republican has spent months turning to Orbán for validation, publicly celebrating him, having private conversations with the Hungarian, and even welcoming Orbán to Mar-a-Lago. The more the prime minister's authoritarian takeover of his country generated international outrage, the more Trump extended his over-the-top support to the prime minister.

His running mate has made similar comments. As recently as May, for example, Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio appeared on CBS and said the United States ""could learn from"" Orbán when it comes to targeting universities. (It fell to ""Face the Nation"" host Margaret Brennan to remind the senator that the Hungarian strongman has ""seized control of state universities"" and put them under the control of foundations run by his allies.)

But as unsettling as the GOP ticket's embrace of Orbán is, it would be a mistake to assume the entirety of the party is aligned with the prime minister. The Hill reported over the weekend:

The five Republican signatories were Arkansas' John Boozman, Maine's Susan Collins, Texas' John Cornyn, North Dakota's John Hoeven, and Kansas' Jerry Moran.

The joint statement was no doubt well received by Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, who's gone to extraordinary lengths to try to drag his party away from Orbán.

It was five months ago, for example, when the Kentucky Republican, still hoping to salvage what remains of the GOP's traditional foreign policy vision, condemned Orbán and urged fellow conservatives to reject the far-right strongman. McConnell pushed the same line in July, reminding his party that Orbán is ""completely in bed with the Chinese and the Russians.""

A few weeks ago, the Senate Republican reiterated the message, declaring, ""I've spoken before about Hungary's decadelong drift into the orbit of the West's most determined adversaries. It's an alarming trend. And nobody -- certainly not the American conservatives who increasingly form a cult of personality around Prime Minister Viktor Orbán -- can pretend not to see it.""

The letter from five senior GOP senators last week suggests McConnell has allies within his party on the issue, but it's clear that Trump and Vance are pushing in the opposite direction. Indeed, the more Orbán's Republican critics denounce the Hungarian's Russian ties and hostility toward democracy, the more one wonders whether Trump sees the criticisms as praise.

Either way, those looking for meaningful divisions in the Republican Party's vision for the near future should start here."
"Trump, Vance and Musk push lies about immigration app CBP One",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/cbp-one-app-trump-vance-musk-rcna174400,2024-10-08T13:51:49Z,"Donald Trump, JD Vance and Elon Musk have spread lies about the U.S. Customs and Border Protection app. Here are the facts.

Donald Trump and the Republican Party are spreading lies about a mobile app used to assist migrants -- and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection -- with the asylum process.

The latest lies align with the Trump campaign's racist fearmongering about migrants weeks out from the election.

During his debate against Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz last week, Trump's running mate, JD Vance, made the following absurd claim:

Trump made a similar claim in Wisconsin last week:

Trump has referred to the CBP One app as ""the Kamala phone app for smuggling illegals,"" but the app was actually launched during his administration. And tech billionaire Elon Musk, who is no stranger to peddling conspiracy theories, claimed last week that ""it takes less than 5 minutes and zero documentation to get approved"" for entry into the United States using the CBP One app.

All of these assertions are flat-out lies. As The Verge explained, the true nature of the app is almost the polar opposite of what Trump and Vance have claimed. The outlet reported:

In other words, the suggestion that the CBP One app is aiding migrants' unfettered entry into the U.S. would be a surprise to the hundreds of thousands of migrants who've used the app. In reality, many migrants have complained about glitches and other malfunctions on the app that have caused delays in the asylum-seeking process. Migrant rights activists have denounced the app's collection of biometric data belonging to the migrants who use it. And Haitian and African migrants, whom Trump and Vance have demonized, have claimed the app's facial recognition software has impeded their immigration process because of its failures to detect darker skin tones.

In the name of stoking anti-immigrant invective, Trump and Vance are filling the MAGA trough with putrid lies and telling their followers to eat up."
Harris turns Trump's Helene lies into election-season scandal,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/harris-turns-trumps-helene-lies-election-season-scandal-rcna174446,2024-10-08T13:26:14Z,"The consequences of Trump's duplicity are real: As my MSNBC colleague Clarissa-Jan Lim explained, officials have said that the election-season lies and conspiracy theories ""are hindering relief efforts,"" while forcing agencies to waste time and resources combatting lies that too many people are falling for.

Vice President Kamala Harris, who started the week with an on-the-ground visit to North Carolina, has started pushing back against her GOP rival in earnest. NBC News reported:

""It's extraordinarily irresponsible,"" the Democratic nominee said, adding in reference to Trump, ""It's about him; it's not about you.""

It was an important point. For months, at the heart of the Democratic Party's election-season messaging was a straightforward condemnation of the former president: Trump's only priority is what's best for Trump. Period. Full stop.

It's against this backdrop that the Republican saw devastated communities and human suffering, which apparently led him to see a political opportunity: If he repeatedly lied about the heartbreaking circumstances, Trump concluded, it might benefit his campaign.

The whole idea behind so-called ""October Surprises"" is that there are sometimes unexpected developments that jolt the public conversation in the runup to Election Day and affect the results. Except, in 2024, Trump has arguably imposed an October Surprise on himself: With four weeks remaining, the Republican Party's presidential nominee got caught trying to exploit human suffering, lying about a deadly natural disaster to advance his own interests.

As it turns out, we have a word in American politics for situations like these. That word is ""scandal."" Trump actions -- drawing fresh attention to his lack of integrity and character -- deserve to be seen and characterized as scandalous.

Making matters worse, these developments also offer a timely reminder that Trump's own record related to responding to disasters is abysmal -- a point the Harris campaign hopes to drive home in a hard-hitting new television ad."
Opinion | The GOP is feeling the stress of Trump's anti-early voting stance,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-early-voting-election-day-rcna174284,2024-10-08T10:47:23Z,"Between disparaging early voting and cutting get-out-the-vote efforts, Donald Trump is making it harder to pull out a win in November.

The polls still show Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump in a close race both nationally and in most swing states. With the results likely falling on a knife's edge, the deciding factor may well be which side is best able to drive voters to the polls. But if that's the case, Republicans are acting at a disadvantage that can only be ascribed to Trump himself.

Modern elections are more of an ""election month"" in many states, with early voting and mail-in ballots offering opportunities to cast votes long before Election Day. This was previously a nonpartisan issue, but things have been thrown into disarray for Republicans since Trump's 2020 re-election campaign. Democratic-led states in particular had moved to set up more ballot drop boxes, pre-emptively send out mail-in ballot request forms and otherwise help people vote safely in the middle of a pandemic.

Naturally, Trump quickly began falsely claiming that mail-in voting leads to mass voter fraud, a claim that formed the backbone of his attempts to overturn his loss that year and soured many of his supporters on early voting. No such mass fraud has ever been discovered, but that hasn't stopped Trump from periodically returning to the matter. There are times when he's managed to stop promoting conspiracy theories long enough to praise early voting -- but he always returns to old habits soon enough. Just two weeks ago, he told a crowd in Pennsylvania, a state he needs to win, that early voting is ""stupid.""

Republicans have begun to realize how much Trump's rhetoric is impeding their efforts to stockpile votes before polls open next month. ""The whole idea behind absentee voting is you're banking that vote, you've got that person, you know they're going to vote for you, you get them off the list,"" Republican strategist Mark Graul recently told Politico. ""This is how you get the extra 5,000, 10,000 votes that may decide the election.""

Rather than heed that advice, the Trump campaign and the Republican National Committee have focused on Election Day. An increased reliance on day-of turnout would be a risk any year, but especially given how Trump has bound the RNC's hands ahead of this election. Upon becoming the nominee this year, Trump decreed that the GOP should invest less in traditional get-out-the-vote efforts in favor of more ""election integrity"" programs.

The resulting cuts have led to outsourcing most turnout programs to outside groups, taking advantage of newly revised Federal Election Commission rules that allow increased cooperation between campaigns and super PACs. Those outside groups haven't exactly been impressive in their efforts, leading some battleground Republicans to question how effective they'll actually prove at getting people to the polls. For example, Turning Point USA, the group run by conservative activist Charlie Kirk, has told Semafor that its lofty goals for voter outreach had been narrowed to mostly focus on Arizona and Wisconsin.

The Elon Musk-backed group America PAC has shown the most promise so far, hiring veteran GOP operatives and spending more than $50 million on voter engagement this cycle. That money has gone into hiring hundreds of canvassers in swing states like Michigan and North Carolina. America PAC also on Monday put even more of Musk's money on the table, promising $47 for each registered voter recruited to sign a petition pledging support for the First and Second amendments, building out the group's engagement lists.

The Trump campaign, for its part, points to the unpaid ""Trump 47 Captains"" it's recruiting to prove it isn't fully giving up the GOTV game. ""Each volunteer initially receives a list of 10 neighbors to mobilize,"" The Guardian's Hugo Lowell wrote about the program, which offers campaign merchandise to those who hit their goals. ""If they meet that target, the next tier involves canvassing 24 out of 50 likely Trump voters, followed by canvassing 45 out of 100 voters, with new perks at each tier."" (If that sounds like the same framework as a multilevel marketing scam to you, don't worry, I'm right there with you.)

It's an idea also being pushed on a website called 10xVotes, which encourages conservatives to ""find 10 friends who don't vote."" The site, which is available in a few swing states, including Michigan and Arizona, appears to draw from voting records to allow users to search for registered Republicans nearby to ""claim"" for contact. It's unclear who exactly owns 10xVotes, which has been pushed by the likes of former Fox News host Tucker Carlson and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon's ""War Room"" podcast.

The Trump campaign appears to be working off a theory wherein if it can't win over the swing voters that Harris is also courting, it can draw out the sort of ""low propensity voters"" who propelled him to office in 2016 -- for example, the cringeworthy push to court young, white males, the kind who feel disaffected but love the hypermasculinity offered on right-wing podcasts and in the MMA ring. One major issue with that strategy: These are also exactly the voters who can't be counted on to turn out on Election Day without frequent contact.

Taken together, Republican operatives aren't feeling especially confident about the ground game that's in place in key states. As National Review's Noah Rothman has noted, the efforts are looking more like 2012 GOP candidate Mitt Romney's doomed initiative than President Barack Obama's dominant GOTV program that year. Other candidates might be thinking about shifting where their funds are going to offset those worries.

Not Trump, though, not when he's ready to blame a failure to win enough votes on what Axios described as a ""detailed catalog of excuses for rejecting the results of the 2024 election -- if he loses."" The guarantee that this will be his response to a loss helps explain his overall nonchalance about getting people to their polling places. After all, it's much easier (and cheaper) to try to throw out Democratic votes than bother paying people to knock on doors."
Trump-supporting billionaires are enabling his white supremacist rantings,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-backing-billionaires-enabling-white-supremacy-rcna174186,2024-10-08T00:54:52Z,"Some of Trump's wealthiest backers say they like his economic policies, so they keep quiet about his racism and xenophobia.

According to polls, the top issue in this year's presidential race is inflation/the economy. But at Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump's rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, last week, there was just about no applause when he stated, ""We will end inflation and make America affordable again. We're going to get the prices down."" When did his audience explode with energy? When Trump gave them lines targeting immigrants, like ""On day one of my new administration, the invasion ends and the deportations begin. We get them out."" And, speaking of Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris, ""Do you trust her to stop the invasion?"" In response, the crowd loudly chanted, ""We need Trump! We need Trump!""

Regardless of what the polls say the top issue is, Trump knows that his rallygoers get most excited when he gives voice to white supremacy. Two weeks ago, at another rally in Pennsylvania, Trump claimed Black migrants were destroying the character of Springfield, Ohio, and then declared, ""You have to get them the hell out. You have to get them out!"" In response, the crowd delivered a bone-chilling chant: ""Send them back! Send them back!""

Over the weekend, Trump told Wisconsin voters that he ""will liberate Wisconsin and our entire nation from this mass migration invasion of murderers, child predators, drug dealers, gang members and thugs."" The facts don't back up Trump's claims of a migrant crime wave. (As Frank Figliuzzi noted in an MSNBC column Sunday, the feds just made a huge bust of a white supremacist gang trafficking in fentanyl.) But Trump doesn't care about facts. He cares about scaring his predominantly white base and then persuading it to see him as the guardian of white America.

We know exactly which immigrants Trump is talking about given his long history of demonizing Latino immigrants and the comments he made when he was president, when he referred to Black nations such as Haiti as ""shithole countries."" His supporters know that when Trump promises ""mass deportation"" -- one of the themes of this year's Republican National Convention -- he means Black and brown people.

Everyone understands what Trump is about. But for too long there has been a tendency to excuse Trump's wealthy supporters -- like Elon Musk, who appeared at Trump's rally on Saturday -- as being on the Trump train only for the tax cuts or other financial gain -- as Trump has explicitly promised them at big-ticket fundraisers. However, these wealthy and often well-educated people see the same headlines we do. They should understand that the most visible part of Trump's campaign is racism, and it's long past time they are called out for enabling Trump's racist agenda.

As Forbes magazine detailed in its article on Trump's top billionaires, some are outspoken, while some support Trump for unspecified reasons.

Billionaire hedge fund manager Bill Ackman, who posted after Jan. 6 attack that Trump should ""resign and apologize to all Americans,"" changed his tune in July when he announced he would endorse Trump. At the time Ackman wrote on social media, ""We are in the midst of a perilous moment for our democracy."" (Seeing Trump, who is facing criminal charges for attempting a coup and called for the ""termination"" of the Constitution, as a guardian of democracy is laughable.)

New York Jets owner Robert ""Woody"" Johnson said this year on Fox News that he is backing Trump again because ""Americans remember how good it was or how much better it was on the border and inflation and gas prices and grocery prices, all that, during the Trump administration, and they want to get back there."" The Winklevoss twins, famously depicted in the film ""The Social Network,"" about the founding of Facebook, donated more than $1 million each to support Trump, citing Trump's ""Pro-Bitcoin Pro-Crypto Pro-Business"" position.

But every one of these billionaires is telling us that in exchange for the policy goals they want, they are on board with or at least comfortable with Trump's bigotry. After all, if racism were a deal-breaker for them, would they still be funding his 2024 campaign?

Others, like Musk, though, appear to be more openly on board with Trump's extremist agenda. Musk has peddled the same types of bigoted attacks Trump has about Black migrants in Ohio, demonized DEI programs while suggesting white people are inherently smarter than Black people. And Ackman has been vocally critical of DEI programs with posts on X such as ""DEI is inherently a racist and illegal movement in its implementation even if it purports to work on behalf of the so-called oppressed.""

Trump has become the head cheerleader for white victimhood and the defender of symbols of white power. This explains why on Friday he told supporters at an event in North Carolina he would rename the local military base to again honor the slave-owning Confederate Gen. Braxton Bragg, who, as part of the Confederacy, fought to preserve chattel slavery.

""Should we change the name Fort Liberty back to Fort Bragg?!"" Trump asked, and the crowd exploded with cheers. (The name of that base, like others that honored Confederates, was changed in 2020 when Congress overrode Trump's veto of the bill.) Trump vowed that if wins, he is ""doing it."" This syncs up perfectly with Trump's defense of monuments honoring white supremacy as ""beautiful"" when he was president.

Those who claim that they're supporting Trump for his promises of tax cuts or deregulation don't get a pass when he's using such racist language and promising to carry out racist policies. If a candidate campaigning on white supremacy is elected to the presidency again, they won't be able to evade accountability with the claim that that's not why they supported him.

""I think there is a definite anti-white feeling in this country,"" Trump told Time magazine in April. He is reportedly planning a second-term overhaul of anti-discrimination law that his allies say would ""dramatically change the government's interpretation of Civil Rights-era laws to focus on 'anti-white racism' rather than discrimination against people of color."" And as the American Civil Liberties Union has recently warned -- citing the mandates of Project 2025 -- if Trump wins there will be a dismantling of diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) programs because he and his supporters have characterized them as ""anti-white racism."" Indeed, 84% of his supporters are worried about ""anti-white"" discrimination.

Trump isn't hiding his bigotry. In fact, it's the cornerstone of his campaign. And if he's returned to office, then everybody who helped him get there is responsible: those who voted for him because of the white supremacy and those who say they had other reasons but didn't treat the white supremacy as disqualifying."
Harris attacked MAGA misogyny head-on in 'Call Her Daddy' interview,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-interview-alex-cooper-rcna174337,2024-10-07T21:05:54Z,"The Democratic presidential hopeful's appearance on the popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast was a clear rebuttal to Donald Trump and the MAGA movement. And Harris pulled no punches.

Kamala Harris sat for an interview on the popular podcast ""Call Her Daddy,"" for an episode that was released over the weekend. The podcast, helmed by host Alex Cooper, is known for being particularly popular with young women.

The interview was part of the Democratic presidential campaign's ongoing strategy of using sit-downs with nontraditional media sources to spread its messaging to targeted groups. Harris recently did an interview on ""All the Smoke,"" a sports-focused podcast known for its popularity among men of color. On Tuesday, she will be interviewed by Howard Stern, a longtime shock jock with a large male audience.

Trump also has gone on a tour of nontraditional media, though his podcast-heavy schedule has seemed structured almost entirely to shore up his support with men (albeit in some pretty juvenile ways). Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview was the antithesis of that.

Where Trump and his movement have embraced the chauvinism of the 19th and 20th century and obsessed over ""tradwives"" -- women defined by their roles as homemakers and caretakers -- the Democratic candidate spoke to the podcast's massive audience of women and encouraged them to define themselves.

Harris said her mom had taught her and her sister ""the importance of us being able to express how we were feeling,"" that they ""had agency"" in how their lives played out, and that they ought to ""figure out how you can take charge of a moment.""

When Cooper asked Harris about Trump's thinly veiled sexist attacks, in which he has called her ""crazy, weak, fake and dumb,"" the VP replied: ""I think it's really important not to let other people define you.""

At one point, the conversation shifted to the crisis of domestic and sexual violence against women. Cooper said many of her listeners have described the shame and the terror they feel about coming forward, but Harris -- a former prosecutor -- told listeners not to ""quietly suffer"" and advised them to ""tell someone that you trust.""

And when Cooper asked about how we can make the country safer for women, Harris did an effective job of explaining how women's economic independence factors into the equation. She said:

This narrative about empowering women economically runs counter to the GOP's attack on diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives that can assist women in the workplace.

Harris also spoke about the impact of abortion bans, describing the harrowing reality of women who are forced to travel out of state to receive reproductive care -- assuming they even have the money and means to do so.

And she attacked conservatives' arcane view of women when asked to address Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders' claim that Harris ""doesn't have anything keeping her humble"" because she does not have biological children. (The vice president, of course, has two stepchildren.)

""I don't think she understands that there are a whole lot of women out here who, one, are not aspiring to be humble,"" Harris said of Sanders. ""Two, a whole lot of women out here who have a lot of love in their life, family in their life and children in their life, and I think it's really important for women to lift each other up.""

The interview was essentially a message to young women that they don't have to accept the MAGA movement's restrictive roles for them -- and that the Harris campaign supports them leading more self-determined lives."
"On crime fighting, Trump flunks another test of self-awareness",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/crime-fighting-trump-flunks-another-test-self-awareness-rcna173709,2024-10-07T10:31:12Z,"As Donald Trump pitches himself as a ""crime fighter,"" the election-season message might be more effective were it not for the Republican's rap sheet.

A couple of months ago, Donald Trump complained that Americans are ""living in a Pro Criminal Atmosphere."" Around the same time, he declared with confidence, ""You're not going to teach a criminal not to be a criminal."" A day later, the former president echoed the line at an unrelated event.

""A criminal is a criminal,"" the Republican nominee said. ""They generally stay a criminal, and we do not have time to figure it out.""

About a month later, the GOP candidate's campaign spokesperson said he ""believes anyone convicted of a crime should spend time behind bars.""

Evidently, Trump and his team aren't quite done failing this rather obvious test of self-awareness. At an event in Milwaukee, for example, the GOP candidate claimed, ""Kamala [Harris] and Joe [Biden] are crime creators. We are crime fighters.""

Hours earlier, the former president pushed the same line via his social media platform, except he put the message in all-capital letters and added an exclamation point (he loves exclamation points).

All of this might be a more effective election season pitch if Trump weren't a criminal.

This need not be complicated. As recently as May, a jury found Trump guilty of 34 felonies. This is not to be confused with a different jury finding Trump liable for sexual abuse or the case in which a court found that Trump oversaw a business that engaged in systemic fraud.

He's also still facing several dozen other pending felony counts, across multiple jurisdictions. (He has pleaded not guilty.)

What's more, the former president has also surrounded himself with other criminals. ""With Lincoln, they had a team of rivals,"" presidential historian Douglas Brinkley recently noted. ""With Trump, you have a team of felons.""

In case that weren't quite enough, during his failed presidency, Trump had a habit of issuing scandalous pardons to politically aligned criminals. And if elected to a second term, the Republican has promised to issue even more pardons to politically aligned criminals, including those who violently clashed with police officers.

With this in mind, as the former president boasts that he and his team ""are crime fighters,"" it's probably worth reminding the Republican operation that a little self-awareness goes a long way."
Opinion | MAGA-friendly centrists are yada yada-ing over Trump's threats,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-politically-tribeless-maga-centrists-yada-rcna174109,2024-10-06T11:49:30Z,"Even after everything that's happened (and could happen), a lot of ""politically tribeless"" commentators are still making excuses for Trump.

In a classic ""Seinfeld"" episode, George Costanza's new girlfriend abbreviates her dialogue by saying ""yada yada yada,"" often eliding the most pertinent parts of a story. George adopts the habit, too, and he and his girlfriend end up yada yada-ing over ""little"" details like criminality and an untimely death. It's hilarious and patently absurd -- the conversational equivalent of burying the lede in journalism.

This is what a lot of self-identified heterodox political commentators do when they talk about former President Donald Trump. You can see it often on ""Real Time With Bill Maher"" panels, hear it on any number of ""politically homeless"" podcasts or read it daily on scores of Substack sites. These ostensible independents view ""the establishment"" -- which includes everything from centrist Democrats to anti-Trump conservatives to non-right-wing media -- as the true threat to freedom and the American way. They might concede Trump's vulgarity is distasteful or that he's sometimes incompetent and often incoherent, but when it comes to confronting his incorrigible criminality, corruption, racism and misogyny, and his relentless dishonesty on matters both trivial and existential, they typically yada yada past the gory details and pivot into pathological whataboutism and both-sidesism.

In just the past 30 days, Trump has helped whip up a racist, xenophobic furor against Haitian immigrants in Ohio based on lies; suggested that people who criticize Supreme Court justices should be imprisoned; and mused that police should be allowed free rein to commit wanton violence on retail thieves over the course of ""one real rough, nasty"" day. I could list so many more of his outrageous, inexcusable words and deeds, but it wouldn't matter.

Yada yada to all that, Trump's useful centrists will argue. Only the humorless, Trump Derangement Syndrome-afflicted could possibly take the former president's rhetoric seriously: ""That's just Trump being Trump, shooting from the hip, flying off the handle, being funny in his uniquely Trumpian way that triggers the hated establishment.""

Last week, Judge Tanya Chutkan released special counsel Jack Smith's 165-page brief laying out evidence that he says shows Trump's attempt to overturn the 2020 election was a private matter and not in the capacity of a sitting president. (The Supreme Court ruled this summer that a president acting in his or her capacity as president is essentially immune from prosecution.) It's all there: Trump knew he lost the election very early, but Smith's filing says he engaged in numerous criminal acts to overturn it anyway. Smith's brief says he also encouraged the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot, refused pleas from his own staff to call for calm, and after being told by an aide that Vice President Mike Pence's life was in danger thanks to his own instigations, he reportedly replied, ""So what?""

As I've previously written, if Trump hadn't ever given his riot-inciting speech on the Ellipse on Jan. 6, he still attempted a self-coup through alleged fraud, intimidation and threats of violence. But high-profile MAGA-adjacent ""independents"" have spent the past four years yada yada-ing away the whole thing as an unfortunate and brief act of mob violence. Some have even suggested it might have actually been a trap laid by Democrats.

So don't expect to hear anything louder than throat clearing about the Smith brief (if even that) from Trump's useful centrists. They're still having a fit over Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz's stupid, discrediting lie about being in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests (he was most likely in Nebraska at the time).

As someone who is actually without a political tribe -- in that I don't neatly fit into any ideological box and feel no need to carry water for either party -- I've concluded that Trump is, by leaps and bounds, the greater threat to American democracy and rationality.

And yet, I still say go ahead and nail Walz on his lies. Make him squirm. Hold Vice President Kamala Harris' feet to the fire on any of her untrue or misleading statements, too. Make all power-hungry politicians feel uncomfortably accountable when they mislead the public.

And then look back at Trump. On the ledger of politicians' falsehoods, do statements like Walz's mistruths about whether he was in China 35 years ago (he claims he ""misspoke"") even remotely measure up to Trump's attempted self-coup or his racist incitements against immigrants?

At the vice presidential debate last week, Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, refused to answer the direct question of who won the 2020 election. You'd think a true political independent -- no matter how much they're triggered by the ""woke"" or the ""establishment"" -- would see Vance's nonanswer as a craven cop-out, given how thoroughly adjudicated the legitimacy of the 2020 election has already been. But not if you're Free Press columnist Abigail Shrier, who lamented during the debate, ""Dear Lord, more January 6 questions?!""

Heaven forfend a candidate for the second-highest office in the land, whose running mate tried to steal the previous election, be asked about it. We nonpartisans really ought to just move on, I guess.

Many anti-anti-Trumpers yada yada'd through 2022's Jan. 6 Committee hearings -- where remarkable video evidence and testimony from ex-Trump White House officials (including Trump's own daughter) and other Republicans laid bare Trump's grand conspiracy to overturn a free and fair election. Trump and his allies have also spent the past four years plotting to do it again -- and thanks to state-level election overhauls and a sympathetic judiciary, they're much better equipped to do so now. Also poisoning the discourse are pro-Trump billionaires like Elon Musk and Peter Thiel, who publicly spread the fiction that Democrats are cheating -- already, they say -- to win the 2024 election. Axios recently reported, ""Through public remarks, Truth Social screeds and more than 100 preemptive lawsuits, Donald Trump is assembling a detailed catalog of excuses for rejecting the results of the 2024 election -- if he loses.""

Yada yada yada, Walz lied about parts of his biography.

I used to think Trump-sympathetic nonpartisans suffered from a failure of imagination. Ever since Trump's escalator descent in 2015, warnings that Trump could do unthinkable things (like try to steal an election he lost, then preemptively discredit the next one) have been dismissed as the panicked bleatings of basic establishment Chicken Littles.

But Trump is a known quantity in 2024. He was president. He's been the GOP nominee three consecutive times. He's been convicted of felonies and found liable for sexual abuse. He's threatening to use the Department of Justice to jail his political rivals.

At what point do Trump-sympathetic independents think it's OK to take Trump at his word when he promises to do horrible things -- like once again pre-emptively attempting to overturn an election based on nothing?

To be clear, I'm not here to police anyone's political preferences. It's perfectly respectable to be a nonpartisan who thinks Harris and Democrats are worse. But you can't credibly make the case that Dems are worse by blithely waving away Trump's most egregious offenses.

I've unequivocally criticized left-wing excesses and liberal threats of censorship, as well as Biden's and Harris' records. And yet, I'm reminded of the late legendary libertarian humorist P.J. O'Rourke, who despite leaning right his entire adult life, explained his vote for Hillary Clinton over Trump in 2016 on the basis that ""she's wrong about absolutely everything, but she's wrong within normal parameters.""

Yes, you can reject political tribalism and still choose a side in an election. But if your criticisms of Trump, MAGA and Republicans are rare, trivial and half-hearted -- and you denounce Trump opponents (including those exiled from the center and the right) as TDS-afflicted liberals -- you're not politically tribeless and you're not fearlessly independent. You've got a tribe; it's Trump's, and you're a reputation sanitizer for his presidential campaign."
Trump's conspiracy theories about Hurricane Helene are hurting relief efforts,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-hurricane-helene-conspiracy-theories-relief-rcna174141,2024-10-05T19:21:05Z,"The spread of misinformation about the storm's aftermath has been staggering, in large part due to the Republican presidential nominee's attempts to politicize the disaster.

As emergency relief agencies scramble to respond to the devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene, Donald Trump and his allies have pushed conspiracy theories about the federal response that officials have warned are hindering relief efforts.

""STOP this conspiracy theory junk that is floating all over Facebook and the internet about the floods,"" North Carolina state Sen. Kevin Corbin, a Republican, wrote in a post on Facebook. ""Example: FEMA is stealing money from donations, body bags ordered but government has denied, bodies not being buried, government is controlling the weather from Antarctica, government is trying to get lithium from WNC, stacks of bodies left at hospitals, and on and on and on ... It is just a distraction to people trying to do their job.""

The spread of misinformation about Helene has been staggering, in large part due to the Republican presidential nominee's attempts to politicize the disaster. In the past week, Trump has falsely claimed that the Federal Emergency Management Agency has no money for disaster relief because its funds were spent on ""illegal migrants,"" and that Vice President Kamala Harris ""stole"" FEMA funds for undocumented immigrants to encourage them to vote for Democrats. He baselessly accused the administration of ""going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas"" -- a move he himself was reported to have considered as president, due to the state's Democratic leanings, after wildfires devastated California in 2018. Trump also claimed that President Joe Biden had not spoken to Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia, one of the hardest-hit states, an assertion that Kemp himself disputed.

Those lies have been amplified by the likes of billionaire Elon Musk, professional conspiracy theorist Alex Jones and the scandal-plagued GOP nominee for North Carolina governor, Mark Robinson. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., a staunch Trump ally, also alluded to a ludicrous conspiracy theory that Hurricane Helene was a man-made weather event -- a claim rooted in antisemitic conspiracy theories, as my colleague Ja'han Jones has pointed out -- in a purported attempt to influence the election against Republicans.

Disaster relief organizations and lawmakers from Trump's own party are urging people to stop spreading unsubstantiated rumors about relief efforts. The American Red Cross issued a statement disputing false claims about its response, saying such misinformation ""disrupts our ability to deliver critical aid and affects the disaster workers who have put their own lives on hold to assist those in need."" FEMA even resorted to launching a misinformation page on its website to debunk rumors about its Helene response.

The White House slammed the conspiracy theories about Helene recovery efforts in a memo on Friday, saying that Republicans are spreading ""bald-faced lies"" and using the tragedy ""to lie and divide us."""
Opinion | An awful lie about Haitian migrants led to this threat against citizens far away,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/ohio-sheriff-kamala-harris-yard-signs-rcna172572,2024-10-05T11:59:10Z,"There appears to be a campaign among some conservatives to bully everybody else into political inactivity or silence.

The hateful lie pushed by Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, that Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio, were eating their neighbors' pets not only endangered those migrants, it also led to an Ohio sheriff three hours away threatening citizens who show support for the Democratic presidential nominee, Vice President Kamala Harris.

In a Sept. 13 Facebook post that he later claimed ""may have been a little misinterpreted,"" Portage County Sheriff Bruce Zuchowski suggested tracking ""all the addresses of the people who had [Harris] signs in their yards"" so that ""when the Illegal human 'Locust' (which she supports!) Need places to live...We'll already have the addresses of their New families...who supported their arrival!""

There's no misinterpreting the racism in that post, described to me by the county's NAACP president as ""vile and egregious."" There's no excusing the lie from the sheriff that Springfield's Haitians -- who are there as part of a federal humanitarian program for migrants -- are here illegally. On top of that, referring to human beings as pests (ravenous pests, at that) has preceded too many global atrocities for Zuchowski's hateful statements to be excused.

And that's before we get to heart of the matter, which is that Zuchowski veered into unconstitutional territory with the suggestion that residents lawfully expressing a political opinion warrant law enforcement's attention. Zuchowski's defense -- that he has a ""First Amendment right"" to post what he did -- is doubly offensive. His status as a public servant ought to come before his desire to express his opinion, and his post made his constituents afraid their government would be monitoring their constitutionally protected expression of speech.

Zuchowski, who has declined to speak to NBC News and multiple media outlets, took down his post after the Portage County NAACP and the League of Women Voters complained to the Ohio secretary of state, and as the Ohio ACLU was gearing up to sue him. But if Zuchowski succeeded in making people afraid that he and his deputies are watching their political activity, it seems unlikely that his deleting the post is enough to make them breathe easy.

On its face, the story out of Portage County, where I happen to have multiple loved ones who vote, is evidence that a malignant lie about an innocent immigrant population metastasized into a threat against innocent citizens hours away. But it's also part of what appears to be a larger campaign from conservatives to bully everybody else into political inactivity or silence.

In Florida, voters who signed a petition that put that state's abortion referendum on the ballot cried foul at being questioned by Gov. Ron DeSantis' election police unit. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton executed search warrants against members of the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), one of America's oldest Latino civil rights groups, about two weeks after LULAC endorsed Harris' presidential campaign. He says he was investigating ""allegations of election fraud and vote harvesting"" in 2022. The Republican National Committee's so-called ""Protect the Vote"" project aims to recruit people from the suburbs to monitor the polls in urban Democratic strongholds, which it has falsely declared are hotbeds of voting fraud.

""I've never felt less protected and more scared than I do right now,"" a resident of Ravenna, Ohio, wrote Ohio Attorney General Dave Yost, according to the Akron Beacon Journal. At least 59 residents complained to Yost's office, the paper reported. Zuchowski ""has made me feel unsafe in my home of 24 years,"" a Kent resident said.

Portage County NAACP President Renee Romine said at the emergency meeting her organization held about Zuchowski's post that there were ""people almost in tears"" and ""not wanting to go to the voting polls"" because Zuchowki's office provides security for in-person absentee voting. ""People did not even want to go and vote if they were going to be there.""

The county's board of elections voted to remove the sheriff's office from that security role, which Romine described as a ""big win for the people."" But to Freda Levenson, the legal director of the ACLU of Ohio, the win was Zuchowski removing the offending post.

""We were going to ask a federal judge to make him take down his post. So as soon as he took down his post, we no longer had anything to ask for,"" she said. ""He backed down, which is what we wanted. Not just what we wanted, it's what the Constitution required him to do.""

But what the ACLU counts as a win may be cold comfort to Portage County voters. He made a post about monitoring who's supporting Harris. There's no reason they should believe that his being forced to take the post down has been accompanied by any change of heart."
Opinion | Striking dock workers just set an example for all working folks,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/dock-workers-strike-sent-powerful-message-bosses-workers-rcna173849,2024-10-05T11:58:58Z,"Dockworkers strike on a picket line outside of the Port of Houston Authority in Texas on Oct. 1.Brandon Bell / Getty Images

On Tuesday, dockworkers went on strike, shutting down ports across the East Coast and Gulf Coast to demand higher wages and a guarantee that automation won't be used to throw many of them out of work. It was a massive demonstration of the power of working people to grind the gears of the economy to a halt by simply refusing to show up.

The bosses caved in record time. Both sides agreed to a tentative deal Thursday. The dockworkers will return to work in exchange for a 62% pay increase over the next six years. That's a very good thing.

What's alarming is that even as the workers were being demonized by right-wing media outlets like The Wall Street Journal and the New York Post, many liberals were fretting that the economic chaos resulting from foreign goods not coming into American ports would cost Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris the election. Even some otherwise left-of-center journalists were criticizing the workers for having the audacity to strike or even calling on President Joe Biden to force them back to work.

Naysayers had argued that the workers were greedy. As they saw it, dockworkers already made more than enough money. Others argued that by blocking automation, the workers were standing in the way of progress. Many observers said that collective bargaining is all well and good within reasonable limits, but shutting down this much of the flow of goods coming into the country was too much of an economic disruption to be allowed.

All of those arguments missed the mark by a mile. The only structural power the working class has in a capitalist system is the power to disrupt the economy by withdrawing its labor. That's the entire point of union organizing.

In this case, the union members stuck to their guns and won. Their victory is a victory for everyone who has to sell their working hours to a boss to make a living.

There were breathless headlines about dockworkers who make ""six-figure salaries,"" but those were about the top earners. As Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., pointed out in his statement of solidarity with the striking workers, the average income for these workers is $60,000 a year, with ""many East Coast port workers mak[ing] as little as $20 an hour -- the same wage that a fast food worker in California currently makes."" And loading and unloading cargo ships is demanding work, often involving very long hours. The idea that these workers are overentitled clashes jarringly with these basic realities.

There's a much bigger problem, though, with the idea that striking dockworkers didn't deserve support because they already made good wages. That argument assumes that labor activity is just a way of procuring charity for workers who are poor and desperate enough to need it. That's exactly the wrong way to think about it. The labor movement exists to give the working-class majority of a society a say in what goes on at the workplaces where they spend half their waking hours and some input into how the profits created by their hard work are divided up. It imposes some small measure of democracy on the economy. The more that happens, the more everyone who works for a living benefits.

Every dollar that doesn't reach the pockets of workers pads the profits of already wildly profitable companies. The ocean carriers have made record profits in the last few years: $400 billion since 2020. Meanwhile, the dockworkers whose labor does so much to produce those profits are actually making 12% less than they were two decades ago, when adjusted for inflation. Why should the bosses hoard the benefits of the industry's success? If some dockworkers make more money than you do at your job, then why should your conclusion be that the dockworkers are greedy and not that you should organize with your co-workers for a better deal?

It's all too easy to think of corporate CEOs and shareholders raking in money as the inevitable order of things and working people trying to get a bigger piece of the pie as an imposition. Similarly, we just take it for granted that advances in automation will be used to throw some workers into unemployment while the ones lucky enough to keep their jobs have to work as hard as ever as they see their employers' profits skyrocket.

But that's not the only way things could work. Imagine that these companies were collectively owned by the workers themselves. In that scenario, labor-saving technology could actually be used to save labor for everyone. Workers could all work shorter hours for the same income, spread the work that still needs to be done by humans more thinly among themselves and give themselves more time to spend with their loved ones.

In the world we live in, though, ownership and labor are separated, so bosses decide how automation will be implemented. This is a problem that's going to impact every corner of the economy as technology advances, and any workers who want to avoid being left in the cold at the end of the process need to be ready to follow the dockworkers' lead and draw a line in the sand.

And people who profess to be workers' allies need to take their heads out of the sand.

Lee Fang, a heterodox left-wing journalist I'd expect to be sympathetic to organized workers, assailed the dockworkers on the grounds that Biden has been a pro-labor president and the strike had the potential to ""cause crippling inflation only 1 month out from the election."" He said this ""might take the cake"" as an extreme example of ""self defeats of organized labor.""

Dylan Matthews of Vox went so far as to call for Biden to invoke Taft-Hartley, a notorious piece of union-busting legislation passed in the 1940s, lest the dockworkers' strike ""cause inflation to come roaring back weeks before an election."" Matthews said ""you can support bargaining"" without tolerating the ""sabotage"" of the economy that would come from shutting down traffic at East Coast ports.

But what incentive are employers supposed to have to give concessions if workers can't back up their bargaining demands with a credible threat to walk off the job? That's the only way workers have ever been able to build real power.

As it happened, the bosses caved before the supply chain disruptions could cause inflation. Even if things hadn't worked out this way, though, it's disturbing that Matthews was willing to throw striking workers under the bus for the ""greater good."" If Biden had taken Matthews' advice, the ""pro-labor"" president using a union-busting law to shut down a major strike would have had demoralizing ripple effects throughout the rest of the organized working class.

Even if all you care about is Democrats winning elections, screwing over dockworkers would still have been a bad idea. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is already being supported by a higher percentage of union households than any other Republican candidate in the last 40 years. A Democratic president invoking Taft-Hartley to shut down a high-profile strike would likely only make things worse.

As Chris Isidore and Vanessa Yurkevich point out at CNN, if the union had continued to work under a contract extension, thus delaying any strike until after the presidential election, then they ""would have lost bargaining leverage"" by losing the chance to shut down the ports before the ""pre-holiday shipping season"" really got going. In telling the workers to throw away their best chance to win this massive pay raise to make sure Harris won, Fang and Matthews were essentially telling them not to take action themselves but to trust politicians to look out for their interests. But workers can't exert much influence on the political process if they don't start by building power for themselves where they work.

It's true that in many ways, Biden has been more pro-labor than recent presidents. But his record is more mixed than Fang suggests. He came into office promising to pass the PRO Act, which would make it easier for workers to organize unions, but it hasn't passed and never seemed to have been a high priority for his administration. And two years ago, in a situation much like this one, Biden invoked the Railway Labor Act to prevent a major rail strike. It's good that this time around he did the right thing -- he told reporters that he didn't ""believe in Taft-Hartley"" -- but these blotches on his record show the limits of trusting politicians to be benevolent toward workers.

While Republicans are certainly worse on labor issues, the sad fact is that the working class has relatively limited influence in both parties. There's no way to change that more basic reality without building a bigger and more militant labor movement, one that's not afraid to flex its muscles at times that might be inconvenient for others.

And if you work for a living, then that's exactly what you should want to happen."
Opinion | JD Vance claimed Democrats are censoring the internet. He's lying.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-claim-democrats-censoring-conservatives-rcna173859,2024-10-05T11:58:51Z,"By Nina Jankowicz, expert on disinformation and democratization

During this week's vice presidential debate, Sen. JD Vance attempted to present Donald Trump's agenda to the American people in a gentler light. The Vance that voters have seen in his cable news and podcast appearances -- invoking ""childless cat ladies"" and asserting parents should have more voting power than nonparents -- was nowhere to be found. Instead, for much of the debate, Vance presented himself as a slick, Ivy League debater with an ""aw, shucks"" exterior.

But by the end of the night, that facade had disappeared, replaced with the extremely online right-wing zealot his public record shows him to be. When Vance was asked if he would seek to challenge the results of the 2024 election if he and Trump lost, he deflected. ""I believe that we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country,"" he said. ""It is the threat of censorship."" Vance later added, ""Kamala Harris is engaged in censorship at an industrial scale.""

If you were baffled as to why Vance chose to bring up ""industrial"" censorship at that moment, you're not alone. This answer wasn't for you -- or for most audience members. It was a flare to Vance's followers, who for years have been told that their right to free speech is under attack. Republicans (and some on the far left) have manufactured a crisis about a ""censorship industrial complex."" They argue that anyone who does research about rumors online, implements social media platform rules that protect safety and health, or talks about either of the above with public or private partners is engaged in unfair censorship.

The narrative that government, academia and the private sector have been supposedly colluding on a massive scale for years to suppress Americans' political opinions has grown from its roots on the fringes of the internet to the halls of Congress. This manufactured controversy preys upon genuine concerns: It would indeed be bad if the U.S. government were coercing social media platforms to remove speech. But its thin record relies heavily on scaremongering, context collapse and research mistakes that would make a grade schooler blush.

One example appeared in the debate itself, when Vance alleged to Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, ""You yourself have said there's no First Amendment right to misinformation."" What he -- and the conservative influencers who made this old quote go viral over the summer -- didn't tell viewers was that Walz was speaking about misinformation in the context of voter intimidation and disenfranchisement, neither of which are protected speech.

That's just one example, but there have been many more across the years of this conservative fever dream. At the American Sunlight Project, of which I am a co-founder, we recently published an investigation unpacking these baseless claims. We found a clear and concerted pattern of ""information laundering,"" in which allegations that are light on facts migrate from online influencers to conservative political groups to lawsuits and congressional investigations. By falsely accusing researchers, governments and social media companies of censorship, these groups have successfully eroded public confidence in essential fact-checking and critical thinking processes before the fast-approaching 2024 election.

We are not the only ones who have highlighted that these claims lack evidence. At another point in the debate, Vance seemingly referenced a recent Supreme Court case in which Missouri and Louisiana alleged the Biden administration had coerced social media platforms to remove Covid falsehoods. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?"" Vance asked. Apparently this Yale Law graduate is not current on his Supreme Court decisions; in June, the court threw the case out. In her opinion for the six-member majority, Trump-appointed Justice Amy Coney Barrett wrote, ""The plaintiff cannot rest on 'mere allegations,' but must instead point to factual evidence.""

A new study on anti-conservative bias published in the journal Nature also casts doubt on the very premise of Vance's allegations. It found that while conservatives were suspended from Twitter more frequently than liberals, ""users who were pro-Trump/conservative also shared far more links to various sets of low-quality news sites -- even when news quality was determined by politically balanced groups of laypeople, or groups of only Republican laypeople -- and had higher estimated likelihoods of being bots.""

In other words, conservatives were more often sharing content that was likely to fall afoul of pre-existing policies, even as assessed by those with similar beliefs. We all agree to abide by social media companies' terms and policies when we sign up to share cat pics or political memes; the implementation of those policies is not ""censorship"" any more than a bar refusing service to shoeless patrons.

Beyond facts and policy, Vance's use of ""censorship"" is a signal to voters who have been told again and again that Democrats are communists, fascists or worse. His use of the term is easy shorthand to solidify an enemy. ""Censorship,"" apparently, is what Vance believes is a serious threat to democracy akin to an armed mob storming the Capitol. The difference between the two is that one of them actually happened."
Jen Psaki: Liz Cheney goes to bat for Kamala Harris,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/inside-with-jen-psaki/trump-liz-cheney-kamala-harris-endorsement-rcna174114,2024-10-05T11:58:40Z,"This week, former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney made headlines by joining Vice President Kamala Harris on the campaign trail in Ripon, Wisconsin -- which is also the birthplace of the Republican Party.

Cheney joins hundreds of high-profile Republicans who have broken away from Trump to endorse the Harris-Walz ticket. Among these defectors is former Trump White House aide Cassidy Hutchinson, who recently declared ""Donald Trump and JD Vance cannot be trusted with the Constitution, cannot be trusted to uphold our rule of law, and cannot be trusted to enact responsible policy."" Hutchinson noted she was ""proud as a conservative to have the opportunity to vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz in this election.""

But with just over 30 days to go before the election, what are all the other anti-Trump Republicans waiting for? Utah Sen. Mitt Romney has voiced concerns that Trump would target him and his family if re-elected. Former President George W. Bush has been castigated and attacked by Trump at every turn. Former Trump chief of staff John Kelly said that Trump ""has nothing but contempt for our democratic institutions, our Constitution, and the rule of law."" And when an aide told Trump that his Vice President Mike Pence's life was in danger on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump reportedly replied: ""So what?""

I am not saying it's easy to go against your own political party. Cheney knows that well, having been essentially excommunicated after a lifetime of loyal service. But as Harris put it during the Wisconsin event, ""There are many who know it is wrong, and then there are those who have the courage to speak out loudly about it and the conviction to speak truth.""

For Romney, Bush, Kelly and Pence, time is running out. If you don't speak up loudly now, you may lose your chance. And the history books will remember.

On Thursday, Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed new evidence in the federal election case against Trump. The filing from special counsel Jack Smith's team argues there is ample evidence to convict Trump for his efforts to overturn the 2020 election, despite the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling this summer.

We'll be talking to Andrew Weissmann this Sunday about this new filing. Here's a sneak preview ahead of the interview:

What's new in this filing that we haven't seen before?

Direct evidence from Republicans who were in Trump's administration and campaign proving Trump's knowledge that he lost and intentional lies that he won, and efforts to undermine the presidential vote nonetheless.

How do you think this indictment will hold up under the Supreme Court's presidential immunity ruling?

Four justices already found that the state pressure scheme is not immune; it is very hard to see how there will not be one more vote agreeing with at least that part of the case going forward. But all of this assumes that Trump is not elected, because once in office he will simply order the DOJ to drop the case.

Some Republicans are claiming this filing represents ""election interference"" because it was unsealed so close to the election. Are you surprised by Judge Chutkan's timing?

Judge Chutkan is carrying out her responsibilities within the parameters dictated by the Supreme Court, after Trump prevailed there. I am not surprised she is fulfilling her duties without fear or favor to either side.

While Vance and Walz traded mild-mannered barbs onstage this week, the breakout star of the VP debate was Oakland University student and civics guru Marcus Johnson.

Johnson went viral for the impromptu ""civics lesson"" he gave post-debate at an OU watch party hosted by MSNBC's Jacob Soboroff, where he fact-checked Vance on the powers of the vice president, quipping that anyone who took high school civics should know the answer.

If MSNBC hosts have anything to do with it, this won't be the last time we benefit from Johnson's wisdom. Joy Reid already locked him in as a co-host for an OU town hall with Harris, should she accept. And you can find more of Johnson's insightful, fact-based commentary on his X profile, where he's rocketed to 27,000 followers (from just 100 before the debate).

Hurricane Helene has had a devastating impact on the Southeast, with at least 200 deaths and hundreds still missing. Hundreds of thousands of homes are without power, and many returning evacuees are finding their communities and homes destroyed, especially in North Carolina.

Chris Hayes: How the Trump campaign is gaslighting Americans,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-vance-lies-gaslighting-debate-fact-check-rcna174067,2024-10-05T01:12:38Z,"Sen. JD Vance lies with such ease that even sometimes when you're paying attention, you don't know you're being lied to and, frankly, it drives me insane.

Just take this moment from Tuesday night's vice presidential debate:

But that's just not true: The United States, under President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, already produces more energy than any other nation on earth. Biden's Energy Department helped open the second of two nuclear reactors in Georgia in May. These were the first new reactors built in the United States in more than 30 years. And in July, Biden signed a bipartisan bill into law aimed at vastly growing domestic nuclear energy.

So, what do you call it when someone says the opposite of the truth? Let's just call it the Trump-Vance campaign: an entire political movement premised on Americans not believing their lying eyes and directing hate and rage at out-groups, rather than dealing with the thorny work of attempting to solve real problems with actual solutions.

Vance proved as much with his debate performance Tuesday night. He claimed there were 25 million unauthorized immigrants in the country, a made-up figure he's repeated often on the campaign trail. The actual number, experts say, is less than half of that. He then suggested Haitians in Springfield, Ohio, were ""illegal immigrants"" when they in fact hold protected status.

He falsely claimed that Mexican cartels were running guns across the border into the U.S. But everyone who covers the border knows guns flow from America, where they're readily available, to Mexico which has some of the strictest gun laws in the world. Vance also said crime, inflation and border crossings are up. The opposite is true; they are all falling.

But my favorite lie from Tuesday's debate was when Vance said -- in a manner so assured that I literally had a moment where I thought I maybe was missing something -- that Donald Trump spearheaded a bipartisan effort to save the Affordable Care Act.

Again, this just isn't true. In 2016, Trump ran on a promise to kill the ACA. And, as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, pointed out during the debate, Trump came within one Senate vote of succeeding in killing it.

Look, this isn't about two parties having good-faith disagreements on whether some policy will have the promised effects. It's about Trump and Vance gaslighting you into not knowing what to believe. Creating this alternate reality has become a central part of their campaign."
Opinion | Hurricane Helene's destruction is an urgent call to action for Harris,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hurricane-helene-trump-jd-vance-republicans-climate-change-rcna174085,2024-10-04T22:21:25Z,"By Henna Hundal, MD candidate at the Stanford University School of Medicine

When Hurricane Helene made landfall as a Category 4 storm last week, it ravaged the Southeast. The official death toll has surpassed 200, and many victims are still missing. Active-duty soldiers are descending across the region to disperse essential supplies, as residents grapple with billions of dollars in damages. The images emerging from the disaster, the flooded streets, collapsed homes, and debris stretching as far as the eye can see, are hard to bear.

What's also hard to bear is certain politicians' refusal to come to terms with a key driver of this disaster: climate change. Such was the case with Ohio Sen. JD Vance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate when he and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz were asked to comment on the harrowing fallout of Hurricane Helene and Americans' overwhelming desire for meaningful climate action.

""I think it's important for us, first of all, to say Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water,"" Vance meandered. ""We want the environment to be cleaner and safer, but one of the things that I've noticed some of our Democratic friends talking a lot about is a concern about carbon emissions. This idea that carbon emissions drives all the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true, just for the sake of argument, so we're not arguing about weird science.""

But Hurricane Helene itself is a grim reminder that the science, as ""weird"" as some may find it, cannot be ignored. What was striking about Vance's circuitous response is how he surgically bifurcated Hurricane Helene from climate change, addressing the two topics as if they're as distinct as apples and oranges. He also employed a strategic ""if-then"" construct, proposing what should happen if people believe that anthropogenic emissions drive climate change, but not personally accepting the premise as fact.

This muddled nonanswer comes on the heels of sobering findings about just how deeply the climate crisis and Hurricane Helene are connected. Early research from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory indicates that climate change may have increased the rainfall from Hurricane Helene by up to 50% in some locations. Other estimates suggest that climate change was a likely culprit for the storm's rapid intensification, as its winds became increasingly ferocious. These findings mirror wider trends. With sea surface temperatures ramping up, stronger storms are in store.

This most recent storm also opens a critical window for Vice President Kamala Harris to step in where Vance and Trump have so egregiously fumbled: In the month remaining before Election Day, Harris should lean into communications that underscore the public health threats arising from climate change. Not only are these threats acutely evident in the wake of Hurricane Helene, but this framing could also stir bipartisan coalescence around actually addressing the climate crisis.

A nationally representative study of registered American voters found that 69% trust their primary care doctor for climate change information, with 57% of conservative Republicans among them. In fact, conservative Republicans are more likely to trust the American Medical Association as a source on climate change than the Environmental Protection Agency.

Reconstituting climate change discourse as a matter of public health and safety taps into mutually aligned priorities. It serves as a powerful reminder that climate change is no back burner issue, but is already intertwined with voters' central concerns about their communities.

Vance's tap dance around this issue may align with his own political calculus, but it'll ultimately prove to be a misguided approach. As debate moderator Norah O'Donnell pointed out while posing the climate change question, a majority of young Republicans want to see climate solutions, too.

Public Health Emergency declarations were swiftly issued for the Carolinas, Georgia, Tennessee and Florida, as the profound health effects of the disaster began to manifest. While fatalities stand out as the most visible consequence and tend to be documented more consistently, the true public health toll runs far deeper.

The almost 100,000 residents of Asheville, North Carolina, could face weeks without clean water, heightening the risk of waterborne disease transmission. As of Thursday, power was still unavailable for almost 1 million customers across the Southeast. For people who need to refrigerate medications or use medical devices, a power outage can be deadly.

And this is to say nothing of how local health care systems become strained to their breaking points, of how hospitalization rates for substance use disorders rise, or of how post-traumatic stress disorder and other mental health impacts linger well after the debris is cleared.

These are not mythical scenarios of a doomsday future. This is the present plight of life in a climate emergency.

Hurricane Helene has been the most devastating wake-up call about climate change in recent years. Vance, and Trump, demonstrate over and over that they deeply misunderstand how Americans tangibly, viscerally, feel climate impacts in a way that is gradually transcending party lines. Harris must not miss this critical moment to emerge as the unifying messenger we so urgently need."
Stephanie Ruhle: By all measures we have a strong economy. So why don't Americans feel that way?,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/morning-joe/job-report-inflation-economy-biden-rcna174092,2024-10-04T20:53:06Z,"The Biden administration woke up to some good news on Friday. The U.S. economy added 254,000 jobs in September, blowing past the 150,000 expected. Not only did September's numbers beat economists' expectations, but data from previous months were also revised upward and the unemployment rate fell from 4.2% in August to 4.1%.

This is good news. By almost all measures, we've got a strong economy, except for one thing that matters an awful lot: how Americans feel about it. It's a reason why Donald Trump continues to poll better among likely voters on handling the economy.

That feeling is largely frustration that prices are still too high. I'm not talking about the pace of inflation -- just the fact that everything seems to cost more.

Now, the administration and the Harris campaign point to all the recent positive economic news, but they don't always connect the dots to one reason behind those prices: the rise in wages.

Yes, price increases can be due to ""greedflation."" Corporations have held wages low for years while raising prices and pocketing big profits. Many businesses could increase wages and benefits without higher prices. That's why many politicians, including Vice President Kamala Harris, want to investigate and go after those engaging in price gouging.

However, a lot of workers -- especially lower-wage earners -- have gotten a raise in recent years. And when wages go up, prices likely do as well. We want lower-wage earners to be able to support their families, but if you're paying people who work at fast-food joints or pizzerias $20 an hour, then you're not likely going to get $1 menu items anymore, and you're not going to get a pizza that costs less than $20.

Here's an example: My son works at a deli and takes home $20 an hour for making sandwiches. When my mother rolls in to pick him up from work, she can't understand why the sandwiches are $22.

But it's not just about ""greedflation"" and price gouging. Employers are paying people more and it's going to impact all kinds of companies. And if employers pay their workers more, especially small business owners, it has to come from somewhere, and often that means raising prices for consumers.

Let's not forget, this increase in wages is also good news. Wage growth has been rising fastest for the lowest-wage workers. That's a good thing, even if it means we might have to pay a little more for fast food, pizza and sandwiches."
Why Trump's odd complaints about Fox News' election ads matter,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trumps-odd-complaints-fox-news-election-ads-matter-rcna174075,2024-10-04T18:25:35Z,"We've reached the point at which Donald Trump thinks Fox News ""shouldn't be allowed"" to air attack ads that he disagrees with.

At a campaign rally in Pennsylvania last week, Donald Trump went on an impromptu riff about one of his favorite subjects: Fox News.

""You ever notice on Fox, they put me on -- I do a great job -- and then they follow me with a horrible commercial,"" the former president said. ""Roger Ailes never allowed bad commercials. What's the purpose of me doing a nice show, and then they put nine horrible commercials on, which are all lies?"" he added.

Wrapping up his thought, the Republican concluded, ""Fox should put just the good people on the people that want to make America great again.""

This comes up with surprising frequency. This past weekend, for example, Trump complained that the network aired a speech from Vice President Kamala Harris. The Hill reported:

Fox, the GOP candidate told a Wisconsin audience, ""shouldn't be allowed"" to show the Democratic candidate's remarks.

A day later, he used his social media platform to argue that Fox News ""shouldn't allow negative Ads."" Though he didn't elaborate, I have a hunch he wasn't referring to attack ads aired by his own campaign. Trump added soon after that Fox should stop ""constantly putting on Liberal Democrats"" who end up ""nullifying"" conservative guests.

If all of this sounds at all familiar, it's because he made similar comments during his White House tenure. In May 2019, the then-president whined online that Fox was going too far ""in covering the Dems,"" referring to Democratic presidential candidates. Trump added that Fox News executives should instead prioritize ""the people who got them there.""

A Washington Post analysis added soon after that it was a remarkable sentiment because it was ""an explicit expression of his expectation that Fox News will at least play down coverage of Democratic issues and candidates, if not shut them out entirely.""

Quite right. As we discussed at the time, Trump was making clear that he saw Fox News, not as a news organization, but as a Republican entity, which exists to advance a Republican cause.

Indeed, the same week, the then-president insisted that if the network was ""putting more Democrats on than you have Republicans,"" than Fox News was necessarily straying from what Trump saw as its proper mission.

The Post's analysis added that Trump not only saw a ""symbiosis"" between the network and his political operation, the president also ""expects Fox News to box out anti-Trump voices in the name of staying true to a group he views as their shared base.""

That was five years ago -- and the Republican is still making the case that the network ""shouldn't be allowed"" to broadcast Democratic speeches that he doesn't like.

Complicating matters, Trump isn't making any effort to hide these sentiments. It'd be one thing if he whined to Sean Hannity during one of their private chats, but the GOP candidate is taking his complaints to the public, apparently in the hopes of pressuring Fox News into compliance with his electoral plans.

I can't say whether the network and its employees consider Trump's rhetoric insulting, but they probably should."
Charlie Sykes: Cheney and Harris put country over party. Americans should follow their lead.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/cheney-harris-rally-trump-democracy-rcna174060,2024-10-04T17:49:56Z,"On Thursday, I was in Ripon, Wisconsin -- known as the birthplace of the Republican Party -- to witness a truly important moment in American politics. Former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, put country above party and joined Kamala Harris on the campaign trail for the first time.

""I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the crowd.

You cannot overlook the symbolism of having this campaign event in Ripon. In 1854, it was the place where a group of Americans came together to form a new political party and fight against the spread of slavery. It was a moment of real moral clarity in our country. And on Thursday, as I stood in that crowd, I felt like this was another one of those moments.

I got to speak to Harris and Liz Cheney before the event, and they were both very aware of the symbolic significance and the weight of this moment. When you step back, it's rather extraordinary to think about what we are seeing from the Democrats and the Harris campaign and their willingness to create a big tent. They're not relitigating things that happened in the past. Instead, they're coming together with those on the other side of the aisle around a common cause: our democracy.

This is not a choice between right or left, liberal or conservative, Democrat or Republican. It is a moral decision about our constitutional order and about whether or not we're going to put country over party.

When they took to the stage together, Harris and Cheney embraced that message. They essentially said, let's set aside our political and ideological differences because our country is in survival mode. American democracy is facing a five-alarm fire. We must rise to the occasion and not let traditional ideological differences get in the way of recognizing the importance of this moment, because in November it's all on the line."
Opinion | How Israel's invasion of Lebanon could spiral into a massive regional war,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/israel-lebanon-war-iran-hezbollah-biden-rcna173364,2024-10-04T16:30:43Z,"An expert explains why Israel's intensifying war on Hezbollah is risky for the region.

Israel moved military forces into southern Lebanese territory Monday, an invasion that marks a major new level of intensity in about a year of conflict with Hezbollah. The paramilitary organization fired rockets at Israeli positions in the Shebaa Farms the day after Oct. 7 ""in solidarity"" with the Palestinian people after Hamas' attacks on Israel. (That area is a disputed territory which Lebanon and Syria say belongs to Lebanon, and Israel controls and says belongs to Syria.) Hezbollah, sometimes called a state within a state, is backed by Iran and does not have widespread support in Lebanon.

Then Tuesday, Iran fired about 200 ballistic missiles at Israel, citing last week's assassination of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut and, this summer, the assassination of Hamas political leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran.

The Biden administration has long opposed an Israeli incursion into Lebanon. But in the past year, the administration has also been unwilling to take any meaningful steps to rein in Israel's behavior, and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is acting boldly to assert more dominance in the region and degrade Israel's adversaries -- with a continued disregard for civilian lives. Israeli airstrikes have struck medical facilities and already killed hundreds of civilians in Lebanon. The probability of a regional war seems to be growing by the day.

To better understand the unfolding conflict, I called Nick Blanford, a Beirut-based fellow at the Atlantic Council and the author of ""Warriors of God: Inside Hezbollah's Thirty-Year Struggle Against Israel.""

Our conversation, edited for length and clarity, follows.

Zeeshan Aleem: What is happening right now and how do we know when to say whether this is a new war?

Nicholas Blanford: I think you have to put the developments of the last few weeks into some context. One day after Hamas attacked Israel on Oct. 7, Hezbollah staged a pro forma attack against Israeli positions along the Lebanon-Israel border, and it dedicated this attack to its allies -- Hamas in Gaza. But very quickly it turned into a kind of a tit-for-tat, daily attacks. The Hezbollah guys would attack Israeli military positions along the border; the Israelis would retaliate with artillery fire airstrikes into south Lebanon. And this really continued from October almost uninterrupted.

There was a clear moment in September when Israel's patience ran out. And they escalated in a very dramatic fashion, by detonating thousands of pagers which they'd been able, apparently, to booby trap. The following day, they detonated hundreds of walkie-talkies. That was followed up by intense airstrikes across areas of Lebanon where Hezbollah has a presence. And those attacks have intensified over the past two weeks, climaxing on Sept. 27 with the massive airstrike on Hezbollah's underground headquarters in south Beirut, which killed the veteran Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, who has led the group for 32 years. The latest development is the advance of some elite Israeli army units into southern Lebanon where they have reportedly already taken some casualties.

So I would say we are in a war but it is not yet full scale. Both sides are mainly hitting military targets, not infrastructure as well, although hundreds of civilians have been killed in Lebanon.

Could you give us a brief primer on Hezbollah? How it emerged, what it is, what it believes in and its social function in Lebanon?

Blanford: Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim organization that follows the Iranian, theocratic system of rule. Hezbollah has a secretary general -- most recently the late Nasrallah -- but the true leader of Hezbollah is the spiritual leader of Iran, currently, Ali Khamenei. He's the ultimate authority and, in general, the Iranians will set the strategic agenda.

Hezbollah emerged after the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in 1982 to kick out the Palestine Liberation Organization, which was deployed in strength in south Lebanon. The Israelis in '82 reached all the way to Beirut and then they gradually withdrew. By 1985, they were occupying a border strip along the Lebanon-Israel border and Hezbollah became the main resistance force against that Israeli occupation. Particularly during the 1990s, Hezbollah, which is backed by Iran but also supported by neighboring Syria, was able to deal blow after blow to the Israeli occupation forces, and that culminated in May 2000 with Israel pulling out of south Lebanon.

Hezbollah refused to put down its arms after the Israelis left. They said, 'We need to keep our arms, our military force, to deter Israel from coming back into south Lebanon.' But there was also another unspoken reason, which is that Hezbollah gradually became a source of deterrence for Iran -- especially after the war between Israel and Hezbollah in 2006 when it expanded very quickly and acquired a great deal of weaponry from Iran, Syria and elsewhere. So, for Iran, Hezbollah has now become a major force multiplier.

Hezbollah has a slightly schizophrenic character, because it is ideologically beholden to the Islamic leadership of Iran, but of course it is a Lebanese organization. It survives or falls depending on the support it gets from the Lebanese Shia community, which is why, since the beginning, Hezbollah has invested a lot in social welfare organizations.

The Shia population of Lebanon tends to be traditionally fairly downtrodden. They live in the poorer areas of the country, traditionally neglected by central governments. And Hezbollah really stepped in with schools, with hospitals, with repairing war damaged houses, even things like helping farmers with agricultural aid. It's become an indispensable organization for the Lebanese Shia community. So they've been able to maintain that support since the early 1980s.

Other communities: the Christians and Sunnis, in particular, the Druze, to an extent, [say] 'Well, hang on a minute. We do have a national army. Why do we need a Shia militia, armed to the teeth, stronger than many armies around the world, to defend Lebanon?' So there have been growing calls for Hezbollah to disarm, and this is why Hezbollah has moved deeper into Lebanese politics, particularly over the last 19 years, since the 2005 parliamentary elections.

What are the fundamental dynamics driving how Hezbollah and Israel's government see each other, both in terms of geopolitical interests and domestic political interests?

Blanford: Ideologically, Hezbollah and Iran want to see the end of Israel, and the restitution of Palestine to the Palestinians. They have in the past assisted Palestinians during the Al Aqsa Intifada. They would help the Palestinians in the West Bank and in Gaza fight the Israelis. But in the past, they didn't get directly involved. When they kicked the Israelis out of Lebanon in 2000, Hezbollah didn't immediately rush across the border into Israel and say, ""We're going to go and liberate Jerusalem now."" There's an acknowledgment that it's up to the Palestinians to liberate themselves, but Hezbollah is definitely there to help.

When you look at it more realistically, the reason why Hezbollah is so powerful now is because the Iranians want them to be. We go back to this notion of Hezbollah forming a key role in Iran's deterrence architecture: The stronger Hezbollah becomes, the safer Iran feels.

The Institute for National Security Studies, a leading think tank in Israel, has for the past few years described Hezbollah as Israel's greatest threat, which is quite remarkable in itself, because we're not talking about a country, we're talking about an organization, albeit one that is backed by a powerful regional country.

The Israelis have watched Hezbollah grow stronger and stronger. What the Israelis are doing now is something they haven't dared to do before, and that is to really go for broke with Hezbollah. What's interesting is I think the Israelis are gambling that Hezbollah and the Iranians do not want a full-scale war with Israel right now. Why? Because if there is a full-scale war, whatever the outcome, Hezbollah will take a huge battering, as indeed we're seeing now, and there's no guarantee that Hezbollah will be able to rebuild, rearm and re-equip as quickly as it did after the 2006 war to continue serving as a deterrence for Iran. In other words, if Hezbollah gets engaged in a full-scale war now, Iran could lose its major deterrence factor in that war, and all this would be for the sake of coming to the support of Hamas in Gaza. Hamas is small fry compared to Hezbollah -- Hezbollah is much, much, much more important to Iran than Hamas. Which is why Hezbollah is still acting with a certain amount of restraint despite Israel's escalated action against it. Hezbollah still has not used its arsenal of precision-guided missiles.

It's a dangerous gamble. It could go wrong. Especially now that Israeli troops are operating on the ground in south Lebanon, Hezbollah's home turf. The current conflict could spill into a major war. We're still below that threshold moment, but if it happens, it has a potential to go regional, dragging in Iran, Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

Can you walk us through the different scenarios you see unfolding here?

Blanford: The least likely one is that a cease-fire comes in. The Americans and the French had an idea for a 21-day cease-fire to calm things down along the Lebanon-Israel border. Netanyahu has rejected it. So that's not going to happen..

A second scenario is that what we're seeing now continues. The Israelis haven't started hitting Lebanese infrastructure, power stations, bridges, roads, the airports, seaports; they are focusing on Hezbollah military targets by using air power and now ground forces, albeit in a limited manner. Hezbollah, by the same token, is striking back at Israeli military targets. They haven't been hitting Israeli infrastructure. Now this could go on even at this heightened rate. But under current circumstances, I suspect that Hezbollah will continue doing what it's doing -- in other words, absorb these blows that the Israelis have inflicted, and keep firing rockets into Israel.

In some respects, the Israeli ground maneuver could play right into Hezbollah's hands, as the Israelis are entering terrain that Hezbollah has had for 18 years [and Hezbollah has been able] to prepare for exactly this eventuality. When the Israelis did move into Lebanon in 2006 after two weeks of aerial bombing, they came in for a big surprise. They didn't understand Hezbollah's underground bunker networks, its ambush positions, firing positions.

You could have a similar scenario this time round, albeit on a larger scale, where the Israelis, who have a better understanding of what Hezbollah is about these days, could come in in force for what they would describe perhaps as a limited incursion to basically rubble-ize and depopulate this broad strip of south Lebanon. But they risk losing a lot of troops because they're going to be operating in Hezbollah's environment. And at the end of it, if the mission is successful, what do you do then? Do you reoccupy south Lebanon? If so, you've gone back to the situation between 1978 and 2000 and that didn't end too well for the Israelis. But if you pull back to the border, then what is to stop Hezbollah basically moving back into the border district and beginning to rebuild?

There could come a point when the Israelis say, 'We've hit all the targets from the air and our soldiers are fighting on the ground but Hezbollah is still firing rockets across the border.' And this is where perhaps a third scenario can kick in: The Israelis conclude that, well, we're going to have to escalate this even further by deploying a larger number of troops into Lebanon to expand the target set to include Lebanese infrastructure as well. It could be at that point that Hezbollah, with Iranian blessing, feels it has no choice but to launch its precision-guided systems at Israeli military and infrastructure targets. This is where the conflict could go regional.

What role does the U.S. have in all this, and what advice would you give to the Biden administration on how to prevent a full-scale regional war from breaking out?

Blanford: Yes, a regional war potentially could happen. If the Iranians assess that Hezbollah is about to get bludgeoned by Israel, they may conclude, 'We've got nothing left to lose. We're about to lose Hezbollah. Let's go large. We'll activate all our proxies across the region, and we'll give it a go and see what happens to Israel.'

I think the Biden administration is in a difficult position. President Biden is enormously frustrated with Netanyahu, partly because of the Gaza conflict going on for so long. But he has been urging Netanyahu since the get-go to not open a second front with Hezbollah. Now you could argue that a second front was open anyway, because of these simmering tit-for-tat attacks that have been going on across the Lebanon-Israel border since October. But these attacks were containable. Hezbollah has said, 'Look, this is a support front that we're doing. Once the war in Gaza ends, we're going to stop.' So the emphasis has been very much on trying to conclude a cease-fire deal in Gaza, which will then have a trickle-down effect and should stabilize the Lebanon-Israel border. But of course, we haven't had a Gaza cease-fire. The conflict continues, and now the Israelis clearly have lost patience with Hezbollah and have gone large.

There's very little that the Biden administration feels it can do, particularly when you've got a very close election coming up in just over a month now. So the Biden administration could do what it's done before, and then suspend arms shipments to Israel, but this time do it properly. Cut off all military support to Israel. That would put a lot of pressure on Netanyahu to start picking up the phone and listening when Biden calls. But I don't think they're going to do that because there'll be a political backlash in the United States, and that could affect Kamala Harris' chances against Donald Trump. I think Netanyahu is taking advantage of this and is going for it."
"On politicizing aid, Trump reportedly did what he accused Biden of doing",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/politicizing-aid-trump-reportedly-accused-biden-rcna174001,2024-10-04T12:59:20Z,"As Donald Trump lies about Democrats politicizing federal disaster aid, there's new evidence suggesting he did what he's falsely accused others of doing.

As this week got underway, Donald Trump traveled to Georgia, ostensibly to survey Hurricane Helene damage, where the former president told a series of bizarre lies. The Republican said Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp hadn't been able to reach President Joe Biden, which wasn't true. He said the Biden administration and North Carolina's Democratic governor were ""going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas,"" which was insane.

Trump also accused Vice President Kamala Harris of staging a photograph of her talking on the phone with FEMA officials, told reporters that ""nobody"" could have predicted Hurricane Helene, and insisted that it's ""late in the season for the hurricanes."" All of these claims were completely false.

Three days later, the GOP candidate started peddling a new and related falsehood, claiming at a campaign rally that the White House lacks the resources needed to address Helene's aftermath because ""they spent it all on illegal migrants."" Trump added that, as far as he was concerned, Biden administration officials ""stole"" FEMA money as part of an elaborate conspiracy to get undocumented immigrants -- who can't vote -- to support Democratic candidates.

The former president's claims were, of course, ugly and indefensible lies. But they also helped open the door to a related conversation, which the Republican nominee would probably prefer to avoid.

In fact, as Trump lies about the Biden administration politicizing federal disaster aid, there's fresh evidence that suggests it was Trump who actually did what he's falsely accused Democrats of doing. Politico reported:

While the reporting hasn't been independently verified by MSNBC or NBC News, one former official -- Mark Harvey, who was Trump's senior director for resilience policy on the National Security Council staff -- went on the record, noting that the former president, while in office, ""initially refused to approve disaster aid for California after deadly wildfires in 2018 because of the state's Democratic leanings.""

Harvey was able to change his mind, not by appealing to the then-president's sense of decency or compassion, but by noting that there was extensive damage in Orange County, California -- where there were many Trump voters.

""We went as far as looking up how many votes he got in those impacted areas ... to show him these are people who voted for you,"" Harvey told Politico.

As the report highlighted related incidents, Harvey went on to shed light on Trump's twisted perspective. ""It just goes into this pattern of, 'We're not awarding that, these aren't my people.' That general sense of, 'I am here to help my people, and these aren't my people, so I don't have a responsibility to help,'"" he added.

Biden highlighted the Politico report via social media, and told his nearly 39 million followers, ""You can't only help those in need if they voted for you. It's the most basic part of being president, and this guy knows nothing about it.""

That's true, though there's no reason to stop there. If these allegations are true, I'd argue that they also constitute the kind of governmental abuse that would almost certainly warrant impeachment.

What's more, they offer a timely warning to American voters about the kind of antics they should expect if Trump is returned to power.

Indeed, Olivia Troye, a former Trump White House homeland security adviser, was explicit on this point, telling Politico that if the former president prevails, he'll view disasters through a political lens that values personal loyalty over damage considerations.

""It's not going to be about that American voter out there who isn't even really paying attention to politics, and their house is gone, and the president of the United States is judging them for how they voted, and they didn't even vote,"" Troye concluded."
Opinion | Harris could win these three Southern states if late deciders show up,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kamala-harris-florida-georgia-north-carolina-rcna173735,2024-10-04T10:34:05Z,"The polls can't capture the procrastinators who aren't yet engaged in the election.

More than a million Americans have already cast their ballots in the presidential election, but the ones who may prove decisive may not have even started paying attention.

For political junkies like me who have been following every twist and turn in this election for the last two years, the next 32 days are the most stressful as we wait to see what voters will decide.

If you already know which candidate you're supporting in the presidential race between Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris -- not to mention everything from governor down to local school board -- it can be frustrating to wait for these seemingly indecisive, procrastinating Americans to get to it.

But late deciders are important, and this year, I think they are the reason that Harris may have a chance to win Georgia, North Carolina and Florida.

No, that's not a typo. I said what I said. President Joe Biden won Georgia in 2020, and North Carolina has been close for a while. But Florida? The one state where the promise of a ""red wave"" in the 2022 midterms actually materialized? The state that has voted for Trump both times he's been on the ballot? It's still close enough that a late-breaking group of Harris voters could make a difference.

Now, it's important to understand who these voters are. I think of them as intentional voters, because they'll usually tell you what they think of the candidates and the race or that they don't intend to vote at all. Months out from the election, if you were to ask whom they'd vote for, they'll give a reflexive response. They'll cite something they heard in an ad or skimmed in a news article that may or may not closely approximates which candidate they're leaning toward. In fact, that candidate may not be whom they end up supporting.

But, as we get closer to Election Day, these voters become more engaged. Their intentions begin to shift and may even harden into support as they read up on the two candidates, listen closer to their arguments, and shift their attitudes. When they do, they can change the political landscape dramatically in short order.

That's especially likely in the 2024 election, which has seen a lot of tumult so far.

Consider when Biden dropped out of the race and Harris became his successor. The country saw 40,000 new voter registrations in just 48 hours, according to Vote.org CEO Andrea Hailey. That's a 700% increase in the site's daily registrations, and young voters accounted for 80% of them. According to ActBlue, the campaign and its joint fundraising committee raised more than $86 million from online donors, many of whom were donating for the first time. This averaged out to around $65 per person from more than a million people. That's a lot of voters who were activated quite suddenly.

Or look at Taylor Swift's influence. Her Instagram post endorsing Harris and urging her fans to vote regardless of their candidate led to at least 337,000 visits to Vote.org. That's a large group of potential voters who were quickly activated and are not likely to be casting their ballot for Trump.

There are also signs that Trump's own popularity has been slipping. Those signs aren't coming from polls, but from his actual performance in the primaries as his own voters shift in their intentions since the Republican convention, as career political adviser Mike Madrid recently noted.

Finally, there's the potential for local issues to have a dramatic effect on turnout.

North Carolinians may turn out to rebuke Trump-endorsed Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson in the state's gubernatorial race. Robinson recently made headlines for allegedly referring to himself as a ""Black Nazi"" on a porn site forum, among a litany of other disgusting comments, all of which he denies making. That's in addition to his extremist views on abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

Trump has distanced himself from Robinson but not pulled his endorsement, and it's not clear if that would even help at this point.

Then there's Georgia. In past elections there, we've seen controversial voting policies be met with determination and expanded turnout due to the resilience of Peach State voters, pushing Democrats to statewide victory in a presidential election and three Senate races. It's possible some of the last-minute, ham-fisted changes to election rules by the state Board of Elections will also provoke a backlash.

And in Florida, voters will also be considering ballot measures to legalize recreational cannabis and codify abortion rights -- popular policies that align with the Harris-Walz agenda.

To be clear, I'm not saying that Harris will outright win Georgia, North Carolina or Florida -- or even that she'll win at all. What I am saying is that the polls can't yet capture what these late deciders intend to do. It happened in 2016 when Trump won unexpectedly, in 2020 when Biden won even as down-ballot Republicans did well, and in 2022 when a much-prophesied red wave failed to materialize. Yeah, those late voters can be pretty intentional

So, as you're going over the polls and casting about for some kind of clue as to what may happen, remember that there's still a lot of uncertainty. The only thing you can do is cast your own ballot, encourage your friends and family to do the same and volunteer to help out a campaign and persuade as many intentional voters as you can along the way. After that, all you can do is wait as they make their intentions known."
Harris campaigning with Liz Cheney shows the effort to win over anti-Trump Republicans,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/liz-cheney-kamala-harris-wisconsin-ripon-rcna173912,2024-10-03T21:33:17Z,"Cheney's appearance alongside Harris is notable -- especially given the deep political divisions in the country -- but it shouldn't be surprising.

Former Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the most vociferous anti-Trump Republicans in the last Congress, is campaigning with Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday in a Wisconsin town widely known as the birthplace of the Republican Party.

Cheney, who endorsed the Democrat for president last month, will join Harris' rally in Ripon, where the meeting that led to the establishment of the Republican Party took place. (Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, has also endorsed Harris.)

The Wyoming Republican's appearance with Harris is notable -- especially given the deep political divisions in the country -- but not surprising. Cheney has been a fierce critic of Donald Trump over his role in the Jan. 6 riots, and she stoked both his ire and that of his allies with her involvement in the congressional investigation of the attack on the Capitol.

Meanwhile, Harris is making a huge effort to win over disaffected Republicans, in part to demonstrate the Democrats' big tent. Several prominent Republicans had speaking slots at the Democratic National Convention in August, and Harris has said she is willing to appoint a Republican to her cabinet if she's elected. On Thursday, NBC News reported that her campaign is releasing two ads in battleground states aimed at Republican voters and former Trump supporters.

Wisconsin is a must-win state for Harris, and holding the event in Ripon has symbolic significance. One of the major arguments made by anti-Trump Republicans against the current GOP nominee is that he has rendered the party unrecognizable from its traditional values. In a town with such historical connection to the Republican Party, Cheney will once again make the case to voters that, party aside, it is simply too dangerous to elect Trump to the White House again."
Opinion | North Carolinians need help. Trump is feeding them lies.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/hurricane-helene-storm-trump-biden-harris-rcna173639,2024-10-03T16:37:10Z,"You would think the partisan hacks would give it a rest while people are dead, dying, or missing.

At least 202 people are dead across six states following Hurricane Helene, and no place was hit harder than North Carolina, where I'm from. Western North Carolina's tumbling landscapes, remote communities, and already swollen rivers made the region especially primed for disaster, and now disaster has arrived. ""This is one of the most catastrophic events that our state has ever seen,"" the state's transportation secretary said Tuesday.

And at least 40 people around Asheville, the area's largest city, died in the storm. Residents in hard-to-reach places desperately need food and water and medical supplies. It's a tragedy in real time.

You would think the partisan hacks would give it a rest while people are dead, dying, or missing. But folks out here were only spared the election gimmicks for about 100 hours. On Monday, former President Donald Trump, who's slipping behind his Democratic opponent Kamala Harris in swing states like North Carolina, began lying about the recovery efforts, at least the ones led by Democrats, falsely characterizing them as nonexistent.

""At a time like this, when a crisis hits, when our fellow citizens cry out in need ... We are not talking about politics,"" Trump said Monday, surveying the damage from Valdosta, Georgia.

Then he immediately made it about politics, claiming falsely that Biden was ""sleeping"" and couldn't be reached by leaders in hard-hit areas, and that government officials were ""going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas."" He claimed Georgia's Republican governor, Brian Kemp, couldn't get Biden on the phone, but that was directly contradicted by Kemp just hours before. That didn't stopTrump and his MAGA surrogates in the Republican Party and right-wing media from repeating and amplifying those falsehoods and others.

Some lies should be left to wither and die. Others demand a response. I'm a longtime journalist in North Carolina. Here's what's actually happening here:

Federal aid has been coming in since Saturday, a day after the storm, when President Biden responded to Gov. Roy Cooper's request and issued a disaster declaration, an important procedural step in hastening federal aid. Biden visited North Carolina Wednesday, and Cooper said he'd spoken with the president about using military assets at nearby Camp Lejeune and Fort Liberty to help out.

Biden's head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency, Deanne Criswell, has been on the ground since Monday and says FEMA plans to stay as long as they're needed. More than 57,000 people in North Carolina had requested federal aid from her agency by Tuesday, and some have already received it.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, members of the National Guard airlifted hundreds of thousands of pounds of food and supplies to desperate communities. State transportation leaders say their crews have been working around the clock to clear damaged roads and interstates for rescue workers and utility companies. Many of these isolated mountain roads were rendered impassable by mudslides and flooding which is why the progress can be heartbreakingly slow. However, Interstate 40 was reopened around Asheville Tuesday morning.

North Carolina healthcare leaders are working to assist nursing homes, assisted living facilities, and other healthcare centers cut off from power, water, and supplies. Volunteers were mobilizing to deliver food and water. And state workers were fielding an ""unprecedented"" number of phone calls to a hotline designated for people who can't reach a lost loved one.

""No matter who and where you are in western North Carolina,"" Cooper said Tuesday, ""if you need help, we are working around the clock to reach you.""

That's just a portion of federal, state and local officials' recovery work, which is boosted by private donors, businesses, and various nonprofits. Of course, Helene's victims need more. They will for years. But all these efforts aren't nothing. And they don't square with Trump and his MAGA allies' attempts to convince people that Helene is Biden's Hurricane Katrina, especially because their motivations appear to be cruel politics, not humanitarian concerns.

Communication is difficult in parts of western North Carolina right now, but imagine being there and reading Trump's lies that the cavalry isn't coming. Mark Robinson, the Trump-approved candidate for governor of North Carolina, is taking a similar approach to distract voters from his latest scandal, this one involving inflammatory posts he allegedly made on a porn messaging board between 2008 and 2012.

When the storm hit, Robinson started posing in front of broken roads with highway patrolmen, showing up and claiming credit for a supply drive run by a local county sheriff's office, and, on his X account, spreading misinformation about Cooper, ""hob-nobing"" (sic) in New York instead of preparing for the storm.

Like everything else about Robinson's candidacy, the story cracks under scrutiny. A report from North Carolina journalists found that, as the storm approached the southeastern United States last week, Robinson, who is also the state's lieutenant governor, was the only member of North Carolina's Council of State that didn't respond to Cooper's call for emergency powers, which allowed the governor to mobilize rescue efforts.

Some people who work in politics will tell you the stagecraft is part of the job, to make your candidate look like a serious leader -- whether or not it's true. They'll tell you that and then wonder why so many people hate politics.

But people know when a politician is there to help and when that politician is there to treat a disaster zone like a photo op. And hurting people, who've lost everything in the space of a few hours, like the folks out in western North Carolina, see that more clearly than most.

There's no room for artifice when you can't find your mom or your children, or if you can't get oxygen for your grandmother who depends on it.

To add insult to injury, there's the staggering hypocrisy for the MAGA politicians.

In 2017, after Hurricane Matthew killed dozens and left huge portions of eastern North Carolina underwater, then-President Trump denied North Carolina more than 99% of the federal relief funds that were requested. A good Southerner forgives but never forgets.

Rep. Virginia Foxx, a western North Carolina MAGA Republican, was also photographed helping a supply drive in the region this week, but Foxx was one of 11 Republicans who voted against providing federal aid to victims of Hurricane Katrina in 2005.

Then there's Sen. Ted Budd, who's demanding more federal aid but has voted against FEMA aid and hurricane relief for other people on multiple occasions. So has Congressman Dan Bishop, who promised Monday to ""make sure the federal government is supporting our state.""

That they're hypocrites doesn't mean North Carolina doesn't need the help, but it's meaningful. They have no mercy for others but demand it for themselves.

While in office, Trump also delayed aid for hurricane-hit Puerto Rico until just before the 2020 election and moved money from FEMA's budget to shuttle more migrants back to Mexico.

And Trump and his allies have repeatedly referred to climate change as a hoax and resisted efforts for any meaningful resistance to global warming, even though climate scientists tell us that we can expect more mammoth storms like Helene in the future.

It's not about liberal versus conservative ideology. There are plenty of well-meaning public servants in the Republican Party, the party of Ronald Reagan, John McCain, and Mitt Romney. It's about real versus fake, and death and destruction has a way of making the fake stand out.

These Republicans are frauds. They respond to emergencies like con artists and ambulance chasers, not like leaders. It takes courage as a political leader to stand in front of people who've lost everything in a disaster. You're there to listen and to try to help them. Based on Trump's stop in Georgia, he seems to be there to talk and be helped -- in this case, by scoring political points against his Democratic rivals.

In times of crisis, some politicians are there to help and some are there to stand and talk. We've seen enough of Donald Trump and his MAGA allies to know which kind they are."
Opinion | The House GOP's problems have only multiplied in the year since ousting McCarthy,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/house-gop-kevin-mcarthy-2024-election-rcna173269,2024-10-03T10:27:07Z,"GOP members of Congress are trying to pitch voters on another term in the majority. There's not much for them to sell.

Thursday marks the first anniversary of House Republicans' defining moment this term: removing the speaker they'd spent 15 rounds of voting to install just nine months earlier. The decision to oust Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., wasn't something that makes for a great campaign ad -- not for GOP members trying to earn second terms. But there's not much on the books from the last two years that makes a great case for granting Republicans another shot at the majority next year.

And yet, that's exactly what House Republicans are doing right now, taking a break from the hard work of failure to spend the next few weeks campaigning. Irrespective of what an abject catastrophe the last two years have been, roughly two dozen swing-seat Republicans are trying to convince Americans that they deserve to be the majority in the 119th Congress, as well. It's a level of audacity that should be disqualifying, not rewarded with another two years of, at best, mediocrity and, at worst, enabling the end of democracy in a second Trump administration.

While McCarthy's undignified boot from the speakership was a lowlight, the House majority hasn't exactly spent the rest of the time covering itself in glory. With only a lame-duck session awaiting after the election and another spending fight along with it, no major legislative push is planned to take advantage of those final weeks. Accordingly, the 118th Congress will go down in history as having enacted the fewest laws in modern history.

The best thing you could say for the House the last two years is that it kept the lights on in Washington -- barely. There have been five shutdown threats in that time as Republicans spent more time arguing among themselves about spending levels than debating with Democrats in the Senate and President Joe Biden in the White House. That total includes the one that got McCarthy booted after agreeing to a short-term spending bill his right flank opposed. He was on thin ice already with it, though, thanks to his decision to avoid a default by agreeing to raise the debt ceiling in April 2023.

The outrage over protecting the full faith and credit of the United States was centered in a cluster of far-right MAGA members I've dubbed the ""chaos caucus."" Their maximalist posturing was a headache for both McCarthy and his successor as speaker, Mike Johnson of Louisiana, who both have tried to appease their capricious whims. As a result, House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., was at times left struggling to pass even routine measures to clear the path for what were essentially messaging bills.

In fact, most of the credit for even the simplest tasks belongs to the minority Democrats, who were willing to swoop in and save the GOP from itself. One of the few major pieces of legislation to pass this term was a funding package providing aid to Ukraine, Israel and Taiwan. It was brought across the finishing line without a majority of the GOP caucus' support to even have the bills be debated. It also lacked the immigration bill that Republicans first insisted be included in any aid package, then it tanked at the urging of former President Donald Trump.

Even things that were nominally in Republicans' control failed to coalesce into anything substantive. Their promise to restore ""regular order"" and pass all of the 12 annual spending bills on time has once again hit a wall, without any real effort from Democrats to hinder them. Likewise, their efforts to find some sliver of pretense to impeach Biden ended with a sad fizzle, in the form of a lackluster report released after he'd ended his campaign. But, seemingly lacking anything better to do, the House Oversight Committee has pivoted to trying to find dirt on Vice President Kamala Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

This new fishing expedition against the Democratic ticket is taking place in a leaky boat with nothing but frayed lines and almost no bait to dangle. If something truly damaging does turn up as a result, it will be more due to coincidence than cunning on the part of Oversight Committee Chair Rep. James Comer, R-Ky. That said, the House did manage to impeach Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas on bogus charges, but he remains in place. The same can't be said for former Rep. George Santos, R-N.Y., whom the House did manage to expel after considering the multiple crimes he committed in the process of running for his seat.

This is the absolute mess that Republicans slunk back to their districts to sell to voters when the House recessed last week. It's only thanks to partisan gerrymandering and the rightward drift of the GOP primaries that most of those who chose to run for re-election will find themselves back in Washington next year. Those few who represent swing districts are essentially on their own to figure out what messaging to offer old-fashioned voters who expect their members of Congress to show results.

Beyond their general lack of interest in governing, Republicans have good reason to feel comfortable in their audacity. As The New York Times recently noted, ""lawmakers benefit from the bar being very low: For years, the vast majority of voters have said they hold a dim view of Congress and think it is already broken, according to polls."" It stands to reason then that the GOP's core voters not only are OK with the current state of play but want members who continue to enact the same fumbling playbook. How fortunate for the House Republican caucus -- and how unfortunate for anyone hoping to see Congress get anything done next year."
Opinion | JD Vance tried to mansplain his way into the good graces of women. It didn't work.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-vice-presidential-debate-fail-rcna173598,2024-10-02T23:54:23Z,"Vance admits Republicans have a problem when it comes to women's trust. That doesn't mean he has a plan.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance arguably had one job going into Tuesday night's debate: convince the American public that he, and his party, don't hate women.

Even with that painfully low bar, I'd say he failed to do the job. The once anti-Trump senator did wear a pink tie, but did not face up to his past comments about menopausal women, ""childless cat ladies"" and a historically low favorability rate. Instead, he used most of his allotted speaking time to mansplain his views to the two women who were moderating, women who vote, and even his own wife.

During a question on immigration, Vance tried to talk over CBS moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, after he regurgitated dangerous lies about Haitian immigrants living in Springfield, Ohio. To Vance's dismay, Brennan reminded the audience that the immigrants in Springfield are there legally.

""The rules that you were not going to fact-check,"" Vance quipped, referring to CBS' statement that it would leave it to Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to fact check each other during the debate. ""And since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

Vance talked over and interrupted both O'Donnell and Brennan as they tried to move forward with the debate.

""Thank you, senator, for describing the legal process,"" Brennan said, before the network then muted Vance's mic.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get into. Thank you for explaining the legal process,"" she added, in a tone every woman sitting in a cubicle, boardroom or classroom knows deep in her bones.

Unlike his windmill-, shark- and Hannibal Lecter-obsessed running mate, Vance deftly wields a very specific type of misogyny that, while far less obvious, is just as insidious -- one that can come off as empathic, but is undeniably condescending as it normalizes the most draconian right-wing policies.

One example of this was Vance consistently referring to Brennan -- a woman he does not personally know -- by her first name rather than addressing her appropriately. The slight-of-hand misogynistic move may have been Vance's attempt to appear likable and down-to-earth, but many viewers saw it differently: condescending, patronizing and rude.

Vance himself admitted that the Republican Party has a problem when it comes to women's trust. He reminded women watching Tuesday that they do not trust Republicans when it comes to abortion and the human right to bodily autonomy -- yet failed to explain how he, his running mate and his fellow party members plan to address the problem.

""We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don't trust us,"" Vance said, before claiming that is ""one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do.""

To demonstrate his party's commitment to earning that end, Vance lied about not supporting a nationwide abortion ban, the realities of abortion care later in pregnancy, and Minnesota's PRO Act, signed by his opponent, Gov. Tim Walz. Because nothing says ""trust me, I know what's best for you"" like holding an impromptu masterclass on gaslighting.

While Vance was able to appear far more level-headed than Trump in his fateful debate performance against Vice President Kamala Harris last month, it was Vance's faux praise of his wife while discussing the necessity of child care that truly embodied his very specific type of mansplaining and misogyny.

""I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I'm so proud of her,"" Vance began. ""But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult.""

It's telling, when a man publicly laments the challenges his working wife faces, yet doesn't seem to face those same challenges as a working father. While appearing to appreciate all his wife does, Vance still chose to mansplain how hard it is to work outside the home while managing the majority of child care and household responsibilities without structural support -- the exact structural support Republicans have historically opposed.

For his bropropriating coup de grâce, Vance then pontificated on the importance of giving a ""family care model that makes choice possible.""

""The cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want,"" Vance said, ignoring how anti-abortion laws make it difficult, dangerous and in some cases impossible for women to choose when and how to start creating a ""family model"" in the first place.

Overall, it's true that during Tuesday's debate Vance succeeded in portraying himself as a level-headed, somewhat ordinary politician (if the definition of ""ordinary"" is calmly discussing the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history). But that is perhaps what makes Vance far more Machiavellian than Trump even. And it's what should put us all on high alert as we prepare to head to the polls in November."
"Trump, who has insulted Jewish voters who don't support him, to attend Oct. 7 memorial event",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/trump-october-7-memorial-event-golf-club-rcna173678,2024-10-02T21:46:48Z,"The Republican presidential nominee intends to speak at the event, which is scheduled to be held at the Trump National Doral Miami, one of his golf courses. (It's unclear if the Trump campaign is also organizing the event; the campaign did not respond immediately to a request for comment.)

""President Trump has always condemned antisemitism and will continue to do so once he is back in the Oval Office,"" his campaign said in a statement. ""He will hold accountable those who perpetuate violence against the Jewish people, and as such, America will be safe and patriotic again.""

Trump has long claimed to be the most pro-Israel U.S. president in history. He has accused the Biden administration of not being supportive enough of Israel, even as the White House has provided unconditional military and financial support to its ally despite the soaring death toll in Gaza. (Trump's anti-Muslim and anti-Palestinian beliefs are also well documented.)

Yet Trump himself also has a history of invoking antisemitic tropes and has rubbed shoulders with white nationalists and Holocaust deniers. He singled out Jewish Democratic lawmakers, like Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York and Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, for attacks. In a radio interview in July, Trump claimed that Vice President Kamala Harris ""doesn't like Jewish people"" and appeared to agree when the host called Harris' husband, Doug Emhoff, a ""crappy Jew.""

Trump has also repeatedly denigrated Jewish Democrats in remarks about the election, even at events focused on combating antisemitism. He said that any Jewish person who votes for a Democrat ""hates their religion"" and that ""they should be ashamed of themselves."" He claimed that Jewish and Black people vote for Democrats out of ""habit"" and said that if he loses the 2024 election, Jewish voters ""would have a lot to do"" with it -- a line that drew outrage from Jewish groups."
"In Helene's aftermath, Trump's views on climate change get worse",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/helenes-aftermath-trumps-views-climate-change-get-worse-rcna173612,2024-10-02T15:16:03Z,"In the deadly aftermath of Hurricane Helene, JD Vance's and Donald Trump's approach to the climate crisis appears to be getting worse, not better.

Early on in the vice presidential debate, Sen. JD Vance described climate change as ""a very important issue."" For a fleeting moment, that seemed encouraging.

The moment didn't last. The Ohio Republican quickly added that many Americans ""are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water.""

Part of the problem with the answer was the simple fact that air and water quality in the United States got worse, not better, during Trump's presidency. But just as notable was the disconnect between the question and the answer: In GOP senator's mind, the key to understanding climate change is focusing on air and water quality, as if they're all the same thing. They're not, no matter how many times the former president -- and now his running mate -- pretend otherwise.

But if the Republican vice presidential nominee's approach to the climate crisis was a mess, Trump's was worse. NBC News reported on the former president's remarks at a press conference in Milwaukee, where he delivered ""sometimes hard-to-follow comments.""

None of this made any sense. The planet hasn't gotten cooler; the climate crisis and the weather aren't the same thing; the climate crisis is also unrelated to air and water pollution; and no sane person could seriously describe Trump as ""an environmentalist.""

But he said all of this with a straight face anyway.

But that's not all he said. In the deadly aftermath of Hurricane Helene, the Republican also suggested no one cares about climate change anymore. Two days earlier, he told a Pennsylvania audience that the climate crisis is ""one of the great scams of all time.""

Eight years ago this week, Hillary Clinton reminded voters that then-candidate Trump referred to climate change as ""a Chinese hoax."" The former secretary of state was correct -- he really was on record saying that -- but the Republican denied it. Two years later, the then-president even conceded, ""I don't think it's a hoax.""

At the time, the GOP nominee seemed to realize that much of the American electorate was concerned about the intensifying effects of global warning, so it made political sense for him to distance himself from overt climate denialism.

In 2024, however, Trump just doesn't care. He seems to now believe that overt climate denialism will not stand in the way of his White House ambitions at all.

This is causing no shortage of international anxieties. As a Politico report summarized this past weekend, ""Pro-climate government officials and environmental activists have had months to think about a strategy for preventing a second Donald Trump presidency from disrupting their efforts to save the world. They've come up with one main idea: Hope Vice President Kamala Harris wins."""
Why JD Vance's 'fact-checking flashpoint' in the debate mattered,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/jd-vances-fact-checking-flashpoint-debate-mattered-rcna173588,2024-10-02T13:23:12Z,"The Ohio senator spent much of the vice presidential debate brazenly lying. No wonder he grew agitated in response to a brief fact-check from a moderator.

About a third of the way into the vice presidential debate, the discussion turned to Springfield, Ohio -- a community torn apart by a racist and false conspiracy theory promoted by the both members of the Republican Party's presidential ticket. It was against this backdrop that Sen. JD Vance, who ostensibly represents the city, referred to ""millions of illegal immigrants"" and parts of the country that have been ""destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border.""

The Republican senator was peddling a multi-layered lie: The border isn't ""open""; the vice president isn't responsible for the nation's immigration laws; and Springfield's Haitian immigrants entered the country legally. Indeed, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democratic nominee, took the opportunity to note that his rival had ""vilified a large number of people who were here legally.""

At that point, one of the debate's moderators, CBS News' Margaret Brennan, told viewers, ""To clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio, does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

The GOP nominee was not having it. The New York Times referred to it as the debate's ""fact-checking flashpoint,"" and NBC News' report summarized it this way:

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" the senator complained.

In reality, even that wasn't quite true: As the Times' report noted, CBS News executives had indicated ahead of the event ""that the moderators may choose to clarify a fuzzy point if they determined it had been left unclear.""

Or put another way, Vance lied about fact-checking after having lied about immigration policy.

But the on-air clash had a larger significance. The Ohio Republican wasn't upset because the debate moderators were wrong; he was upset because the debate moderators were telling the public the truth.

And as Vance made clear over the course of the evening, telling the truth simply wasn't part of his debate strategy.

Much of the post-event analysis has focused on the fact that the young senator appeared polished, smooth, and well-prepared for much of the debate, while Walz, who missed some opportunities, seemed nervous and at times unsteady. Those assessments are largely fair. But more important than the GOP candidate's presentation and style was the fact that he spent much of the evening peddling an alternate reality with little resemblance to the real world.

I recently wrote a book about Republican efforts to rewrite recent history, and even I was amazed at Vance's brazenness when it came to waging war against the recent past.

The GOP nominee lied about Trump and the Affordable Care Act. He lied about the ""peaceful"" transfer of power after Trump's 2020 defeat. He lied about his earlier support for a national abortion ban. He lied about his party's regressive 2017 tax breaks. This is a small sampling from a much longer list of obvious falsehoods.

A separate New York Times analysis said Vance showed ""a knack for revising history,"" which was a polite way of saying the senator spent the evening lying to the electorate about matters large and small. A Washington Post report added that Vance ""dominated on the falsehood meter.""

No wonder he seemed quite agitated about moderators telling the truth: The Republican was busy trying to pull a con on the American electorate, and the CBS News anchors were interfering with his scam.

A couple of weeks ago, Vance conceded that he's willing to ""create stories"" to advance his goals. It was hard not to think of this line during this year's only vice presidential debate."
"Opinion | The VP debate left me with one big, lingering question",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-tim-walz-vp-debate-vice-presidential-rcna172751,2024-10-02T10:48:08Z,"The vice presidential debate is over, which means the pundits will now spend the next 48 hours talking about who ""won."" Here's my answer: nobody. Certainly not the American people. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen JD Vance of Ohio spoke to their respective audiences. I doubt they did much to convince undecided voters. And they did nothing at all to inspire. At the end of the night, I was left with just one question: Is this the best we've got?

Let's start by giving the howler of the night to Vance, who said he has been ""extremely consistent"" in his views on former President Donald Trump and Trump-style politics. Sure, and Joe Biden is planning to run the New York City Marathon next month.

Back when he was the iconoclastic author of ""Hillbilly Elegy,"" Vance worried Trump could be ""America's Hitler,"" which seems like something you say about a guy you are not super-fond of. He continued to hold such critical views of Trump until 2020.

So how did Vance end up as Trump's running mate? During the vice presidential debate Tuesday night, Vance said he had ""believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of [Trump's] record."" Right, that must be it: The guy who wears his time at Yale Law as lightly as a cinder block lacked the sophistication to properly judge Trump's record. In fact, he seems to have judged it pretty well, until his ambition kicked in.

So there was the MAGA convert extraordinaire and least popular vice presidential candidate in recent memory onstage at the CBS News studio on 57th Street, shilling for a man he once likened to a genocidal dictator. Politics sure does sound like a lot of fun, doesn't it?

Vance declined to walk back the lies he has promulgated about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio. And his thoughts on school shootings were crushingly meager: ""We have to make the doors lock better,"" he said with what appeared to be a straight face. In 1991, former President Ronald Reagan came out in favor of an assault weapons ban. And now the party he once led is talking about better locks. His daughter Patti Davis recently wrote in The New York Times that he would ""weep"" for America today.

To be fair, conservatives seem to think Vance did a fine job of defending Trump's record. Alyssa Farrah Griffin, a former Trump White House staffer who now opposes him, offered that Vance was a ""very good communicator,"" though one who ""lacks authenticity."" Sure enough, Vance wasn't Sarah Palin or Dan Quayle. But it's a sad comment on our politics that those are standards on which we judge our candidates.

For that matter, I can't say that Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, his Democratic opponent and Kamala Harris' running mate, did all that much better. He doesn't creep me out the way Vance does, with his undercooked musings on demography, but he doesn't thrill me, either.

When he was introduced by Harris as her running mate several years ago (what, that was only August?) Walz said he couldn't wait ""to debate the guy,"" promptly making a joke about Vance romancing a couch. After months of watching Biden plod through the motions of campaigning, Democrats were happy to laugh. But when the debate finally came, there was much less to celebrate.

In old clips from the Minnesota State Fair, Walz perfectly plays the part of the normie dad. But in a suit, onstage, he is just like another politician -- and not an especially adept one, at that.

He looked nervous, and his voice sounded thin. Asked about a lie he'd told about being in Hong Kong during the protests in Tiananmen Square in Beijing in 1989, Walz stammered through a largely incoherent response. ""Many times I talk a lot, I get caught up in the rhetoric,"" he finally said. Fair enough, but haven't we had enough political leaders who get caught in their own rhetoric?

Ahead of the debate, Times opinion columnist Pamela Paul wrote that ""we need to hear more from the ticket beyond Harris' broken-record talk about small businesses, middle-class Americans and abortion rights, as safe and winning as those ideas may be."" We didn't. Instead, Walz reiterated that Harris would practice ""the politics of joy,"" whatever that means.

To be clear, I don't think the two candidates, or presidential tickets, are equal. Asked about election integrity, Vance repeated shameless lies about the 2020 election and the Jan. 6 riot at the U.S. Capitol, which Trump instigated and most Republicans defended. Asked bluntly by Walz whether Trump lost the 2020 election, Vance started talking nonsensically about ""censorship."" His fear came clearly through my small television screen.

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz shot back. I concur with Puck reporter Tara Palmeri, who said that, in that exchange, the Minnesota governor delivered what ""might be one of the best lines of the debate."" It showed who Vance was, how little intellectual courage he has, the enormous compromises he has had to make to reach the summit of Republican politics.

Enjoy the view from Mount MAGA, JD. I don't think you will be there for very long."
"Opinion | Who will win? Election forecasters think it's Harris, but they've been wrong before",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/trump-harris-election-forecasts-predictions-rcna173277,2024-10-02T10:48:06Z,"Models looking at everything from polls to economic conditions show a narrow Harris win.

Can science predict the future? The great science fiction author Isaac Asimov wrote a series of books in which a scientist figures out a way to do just that.

""It was the science of human behavior reduced to mathematical equations,"" Asimov wrote in one of the books in his Foundation series. ""The individual human being is unpredictable, but the reactions of human mobs ... could be treated statistically.""

It's a great concept for a book series -- and a well-reviewed streaming TV show -- but in the real world, it falls flat.

The subject has come up again as we are now just a month out from a hotly contested election that could determine everything from the future of abortion rights to the strength of American democratic institutions. It would be comforting to hear from an expert who can read the tea leaves and tell us who will win.

Demand is so high that multiple models are competing for dominance, and two of the biggest forecasters -- historian Allan Lichtman and close poll reader Nate Silver -- got into an online feud over the weekend over how to read the ""13 keys"" that Lichtman uses to make his predictions. (Lichtman says they predict a Kamala Harris win, but Silver argues they actually favor Donald Trump.)

""Allan let's just say the little tricks you've played with the Keys in the past will come back to haunt you! The Keys shall be respected,"" posted Silver, in what sounded like something the villain in a children's movie shouts shortly before an army of elves overtakes the castle.

If you're not sure about the 13 keys, you could look instead at the Misery Index, a crude measure developed by an adviser to President Lyndon Johnson that combines the unemployment rate and the inflation rate, which will tell you the numbers are looking good for Harris. Or you can check out the more sophisticated Time for Change model, which zeroes in on the popularity of the current president, the state of the economy and the number of terms the incumbent party has been in the White House. That also predicts a narrow Harris win.

Or maybe, like Silver, you favor polls. In that case, you can look at 538's proprietary mix of polls, economic and demographic data to see that Harris is projected to win 57 out of 100 times (Silver is no longer with 538). If you're willing to pay, you can see Silver's own forecast, which is based on his new model. Or you can just look at the state-by-state polls yourself and obsessively play with the maps on 270 to Win while muttering about crucial Waukesha County.

Or perhaps you like the newfangled prediction markets, which ask bettors to put their money where their mouth is. PredictIt has a bet on a Harris win at 56 cents, with Trump as the underdog at 47 cents, while VirtualTout blends PredictIt data with some fancy math to come up with a forecast for a ""strong Democratic victory.""

The good news for these forecasters is that if Harris wins, they'll all get to claim that their models were accurate. And if Trump wins, they can say that, after all, their models showed only a high probability of a Harris win, or they'll switch to talking about the popular vote.

The problem with all of these models, however, is that they attempt to make iron laws out of the scrap metal of past elections. We've had only 59 presidential elections since the Constitution went into effect -- even fewer if you consider only those since the expansion of voting rights, the advent of TV news and the development of sophisticated voter targeting in the 20th century. Statistically speaking, that's just not a lot of data.

More recently, you can throw in the complications the Electoral College has caused since 2000 by diverging twice from the national popular vote, the increasingly intense partisanship and the closely divided elections, and it's basically impossible to make definitive predictions. Would your favored political model have predicted an Al Gore or George W. Bush win in 2000? Did it predict Trump or Joe Biden winning by tens of thousands of votes in a handful of swing states?

If your model assumes how voters will respond to a president running for re-election, how does it factor in the president's dropping out and endorsing his vice president just months before the election? Or a former president's running for a nonconsecutive second term? What about a candidate who was impeached for trying to overturn the results of the last election?

Most models can be useful to a point. They can give us the general sense of the political landscape or enough information to start make contingency plans for after the election. If Harris wins, maybe the models will make at least some voters less open to bogus arguments that the election was stolen. (I'm not holding my breath on that one.) And some can tell us how well a generic Democratic or Republican candidate might have done in a particular environment, which can help the parties review their strategies.

But ultimately, we aren't voting for a generic candidate. We have to choose between two specific people, with their own strengths and weaknesses. And sometimes the polls, the economic models and the betting markets can't measure that.

In Asimov's series, the scientist's predictions of the future are accurate for centuries until, through random chance, a man is born with a mutation that allows him to psychically manipulate other people's emotions, creating fear and devotion in order to rise to power. That proposition -- that predictions of the future ultimately cannot account for the unknown or the unexpected -- is worth keeping in mind as we head into the November election, especially given that we have a candidate on the ballot who's adept at creating fear and devotion.

In the end, election forecasts are not bad at telling us how the future will look, as long as it continues to look like the past."
Opinion | This is the rare vice presidential debate that actually matters,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-tim-walz-vp-debate-vice-presidential-rcna172750,2024-10-01T23:15:15Z,"""Ain't nobody coming to see you, Otis"" is an iconic line from ""The Temptations,"" a 1998 NBC miniseries. Delivered by the actor playing David Ruffin, it's a boast that the audience was not paying to see anyone else in the group, just Ruffin. Conventional wisdom says one could apply this logic to Tuesday's vice presidential debate between Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance of Ohio.

In a ""normal election,"" a debate between the No. 2s on the ticket would be interesting but not statistically significant. The rule for a vice presidential debate is generally the same election to election: Stick to the top of the ticket's message, draw a contrast with the challenger anchored in that message and, crucially, do no harm. Conventional wisdom says people do not cast ballots because of whom the Democratic or Republican nominee chose as an eventual governing partner. It's the name on the top of the ticket that matters.

However, this is not a normal election, and I disagree with the conventional wisdom. Running mates matter, and tonight's debate is quite significant!

If the nominees' choice for potential governing partner did not matter, then there would no reason to put them on the stage together before the election. Choosing a running mate is the first presidential-level decision a major party nominee makes. It is a statement about who they are and what their agenda and legacy will be if elected president. In selecting the millennial Vance, former President Donald Trump tripled down on Trumpism, cementing it as a key pillar of the Republican Party apparatus and the bedrock of the GOP's next generation.

In selecting Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris signaled that the Democratic tent is big and that she is serious about making her bold plans on child care, reproductive freedom and the economy a reality. Just look at what her running mate has done in Minnesota when it comes to those issues.

Tonight's debate could be the last time voters hear from the campaigns in a forum at which they are mandated to stand next to each other and defend their plans. A literal split screen where the comments of both participants will take center stage. That alone raises the stakes.

Vance will have to answer for his treasure trove of soundbites on everything from likening Trump to Hitler and the racist conspiratorial lies about Haitian people in his home state, to name just two. Walz will be asked to defend his record in Minnesota (because apparently feeding children is too progressive) and his military service record. Regardless of what the moderators ask, a candidate who is well prepared will answer the question then quickly pivot out of the conversation about themselves and back to the issues and their No. 1. This is not always easy to do, but it is critical.

When we first sat down for debate prep in 2020 with then-Sen. Harris, we initially focused on ensuring she knew what then-candidate Joe Biden had said publicly about each issue. It was important she was well versed in his thoughts, so she knew the contours of where and how far to go in discussing any particular topic.

The last thing a campaign wants is the running mate making unauthorized news.

When Vance sat down with my colleague Kristen Welker on ""Meet the Press,"" he emphatically stated Trump would not sign a national abortion ban into law. And yet, during Trump's second debate this cycle, he walked back Vance's answer on national television. Vance will want to avoid making the same mistake tonight, but a large part of being vice president is speaking for the president. If Vance cannot do that in a debate, why would he be able to do it at the White House?

For Walz, he will have to walk the tightrope of part attack dog and part explainer. This is an area where many voters still say they want to know more about Harris' plans, so Walz will have to use his time wisely, find moments to speak directly to the people at home and explain how a prospective Harris-Walz administration would make a difference for families across the country. Much has been said about Walz not being a seasoned debater, but remember he was a high school teacher and a football coach! One could say he honed his oratory skills in the lion's den.

In 2020, during Harris' debate prep, we had many internal discussions about how to handle the question of age if it came up. Tonight, Walz won't have that problem. Harris will turn 60 this month; however, Vance will have to speak to why Americans should trust 78-year-old Donald Trump to sit behind the resolute desk again and if he himself -- a freshman senator with no legislative accomplishments and no other political or government experience -- would actually be ready to lead the country if duty called.

Tonight, while no one will be looking for Otis, all political eyes will be on Tim Walz and JD Vance."
Opinion | What the right and left still get wrong about Gus Walz,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/gus-tim-walz-son-debate-emotions-dnc-rcna172573,2024-10-01T20:20:18Z,"Gus Walz cries as Democratic vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz speaks during the Democratic National Convention in Chicago on Aug. 21.Matt Rourke / AP

When Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz accepted the vice presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention, almost immediately everyone zeroed in on his son Gus' emotional reaction in which the teen said, ""That's my dad."" When Vice President Kamala Harris selected Walz as her running mate, the family spoke to People magazine about the fact that Gus a has nonverbal learning disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. That means Gus is multiply neurodivergent.

At the time, I wrote that the Walz family's approach to Gus was a welcome antidote to how parents have long spoken of their neurodivergent children -- because rather than trying to ""fix"" Gus, the family focused on making sure he can live a good life.

As the vice presidential debate between Walz and Sen. JD Vance approaches, it's clear too many people missed that point. Too many people missed that point. Right-wingers engaged in cruelty, with Ann Coulter mocking the younger Walz's show of emotion. This is wholly unsurprising, given the fact that ableism is now a defining feature of the Republican Party -- from its mockery of Sen. John Fetterman, D-Pa., for using a closed captioning device after surviving a stroke to ridiculing Harris for describing what she looked like for low-vision people during an event with disability rights activists. And who can forget Trump mocking New York Times reporter Serge Kovaleski, who has a disability, during his 2016 campaign?

In response, plenty of liberals sought to use the moment to elevate Walz. Case in point, Ana Navarro, a co-host on ""The View"" who served as an emcee at the DNC, said, ""Teens like Gus can have trouble regulating their emotions in social settings,"" adding: ""Leave him the f--- alone, you ghouls."" Author and minister John Pavlovitz responded to Coulter, saying, ""He deals with ADHD, anxiety, and a nonverbal learning disorder. He was overcome with pride and love for his father.""

I understand the impulse behind wanting to defend Gus Walz and the way he expresses himself. But these sympathetic commentators provide a mirror image of the mockery that conservative pundits hurled toward Gus. While conservatives needlessly mocked Gus for the way he expressed himself without understanding his disability, his defenders almost provided an excuse and a rationale.

By saying simply that Gus has a disability and therefore it's OK for him to express himself, they are still implying something is wrong with the way he expresses himself. The true beauty of that moment with the Walz family is not that they love Gus despite his emotionality. Rather, it's that they recognize the way he expresses himself and the love he has for his family as valid and just as worthy as the way his other family members express themselves.

While many were understandably overcome with emotion watching the younger Walz, what made just as strong an impression on me was how mother Gwen and sister Hope reacted to his display for his dad. Rather than tamp him down, they allowed him to show all of himself on an incredibly public stage. They did not stop him or get him to tone it down.

Pundits have spilled gallons of ink on how Tim Walz offers a healthier version of masculinity. They pontificate about how he served his country in the military and was a defensive coordinator for the high school football team where he taught, along with the fact he served as the faculty adviser for Mankato West's gay-straight alliance, as well as his willingness to discuss going through fertility treatments with his wife, Gwen. The Harris campaign has embraced his everyman aesthetic as part of its overtures to white working-class voters.

Walz's embrace of his son Gus should be seen through that lens. Just as the governor sees no daylight between supporting his gay students and shooting pheasants, he seems to embrace how his son is growing into being a man.

This is a positive development. In recent months, I've been writing my second book about autism, neurodivergence and masculinity. While many autistic and neurodivergent women and people assigned female at birth find themselves forced to mask their symptoms, many times, autistic men also do it to try to avoid being ostracized. In the past, I've masked my stims or any visible neurodivergent traits out of fear of ridicule or because I was not ""manly enough.""

But expressions of emotion are just as valid and worthy, including those by men, regardless of their neurotype. Gus may have expressed himself differently than others may choose, but he only expressed the feelings many sons would have if their dad said they loved them in such a public way. Incidentally, former first lady Michelle Obama had a more correct response than some other people. Rather than excusing Gus Walz's expression of affection for his dad as a side effect of his disability, she correctly thanked him for ""showing us all what real love looks like, Gus."" (Her late father, Fraser Robinson, lived with multiple sclerosis.)

This embrace of how Gus Walz expresses himself also has larger policy implications. If society chooses not to see neurodivergent behaviors negatively, then it can start from the point of asking what support systems neurodivergent people need in order to live their fullest selves. This reorients decades of policy that focused on ""combating"" developmental disabilities more toward serving them and changing the world around them.

Far too often, well-meaning people feel the need to defend neurodivergent or disabled people. But Tim and Gus Walz offer a challenge to those same people; not to consistently defend or excuse them, but to treat their types of love as valid as anything else."

The vice presidential debate Tuesday between Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz will likely be your last chance to see the two campaigns square off before the election.

With the two running mates not as well-known as the tops of the tickets, many people will be watching just to get to know them. Others will be looking for how they represent the tickets.

So what should you watch for?

We asked some MSNBC analysts to weigh in on what they will be watching for during the debate. Here's what they said.

Follow live updates covering the 2024 vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz.

There's an underappreciated point of distinction between Walz and Vance: At their debate, one will find it vastly easier to defend his running mate.

When the vice presidential nominees share the stage, I'll be watching to see just how much the Republican senator struggles, not only to defend Donald Trump's latest scandals, lies and missteps, but also to distance himself from his own condemnations of the former president -- some of which he reportedly voiced as recently as 2020.

It's a challenge the Minnesota governor won't have to worry about: He and Kamala Harris were, are and almost certainly will remain on the same page.

Walz has lived a charmed existence since being tapped for VP, but we're about to learn whether he can take a punch. It will be very interesting to see how he handles real scrutiny and tough questions, which he's so far been able to avoid.

Walz's superpower is his relatability. Vance's biggest liability is his inability to connect with human beings. I'll be looking out for Walz to exploit that difference, especially by highlighting some of Vance's more extreme positions on abortion, marriage, reproductive rights and more. We'll see if Vance is suddenly going to run away from all of those Christofascist views that he was so quick to espouse on the right-wing podcast circuit before he became the Republican vice presidential nominee. My guess is that he'll certainly try.

Vance has a hard choice to make: try to show balance and get his historically low favorability numbers up or please Trump. This means he will have to attack but not cough up a hairball. Gov., aka ""Coach,"" Walz must show that he is more than just a nice guy. He must show command of the issues and not fumble the ball.

Quite simply: Will CBS fact-check the candidates, or will it outsource that to the candidates themselves? This seems like an especially important question given JD Vance's serial lies about Haitian immigrants, but it also goes to the question of whether the media has been browbeaten into eschewing its most important function: the dissemination of truth."
"Walz-Vance VP debate is tonight: Live updates, analysis and commentary",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/politics/2024-election/live-blog/walz-vance-vice-presidential-debate-live-updates-rcna171510,2024-10-01T17:32:49Z,"Here's who stood in for Walz and Vance during their debate prep

On ""Saturday Night Live"" last weekend, Walz was portrayed by comedian Jim Gaffigan. During Vance's final debate rehearsals, the task of playing the Minnesota governor fell to a fellow Minnesotan: Rep. Tom Emmer.

As NBC reported:

The choice of Emmer as a stand-in for Walz provides the Vance team with another Minnesotan and someone who, like Vance and Walz, has deep Midwest roots. Emmer, the House majority whip, has emphasized his past as a youth ice hockey coach. Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign has been emphasizing Walz's experience coaching high school football.

Yet another native Midwesterner -- Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg -- played the role of Vance during Walz's own debate prep."
"Ahead of the VP debate, Trump claims event will be rigged against Vance",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/ahead-vp-debate-trump-claims-event-will-rigged-vance-rcna173453,2024-10-01T16:09:10Z,"One of the keys to understanding Donald Trump's worldview is acknowledging one of his core, conspiratorial beliefs: The former president believes just about just about everything in American society -- from elections to the judicial system to the Emmys -- has been ""rigged"" by nefarious forces he never identifies.

With this in mind, it's not surprising the Republican has told anyone who would listen that his debate with Vice President Kamala Harris was, of course, ""rigged."" Indeed, Trump sat down this week for a Fox Nation interview with Kellyanne Conway, who heard him continue to whine about the debate he lost three weeks ago.

But that's not all he said: In the same on-camera exchange, the GOP nominee also made a prediction on the eve of the vice presidential debate. Asked by his former White House aide about the prospects for additional debates, Trump said:

As the video makes clear, the former president, who has suggested targeting ABC's broadcast license because he didn't like his recent debate defeat, was not kidding.

To the extent that reality still has any meaning, the vice presidential debate has not been rigged against the Republican nominee. Last month's Trump-Harris debate wasn't ""stacked,"" either. The larger question, however, is why the former president is already attacking a debate that hasn't happened yet.

The answer, of course, is that Trump realizes that his running mate might fare poorly, so he considers it smart to attack the integrity of the event in advance.

As regular readers know, it's a process I like to call preemptive delegitimization.

Fearing possible election defeats, for example, the Republican has consistently taken steps to delegitimize the process to explain away potential losses. Fearing possible legal setbacks, he's also repeatedly tried to delegitimize the justice system to invalidate potential adverse outcomes. And fearing possible debate defeats, he's done the same thing, making pre-emptive excuses for possible failure ahead of his recent debate with President Joe Biden, and then doing it again ahead of his debate with Harris.

Trump approaches effectively every challenge with the same thought: ""If I fail, it can't be my fault.""

This week, Trump took the next logical step and extended his pitiful bubble to include his running mate."
Trump caught lying repeatedly about response to Hurricane Helene,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/trump-caught-lying-repeatedly-response-hurricane-helene-rcna173407,2024-10-01T13:19:19Z,"What kind of would-be leader lies about a deadly natural disaster? When it comes to Donald Trump and Hurricane Helene, it's not a rhetorical question.

When it comes to hurricanes, Donald Trump's record is an embarrassment. Indeed, some of the low points of the Republican's failed presidency were directly related to his bizarre reactions to brutal storms: From ""Sharpiegate"" to ""big water,"" from his odd unfamiliarity with Category 5 hurricanes to lobbing paper towels as if he were having fun shooting free throws, the GOP candidate's background is tough to defend.

But it wasn't just a matter of gaffes and photo-ops gone awry. As a New York Times report explained, ""As president, he viewed federal aid through the prism of his personal politics, threatening to withhold money from governors of blue states whom he saw as enemies, and promising 'A-plus' treatment for his allies.""

But that doesn't mean his record can't get worse. NBC News reported:

Hours earlier, the Republican governor said the opposite, describing the helpful and constructive conversation he had with Biden, and letting the public know that he appreciated the president's offers of support.

It'd be easier to overlook if this were Trump's only break with reality, but it was not. The former president also falsely argued that the Biden administration and North Carolina's Democratic governor were ""going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas,"" which was absurd on its face, and made worse by the fact that Asheville and the surrounding area is heavily Democratic.

When NBC News asked the Republican to substantiate his aid-related conspiracy theories, he walked away.

Trump also baselessly accused Vice President Kamala Harris of staging a photograph of her talking on the phone with FEMA officials, and his claims immediately fell apart.

Alas, we can keep going. Trump told reporters that ""nobody"" could have forecast Hurricane Helene, which wasn't true, before added that it's ""late in the season for the hurricanes,"" which also wasn't true.

My personal favorite was Trump, during an appearance in Georgia, telling reporters, ""We're not talking about politics now,"" even as he talks about politics. As an Associated Press report summarized, ""Donald Trump repeatedly spread falsehoods Monday about the federal response to Hurricane Helene despite claiming not to be politicizing the disaster as he toured hard-hit areas in south Georgia.""

Part of the problem, of course, is that the GOP nominee was lying to the public about an important crisis five weeks before Election Day. Another part of the problem was Trump's apparent instinct to try to divide people rather than pulling people together in a time of need.

But just as notable is the broader question hanging overhead: What kind of would-be leader lies about a deadly natural disaster?

At a campaign event last week, Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, Trump's controversial running mate, insisted that the ""most important thing"" is ""having a person of character"" in the Oval Office. It was an easy sentiment to agree with. It also set a standard that his running mate can't meet."
Opinion | JD Vance isn't ready,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-trump-vice-president-job-qualifications-rcna173109,2024-10-01T10:34:36Z,"The first-term senator doesn't have nearly the experience necessary to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.

Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, hope to use Tuesday night's vice presidential debate to bolster their respective running mates' chances in November. Facing a yawning favorability gap with Walz, Vance is readying via both traditional mock debates -- with Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., standing in for Walz -- and the constant back-and-forth Vance keeps up with reporters on the trail.

But as vice president, Vance would have to be ready for one main task: assuming the presidency. It is a duty that nine vice presidents before him have had to fulfill. It is also a possibility we need to discuss given that if Donald Trump returns to the White House, he would be the oldest person ever sworn in as president. Unfortunately, Vance is in no way ready to step in should Trump be no longer able to function as president.

It's true that the vice presidency itself was originally something of an afterthought for the country's founders. They tasked the vice president with presiding over the Senate only to give the role something concrete to do besides be a backup executive. But Article II, which supposedly lays out what happens if a vacancy occurs in the presidency, isn't crystal clear: It says only ""In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or Inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President.""

The lack of specificity was a problem from its first major test, when President William Henry Harrison died in 1841 after just 31 days in office. The question that Vice President John Tyler faced was whether he would be an ""acting"" or ""temporary"" president, one who merely took on the tasks of the presidency, or would he succeed to the office himself. Tyler decided on the latter, immediately taking the presidential oath of office. And though he was never a popular chief executive, nobody seemed inclined to challenge this new precedent regarding presidential succession.

In modern times, the vice president's role has grown beyond the constitutional duties assigned to include whatever policy portfolios the president delegates. But the essential duty remains stepping into the presidency if required. It's almost certain that the debate moderators will ask Vance and Walz whether they feel up to the job at some point during the debate.

Of course, both candidates will say ""yes"" if they are asked; what matters is how many viewers believe their answers. And looking at the experience the two candidates have, there's much more evidence to support Walz's readiness than that of Vance. The Democrat is in his second term as governor of Minnesota, giving him years of practice running an executive office. Before that, he spent 12 years in the House, getting an up-close look at how the federal government functions and the way the legislative sausage gets made.

In contrast, Vance is in just his second year as an elected official. He has passed no major legislation, and several of those bills that he has submitted have had no co-sponsors at all. Before winning his seat in 2022, he was an author and a Silicon Valley gadabout and served four years in the Marines, mostly as a war correspondent.

This makes Vance the least experienced vice presidential candidate since then-Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska was tapped to join the GOP ticket in 2008. The public was deeply skeptical of Palin's readiness to lead after less than two years as governor, according to a USA Today/Gallup poll taken the day Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., chose her as his running mate. Of those surveyed, 39% said she was ""ready to serve as president if needed,"" with 33% saying she wasn't and 29% having ""no opinion"" about the then-unknown governor. At the time, that was ""the lowest vote of confidence in a running mate since the elder George Bush chose then-Indiana senator Dan Quayle to join his ticket in 1988,"" according to ABC News.

Incredibly, Vance has managed to beat that record. According to a late July poll from YouGov, only 29% of respondents believed Vance ready to serve as president, with 38% percent saying he isn't and another 33% unsure. Vance performed slightly better in YouGov's August poll -- climbing to 30% who thought he's ready -- but still trailed Walz on that front.

Despite this, if elected Vance could very well become the latest vice president to ascend to the Oval Office in the middle of an administration. It's true that Trump himself had never served in office and held almost no experience to become president when he was inaugurated in 2017. But after four years in the White House, even he has more qualifications than Vance.

It's even more striking when you consider Vice President Kamala Harris' résumé. She's spent her entire career in public service, going from being San Francisco's district attorney to attorney general of California to a four-year senator before her current place a heartbeat away from the presidency. President Joe Biden's quick endorsement of her after he dropped out speaks to his confidence in her. Meanwhile, when Trump was asked whether Vance could step into his shoes ""on day one, if necessary,"" the former president changed the topic entirely to be about himself.

And yet even with that massive gap in their experience, when Harris took over the top of the ticket in late July, Vance claimed to be upset he wouldn't be facing her himself. ""Talk about take-backs,"" he said. ""I was told I was going to get to debate Kamala Harris, and now President Trump's going to get to debate her. I'm kind of pissed off about that if I'm being honest with you.""

That's a level of self-regard that I couldn't even begin to muster. Can you imagine, seeing how well Harris handled Trump while arguing to become the next president, how thoroughly she would have dismantled Vance in an undercard event? Instead, we'll have to settle for Walz's performance on Tuesday, as he makes clear that only one person on that stage can be trusted to take on the second-highest office in the land."
How to watch the Vance-Walz vice presidential debate,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/walz-vance-vp-debate-how-to-watch-time-channel-rcna172911,2024-10-01T10:34:26Z,"Tuesday night's debate could sway the critical undecided voters whom both campaigns are hoping to win over.

Tim Walz and JD Vance will face each other on the debate stage Tuesday night, with both vice presidential nominees aiming to further introduce themselves to voters and draw a contrast between their visions for the country.

The debate will be hosted by CBS News in its New York studios at 9 p.m. ET, without a live audience. MSNBC will simulcast the debate live, with prime-time coverage beginning at 7 p.m. ET, and MSNBC's live blog will provide updates and expert analysis in real time.

Two of CBS News' veteran anchors, Norah O'Donnell of ""CBS Evening News"" and Margaret Brennan of ""Face the Nation,"" will be the moderators.

The debate may help sway the critical undecided voters whom both campaigns are hoping to win over. Polls have shown Kamala Harris and Donald Trump neck and neck in battleground states, setting up an election that could be decided by potentially razor-thin margins in a handful of states.

Walz and Vance have hit the campaign trail hard since being chosen as running mates, and they each have served a different function for their ticket. Walz, the governor of Minnesota, was selected in part to broaden the Democratic campaign's appeal among voters who are unsure about Harris. Meanwhile, Vance, a U.S. senator representing Ohio, is largely seen as someone who can shore up Trump's support among his base.

Although most voters surveyed have said they are unfamiliar with either VP candidate, polls have consistently shown that more voters have a favorable view of Walz than they do of Vance. Part of that may be due to resurfaced remarks by Vance about women and families, comments that have led to widespread and persistent backlash. Walz, on the other hand, has been targeted by Republicans, but those attacks have not quite caught on outside of conservative circles."
"Trump calls Maine Gov. Janet Mills a man in a mistake-riddled call to supporters, newspaper reports",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-janet-mills-gender-maine-call-64caded389dd4a0c6b39edb7473fe8c4,2024-10-08T22:10:21Z,"BANGOR, Maine (AP) -- Republican Donald Trump mixed up Democratic Gov. Janet Mills' gender on a phone call with supporters in Maine, The Bangor Daily News reported Tuesday.

The newspaper obtained a recording of the call in which Trump attacked Mills on immigration, saying the governor is going to turn Maine into a ""third world"" country. Trump was trying to energize voters on Monday, the first day of early voting in the state.

Trump referred to the state's first female governor as ""he"" several times while accusing her of seeking to ""resettle 75,000 migrants"" at the behest of the Biden administration. ""He's weak and ineffective, and they told him to do so, and he's saying, 'Yes, sir. Yes, ma'am. I will do it,'"" Trump said, referring to Mills, who's serving a second term.

Conservatives have conflated a 2019 economic plan that calls for growing the workforce by 75,000 with a separate Office of New Americans created by the governor last year, portraying her as only seeking foreign-born people.

Mills referred to Trump's opponent, Democrat Kamala Harris, in a brief retort on X: ""He better get used to recognizing women. He's about to get beat by one.""

There was no immediate response from the Trump campaign.

Maine is important to Trump. The state is one of two that divide electoral votes by congressional district, and Trump won a single electoral vote in 2016 and 2020 in the state's 2nd Congressional District.

Trump also merged two different parts of the Gulf of Maine -- a 277-square-mile (717-square-kilometer) contested ""gray zone"" near Canada and a national marine monument comprising 5,000 square miles (12,910 square kilometers) that he opened to lobstering while president. The ""gray zone"" is subject of a long-running territorial dispute while the national marine monument is far offshore -- too far for most lobster fishermen to utilize.

""The Canadians are able to fish there, but the Americans aren't. We're going to open it up,"" Trump said. ""You're going to have Maine lobster and you're going to have it right near you. Think of it, 5,000 square miles."""
Democrats hope the latest court rulings restricting abortion energize voters as election nears,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-rulings-election-trump-harris-texas-georgia-b17211cd0fe92a6454878169b1730207,2024-10-08T21:13:59Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Two court rulings this week have delivered major blows to reproductive rights in Texas and Georgia but, during a crucial time in the election cycle, Democrats are seizing on them in an attempt to energize voters who support abortion access.

Advocates hope the rulings will serve as reminders about what's at stake in a post-Roe America just weeks before a presidential election that has been partly defined by competing visions of abortion rights and the sometimes harrowing consequences for women living in states with abortion bans.

""Every time our opponents say the policies we have in place are fine and not as extreme as you think, this continual drumbeat of headlines illustrates the reality and galvanizes voters,"" said Kelly Hall, executive director of the Fairness Project, which is providing money and other support for several ballot measure campaigns hoping to preserve or strengthen abortion rights.

The U.S. Supreme Court on Monday left in place a lower court decision that bans emergency abortions that violate Texas law. The same day, the Georgia Supreme Court halted a ruling that had struck down the state's near-total abortion ban.

Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, took the opportunity to remind voters of the threats her campaign says a second Trump presidency poses to reproductive rights and his role in overturning Roe v. Wade, which once granted a federal right to abortion. Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn the constitutional right to abortion that had stood for 50 years.

""Because of extreme Trump Abortion Bans in states across the country, including Texas, Louisiana, and Georgia, women are facing horrific consequences to their health and lives -- even death,"" Harris posted on X. ""Let me be clear: Donald Trump is the architect of this health care crisis.""

Monday's rulings are just the latest court decisions around reproductive rights to ripple through this year's races for president and Congress. In February, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled that embryos can be considered children, a decision that temporarily halted in vitro fertilization treatments and threw the lives of couples seeking fertility treatments into chaos.

In April, the Arizona Supreme Court upheld a near total abortion ban from 1864 -- when the state was only a U.S. territory. The Legislature repealed it months later, but not until after the issue had galvanized abortion rights supporters in a state that will help determine the presidency and control of the Senate.

Kristi Hamrick, spokesperson for the national anti-abortion group Students for Life Action, accused Democrats of ""latching onto anything and blaming losses on anyone but themselves in a desperate attempt to get votes."" She celebrated the two rulings Monday and expressed hopes the anti-abortion wins will instead energize voters against abortion.

""We're grateful for these wins and hopeful they may add some wind in our sails,"" she said.

In Texas, the state's abortion ban - one of the strictest in the country - is playing a role in the Senate race between the Republican incumbent, Sen. Ted Cuz, and Democratic U.S. Rep. Colin Allred. The weekend before Monday's ruling, Allred vowed to restore Roe v. Wade at a campaign event in Fort Worth.

Other Democrats in the statehouse, including Texas Rep. Donna Howard, also expressed outrage at the rulings. She accused the courts of ""willfully ignoring the dangerous reality many pregnant Texans are forced to endure if they experience severe pregnancy complications.""

In Georgia, one of the seven presidential battleground states, the state supreme court's ruling comes on the heels of outrage over the deaths of Georgia women Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, who died after being denied immediate care that was attributed to the state's restrictive laws.

Georgia voters are watching these stories about the impact of the state's abortion restrictions and ""they will bring that to the polls"" during the presidential election, said Jessica Arons, a director of policy and government affairs at the ACLU. But these headlines might also energize voters in contests up and down the ballot, including citizen-led ballot measures in nine states aiming to protect abortion rights, she said.

Support for legal abortion has risen since the Supreme Court eliminated protections two years ago, according to a July poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Around 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion for any reason if they don't want to be pregnant. That represents an increase from June 2021, a year before the Supreme Court decision, when about half of Americans thought legal abortion should be possible under these circumstances.

Many experts and advocates have credited this shift to Americans' reactions to the abortion restrictions affecting a wide swath of the country since Roe was overturned. Currently, 13 states are enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy while another four ban it after six weeks -- before many women know they're pregnant.

""It's hard to say how much voters are following each development, but it's clear abortion is still an incredibly salient issue, and these are reminders of why as we head closer to November,"" Arons said. ""As courts and politicians continue to play ping-pong with women's lives, ballot measures will be especially important.""

Only about half the states allow citizen-led ballot initiatives. Georgia and Texas, states where Republicans control the Legislature and governor's office, are not among them.

Lauren Brenzel, campaign director for a coalition aiming to enshrine abortion rights into the Florida Constitution, said the Georgia Supreme Court ruling only adds to a ""public health crisis in the Southeast.""

Florida is the only state in the Southeast that allows citizen-led ballot initiatives, Brenzel said. If Floridians vote in favor of abortion rights, the state may become a major access point for Georgians seeking abortions. The Florida amendment needs at least 60% support to pass.

""It raises the stakes for us here in Florida,"" Brenzel said.

After the Arizona Supreme Court revived the Civil War-era ban on nearly all abortions, a coalition organizing around a statewide ballot measure to protect abortion rights reported a surge in donations, volunteers and interest. Laura Dent, the coalition's political director, said it's evidence that voters are paying attention and taking action.

""Arizonans are seeing these headlines,"" she said. ""This and all the whiplash we've seen since the Dobbs decision really brought into focus for Arizona voters how we need to protect this right, and I think that will be reflected in November.""

Lawsuit seeks to reopen voter registration in Georgia after Hurricane Helene,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-elections-registration-lawsuit-hurricane-helene-b8b034f7b1dfb3fa3dee0f61e1423a72,2024-10-08T21:11:21Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- Three voting rights groups are asking a federal judge to order the state of Georgia to reopen voter registration for November's elections due to Hurricane Helene.

The groups argue in a lawsuit filed Monday in federal court in Atlanta that damage and disruptions from Hurricane Helene unfairly deprived people of the opportunity to register last week, in advance of the state's Monday registration deadline.

The lawsuit filed by the Georgia conference of the NAACP, the Georgia Coalition for the People's Agenda and the New Georgia Project seeks to have registration reopened through Oct. 14. All three groups say they had to cancel voter registration activities last week. Historically, there's a spike in Georgia voter registrations just before the deadline, the plaintiffs said.

""Absent action by this court, the likely thousands of voters who could not register while power was down, roads were impassible and county election and post offices were closed will be unfairly disenfranchised, an injury that can never be undone,"" the plaintiffs wrote in court papers seeking a temporary restraining order reopening registration from U.S. District Judge Eleanor Ross.

The judge scheduled a Wednesday hearing on the request.

A spokesperson for Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who oversees statewide voter rolls, declined to comment Tuesday, saying the office doesn't talk about pending lawsuits.

Georgia has 8.2 million registered voters, according to online records from Raffensperger's office. But with Georgia having been decided by only 12,000 votes in 2020, a few thousand votes could make a difference in whether Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Kamala Harris wins the state's 16 electoral votes. A number of issues related to elections in Georgia are already being litigated.

The lawsuit says the storm kept people with driver's licenses from registering online because of widespread power and internet outages in the eastern half of the state, and kept people from registering in person because at least 37 county election offices were closed for parts of last week. The lawsuit also notes that mail pickup and delivery was suspended in 27 counties, including Augusta, Savannah, Statesboro, Dublin and Vidalia.

The suit notes that a court in South Carolina extended that state's registration deadline after Helene and that courts in Georgia and Florida extended registration deadlines after 2016's Hurricane Matthew. In North Carolina, which was more heavily impacted by Hurricane Helene, the registration deadline isn't until Friday. Voters there can also register and cast a ballot simultaneously during the state's early in-person voting period, which runs from Oct. 17 through Nov. 2.

The Georgia plaintiffs argue that the shutdown of voter registration violates their rights under the First Amendment and 14th Amendment, which guarantees equal protection and due process to all citizens. They also say the shutdown violates a provision of the 1993 National Voter Registration Act that requires states to accept voter registrations submitted or mailed up to 30 days before an election.

At least 40 advocacy groups asked Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Raffensperger to extend the registration deadline in affected counties before the Georgia lawsuit was filed.

The NAACP Legal Defense Fund also sent a similar letter to Florida officials, including Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis and Secretary of State Cord Byrd."
Not all elections look the same. Here are some of the different ways states run their voting,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/ranked-choice-voting-nebraska-california-615e9fbdf7b086dce4227dff01c0df68,2024-10-08T19:44:46Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. general election on Nov. 5 will decide the country's direction, but it is far from a nationally administered contest. The 50 states and the District of Columbia run their own elections, and each does things a little differently.

Here's a look at some notable variations in the 2024 election:

To win the presidency outright, a candidate must receive at least 270 of the 538 votes in the Electoral College. In 48 states, the statewide winner gets all of that state's electoral votes, and that's also the case in the nation's capital.

In Maine and Nebraska, the candidate who receives the most votes in each congressional district wins one electoral vote from that district. The candidate who wins the statewide vote receives another two.

In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden received three of Maine's four electoral votes because he won the popular vote in the state and its 1st Congressional District. Republican Donald Trump received one electoral vote from the 2nd Congressional District. Trump won four of Nebraska's five votes for winning the popular vote in the state as well as its 1st and 3rd Congressional Districts; Biden received one electoral vote for winning the 2nd Congressional District.

In ranked choice voting, voters rank candidates for an office in order of preference on the ballot. If no candidate is the first choice for more than 50% of voters, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes redistributed to their next choice. This continues, with the candidate with the fewest votes getting eliminated, until someone emerges with a majority of votes.

Maine uses ranked choice voting in state-level primaries and for federal offices in the general election. That means Maine voters can rank presidential, Senate and House candidates on ballots that include the Democrat and the Republican who advanced out of their respective party primaries, plus third-party and independent candidates who qualify.

The presidential ballot will include Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris, plus three other candidates. In the six years since implementing ranked choice voting, the state has used it twice in races for Congress in its 2nd Congressional District. The 2020 presidential race did not advance to ranked choice voting, with the winners of the state and in each congressional district exceeding 52% of the vote.

Alaska holds open primaries for statewide offices and sends the top four vote-getters, regardless of party, to the general election, where the winner is decided using ranked choice voting. In all legislative and statewide executive offices, Alaskans can rank up to four names that can include multiple candidates from the same party.

The exception is the presidency, which is eligible for ranked choice voting in Alaska for the first time. This year, there will be eight presidential tickets on the ballot, and Alaskans can rank all candidates if they choose to. The last time the winner of the presidential contest in Alaska failed to surpass 50% of the vote was in 1992, when third-party candidate Ross Perot won almost 20% of the national popular vote.

But in 2022, both Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski won their elections after both went to ranked choice voting.

Another wrinkle this year? In Alaska, where ranked choice voting was implemented by ballot measure in 2020, there's a voter initiative on the ballot this fall to repeal it.

California and Washington hold open primaries in which all candidates run on the same ballot and the two top vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of party. This year, there are two House races in Washington that include candidates of the same party, one with two Republicans and one with two Democrats. There are four in California: three with only Democrats and one with only Republicans.

The winning party in those six districts will be reflected in The Associated Press' online graphic showing the balance of power in the House at poll close, rather than once a winner is declared because the party of the winner is a foregone conclusion.

Louisiana holds what it refers to as its ""open primaries"" on the same day the rest of the country holds its general election. In Louisiana, all candidates run on the same open primary ballot. Any candidate who earns more than 50% of the vote in the primary wins the seat outright.

If no candidate exceeds 50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters advance to a head-to-head runoff, which can end up pitting two Republicans or two Democrats against each other. Louisiana refers to these contests as its ""general election.""

That will change for elections for the U.S. House starting in 2026 when congressional races will have earlier primaries that are open only to registered members of a party. Certain state races will continue to hold open primaries in November, but the change will prevent future members of Congress from waiting until December -- a month later than the rest of the country -- to know whether they are headed to Washington.

In Nebraska, any measure that receives approximately 123,000 valid signatures qualifies for the ballot. This year, two measures relating to abortion met this threshold.

One would enshrine in the Nebraska Constitution the right to have an abortion until fetal viability or later, to protect the health of the pregnant woman. The other would write into the constitution the current 12-week ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the pregnant woman.

This marks the first time since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade that a state has measures that seek to roll back abortion rights and protect abortion rights on the ballot at the same time.

It's possible voters could end up approving both measures. But because they're competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the measure with the most ""for"" votes will be the one adopted, according to the Nebraska secretary of state.

In primary elections, a handful of states, mostly in the South, go to runoffs if no candidate receives at least 50% of the vote. In races with more than two candidates, runoffs in those states are common. Several states held primary runoffs this year.

Georgia uses the same rules in general elections. The last three Senate races there went to runoffs because a third-party candidate won enough of the vote to prevent the Republican or Democratic nominee from exceeding 50% of the vote.

But this year, runoff possibilities may be confined to downballot races such as state legislature. There's no Senate race there this year, and the U.S. House races have only two candidates on the ballot.

This is common in states that span multiple time zones. In most states, polls close at the same time in each time zone.

The AP will not call the winner of a race before all the polls in a jurisdiction are scheduled to close, even if votes already reported before that time make clear who will win the race. So if there is a statewide race in a state where polls close at 8 p.m. local time, but some of the state is in the Eastern time zone and some of the state is in Central time zone, the earliest the AP can call the winner is 8 p.m. CST/9 p.m. EST.

The AP will still show the results as they arrive from counties with closed polls.

Some of the biggest states with split poll close times are Florida, Michigan, Texas and Oregon. Tennessee is an exception, as even though the state is in both the Eastern and the Central time zones, all counties coordinate their voting to conclude at the same time.

Where are the voters who could decide the presidential election?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-swing-states-georgia-arizona-nevada-michigan-e69da5eb0584606ba9f02ff8fe1de9ee,2024-10-08T19:26:39Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- When you hear the term bellwether, you might think about states in the presidential election that always vote with the White House winner. The true meaning of a bellwether is an indicator of a trend. And for that, you need to be thinking about counties.

In a closely contested presidential election, as many expect 2024 to be, the results in a few bellwether counties in the key battleground states are likely to decide the outcome, just as they did in the past two general elections.

Here's a look at those that might matter the most on Election Day.

Many of those states have large, Democratic-leaning cities. These cities and their inner suburbs are an important source of Democratic votes in statewide elections. These areas consistently vote for the Democratic candidates, which means turnout in these places can have an outsized effect on the final statewide margin.

This year, look at Michigan's Wayne County (Detroit), North Carolina's Mecklenburg County (Charlotte) and Georgia's Fulton County (Atlanta).

Republican candidates have tended to do well in the more rural areas of these states, which means Democrat Kamala Harris will need to run up big margins in these places in order to offset Republican Donald Trump's advantage elsewhere.

Detroit, Charlotte and Atlanta are particularly large, about twice as populous as the next biggest municipality in each state. In 2020, voters in those three counties cast more than two-thirds of their votes for Democrat Joe Biden.

The turnout and margin in the counties around Milwaukee and Philadelphia will be significant to the results in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, respectively.

In Wisconsin, the key counties that surround Milwaukee are Washington, Ozaukee and Waukesha -- known colloquially as the ""WOW"" counties. These historically Republican-leaning communities have been slowly moving to the left: Republican presidential candidates have won them in recent elections, but by increasingly smaller margins.

This forces Republican candidates to seek to run up turnout in more rural areas of the state rather than relying on those counties to offset losses in the state's urban counties of Milwaukee and Dane, home to Madison, the state capital and the University of Wisconsin's main campus. It will be a good night for Trump if high turnout and margins in the ""WOW"" counties look more like the early 2000s, rather than 2020.

Philadelphia's collar counties of Bucks, Montgomery, Chester and Delaware are among the state's wealthiest. They, too, are historic Republican strongholds that have shifted left for decades. Democratic presidential candidates have carried three of them since the 1992 election; Chester flipped between the parties throughout the 2000s.

Arizona and Nevada are unique because in both states, one county is home to so much of the state's population. More than 60% of ballots cast in the 2020 presidential election in Arizona came from Maricopa, which includes Phoenix, while more than two-thirds of Nevada votes came from Clark, home to Las Vegas.

In states where voters are so overwhelmingly concentrated in a single county, even a narrow win can produce big shifts in the statewide numbers. Biden won 50.3% of the vote in Maricopa in 2020, beating Trump by about 45,000 votes, and that was enough to win the state by just over 10,000 votes. In Nevada, Biden lost 14 of the state's 15 counties, but his 91,000-vote margin over Trump in Clark was enough to secure his statewide victory of 34,000 votes.

Trump's margin of victory in North Carolina was just 74,481 votes in 2020, a little more than 1 percentage point and the tightest of any state he won that year over Biden. It's not yet clear, and may not be by Election Day, Nov. 5, how Hurricane Helene will affect the election in North Carolina.

The storm's impact was severe in Buncombe County and the Asheville area, one of two counties in western North Carolina carried by Biden four years ago. The other counties in the region are reliably Republican, and suffered alongside Buncombe a level of destruction described by the state's governor, Democrat Roy Cooper, as ""unlike anything our state has ever experienced.""

""We've battled through hurricanes and tropical storms and still held safe and secure elections, and we will do everything in our power to do so again,"" Karen Brinson Bell, the executive director of the state's election board, said a few days after Helene struck. ""Mountain people are strong, and the election people who serve them are resilient and tough, too.""

Across the seven main battleground states in 2024, there are 10 counties -- out of more than 500 -- that voted for Trump in 2016 then flipped to Biden in 2020. Most are small and home to relatively few voters, with Arizona's Maricopa a notable exception. So it's not likely they'll swing an entire state all by themselves.

What these counties probably will do is provide an early indication of which candidate is performing best among the swing voters likely to decide a closely contested race. It doesn't take much for a flip. For example, the difference in Wisconsin, in both 2016 and 2020. was only about 20,000 votes.

North Carolina's two Trump-Biden counties - New Hanover on the Atlantic Coast and Nash, northeast of Raleigh - are likely to be the first among the 10 to finish counting their vote on election night. Polls close next in Michigan's Kent, Saginaw and Leelanau counties and Pennsylvania's Erie and Northampton counties, followed by Wisconsin's Sauk and Door. Maricopa is the closer.

How elections forecasters became political 'prophets',AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-prophet-prediction-2024-kamala-harris-donald-trump-joe-biden-d1e61649ef95e0b7a187465410cd9303,2024-10-08T19:26:19Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Before there was a FiveThirtyEight model, or a New York Times election night needle, or 13 keys revealing ""how presidential elections really work,"" there was an economist named Louis Bean.

Bean achieved a sort of political fame for a book he wrote in 1948 that suggested, contrary to conventional wisdom, that Democratic President Harry Truman was favored to win the election, not Republican Thomas Dewey, the governor of New York.

""It is here, presumably, where the experts fall out, that the tea leaves and intuition enter in,"" said a Times review of Bean's book, ""How to Predict Elections."" ""The intuitive school has already counted Governor Dewey in by a landslide.""

Truman won.

When Bean predicted that Sen. Robert A. Taft, R-Ohio, would lose reelection in 1950, The Washington Post printed the headline: ""Political Prophet Sees Taft Defeat.""

Today, there are more of these ""prophets"" than ever.

It may be no surprise that people seek certainty before elections happen, given what they see as the stakes: One recent Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll found that about 7 in 10 Americans believe that the future of democracy is at stake in this year's presidential election, and another found that about 6 in 10 Americans described themselves as being ""fearful"" about the possibility of Democrat Kamala Harris winning, Republican Donald Trump winning, or both.

Yet often the forecasters themselves are the first to push back on the characterization that they can tell you what's going to happen.

""People I think are looking for oracles, right?"" said Nate Silver, the founder of FiveThirtyEight and author of the Silver Bulletin, a new site analyzing elections. ""They're looking for people that seem to have some magic formula or have some almost quasi-mystical understanding of elections and trends.""

Charlie Cook, founder of the Cook Political Report, said he flinches ""at the term 'prediction' because it suggests saying, 'I think Smith will win.'"" But, Cook said, ""In close races, how can someone say that without knowing precisely what will happen between now and the last vote is cast?""

Most people, Cook said, ""don't really understand probabilities, they want it to be definitive, either Smith or Jones, no hedging, no qualifying, no conditions, don't give me nuance"" and ""they want us to say something that is unknowable.""

In a recent column, the Cook Report's publisher and editor, Amy Walter, issued a ""plea"" to stop ""attaching your hopes, dreams, and fears to one poll or a poll model on any given day.""

""Just take a breath and accept the fact that this election will be won on the margins,"" Walter said in an interview.

Even Bean, whose election predictions made headlines for decades, cautioned against reading his analysis as gospel. A year before the 1968 election, he predicted, with a caveat, that Democratic President Lyndon Johnson would defeat Republican Richard Nixon: ""If the Republicans win, you ought to forget it and say it was a good, tentative early analysis.""

Johnson ended up dropping out and his vice president, Humbert Humphrey, was the party's nominee. Nixon won.

Before the 2022 midterms, a Q-and-A with David Wasserman appeared in New York Magazine with the headline ""'A Category 2 or 3 Hurricane Headed Democrats' Way.'"" The quote wasn't wrong. It just wasn't complete.

""Today, we're somewhere between an asterisk year, where there's a minimal wave, and a classic midterm election, where Republicans do quite well,"" Wasserman said at the time. ""I think this is probably a Category 2 or 3 hurricane headed Democrats' way, just not a Category 4 or 5.""

Wasserman, senior editor and elections analyst at the Cook Report, said he was trying to convey that, despite the conventional wisdom, a massive Republican wave wasn't imminent at all. But that's not how many readers interpreted the headline. Republicans ended up making only modest gains.

""I have to be very careful on how I communicate our elections analysis because it's so prone to misinterpretation,"" Wasserman said.

Before the internet took off, analysts such as Cook and Stu Rothenberg offered their analysis in newsletters. Part of that included putting individual races in categories, on a scale from ""safe"" to ""toss-up."" Those designations come from a combination of access to polling data, reporting in battleground states, in-person assessments of candidates and other factors that have made Cook and Rothenberg some of the foremost elections experts.

The ratings, however, are only a small part of the analysis these outlets provide.

Rothenberg, the founder of the Rothenberg Political Report, approached his newsletter as a venue to tell subscribers what he had observed and analyzed in the world of elections, communicating directly with the readers who knew and trusted him.

Sometimes news outlets would mark his ratings as news events, rather than as expert analysis.

""It was like I was coming down from Mount Sinai with the truth,"" Rothenberg reflected.

The current surge of elections predictions is centered around models that use a combination of factors -- polling, demographics, historical results, to name a few -- to put a number on the probability that a race will turn out one way or the other. That can make it seem like forecasts are objective measurements, when in fact they rely on many subjective decisions, said Natalie Jackson, a longtime pollster who is now vice president at Democratic polling firm GQR.

""They're treated as a lot more concrete than they should be,"" Jackson said.

Nathan Gonzales, who runs Inside Elections, calls the process of placing races in a category to denote competitiveness ""a combination of art and science.""

Paradoxically, even though the most reputable analysts urge caution, it's those who present their predictions most confidently who tend to receive the most attention.

The digital era has made people even more uncomfortable with uncertainty.

""There's information, and a lot of it, and there's an industry constantly creating more information, and that makes us think we should have everything at our fingertips, including future election results,"" Jackson said.

""Everyone is jockeying for attention, and there are some perverse incentives as well,"" Wasserman said. ""If your model shows a strong probability for one side, that'll get the most 'likes' and 'retweets' on that side. A lot of the most nuanced and thoughtful approaches get drowned out.""

That need for certainty may also be one reason for a field of elections forecasters that is dominated by men, despite the large number of women who work in polling and political journalism.

There's not a single reason that fully explains the gender disparity, though Silver believes that ""men are given license to be more aggressive"" and that sexism likely plays a role in who gets taken seriously.

Studies also suggest women are more cautious in professional settings, Jackson noted. It's a quality that can be critical for conveying uncertainty of elections predictions but doesn't necessarily get rewarded on social media or in headlines.

""People don't like uncertainty,"" Jackson said. ""They like the person who tells them what's happening.""

That human tendency is especially problematic in the elections forecasting business. Silver actually describes his forecasts as ""models of uncertainty.""

""A definitive prediction,"" Silver said, ""is usually a sign that someone's a charlatan.""

"AP Elections Top 25: The people, places, races, dates and things to know about Election Day",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/associated-press-elections-top-25-people-places-races-dates-f323fe3dd459c54860a3ad39657e1fca,2024-10-08T19:26:14Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans will cast roughly 160 million ballots by the time Election Day comes to a close -- in several different ways, including many submitted a few weeks before polls even open.

They will choose a president, members of Congress and thousands of state lawmakers, city council members, attorneys general, secretaries of state -- and in Texas, a railroad commissioner who has nothing to do with the trains.

This year's election also comes at a moment in the nation's history when the very basics of how America votes are being challenged as never before by disinformation and distrust.

It can be tough to make sense of it all. To help better understand the way America picks its president and its leaders -- all the way down the ballot -- The Associated Press offers the following thoughts on the Top 25 people, places, races, dates and things to know about Election Day. A guidebook, of sorts, to American democracy as it nears its 250th birthday.

It's said that every presidential election makes history. Perhaps. But while some are destined to be included in the history books, others become the subject of books all of their own. Put 2024 down to get a whole shelf at the library. Will Americans choose to return Donald Trump to the White House, electing a former president to a new term for only the second time -- and picking for the first time a convicted felon to sit behind the Resolute Desk? Or will voters decide Kamala Harris ought to be the nation's first woman to take up office in the Oval Office, a candidate who didn't win a single primary yet landed at the top of her party's ticket by acclamation. No list of the Top 25 things to know about this year's general election can begin without an acknowledgment that no matter who America chooses, Trump and Harris will make history this Election Day. (Or a few days later.)

There might not be anyone as all-in on returning Trump to the White House as Elon Musk, the world's richest person. ""President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America,"" the founder of SpaceX and Tesla told a rally crowd in early October when Trump returned to the site of his first attempted assassination in Pennsylvania. Along with his unfathomable personal wealth, Musk's ownership of X, formally known as Twitter, gives him an unprecedented ability to try and convince voters of his belief that electing Trump is a ""must-win situation."" Musk is spending heavily on get-out-the-vote efforts and using his perch as X's CEO to amplify misinformation and push into millions of timelines his argument that the country will not survive should Kamala Harris win the White House. It's a foreboding message that seems to get bleaker by the day - and Musk knows it. ""As you can see, I am not just MAGA,"" he told Trump's backers from the rally stage. ""I am Dark MAGA.""

The founder of Win With Black Women, Jotaka Eaddy has for the past four years hosted Sunday evening video conferences on Zoom to chat politics. On July 21, she couldn't get into her own meeting. Earlier that day, Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris as his replacement to be the Democratic nominee, and once Zoom changed some settings, 44,000 people were online and ready to talk about it. It was a pep talk and a telethon. People prayed and sang. About an hour after the Zoom started, Star Jones shared a donation link and by early the next morning they had raised more than $1 million. The meeting spawned a domino effect as Eaddy turned a tool made essential by the coronavirus pandemic into an essential place for Harris' supporters to gather. Soon, Black men and white women and white dudes and Taylor Swift fans were logging on. ""It has allowed us to organize in a way to bring people together that otherwise would not connect,"" Eaddy said.

Now that how a ballot is cast is as much of a red/blue choice as the candidate getting the vote, figuring out who will win a close election often depends on knowing the kind of ballots left to be counted. Garrett Archer, a former analyst at the Arizona Secretary of State's office who is now a data journalist, was one of the first of Twitter's election seers to understand how nit-picky those details can be. Were the advance votes still to be counted cast in person, mailed or left at a drop box? How soon before Election Day did those mail ballots arrive? Or might those mail votes actually be ""late earlies"" dropped off at a polling place? Archer goes deep into those details in his job with ABC's Phoenix affiliate, but most of us will get his analysis of Arizona's election results online, as we wait every afternoon after Election Day for his trademark Tweet that begins: ""Maricopa incoming...""

About a week after Election Day, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows is likely to star in a livestream via laptop webcam to announce results of ranked choice voting. The instant-runoff system, used when no candidate initially wins an outright majority, might be a downballot novelty if not for the state's 2nd Congressional District. Behind by about 2,000 votes in 2018, Democrat Jared Golden emerged the winner and ousted the GOP incumbent once the ranked choice process awarded him the votes of two trailing independents. Maine also awards two of its Electoral College votes by congressional district, and while it may be unlikely, the road to 270 electoral votes could theoretically end with ranked choice results in Maine's 2nd District. In that case, should Golden's come-from-behind win of 2018 repeat itself, it would fall to Bellows to announce that ranked choice voting had put a second place finisher into the White House.

On an Aleutian island closer to the Russian border than mainland Alaska and more than 4,000 miles from the White House, the question isn't who wins on Election Day. It's who will be the very last American to vote. ""People have a little bit of fun on that day, because, I mean, realistically everybody knows the election's decided way before we're closed,"" said Layton Lockett, the city manager in Adak, Alaska. The country's last polling place to close is the only one still open from midnight ET to 1 a.m., when things wrap up on the island and former World War II military base. The honor of being the last voter was Mary Nelson's in 2012, when the community of a few hundred people did away with early voting in favor of casting ballots in person. She was a poll worker that Election Day, too, meaning her historic moment was short lived. ""When I opened the curtain to come back out, the city manager took my picture ... and they were waiting for us in Nome to call with our vote count,"" she said.

Out of more than 500 counties in the seven battleground states in this year's election, only 10 voted for Trump in 2016 before flipping to Biden in 2020. The first to complete its count this Election Day ought to be North Carolina's Nash County, which by 10 p.m. ET could provide an early indication of which candidate is performing best among the swing voters likely to decide a closely contested White House. That's especially true should there be a decisive winner in the community northeast of Raleigh, unaffected by Hurricane Helene. Two decades have passed since any presidential candidate won Nash by more than a point. Confirmation won't come for hours (or days), but more intelligence will arrive about a half hour later when North Carolina's other Trump-Biden county -- New Hanover on the state's Atlantic Coast -- should wrap up its count. The other eight counties to watch: Erie and Northhampton in Pennsylvania; Maricopa in Arizona; Kent, Saginaw and Leelanau in Michigan and Sauk and Door in Wisconsin.

There's more to Arizona than Maricopa County. Seriously! Yes, it's true that Biden eked out a win in 2020 among the more than 60% of Arizona voters who live in the sprawling home of Phoenix and its suburbs. But Biden may not have won Arizona and its 11 electoral votes without his win in Apache County, where he beat Trump by 11,851 votes out of roughly 35,000 cast. His statewide margin? Just 10,457. Apache County is far from the typical Democratic urban stronghold. Much of the rural county is part of the Navajo Nation, and it also includes lands belonging to the Apache people who gave the county its name. In all, more than 70% of people living there are Native American. America's indigenous population is often overlooked in presidential elections: the states with the largest percentages of Native people - Alaska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and South Dakota - are not often competitive. Arizona's emergence as a battleground makes the voters in Apache County -- and the roughly 5% of Arizonans who are Native American -- a potential factor in this year's election.

Trump won Wisconsin by about 20,000 votes in 2016 - and he and the country had to wait on Milwaukee County to know which way that margin would fall. The state's largest county and Democratic stronghold is one of a handful in Wisconsin that releases results of mail ballots all at once, rather than combining them with other ballots counted at precinct polling places. In 2016, confirmation there weren't enough mail votes left to count in the City of Milwaukee to flip the race from Trump to Hillary Clinton allowed AP to declare the Republican the winner of the state - and the White House. In the 2022 midterms, it was only when AP confirmed there were no ballots remaining to be counted in Milwaukee and Dane County, Wisconsin's other largest source of Democratic votes, that it was able to say incumbent Republican Ron Johnson would return to the Senate. Milwaukee might not be among the final counties in Wisconsin to report its results this year, but don't count out its chances to be the decisive county once it does in this crucial battleground state.

Election officials nationwide found no cases of fraud, vandalism or theft related to the use of drop boxes that that could have affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. And yet no place in this year's election may face more scrutiny than the drop box - a tool designed to make voting easier that's become the source of conspiracy theories that they played a role ( they didn't ) in stealing the election from Trump ( it wasn't ). Several states have enacted laws restricting their use since 2020, while in others they remain the subject of fascination. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed itself in July and dumped a ruling that limited drop boxes to only election clerks' offices. Prosecutors are currently investigating allegations that the mayor of Wausau removed the city's drop box last month without consulting with the city clerk. Election officials typically have detailed processes to ensure the security of ballots left in drop boxes, which are often monitored remotely by camera. Still, drop boxes remain a place where opponents wrongly believe their vote is neither safe nor secure.

There are 538 electoral votes to win from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but the Trump and Harris campaigns are seriously contesting only seven states this year as battlegrounds: Arizona and Nevada out West, North Carolina and Georgia in the South, Michigan and Wisconsin amid the Great Lakes and Pennsylvania as the final boss. Eight years ago, Pennsylvania was the last state called for Trump before he won election by winning in Wisconsin in the early morning hours after Election Day. Four years ago, Biden's win there four days after polls close -- by roughly 80,000 votes out of more than 6.8 million cast -- was the difference. Both presidential hopefuls can get to the 270 electoral votes need to win White House without the Keystone State, but their path to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue gets a whole lot easier if they grab Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes along the way.

Supporters of abortion rights are 7-for-7 in statewide votes since the U.S. Supreme Court "" returned to the people and their elected representatives "" the ability to decide on the legality of abortion. Come Election Day, voters in nine more states will get the chance via ballot measure to do the same. The states range from the reliably blue (Colorado, Maryland) to the resolutely red (South Dakota, Missouri, Nebraska), with a few presidential battlegrounds and/or states with key races for U.S. Senate - Arizona, Nevada and Montana - in between. And then there's Florida, a state Hillary Clinton hoped would provide her with a powerful push into the White House. Instead, the Sunshine State was in 2016 (and again in 2020) a cornerstone of Trump's Electoral College count. A Trump loss in Florida would undoubtedly sink his bid to return to the White House, but it's hardly clear that the chance to vote on social issues - even one as potent as abortion - can sway enough voters to truly affect an outcome at the top of the ticket.

Republicans can likely hold the U.S. House of Representatives even if they lose a couple of seats in New York, where a messy redistricting process two years ago helped the GOP win six districts carried by Biden. But if those losses include freshman Rep. Marc Molinaro in the state's 19th District, it will make for an uncomfortable election night for House Speaker Mike Johnson. Molinaro has styled himself as a pragmatist as he seeks reelection for the first time, avoiding the circus of former GOP Rep. George Santos in New York's 3rd District - a seat his party has already lost - and the inconveniently timed headlines of rising party star and 17th District Rep. Mike Lawler. Democrat Josh Riley, who nearly won the district in 2022, has raised more money than Molinaro ahead of their November rematch, as Democrats run candidates nationwide who came up just short in the 2022 midterms. If that's a winning strategy in New York's 19th District and elsewhere, the celebrations might be the most raucous in Brooklyn at the election night party of New York 8th District Rep. Hakeem Jefferies: the Democratic leader and House Speaker-in-waiting.

Pay enough attention to politics and you'll have heard the bit about Democrats being one election away from winning in Texas. Then Election Day arrives and Republicans have the cattle while Democrats are once again holding their hat. Is this the year that changes? Democrats say they're investing serious cash into the state with the hope that an unpopular incumbent (Sen. Ted Cruz) is at risk to a rising star (former NFL player and current Rep. Colin Allred). Sound familiar? Six years ago, Cruz was an unpopular incumbent running against a rising Democratic star from the U.S. House named Beto O'Rourke. Some say O'Rourke ran the perfect campaign...and Cruz won by a comfortable 2.6 points. It's been 30 years since a Democrat won statewide in Texas, so maybe the odds are better for Democrats in Florida? They're spending money there, too, to try and take down incumbent Sen. Rick Scott. Ask the GOP what to make of these moves and they'll tell you Democrats need that kind of dramatic upset to keep control of the Senate.

John Duarte might be in one of the closest races of the cycle - and possibly faces the longest waiting time to find out if he's returning to Congress. The California Republican won his 2022 race by 564 votes in a race that was so close that the AP needed until the first week of December to declare Duarte the winner. Now he has to do it all again: He faces a rematch in the state's 13th Congressional District against former state Assemblyman Adam Gray. California's count takes so long in large part because the state conducts its elections entirely by mail. In the 13th, there are also no major cities - no L.A., no Bakersfield, not even Fresno - that would provide enough votes at the beginning of the night to make clear who has won. If the House majority comes down to Duarte's race, the nation's attention will focus on a long count in five counties of California's agricultural Central Valley.

The first Tuesday after the first Monday in November is Election Day, established in 1875 under 2 U.S. Code § 7 for the election ""in each of the States and Territories of the United States, of Representatives and Delegates to the Congress."" In modern U.S. elections, Election Day is perhaps best thought of as the LAST day of the general election: it's the final chance for voters to cast ballots in person, for mail ballots to arrive and be counted, or, in some states, the day by which mail ballots must be postmarked.

Three weeks later comes the last day a mail ballot can arrive in Washington state and still be counted -- Nov. 25 is the latest deadline of any state that accepts votes cast by mail to arrive with an Election Day postmark. In all, 17 states and the District of Columbia allow mail ballots to arrive after Election Day, while 32 others require they be in the ballot box on Election Day. Only Louisiana requires mail ballots to arrive early in order to be counted -- the deadline there for mail ballots is the day before Election Day.

After supporters of Trump stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an insurrection that aimed to overturn his loss to then-President-elect Joe Biden, Congress updated the Electoral Count Act to, among other things, establish the date by which every state's governor must certify the results of the presidential election and submit their slate of electors. Any legal challenges should then be completed by Dec. 16, because those members of the Electoral College will vote the next day.

Wait, there's another election day? Indeed! The Constitution says it's not the people who pick a president, but rather a group of ""electors"" as selected by each state for the job. But the founders also wrote that states get to decide how to pick their members of the Electoral College, and almost all require they vote for the winner of their state's popular vote (Maine and Nebraska do it just a little differently). This ritual takes place about a week before Christmas, the deadline for the electors' cast ballots to arrive in Washington.

More ceremony in early January as the members of the 119th Congress, having taken office a few days earlier, count those Electoral College ballots under the rules of the updated Electoral Count Act. Objections are still possible, but much harder to raise, and the revised law makes plain the vice president is there only to announce the results as president of the Senate. Once the electoral votes are officially cast and counted, the final step of the election comes at the new president's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025.

Almost all of the roughly 160 million ballots that will be cast in this year's election will be made of paper. And almost all will be counted by machine. Election officials say without such machines, counting those ballots by hand would take much longer, cost taxpayers far more and result in errors that would then take even more time and money to fix. ""Human beings are really bad at tedious things, and counting ballots is among the most tedious things we could do,"" said Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart. ""Computers are very good at tedious things. They can count very quickly and very accurately."" Still, the desire to have humans involved in the process lingers. Officials in Georgia remain at odds over a recent directive from the state's election board requiring poll workers to count the total number of ballots by hand.

At The Associated Press, a race is ""too early to call"" if election officials are still tabulating votes and there is no clear winner. Regardless of how tight the margin may be between the leading candidates, AP won't say a race is ""too close to call"" unless election officials have tallied all outstanding ballots -- save for provisional ballots and late-arriving mail and absentee votes -- and the winner still remains unclear. In those cases, it's likely AP won't be able to say who has won until election officials certify the results -- a process that may take up to several weeks after Election Day. By the way, elections headed to a recount aren't automatically ""too close to call."" In fact, depending on how many votes separate the trailing candidates from the leader, AP may declare a winner even if a recount is possible.

Here's the thing about recounts: They might be required by law, they might be requested by a candidate, they might be ordered by a court. But they're not very likely to do anything but drag out the inevitable. ""Recounts are shifting a very small number of votes,"" said Deb Otis of the nonpartisan organization Fair Vote. ""We're going to see recounts in 2024 that are not going to change the outcome."" They almost never do. In the 36 recounts of a statewide general election since America's most famous recount in 2000, none moved the margin by more than a few hundred votes. The average change? Just 0.03 percentage points. The biggest? A move of 0.11 points in the 2006 race for Vermont state auditor - a rare race that did flip as a 137-vote lead in the initial count for Republican Randy Brock became a 102-vote recount win by Democrat Thomas Salmon. ""The count is pretty accurate because the machines work,"" said former Arizona election official Tammy Patrick. ""We have recounts ... to make sure we got it right."" As hopeful trailing candidates will soon learn, the first count almost always is.

Looking for ""precincts reporting"" when watching as results are reported in this year's election? Chances are, you'll find an estimate of ""expected vote"" instead. The Associated Press and other news organizations have moved away from precincts reporting as a measure of election turnout for several reasons - the fact that well more than half of voters no longer cast their ballot in person at a neighborhood ""precinct"" on Election Day chief among them. Instead, AP will estimate how much of the vote election officials have counted - and how many ballots they have left to count - based on a number of data points, including details on advance ballots cast, registration statistics and turnout in recent elections. Those estimates will change as votes are counted and more information about the exact number of ballots cast becomes available. AP's estimates of ballots cast won't reach 100% until election results are certified as final and complete.

More often than not, in a nation as evenly divided as the United States, not on Election Day -- or, at the least, not on Election Day on the East Coast. Since it took 36 days for George W. Bush's win in the 2000 presidential race to play out in Florida and before the Supreme Court, only in Barack Obama's two victories has AP declared a White House winner before midnight Eastern Time. Trump didn't win until 2:29 a.m. ET in 2016 and he didn't lose in 2020 until the Saturday morning after Election Day -- that's how long it took for Biden to claim 270 electoral votes by emerging as the clear winner in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the sheer number of U.S. Representatives from California -- a state where officials will be counting mail ballots for weeks -- could make for a long wait to know which party will control the House. The election for Speaker? That's a whole other matter.

The AP Elections Top 25 was reported by Leah Askarinam, Christina A. Cassidy, Christine Fernando, Meg Kinnard, Chris Megerian, Geoff Mulvihill, Stephen Ohlemacher, Emily Swanson, Mark Thiessen and Robert Yoon.

Will the polls be right in 2024? What polling on the presidential race can and can't tell you,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-polls-kamala-harris-donald-trump-b497bd1015d35ed563e085c8db075802,2024-10-08T19:18:52Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The presidential race is competitive.

That's about as much as the national polls can tell us right now, even if it looks like Democrat Kamala Harris is down in one poll or Republican Donald Trump is up in another.

And that's just fine.

Even though polls are sometimes treated as projections, they aren't designed to tell you who is likely to win.

Polls are better for some things than others. Tracking shifts in voter intention is hard to do with a survey, particularly when the number of truly persuadable voters is relatively small. Voters' opinions can change before Election Day and they often do. Horse race polls can only capture people's viewpoints during a single moment in time. Even then, a margin that looks like one that could decide an election -- say, one candidate has 48% support and the other has 45% support -- might not be a real difference at all.

When reporters at The Associated Press are covering the election, horse race polling numbers don't take center stage. The reason for this is that the AP believes that focusing on preelection polling can overstate the significance or reliability of those numbers.

Election-year polls are still useful, particularly when they're trying to assess how the public is feeling about the candidates or the state of the country. They told us quite clearly, for instance, that many Americans wanted Democratic President Joe Biden to drop out of the 2024 race. But they're not the same thing as an election result, and even a poll conducted just before Election Day still reflects opinion before all ballots have been cast.

Polls are useful tools, but it's important not to overstate their accuracy. After all, a polling organization can't talk to every single person in the country. They instead rely on a sample to produce a statistically valid estimate of the views of all adults. Even though polls can give a reasonable approximation of the views of the larger group, the question is how much each finding could vary.

The margin of error, which all high-quality pollsters will share along with their results, helps capture some of that uncertainty. It means that in a poll with a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points, a finding that 47% of voters say they'll support a particular candidate actually means that there's a very good chance that anywhere between 50% and 44% of voters are supporting that candidate. If the other candidate has 45% support, which could really be anywhere from 42% to 48%, the 2 percentage point difference isn't statistically meaningful.

That's why the AP will only say a candidate is leading if that candidate is ahead by more than twice the margin of error.

When you're looking at a subgroup, rather than a national sample, the potential error is even larger. The fewer people interviewed, the larger the margin of error. This means that state-level polls or polls that measure the views of a subgroup such as women, men, Hispanic Americans or Black Americans are subject to even more error than a national finding.

The margin of sampling error is not the only source of survey error. It is simply the only one that can be quantified using established statistical methods. But there are other factors, too. The wording and order of questions can affect how people answer. An interviewer's skill can have an effect. Even in high-quality polls, some respondents may be less likely to answer, which means their views can be underrepresented.

National polls measure how voters all over the country are thinking about the election. But that's not how we elect presidents.

The Electoral College system means that presidential elections are functionally decided by a small number of states. So in some ways, looking at polls of those states is a better way to assess the state of the race.

But state-level polls introduce their own challenges. They're not conducted as frequently as national polls and some states get polled more often than others. Also, the number of people surveyed for state polls is often smaller than for national polls, which means the margin of error is broader.

Some media outlets or organizations publish polling averages or aggregates that combine the results of multiple polls into a single estimate. There are some organizations that create polling averages or models during elections that attempt to determine which candidate is leading in overall polls.

But averaging poll results does not eliminate polling error and it can introduce additional problems. Polling averages contain their own methodological decisions, such as which polls are included or receive greater weight. Some of them also include other factors such as the state of the economy to turn those estimates into forecasts.

In election polling, survey averages can provide a general sense of the state of a race. But it's also important to not overstate the accuracy of an average or expect it to be a crystal ball into the election outcome. Sometimes the individual results of multiple different polls can provide a better sense of the potential array of outcomes than an average boiled down to a single number.

Ranked choice voting could decide which party controls the US House. How does it work?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/ranked-choice-voting-maine-alaska-elections-3c671352c0a6aa3604502955e6df3097,2024-10-08T19:14:15Z,"PORTLAND, Maine (AP) -- An uncommon system of voting could be central to which party controls the U.S. House this fall -- or even the presidency.

In Maine and Alaska, voters in competitive congressional districts will elect a winner using ranked choice voting.

Rather than cast a single vote for their preferred candidate, voters rank their choices in order of preference on the ballot. If a candidate is the first choice of more than 50% of voters in the first round of counting, that candidate is the winner.

But if no candidate surpasses 50%, the count continues in round two. The candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated, and voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes redistributed to their next choice. This continues with the candidate with the fewest votes getting eliminated until someone emerges with a majority of votes.

Ranked choice voting has become more popular in recent years, particularly at the municipal level.

Voters in two dozen cities and counties -- from New York and Minneapolis to Boulder, Colorado -- used ranked choice voting in 2023, according to FairVote, a nonpartisan organization that advocates for the expansion of ranked choice voting. Seven other cities voted in favor of preserving, adopting or expanding ranked choice voting.

Proponents of ranked choice voting argue the system encourages candidates to build broader coalitions, eliminates the spoiler effect and discourages negative campaigning. Opponents say it's confusing and can result in a candidate without the largest number of first-choice votes ultimately prevailing.

Because they take place over multiple rounds, elections that advance to ranked choice are often resolved a week or more after Election Day.

Maine adopted ranked voting in elections in 2016 in a statewide referendum. It is used in all statewide primaries with more than two candidates. In general elections, it is used for federal offices including the presidency but not in state races, such as for governor or the Legislature, because it runs afoul of the Maine Constitution.

It quickly came into play -- twice -- in Maine's 2nd Congressional District. Then-GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin won the first round of voting in 2018, but lost to Democratic Rep. Jared Golden when votes were reallocated after removing the third- and fourth-place finishers. The process repeated four years later when Golden beat Poliquin in a rematch.

A federal judge twice upheld the constitutionality of ranked voting in separate challenges by Poliquin in 2018 and a group of voters in 2020.

This year, only two candidates are explicitly on the ballot in the 2nd District -- Golden and Republican Austin Theriault -- but the race could nonetheless go to ranked choice voting because votes will be counted for a third candidate whose write-in candidacy has been recognized by the state.

If no first-round winner receives a majority of the vote on Election Day, then the ballots are shipped to the state capital, where the ballots are entered into a computer. The process takes about a week before the final tally is run and the winner declared.

Alaskans approved the use of ranked choice voting in a 2020 statewide initiative. It is used in all general elections, including for the presidency, but not in state primaries. Alaska's state primaries are open, so all candidates, regardless of party, run on the same ballot and the top four vote-getters advance to the general election.

Presidential primaries are different. Candidates can make the ballot by winning a recognized party's primary or successfully petitioning the state Division of Elections. This year, there will be eight presidential tickets on the ballot in Alaska; voters can rank all of them if they choose.

The first use of ranked choice voting -- and when it first came into play -- was in a 2022 special election for the state's at-large congressional district. Now-Rep. Mary Peltola, a Democrat, received the most votes in the first round of voting, while two Republican candidates finished second and third. She surpassed 50% of the vote when the third-place candidate was eliminated.

Peltola went on to win the regularly scheduled election, which also used ranked choice voting, later that year. She faces Republican Nick Begich, one of the two candidates she defeated in 2022, and two others in November.

Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski was reelected in 2022 in a race that went to ranked choice voting.

Alaska will vote next month on a ballot measure that would repeal the state's new open primary and ranked choice general election system.

The more candidates in a race, the more likely it is that candidates will split the vote and nobody will win a majority, advancing the election to ranked choice voting. The presidential ballots in Maine and Alaska will include more than just Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump, so it's possible those states' races could wind up going to ranked choice voting.

Maine is one of two states that gives an electoral vote to the winner of each congressional district along with two to the statewide winner, and ranked choice voting could go into effect if no presidential candidate receives a majority in one of the districts.

In 2020, before Alaska's ranked choice voting was in place, Trump received about 53% of the state's vote. Democrat Joe Biden won Maine with about 53% of the vote that year.

Sweedler reported from Washington.

What is the Electoral College and how does the US use it to elect presidents?,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/what-to-know-electoral-college-presidential-elections-1fe5436f724d87030f340f1893626f6e,2024-10-08T19:14:10Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Donald Trump won the presidency in 2016 because of the Electoral College. So did George W. Bush in 2000.

The Electoral College is the unique American system of electing presidents. It is different from the popular vote, and it has an outsize impact on how candidates run and win campaigns. Republicans Trump and Bush lost the popular vote during their presidential runs but won the Electoral College to claim the nation's top office.

Some Democrats charge that the system favors Republicans and they would rather the United States elect presidents by a simple majority vote. But the country's framers set up the system in the Constitution, and it would require a constitutional amendment to change.

A look at the Electoral College and how it works, as Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee for president, compete for the White House on Election Day, Nov. 5:

The Electoral College is a 538-member body that elects a president. The framers of the Constitution set it up to give more power to the states and as a compromise to avoid having Congress decide the winner.

Each state's electors vote for the candidate who won the popular vote in that state. The runner-up gets nothing -- except in Nebraska and Maine where elector votes are awarded based on congressional district and statewide results.

To win the presidency, a candidate must secure 270 electoral votes -- a majority of the 538 possible votes.

Under the Electoral College system, more weight is given to a single vote in a small state than to the vote of someone in a large state, leading to outcomes at times that have been at odds with the popular vote.

It also affects how candidates campaign. Because the outcome is almost certain in solidly Republican states and solidly Democratic states, candidates tend to focus most of their efforts on a handful of swing states that have split their votes in recent elections.

Electors are allocated based on how many representatives a state has in the House of Representatives, plus its two senators. The District of Columbia gets three, despite the fact that the home to Congress has no vote in Congress.

It varies by state, but often the electors are picked by state parties. Members of Congress cannot serve as electors.

After state election officials certify their elections, electors meet in their individual states -- never as one body -- to certify the election. This year, that will happen on Dec. 17.

If the two candidates have a tied number of votes, the election is thrown to the House, where each state's congressional delegation gets one vote. That has happened only twice, in 1801 and 1825.

Once a state's electors have certified the vote, they send a certificate to Congress. Congress then formally counts and certifies the vote at a special session on Jan. 6. The vice president presides as the envelopes for each state are opened and verified.

Lawmakers can object to a state's results during the congressional certification, as several Republicans did after the 2020 election. On Jan. 6, 2021, the House and Senate both voted to reject GOP objections to the Arizona and Pennsylvania results.

After Trump tried to overturn his defeat to Democrat Joe Biden and his supporters stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, Congress updated the 1800s-era Electoral Count Act to make it harder to object and to more clearly lay out the vice president's ceremonial role, among other changes. Trump had pressured Vice President Mike Pence to try and object to the results -- something the vice president has no legal standing to do.

Once Congress certifies the vote, the new or returning president will be inaugurated Jan. 20 on the steps of the Capitol.

Election certification is a traditionally routine duty that has become politicized in the Trump era,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-certification-electoral-college-trump-harris-6319a520078cca1455862151f085414e,2024-10-08T19:14:07Z,"For the outcome of this year's presidential race, it will be the vote count on election night and possibly in the days after that will grab the public's attention. But those numbers are unofficial until the election is formally certified -- a once uneventful process that has become politicized since then-President Donald Trump tried to overturn his reelection loss four years ago.

Trump unsuccessfully pressured fellow Republicans on an evenly divided board that had to sign off on Michigan's vote not to certify his loss in the state. On Jan. 6, 2021, he directed his supporters to march to the Capitol and stop Congress from taking the final step to certify that Democrat Joe Biden had won the presidency.

This year, Trump's allies have set the table to try to block certification should Trump lose to Democrat Kamala Harris.

The best way to think about certification is as a three-step process.

It starts with local governments, such as counties. It then moves to states, which add up all the local totals to certify the winner and appoint presidential electors. Congress then effectively certifies the votes of those electors.

The process may seem daunting, especially on the local level. Most of the country's thousands of individual election jurisdictions -- many of which have been taken over by Trump supporters -- have to officially certify their vote tallies before a state can certify a winner. If just one of those counties refuses to certify, it could stop a state from signing off.

Legal experts say there is no actual legal risk of Trump's allies being able to reverse a loss by refusing to certify at the local level. Decades of case law hold that local officials have no choice but to certify election results. Any potential problem with the vote count can be challenged in court, but not on the boards and commissions that have the ceremonial task of certifying the ballot tallies and transmitting them to the state.

Trump supporters have tried to block election results in Arizona, Michigan and New Mexico since 2020 by refusing to certify them, only to be forced to sign off by courts or to back down under legal pressure.

The notion that a lone board could hold up a state by refusing to certify is ""this crazy fantasy that has merged the right and the left,"" said Derek Muller, a University of Notre Dame law professor.

In 2020, Trump focused intensely on getting Republican state leaders to refuse to certify his losses and send his own slate of electors to the Electoral College. That failed everywhere.

In 2024, four of the six swing states where Trump disputed his loss are led by Democratic governors. In the other two, the GOP governors don't seem likely to go along with a potential push by Trump to stop certification. Georgia's Brian Kemp defied Trump in 2020, and Nevada's Joe Lombardo was elected in 2022 with votes from Democrats.

The last step in the certification process is in Congress on Jan. 6. Once the states have certified their winners and selected their electors, and those electors cast their votes for president, the Constitution requires Congress to formally count those votes.

That's what Trump and his supporters seized on in 2020, arguing that Congress could choose to reject Electoral College votes from states where it didn't trust the vote count. Even after the assault on the Capitol, a majority of House Republicans -- 139 of them -- and eight Republican senators voted to reject Biden's electors from Pennsylvania. That wasn't enough votes to change the outcome of the election, but it's a signal that they could try again should Harris win.

A bipartisan majority in Congress not only upheld Biden's 2020 victory but then amended the law that governs how Congress certifies a presidential election to make it much harder to reject Electoral College votes. If Harris wins, we'll see if that majority still holds on Jan. 6 to confirm her victory.

Harris proposes expanding Medicare to cover in-home senior care,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-home-health-care-sandwhich-generation-098a7ed48dfd94d11fb0efcd5d63b42b,2024-10-08T19:05:50Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris is proposing to provide federal funding to cover home care costs for older Americans, aiming to help the "" sandwich generation "" of adults caring for aging parents while raising their children at the same time.

Appearing Tuesday on ABC's ""The View,"" Harris talked about taking care of her mother when she was dying and personally experiencing the challenges many families face when seeking affordable in-home care for their aging loved ones.

She promised that if, elected in November, she will seek to expand Medicare, the federal health insurance program for older Americans, so that it covers long-term care and includes services like in-home aides. Harris said aides could help seniors do things as simple as preparing meals or putting on sweaters because it is ""about dignity for that individual. It's about independence for that individual.""

Her proposal is a new one just a month out from Election Day but the issue is one that President Joe Biden 's administration has been working on for years.

In an effort to soften the effects of inflation, the White House promoted as part of Build Back Better, its legislative agenda that stalled on Capitol Hill years ago, steeply increased federal spending for child care as well as for seniors. After Build Back Better collapsed, the Biden administration continued to promote increasing spending for what it calls ""the care economy,"" a cause Harris has continued to mention after replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.

""These plans are common sense. They can help family caregivers work and save both families and the federal government money by allowing seniors to stay in their homes instead of being sent to nursing homes,"" the Harris campaign said in a fact sheet detailing her proposal. ""Medicare at Home will also reduce hospitalizations.""

As part of a blitz of media interviews she's been doing in recent days, Harris sat down after her appearance on ""The View"" with radio personality Howard Stern, who said that his mother is 97. Taking care of an elderly parent, he said, ""will bankrupt you.""

Such costs have increased pressure on adults caring for their parents and kids simultaneously. In 2019, roughly 30% of family caregivers of older Americans lived in households that included children or grandchildren, according to AARP.

Harris would likely have to work with Congress to achieve key parts of her proposal. Harris' campaign points to past, similar proposals projected to cost $40 billion annually, but says much of that can be offset by savings achieved through efforts begun by the Biden administration to expand Medicare's ability to negotiation prices with major drug manufacturers.

Harris is also promising to further expand Medicare to include hearing and vision coverage, while changing existing rules that can allow federal authorities to seize a deceased beneficiary's home to recuperate costs. The campaign fact sheet says that practice ""means that those homes are not passed on to the seniors' children, which particularly harms rural and minority families."""
Courts keep weighing in on abortion. Next month's elections could mean even bigger changes,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-ruling-texas-georgia-5c5d73c45274f90d40f7a4a07f00a27a,2024-10-08T16:18:22Z,"Two court rulings Monday bolstered abortion opponents, with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that Texas could ban emergency abortions if they violate state law and Georgia's top court allowing enforcement of the abortion ban in that state.

The rulings are the latest in a legal saga that's been playing out a few rulings at a time across the U.S. for the past two years -- since the nation's top court overturned Roe v. Wade, ended the nationwide right to abortion, and opened the door to bans and restrictions, as well as the new legal fights that followed.

Meanwhile, abortion is also a top concern for voters ahead of next month's elections, including in nine states where it's on the ballot directly in the form of state constitutional amendments.

Here are five key things to know about the latest abortion developments across the country.

In the fallout of the 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, President Joe Biden's administration told hospitals that federal law required them to provide abortion services when the life of the pregnant person was at risk.

Texas sued over the policy, saying the federal government could not mandate the right to abortions that would violate the state's ban at all stages of pregnancy, with exceptions to protect the health and life of the woman.

On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand. The justices did not detail their reasoning.

A weeks after a Georgia judge blocked the state's ban on abortion after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy, the state Supreme Court on Monday put it back into place -- at least for now.

The state's top court said the ban on abortion once cardiac activity can be detected, generally about six weeks into pregnancy and often before women realize they're pregnant, can be enforced while it considers the state's appeal of the September ruling.

It's not clear how many abortions were provided in the state that could not have been under the ban during the week the rules were relaxed. Some clinics said they were willing to provide abortions after six weeks, though.

The ruling meant that four states again bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy.

In another late-September development, a North Dakota ruling from earlier in the month striking down that state's abortion ban became official.

That means that 13 states are now enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, instead of 14.

But the impact of the ruling in North Dakota is limited to hospitals in the nation's second-least populous state.

The only clinic that provided abortions in the state moved from Fargo to nearby Moorhead, Minnesota, after the Dobbs ruling was made and North Dakota's ban took effect.

Court rulings are not the only place where abortion policy decisions are being made.

Voters in nine states are determining whether to add the right to abortion to their state constitutions.

In Missouri and South Dakota, the measures would undo current bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy. In Florida, it would lift a ban that kicks in after six weeks.

Nebraska has competing measures on the ballot. One would create the right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. The other would enshrine the current ban that kicks in after 12 weeks.

In Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana, it would enshrine, and in some cases expand, abortion rights. Nevada's vote would, too, but to take effect, the measure would have to pass a second time, in 2026.

Additionally, New York voters will decide on an amendment that would bar discrimination on the basis of pregnancy status, though it does not mention abortion by name.

Abortion is a major issue in elections for office, too -- including the presidential race.

Vice President Kamala Harris has been focusing on abortion rights in her presidential campaign. She says she wants to ""reinstate the protections of Roe"". She talked about it on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast this week and in a speech last month in Georgia.

Former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has taken credit for nominating Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe. He says that the issue should be up to the states and, recently, that he would veto a nationwide abortion ban if Congress passed one. He has also said he would vote against the Florida ballot measure, though he has also criticized it as too restrictive."
"Biden visita Pensilvania y Wisconsin, estados clave en la contienda electoral",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/general-news-c2c3ae97114764dcd76b65100c39386a,2024-10-08T16:06:24Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- El presidente Joe Biden hará una inusual incursión en la contienda política de 2024 desde que dio un paso atrás tras poner fin a su candidatura a la reelección.

El martes hará campaña en Pensilvania por un aliado y visitará Wisconsin para destacar un logro legislativo emblemático.

Pero mientras Biden hace un rápido recorrido por estos estados clave, dos senadores demócratas inmersos en reñidas batallas por la reelección están adoptando enfoques diferentes respecto al presidente saliente, cuyos índices de aprobación en una franja significativa del país siguen estando por los suelos.

Biden será recibido con los brazos abiertos por el senador demócrata Bob Casey cuando participe en un acto privado de recaudación de fondos para la campaña del legislador por Pensilvania en los suburbios de Filadelfia. Pero en Milwaukee, donde Biden está destacando los esfuerzos de su gobierno para sustituir las tuberías de plomo tóxicas del país, la senadora demócrata Tammy Baldwin estará ausente.

""Los demócratas en contiendas muy reñidas, en su mayoría, están calculando que el riesgo de apoyar a Biden supera con creces cualquier recompensa que sus esfuerzos puedan aportar a su campaña"", señaló Christopher Borick, director del Instituto de opinión pública del Muhlenberg College, en Pensilvania. ""No hay muchos lugares en los que pueda ser de gran ayuda a los demócratas en contiendas competitivas"".

Biden ha pasado poco tiempo haciendo campaña desde que puso fin a su proceso de reelección en julio. Eso hace que sus escalas en Pensilvania y Wisconsin -dos estados muy disputados que la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris y el expresidente Donald Trump consideran cruciales- sean aún más notables.

Las contiendas de Casey y Baldwin también se consideran imprescindibles para los demócratas, que intentan mantener su estrecho control del Senado.

Tras retirarse, Biden se comprometió a hacer campaña por Harris y los demócratas. Pero a medida que avanza la campaña, Biden se ha mantenido al margen y sigue siendo un sustituto inadecuado de Harris y de otras candidaturas demócratas.

Casey, que se enfrenta al republicano David McCormick en busca de su cuarto periodo en el Senado, mantiene una larga relación con Biden desde hace tiempo.

El senador demócrata creció en la misma calle que Biden en Scranton. Sus familias se conocen desde hace décadas, y Casey ha hecho campaña con Biden en innumerables ocasiones, incluso a principios de este año.

"Encuesta: Votantes negros apoyan más a Harris, pero no están seguros de que cambiará las cosas",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/encuesta-votantes-negros-apoyan-mas-a-harris-pero-no-estan-seguros-de-que-cambiara-las-cosas-b8e6e2f00c41d9e00df2a6b5503abc4b,2024-10-08T16:01:14Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Los votantes registrados negros tienen un punto de vista abrumadoramente positivo de la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris, pero no están seguros de que ella cambiará al país para bien, según una encuesta de AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

La encuesta, realizada a mediados de septiembre, halló que alrededor de un 70% de los votantes negros tienen una opinión muy o algo favorable de Harris, con escasa diferencia entre hombres y mujeres. Los votantes más jóvenes y los de edad más avanzada también tenían opiniones similares de la vicepresidenta.

Las opiniones entre los votantes negros hacia el expresidente y candidato presidencial republicano Donald Trump, en cambio, son abrumadoramente negativas, lo que subraya la dificultad que enfrenta en sus intentos por quitarle a Harris apoyo entre las personas de raza negra. Los votantes negros son un importante baluarte para los demócratas y pocos están alineados con el Partido Republicano. Según la encuesta, dos tercios de los votantes negros se identifican como demócratas, un 20% se identifica como independiente y solo un 10% se identifica como republicano.

Pero el sondeo también halló que, a pesar de la profunda discrepancia en los puntos de vista hacia los candidatos, los votantes negros tienen menos certeza en cuanto a que Harris pueda colocar al país en una mejor trayectoria o cambiar sus vidas de manera significativa. Preguntados si la frase ""Cambiaría al país para bien"" describe bien a Harris, solo la mitad dijo que la describiría muy o extremadamente bien, un 30% dijo que la describiría ""más o menos bien"" y un 20% dijo que la describe ""no muy bien"" o ""para nada bien"". Y solo alrededor de la mitad opinan que el resultado de estas elecciones tendrá ""mucho"" o ""algo"" de impacto en sus vidas, una proporción similar a la hallada en la población general.

""El Partido Demócrata no es lo suficiente fuerte para mí"", expresó Raina Johnson, una habitante de Chicago de 53 años de edad. Vaticinó que Harris ""tratará de hacer algo a favor de la gente"" pero se verá limitada ""como ocurrió con (Barack) Obama, porque el Partido Republicano le trancó el camino"".

Si bien Johnson opina que las elecciones serán muy importantes, no cree que le afectará mucho en su vida ""porque yo seguiré viviendo mi vida, seguiré adaptándome a los problemas que surjan"".

Preguntados sobre cuál candidato haría un mejor trabajo en encarar los temas que enfrentan al país -- como la economía, la atención médica y la delincuencia - la mayoría de los votantes negros coincidieron: Harris.

Al igual que en la población general, un 80% de los votantes negros dijeron que la economía es uno de los temas principales en esta campaña. Pero un 75% de los votantes negros dijeron que la atención médica es uno de los temas más importantes, comparado con poco más de la mitad de la población general. Además, los votantes negros son más propensos a opinar que las normas sobre tenencia de armas y la delincuencia son problemas importantes, que en la población general.

En todos esos temas, así como en otros como el aborto y el cambio climático, Harris supera cómodamente a Trump entre los votantes negros. Pero el tamaño de esa ventaja es mayor en algunos temas que en otros. Un 60% de los votantes negros opinan que Harris está mejor posicionada para manejar la economía, mientras que un 20% dice lo mismo de Trump, lo que le da a Harris una ventaja de alrededor de 40 puntos. En cuanto al aborto, ella tiene una ventaja de alrededor de 60 puntos.

La campaña de Trump ha estado aumentando sus intentos por ganarse el apoyo de las comunidades negras, creyendo que su mensaje en cuanto a la economía, la inmigración y los valores tradicionales puede quitarle votos a los demócratas, particularmente entre los hombres negros más jóvenes.

Rod Wettlin, un jubilado y veterano de la Fuerza Aérea en Surprise, Arizona que desea más acción en cuanto a la atención médica y la inmigración, dice que se opone fuertemente a Trump y que teme que la democracia estadounidense está en peligro.

""Lo que está pasando ahora es la culminación de algo a lo que nos hemos enfrentado desde hace años"", dijo Wettlin. ""Ojalá después de las elecciones volveremos a un discurso más civil, pero esta gente desde ya está clamando por un caos. Y eso es su derecho, yo luché para que ellos tengan ese derecho. Pero que no vengan a pisarme mis derechos"".

Hay indicios de que algunos votantes negros consideran a Harris una figura más fuerte. Las mujeres negras y los votantes negros de mayor edad especialmente son más propensos a describir a Harris como alguien que ""luchará a favor de gente como tú"", comparado con los hombres negros y los votantes negros más jóvenes.

Son relativamente pocos los votantes negros que tienen una opinión positiva de Trump, o que lo consideran un candidato poseedor de las cualidades necesarias para ser presidente. La encuesta halló que alrededor del 80% de los votantes negros tienen una opinión algo o muy desfavorable de Trump, mientras que apenas un 15% tienen una opinión algo o muy favorable. Apenas alrededor de un 10% dicen que frases como ""Cambiaría al país para bien"" o ""Lucharía por gente como tú"" describen bien a Trump, y una proporción igualmente baja de votantes negros dijeron que Trump sería un buen presidente.

""Creo que iremos por la dirección correcta si Kamala Harris gana"", opinó Roslyn Coble, una residente de Oakboro, Carolina del Norte, de 63 años de edad. ""Pero si Donald Trump gana, las cosas irán mal. Él ya dejó claro lo que va a hacer, va a ser un dictador"".

Alrededor del 70% de los votantes negros dicen que la frase ""Dirá cualquier cosa para ganar las elecciones"" describe a Trump por lo menos muy bien.

En un indicio de cómo la decisión del presidente Joe Biden de retirarse como candidato demócrata en julio podría haber afectado la contienda, solo un 55% de los hombres negros tienen una opinión favorable de Biden, comparado con 70% entre las mujeres negras.

Biden ""hizo lo mejor que pudo"", declaró Wettlin. Añadió que Biden debió haberse retirado mucho antes, y se mostró escéptico ante los logros del mandatario.

Grupos de activismo negro dicen que han detectado un aumento en energía y entusiasmo desde que Harris se convirtió en la candidata demócrata, y tanto la campaña de Harris como la de Trump siguen centrando esfuerzos en ese sector demográfico.

La campaña de Trump ha estado organizando eventos en vecindarios negros de ciudades como Filadelfia, Detroit y Milwaukee y organizó una gira en autobús con el lema ""Voces Negras A Favor De Trump"" en septiembre. Por su parte, la campaña de Harris ha realizado varios eventos orientados hacia los votantes negros, especialmente los hombres, y ha despachado a varios partidarios prominentes - como legisladores, celebridades y líderes de derechos civiles - en comunidades negras en semanas recientes.

La encuesta abarcó 1.771 votantes registrados y se realizó entre el 12 y 16 de septiembre usando una muestra AmeriSpeak, diseñada para ser representativa de toda la población estadounidense. Tiene un margen de error de +/- 3,4 puntos porcentuales."
Book Review: 'Countdown 1960' shows parallels with this year's presidential election season,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/countdown-1960-chris-wallace-book-review-203e5e4aa70216ea20905a4797e43fad,2024-10-08T15:55:44Z,"""Countdown 1960: The Behind-the-Scenes Story of the 312 Days that Changed America's Politics Forever"" is a look at a critical period in U.S. history that holds lessons for today.

CNN news anchor Chris Wallace starts the book in January 1960, when U.S. Sen. John F. Kennedy of Massachusetts declared his candidacy for the presidency during a divided time in United States politics. We are introduced to mobsters, Hollywood movie stars, labor bosses and Cuba's revolutionary leader Fidel Castro.

It was the year that U.S. presidential campaigns entered the modern era, with televised debates and slick advertising, The achingly close contest was not unlike the current lead-up to the 2024 election pitting Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris against Republican Donald Trump.

Like now, there were charges of voter fraud and a stolen election. The results were so tight that Americans stayed up well past midnight to hear the final count.

The book is the latest in Wallace's ""Countdown"" series of popular histories, following his best-selling ""Countdown 1945: The Extraordinary Story of the Atomic Bomb and the 116 Days that Changed the World,"" and ""Countdown bin Laden: The Untold Story of the 247-Day Hunt to Bring the Mastermind of 9/11 to Justice.""

This time, Wallace, the son of CBS broadcaster Mike Wallace, takes us behind the scenes to view the machinations of the 1960 Democratic National Convention that led to Kennedy's nomination over Lyndon B. Johnson, later chosen as his running mate. Kennedy went on to become the first Catholic and youngest person elected U.S. president.

Kennedy narrowly defeated Republican Richard M. Nixon, who ultimately decided not to contest the results despite reports of voting irregularities in Illinois and Texas. He said he could not think of a worse example for young nations trying to adopt free elections.

As we approach another consequential election this year, the book is a reminder of how 1960 was also a deeply perilous time for America. It also was a moment the nation survived because of patriotism and courage."
The Latest: Harris continues media blitz with 3 more national interviews,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-2024-831fd5c5a53476639c664234b1dafe3b,2024-10-08T15:27:46Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris is continuing her media tour Tuesday with three more interviews for national audiences, with Election Day now just four weeks away.

The Democratic presidential nominee was scheduled to appear in New York with the women of ""The View,"" speak with radio host Howard Stern, and tape a show with late-night comedian Stephen Colbert. The trio of appearances comes after Harris granted interviews to CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" which aired Monday night, and Anderson's Cooper's podcast, which was released Sunday.

The blitz comes after Harris has largely avoided interviews since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket. Long past the midway point of her unexpected presidential campaign and with voting already underway, Harris is still introducing herself to Americans who will determine her fate in this year's presidential election.

Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Vice President Kamala Harris, according to a recent poll from the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

About 7 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, with few differences between Black men and women voters on how they view the Democratic candidate.

Black voters' opinions of former President Donald Trump, by contrast, were overwhelmingly negative, underscoring the challenges he faces as he seeks to erode Harris' support among Black men.

But the poll also found that despite this dramatic gap in views, many Black voters don't see Harris as a candidate who will set the country on a better trajectory or make a substantial difference in their own lives.

Jill Biden will return to the campaign trail this week on a tour of battleground states to help boost Vice President Kamala Harris.

Harris' campaign and the White House announced Tuesday that the first lady will depart Friday on a five-day, five-state swing with stops in Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania.

The appearances will mark the first lady's return to campaigning. She had campaigned extensively for her husband, President Joe Biden, when he was running for reelection. But she pulled back after Biden folded his campaign and endorsed Harris to replace him on the Democratic ticket.

With four weeks to go until Election Day, Harris' campaign said the first lady will be urging people to get out and vote. The campaign noted that early voting is set to start Wednesday in Arizona and that mail ballots are going out in the five states that Jill Biden will be visiting.

President Joe Biden is campaigning through two key swing states, but two Democratic senators locked in competitive reelection battles are taking markedly different approaches to the the outgoing president.

Biden will be fully embraced by Democratic Sen. Bob Casey when he participates in a private campaign fundraiser in suburban Philadelphia for the senior Pennsylvania senator.

But in Milwaukee, where Biden is spotlighting his administration's efforts to replace the nation's toxic lead pipes, incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin will be conspicuously absent.

Biden has spent scant time on the campaign trail since ending his reelection effort in July. That makes his stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- two tightly contested states that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump see as crucial -- all the more notable.

But as Biden makes a quick swing through the key states, two Democratic senators locked in competitive reelection battles are taking markedly different approaches to the outgoing president, whose approval ratings in a significant swath of the country remain in the pits.

Casey's and Baldwin's races are also seen as must-wins for Democrats who are trying to maintain their razor-tight control of the Senate.

Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump is speaking at Trump International Doral in Miami, headlining a memorial service for the attack on Oct. 7, 2023, against Israel, telling his audience the threat of Hurricane Milton wouldn't have kept him away.

""I think I'm the only person who flew into Florida today,"" Trump said at the outset of his remarks. ""I wouldn't have missed it, regardless.""

Milton, a Category 5 hurricane, could come ashore Wednesday in the Tampa Bay region.

Trump said he had never heard of a Category 5 hurricane hitting land. However, hurricanes Andrew and Michael in Florida were Category 5, the latter of which struck during his administration.

President Joe Biden has spoken with Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis to discuss preparations in Florida for the approaching Hurricane Milton and ongoing recovery efforts from the devastation caused by Hurricane Helene.

The White House confirmed the president's call with the governor after Vice President Kamala Harris earlier on Monday accused DeSantis of ""playing political games"" and engaging in ""political gamesmanship"" over the federal response to Helene.

Biden, according to the White House, asked DeSantis ""to call him directly if there is anything that can be done to further support the response and recovery efforts.""

Harris' office suggested earlier that DeSantis was dodging Harris, saying she reached out to the governor last week but the two never spoke.

DeSantis said that he ""didn't know that she had called"" and ""they didn't call me.""

Biden also spoke on Monday with Tampa Mayor Jane Castor and received a detailed briefing from National Weather Service Director Ken Graham on the expected impact Milton will cause.

Graham stressed during the briefing that people in the storm's path should evacuate now while there's time to do so.

Vice President Kamala Harris says she owns a Glock pistol and that she has fired it at a shooting range.

""I've had it for quite some time,"" said Harris, during an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" aired on Monday evening.

Harris last month at a campaign event with Oprah Winfrey noted that she was a gun owner. She caused a stir when she told Winfrey, ""If somebody breaks into my house, they're getting shot.""

Harris has advocated for stricter gun safety laws, while also underscoring that she and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, are gun owners.

Harris laughed when asked by ""60 Minutes"" journalist Bill Whitaker if she had ever shot her weapon."
Harris hace campaña en podcasts y otros medios para llegar a los votantes,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/general-news-06359cf38877693936c735a02260abc1,2024-10-08T15:07:52Z,"NUEVA YORK (AP) -- Cuando la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris apareció en el podcast de Alex Cooper, la conversación no comenzó con el análisis de posturas políticas. El objetivo, le dijo Cooper a la candidata demócrata, era ""conocerla a usted como persona"".

Y eso le pareció muy bien a Harris, que acudió al popular podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" porque ""una de las mejores formas de comunicarse con la gente es siendo auténtica"".

Mucho más allá de la mitad de su inesperada campaña presidencial, y con la votación ya en marcha, Harris sigue dándose a conocer a los votantes estadounidenses que determinarán su destino en la elección presidencial de este año.

El martes, su campaña mediática la llevara a distintos estudios en todo Manhattan, mientras la candidata demócrata trata de llegar a tantas personas como pueda en el menor tiempo posible. Es un marcado contraste con la época en la que evitaba dar entrevistas desde que reemplazó al presidente Joe Biden en la candidatura presidencial, y una forma implícita de reconocer que tiene que hacer más para superar al candidato republicano Donald Trump.

Harris conversará con las mujeres del programa ""The View"" de ABC, hablará con el conductor de radio Howard Stern y grabará un programa con el comediante nocturno Stephen Colbert. Las tres apariciones se producen después de que Harris concediera entrevistas en ""60 Minutes"" de CBS que se transmitió el lunes en la noche, y en el podcast de Cooper, emitido el domingo.

El podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" suele ser provocativo, y se habla abiertamente de sexo, pero Harris y Cooper comenzaron hablando de sus respectivas madres.

Harris señaló que el primer instinto de su madre fue nunca consolar a su hija mayor cuando se metía en problemas. En cambio, le preguntaba, ""¿Qué hiciste?"".

Aunque eso podría parecer frío, señaló la vicepresidenta, ""en realidad me estaba enseñando a pensar, dónde tuviste influencia en ese momento y qué pudiste decidir hacer o no. No dejes simplemente que las cosas te ocurran"".

Son interacciones como esas a las que el equipo de Harris da prioridad para la vicepresidenta, en las últimas cuatro semanas antes del día de la elección. Ella aún no ha dado entrevistas a diarios o revistas, pero su personal considera la posibilidad de que acuda a más podcasts donde piensan que Harris pueda llegar a votantes que no siguen los medios noticiosos tradicionales.

Anna Greenberg, una encuestadora demócrata, dijo que Harris debe motivar a las personas que se han desligado de la política porque piensan que ""todos los políticos son iguales, dicen lo mismo, no saben nada de mi vida, y no puedo identificarme con ellos en absoluto"".

""Quieren que les gustes y que puedan confiar en ti"", dijo.

Jennifer Harris, exdirectora de alto nivel de economía de la Casa Blanca, dijo que Harris tiene un camino más largo que recorrer por la forma en que se convirtió en candidata demócrata.

""No tuvimos una buena y larga elección primaria para conocer a Kamala Harris en la forma que muchos votantes están acostumbrados"", dijo. Harris debe hallar la manera de demostrar los instintos y principios que ""guiarán cientos de cuestiones políticas que surgirán durante la presidencia"".

Ataques israelíes están trastocando el equilibrio de poder en Oriente Medio,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/world-news/general-news-b4a473447c9923bc9d7e5db222346f7b,2024-10-08T14:36:27Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israel está atacando a milicias respaldadas por Irán en una franja de casi 3.200 kilómetros (2.000 millas) y ha amenazado al mismo Irán, una gestión que podría poner fin a dos décadas de ascendencia iraní en la región inadvertidamente provocada por la invasión estadounidense de Irak en el 2003.

En Washington, Tel Aviv, Jerusalén y en las capitales árabes, los opositores y partidarios de la ofensiva israelí están ofreciendo ideas encontradas sobre qué debería hacer Estados Unidos a medida que su aliado se anota éxitos tácticos contra Hezbollah en el Lïbano y contra los hutíes en Yemen, y avanza en su campaña por aplastar al grupo Hamás en la Franja de Gaza.

Israel debe recibir todo el apoyo que necesita de Estados Unidos hasta que el gobierno iraní ""caiga en el basural de la historia como lo han hecho tantas dictaduras del pasado"", estimó Richard Goldberg, asesor sénior de la Foundation for the Defense of Democracies, una institución de inclinación conservadora en Washington. Es una postura que comparten algunos políticos israelíes.

Yendo aun más lejos, Yoel Guzansky, ex integrante del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional israelí, se manifestó a favor de que Estados Unidos se suma a Israel en un ataque conjunto contra Irán. Ello ""le enviaría un mensaje bien claro a los iraníes: no se metan con nosotros"", dijo Guzansky.

Sin embargo, hay quienes apuntan a lecciones de la campaña norteamericana en Irak y el derrocamiento de Saddam Hussein, cuando el entonces presidente George W. Bush ignoró advertencias árabes de que el dictador iraquí era un contrapeso indispensable contra la influencia iraní. Advierten que Estados Unidos no debe depender en victorias militares sin considerar los riesgos, objetivos y planes para siguientes etapas, y sobre la posibilidad de consecuencias indeseadas.

Al final Israel ""podría terminar en una situación en que sólo se puede proteger mediante una guerra perpetua"", dice Vali Nasr, quien fue asesor a la administración de Barack Obama y quien es hoy profesor en la Escuela de Estudios Internacionales Avanzados Johns Hopkins (SAIS) y ha sido uno de los principales estudiosos del ascenso de la influencia iraní desde la invasión estadounidense de Irak.

En momentos en que el primer ministro israelí Benjamin Netanyahu le presta limitada atención a los llamados de mesura que le hace el gobierno estadounidense, Washington y sus aliados en el Medio Oriente ""están a merced de cuán lejos quiere Netanyahu llevar las cosas"", dice Nasr.

""Es como si no hemos aprendido las lecciones del error de ese experimento ... en Irak en el 2003, sobre la idea de reestructurar el orden político del Medio Oriente"", sostiene Randa Slim, profesora en SAIS e investigadora del Middle East Institute, una institución en Washington.

Los partidarios de Israel están a favor de debilitar a Irán y las milicias que controla, las cuales atacan a Estados Unidos, Israel y sus aliados, reprimen a la sociedad civil y se ponen del lado de Rusia y otros adversarios de Occidente.

Los opositores advierten que acciones militares sin resolver los agravios de los palestinos y otros grupos podrían dejar al Medio Oriente en un espiral de guerra, insurgencias, violencia y la represión de regímenes que tratan de controlar la situación.

Está además la posibilidad de que Irán desarrolle armas nucleares en un intento por asegurar su supervivencia. Antes de los ataques israelíes contra Hezbollah, los líderes iraníes habían mostrado interés en regresar a la mesa de negociaciones sobre su programa nuclear y en general, en mejorar relaciones con Occidente.

En apenas semanas, los ataques y operaciones encubiertas israelíes han devastado la conducción, las filas y los arsenales de Hezbollah -- milicia libanesa que se había erguido como una de las fuerzas más potentes del Medio Oriente y una herramienta de Irán para defenderse de ataques contra su territorio -- y han golpeado instalaciones petroleras de los hutíes yemeníes.

Un año de ataques aéreos israelíes en Gaza parecen haber reducido la cúpula del grupo proiraní Hamás a unos pocos sobrevivientes escondidos en túneles. Sin embargo, las fuerzas israelíes nuevamente se vieron enfrascadas en combates allí esta semana y Hamás logró disparar cohetes contra Tel Aviv en el aniversario de los ataques que ese grupo perpetró contra Israel el 7 de octubre, hecho que desencadenó la actual guerra.

La anticipada represalia israelí contra Irán podría acelerar el cambio en el equilibrio de poder regional, luego que Irán lanzó misiles balísticos contra Israel la semana pasada en respuesta a los asesinatos de líderes de Hezbollah y Hamás. Podría también aumentar el riesgo de una conflagración regional más amplia, algo que el presidente Joe Biden y muchos gobiernos anteriores han tratado de evitar desde hace décadas.

El aumento de los ataques israelíes desde fines del mes pasado ha frustrado los intentos de Estados Unidos, Egipto y Qatar por lograr un cese al fuego y una liberación de rehenes en Gaza. Líderes estadounidenses dicen que Israel no les avisó antes de atacar a los líderes del Hezbollah en el Líbano, pero han defendido los asaltos israelíes aunque perseveran en sus intentos por lograr una tregua.

La vicepresidenta y candidata presidencial demócrata Kamala Harris dijo en una entrevista el lunes con el programa ""60 Minutes"" de CBS que Estados Unidos está decidido a darle a Israel las armas que necesite para su defensa, pero que al mismo tiempo seguirá con sus esfuerzos por poner fin al conflicto.

""No vamos a dejar de ejercer presión sobre Israel y sobre otros en la región, incluyendo los líderes árabes"", manifestó Harris.

Los ataques israelíes, para algunos, asoman la tentadora posibilidad de debilitar la alianza antioccidental y antiisraelí entre Irán y grupos afines en el Líbano, Irak, Siria y Yemen, y gobiernos como el de Rusia y Corea del Norte.

Las alianzas militares iraníes - apodadas ""El eje de la resistencia"" - crecieron primero a nivel regional y luego a nivel global luego que la invasión estadounidense de Irak derrocó a Saddam, quien había librado una guerra de ocho años contra el ambicioso régimen teocrático iraní.

Los partidarios de la invasión estadounidense de Irak y del derrocamiento de Saddam acertaron en cuanto a que la democracia iraquí se afianzaría, pero las consecuencias indeseadas fueron aun mayores, como el surgimiento del ""Eje de la resistencia"" y de nuevos grupos extremistas, como el Estado Islámico.

""Un Irán envalentonado y expansionista parece ser el único ganador"" de la guerra del 2003, dice una evaluación del ejército norteamericano sobre las lecciones derivadas de ese conflicto.

""Hace dos décadas, ¿quién se hubiera imaginado que Irán le estaría dando armas a Rusia? La explicación está en el aumento de su influencia tras el derrocamiento de Saddam"", dijo Ihsan Alshimary, profesor de ciencias políticas de la Universidad de Bagdad.

Aun más que en el 2003, los líderes globales están ofreciendo pocos vaticinios de cómo terminarán los cambios que están generando las acciones militares israelíes, ya sea para Irán, Israel, el Medio Oriente en general y Estados Unidos.

Irán y sus aliados están siendo debilitados, dijo Goldberg, de la Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. Pero también está disminuyendo la influencia estadounidense, al ser arrastrada por Israel, sostuvo Nasr.

El conflicto podría terminar perjudicando a Israel si se estanca, por ejemplo, en una guerra terrestre en el Líbano, dijo Mehran Kamrava, profesor y experto en temas del Medio Oriente en la Universidad de Georgetown en Qatar.

Tras cuatro décadas de intensa animosidad entre Israel y los líderes iraníes, ""la guerra fría entre ellos se ha convertido una guerra caliente. Y ello está cambiando, y sin duda cambiará, el panorama estratégico en el Medio Oriente"", afirmó Kamrava.

""Estamos sin duda en el precipicio de un cambio"", dijo Kamrava, pero ""la dirección y la naturaleza de ese cambio es muy difícil de predecir en estos momentos"".

El gobierno de Biden impone un plazo de 10 años a las ciudades para retirar tuberías de plomo,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/general-news-2f3f4cd4c78ead331ea705bc8bc6aa3d,2024-10-08T10:59:04Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Una década después de que la crisis de agua en Flint, Michigan, hiciera sonar las alarmas sobre el peligro que sigue suponiendo el plomo en el agua del grifo, el presidente de Estados Unidos, Joe Biden, marcó un plazo de 10 años para que ciudades de todo el país sustituyan sus conducciones de plomo, lo que completaba una agresiva estrategia dirigida a garantizar que el agua potable es segura para todos los estadounidenses.

Estaba previsto que Biden anunciara el martes la norma definitiva de la Agencia de Protección Ambiental de Estados Unidos (EPA, por sus siglas en inglés) en el estado disputado de Wisconsin, en el último mes de una ajustada campaña presidencial. El anuncio ponía sobre la mesa un asunto -- el agua potable segura -- que Kamala Harris ha priorizado como vicepresidenta y durante su campaña presidencial. La nueva norma sustituye a una regulación más laxa aprobada por el gobierno del expresidente Donald Trump que no incluía un requisito universal de sustituir las tuberías de plomo.

Biden y Harris creen que es ""un imperativo moral"" asegurarse de que todo el mundo tiene acceso a agua potable limpia, indicó el lunes a periodistas el administrador de la EPA, Michael Regan. ""Sabemos que más de 9 millones de tuberías de plomo antiguas siguen llevando agua a hogares en todo nuestro país. Pero la ciencia está clara desde hace décadas: no hay un nivel seguro de plomo en nuestra agua potable"".

La norma es la reforma más importante de los niveles autorizados de plomo en el agua en unas tres décadas. El plomo, un metal pesado utilizado en tuberías, pintura, munición y muchos otros productos, es una neurotoxina que puede causar una amplia gama de problemas de salud, desde trastornos de comportamiento a daño cerebral. El plomo reduce las puntuaciones de los niños en pruebas de inteligencia, merma su desarrollo e incrementa la tensión sanguínea en los adultos.

La EPA estima que el estándar más estricto impedirá que hasta 900.000 bebés tengan un peso bajo al nacer y evitará hasta 1.500 muertes prematuras al año por enfermedad cardiaca.

La nueva regulación es más estricta que la que se propuso el pasado otoño y requiere que los sistemas de agua se aseguren de que la concentración de plomo no supera un ""nivel de acción"" de 10 partes por mil millones, en comparación con las 15 partes por mil millones de la norma actual. Si se encuentran niveles más altos, los sistemas de agua deben informar a la población de formas para proteger su salud, incluido el empleo de filtros de agua, y tomar medidas para reducir la exposición al plomo al tiempo que trabajan para sustituir todas las conducciones de plomo.

Las tuberías de plomo suelen afectar sobre todo a zonas urbanas de bajos ingresos. Se encuentran con más frecuencia en zonas industriales y más antiguas del país, lo que incluye grandes ciudades como Chicago, Cleveland, Nueva York, Detroit y Milwaukee, donde Biden anunciará las normas el martes.

La nueva regla también revisa cómo se miden las cantidades de plomo, lo que podría incrementar de forma significativa el número de ciudades y sistemas de agua que se considera tienen niveles excesivos de plomo, indicó la EPA.

Para ayudar a las poblaciones a cumplir los criterios, la agencia ofrecerá una partida adicional de 2.600 millones de dólares para infraestructura de aguas a través de la ley bipartidista de infraestructura. La agencia también concederá 35 millones de dólares en concursos para programas para reducir el plomo en el agua potable.

El plazo de 10 años no empezará a contar hasta dentro de tres años, lo que da tiempo para prepararse a las compañías de suministros. Un número limitado de ciudades con una gran concentración de tuberías de plomo podría recibir un plazo más largo para cumplir la nueva norma.

Biden hará el anuncio en Milwaukee, que ocupa el quinto lugar en la lista de ciudades con mayor número de tuberías de plomo en el país, según la EPA. Las autoridades locales han dedicado dinero de la ley federal de infraestructura para acelerar los trabajos de sustitución de conducciones de plomo y cumplir el objetivo de retirarlas todas en 10 años, en comparación con el objetivo inicial de 60 años.

Las tuberías de plomo pueden corroerse y contaminar el agua potable. Retirarlas reduce de forma drástica la posibilidad de una crisis. En Flint, un cambio en la fuente de agua potable de la ciudad hace más de una década la hizo más corrosiva, lo que disparó los niveles de plomo en el agua corriente. Flint era el ejemplo más llamativo de las muchas ciudades que han tenido problemas para reducir los altos niveles de plomo, como Newark, en Nueva Jersey, Benton Harbor, en Michigan, y Washington D.C.

La norma original sobre plomo y cobre en el agua potable fue aplicada por la EPA hace más de 30 años. Las normas han reducido de forma significativa el plomo en el agua corriente, pero tenían lagunas legales que permitieron que algunas ciudades tomaran pocas medidas cuando se disparaban los niveles de plomo.

""Creo que hay un apoyo muy amplio a hacer esto. Nadie quiere beber agua del grifo contaminada con plomo ni básicamente beber agua de una cañita de plomo, que es lo que están haciendo millones de personas ahora"", dijo Erik Olson, experto en salud y alimentación en la organización sin fines de lucro Natural Resources Defense Council, refiriéndose en general a los esfuerzos de la EPA por sustituir las tuberías de plomo antes del anuncio oficial.

En la práctica, desenterrar las tuberías de plomo será un desafío enorme. La ley de infraestructura aprobada en 2021 ofrecía 15.000 millones de dólares para ayudar a las ciudades a sustituirlas, pero el coste total será muchas veces esa cifra. El requisito también se anunciaba después de que el gobierno de Biden propusiera nuevos estándares más estrictos para productos químicos duraderos conocidos como PFAS, o sustancias perfluoroalquiladas y polifluoroalquiladas. Esas normas también mejorarán la salud pública, aunque a un coste de miles de millones de dólares.

La American Water Works Association, un grupo sectorial, dijo cuando se anunció la propuesta que apoya los objetivos de la EPA, pero advirtió que el coste sería prohibitivo.

Otro obstáculo es encontrar las tuberías. Muchas ciudades no tienen registros fiables que indiquen dónde están. Está previsto realizar inventarios preliminares este mes, y muchas ciudades han dicho que no saben de qué material están hechas sus tuberías.

Biden sets a 10-year deadline for US cities to replace lead pipes and make drinking water safer,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lead-pipes-epa-flint-biden-wisconsin-4aae63134894762cbe904ee460e62708,2024-10-08T09:28:14Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A decade after the Flint, Michigan, water crisis raised alarms about the continuing dangers of lead in tap water, President Joe Biden is setting a 10-year deadline for cities across the nation to replace their lead pipes, finalizing an aggressive approach aimed at ensuring that drinking water is safe for all Americans.

Biden is expected to announce the final Environmental Protection Agency rule Tuesday in the swing state of Wisconsin during the final month of a tight presidential campaign. The announcement highlights an issue -- safe drinking water -- that Kamala Harris has prioritized as vice president and during her presidential campaign. The new rule supplants a looser standard set by former President Donald Trump's administration that did not include a universal requirement to replace lead pipes.

Biden and Harris believe it's ""a moral imperative"" to ensure that everyone has access to clean drinking water, EPA Administrator Michael Regan told reporters Monday. ""We know that over 9 million legacy lead pipes continue to deliver water to homes across our country. But the science has been clear for decades: There is no safe level of lead in our drinking water.''

The rule is the strongest overhaul of lead-in-water standards in roughly three decades. Lead, a heavy metal used in pipes, paints, ammunition and many other products, is a neurotoxin that can cause a range of disorders from behavioral problems to brain damage. Lead lowers IQ scores in children, stunts their development and increases blood pressure in adults.

The EPA estimates the stricter standard will prevent up to 900,000 infants from having low birthweight and avoid up to 1,500 premature deaths a year from heart disease.

The new regulation is stricter than one proposed last fall and requires water systems to ensure that lead concentrations do not exceed an ""action level"" of 10 parts per billion, down from 15 parts per billion under the current standard. If high lead levels are found, water systems must inform the public about ways to protect their health, including the use of water filters, and take action to reduce lead exposure while concurrently working to replace all lead pipes.

Lead pipes often impact low-income urban areas the most. They are most commonly found in older, industrial parts of the country, including major cities such as Chicago, Cleveland, New York, Detroit and Milwaukee, where Biden will announce the standards on Tuesday.

The new rule also revises the way lead amounts are measured, which could significantly expand the number of cities and water systems that are found to have excessive levels of lead, the EPA said.

To help communities comply, the agency is making available an additional $2.6 billion for drinking water infrastructure through the bipartisan infrastructure law. The agency also is awarding $35 million in competitive grants for programs to reduce lead in drinking water.

The 10-year timeframe won't start for three years, giving water utilities time to prepare. A limited number of cities with large volumes of lead pipes may be given a longer timeframe to meet the new standard.

Biden will make the announcement in Milwaukee, a city with the fifth-highest number of lead pipes in the nation, according to the EPA. Officials there are using money from the federal infrastructure law to accelerate lead-pipe replacement work and meet a goal to remove all lead pipes within 10 years, down from an initial 60-year timeframe.

Lead pipes can corrode and contaminate drinking water; removing them sharply reduces the chance of a crisis. In Flint, a change in the source of the city's drinking water source more than a decade ago made it more corrosive, spiking lead levels in tap water. Flint was the highest-profile example among numerous cities that have struggled with stubbornly high levels of lead, including Newark, New Jersey, Benton Harbor, Michigan, and Washington, D.C.

The original lead and copper rule for drinking water was enacted by the EPA more than 30 years ago. The rules have significantly reduced lead in tap water but have included loopholes that allowed cities to take little action when lead levels rose too high.

""I think there is very broad support for doing this. Nobody wants to be drinking lead-contaminated tap water or basically sipping their water out of a lead straw, which is what millions of people are doing today,"" said Erik Olson, a health and food expert at the nonprofit Natural Resources Defense Council, speaking generally about the EPA's efforts to replace lead pipes ahead of the official announcement.

Actually getting the lead pipes out of the ground will be an enormous challenge. The infrastructure law approved in 2021 provided $15 billion to help cities replace their lead pipes, but the total cost will be several times higher. The requirement also comes as the Biden administration proposes strict new drinking water standards for forever chemicals called PFAS, or per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances. These standards will also improve public health although at a cost of billions of dollars.

The American Water Works Association, an industry group, said when the proposed rule was announced that it supports EPA's goals, but warned that costs could be prohibitive.

Another hurdle is finding the lead pipes. Many cities do not have accurate records detailing where they are. Initial pipe inventories are due this month, and many cities have said they don't know what substances their pipes are made of.

Biden makes rare dip into battleground state fray with visit to Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-pennsylvania-wisconsin-senate-races-casey-e7bb70bd880ca4927b5ba92acd0f3852,2024-10-08T09:27:17Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Joe Biden is making a rare jump into the 2024 political battleground fray since taking a step back after ending his reelection bid.

He'll campaign on Tuesday in Pennsylvania for a close ally and visit Wisconsin to spotlight a signature legislative achievement.

But as Biden makes a quick swing through the key states, two Democratic senators locked in competitive reelection battles are taking markedly different approaches to the outgoing president, whose approval ratings in a significant swath of the country remain in the pits.

Biden will be fully embraced by Democratic Sen. Bob Casey when he participates in an evening campaign fundraiser in Philadelphia for the senior Pennsylvania senator. But in Milwaukee, where Biden is spotlighting his administration's efforts to replace the nation's toxic lead pipes, incumbent Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin will be conspicuously absent.

""Democrats in tight races, for the most part, are calculating that the risk of embracing Biden far exceeds any reward that his efforts would bring to their campaign,"" said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania. ""There just aren't many places where he can be of much help to Democrats in competitive races.""

Biden has spent scant time on the campaign trail since ending his reelection effort in July. That makes his stops in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin -- two tightly contested states that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump see crucial -- all the more notable.

Casey's and Baldwin's races are also seen as must-wins for Democrats who are trying to maintain their razor-tight control of the Senate.

Biden, after dropping out, pledged to campaign hard for Harris and Democrats. But as the campaign season has played out, he's largely stayed on the sidelines as he's remained a flawed surrogate for Harris and down-ballot Democrats.

Casey, who faces a stiff challenge from Republican David McCormick as he seeks a fourth Senate term, has a long-running relationship with Biden.

Casey grew up on the same street as Biden in Scranton. Their families have known each other for decades, and he's campaigned with Biden countless times, including earlier this year. Biden -- a Delaware resident but a Pennsylvania native -- has long claimed Pennsylvania as his own.

Still, Biden faces considerable skepticism and his popularity has sagged amid pessimism about rising costs and doubts about whether at 81 he remains up to the job.

About 4 in 10 voters had a favorable view of Biden and about 6 in 10 had an unfavorable view, according to a Monmouth University poll published in late September.

Baldwin will spend Tuesday on the other side of Wisconsin from Biden, attending campaign events and getting an award, according to her campaign and Senate office.

""Senator Baldwin had a previously scheduled event at a family farm in Eau Claire to receive the American Farm Bureau Federation's 'Friend of Farm Bureau' award recognizing her leadership fighting for America's hardworking farmers, growers, and producers,"" said Eli Rosen, Baldwin's communications director, in response to a query about why she was skipping the president's visit.

Biden's favorability in Wisconsin has hovered around 40% for the past year and did not increase after he dropped out of the presidential race this summer, according to a recent Marquette University Law School poll.

Baldwin, who is seeking her third term, is facing a stiff challenge from Republican Eric Hovde, the CEO of a Wisconsin real estate development company.

She has skipped four of Biden's five appearances in the state this year, including two in her hometown of Madison, before he dropped out of the race.

However, Baldwin has appeared with Harris, including speaking to a crowd of more than 10,000 people last month in Madison.

""Baldwin may be able to skip a Biden event, but she cannot avoid the verdict of working families in Wisconsin when they head to the polls,"" said Wisconsin GOP chairman Brian Schimming.

Biden's visit to Wisconsin, which has some 340,000 lead pipes, comes as the Environmental Protection Agency on Tuesday issued a final rule requiring drinking water systems across the country to identify and replace lead pipes within 10 years.

Biden's 2021 infrastructure law provides $15 billion to find and replace the toxic pipes, a legacy the Biden White House says will have an impact on generations to come. Lead can lower IQ and create behavioral problems in children, and the administration believes the legislation will go a long way in removing some 9.2 million lead pipes carrying water to U.S. homes.

White House officials played down Baldwin's expected absence from the event, while noting that Wisconsin's other senator, Republican Ron Johnson, voted against the infrastructure law.

""Senator Baldwin is an amazing partner (to) this administration in leading the charge in the bipartisan infrastructure law,"" White House deputy chief of staff Natalie Quillian said of Baldwin's absence from the president's visit.

Democratic U.S. Rep. Mark Pocan, whose district includes Wisconsin's deeply Democratic capital city of Madison, said Biden's policies are popular in the battleground state even if polls show he is not.

""I don't think that polling on Biden is based on what he's done in office,"" Pocan said. ""The problem with some of the polls is overly simplistic. He looks old and people don't want that in the White House, but he's not running anymore.""

Pocan, who is not in a competitive race, also defended Baldwin not appearing with Biden.

""If you're in a competitive race, you have your calendar,"" Pocan said. ""You have a strategy based on where you're trying to get votes and you don't change it when you have a surrogate come.""

Harris is still introducing herself as she sets out on media tour when people are already voting,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-stern-view-colbert-60-minutes-daddy-5a2af60ba0b1099e19cca151955c9855,2024-10-08T04:18:06Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- When Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview with podcaster Alex Cooper, the conversation didn't start by parsing policy positions. The goal, Cooper told the Democratic nominee, was ""to get to know you as a person.""

And that was just fine with Harris, who said she was on the popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast because ""one of the best ways to communicate with people is to be real.""

Long past the midway point of her unexpected presidential campaign and with voting already underway, Harris is still introducing herself to Americans who will determine her fate in this year's presidential election.

On Tuesday, her media blitz will take her to studios across Manhattan as the Democratic nominee tries to reach as many people as possible in the shortest period of time. It's a sharp shift after largely avoiding interviews since replacing President Joe Biden at the top of the ticket, and it's an implicit acknowledgment that she needs to do more to edge out Republican candidate Donald Trump.

Harris will sit for a conversation with the women of ABC's ""The View,"" speak with longtime radio host Howard Stern and tape a show with late-night comedian Stephen Colbert. The trio of appearances comes after Harris granted interviews to CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" which aired Monday night, and Cooper's podcast, which was released Sunday.

""Call Her Daddy"" is often raunchy, with frank talk about sex, but Harris and Cooper began by talking about their mothers.

Harris said her mother's first instinct was never to comfort her eldest daughter when she ran into problems. Instead, she asked, ""What did you do?""

Although that might sound cold, the vice president said, ""she was actually teaching me, think about where you had agency in that moment, and think about what you had the choice to do or not do. Don't let things just happen to you.""

It's interactions like those that Harris' team is prioritizing for the vice president in the final four weeks before Election Day. She has yet to give an interview to a newspaper or magazine, but her staff is pondering additional podcasts where they believe Harris can reach voters who aren't following traditional news sources.

Anna Greenberg, a Democratic pollster, said Harris has to energize people who have tuned out politics because they believe ""all the politicians are the same, they all say the same thing, they don't know anything about my life, I can't relate to them at all.""

""They want to like and trust you,"" she said.

Jennifer Harris, the former White House senior director of international economics, said Harris has a steeper hill to climb because of the way she became the Democratic nominee.

""We did not have a good long primary to meet Kamala Harris in the way most voters are accustomed to,"" she said. Harris has to find a way to demonstrate the instincts and principles that ""will be guiding any number of hundreds of specific policy questions that will come up in the course of the presidency.""

While Harris has unveiled some policy proposals during her two and half months at the top of the ticket -- such as increasing the child income tax credit and taking a range of actions to help lower the cost of housing -- she's given prime billing to speeches about her ""economic philosophy,"" like one she delivered in Pittsburgh two weeks ago.

There, Harris pushed back against Trump's claims that she's advancing ""communist"" ideas, embraced capitalism and positioned herself as a pragmatist who ""would take good ideas from wherever they come.""

""As president, I will be grounded in my fundamental values of fairness, dignity and opportunity,"" Harris said. ""And I promise you, I will be pragmatic in my approach.""

Senior campaign officials have largely blocked out criticism from some corners that Harris hasn't articulated more policy positions. Instead, they say that small yet pivotal numbers of still-undecided voters say they want to know more about Harris before making up their minds, and that the more those voters see Harris, the more they like her.

Republican communications strategist Kevin Madden said defining Harris in voters' eyes is the central challenge of the campaign.

""This race is actually pretty simple in the sense that the next few weeks are about who's going to fill in the blanks on who Harris is,"" he said.

Being a vice president confers a certain amount of basic name recognition. In October 2019, while Harris was one of many candidates in the Democratic presidential primary, AP-NORC polling found that about 3 in 10 Americans didn't know enough about her to have an opinion. That share dropped to around 1 in 10 Americans by early 2021, when she and Biden took office, where it stayed until earlier this summer.

Now, nearly all Americans know enough to have at least a surface opinion -- whether positive or negative -- of Harris.

But that doesn't mean perspectives on Harris are settled, or that Americans know as much as they would like about her. Harris' favorability numbers shifted slightly over the course of the summer, suggesting that opinion of her may still be somewhat malleable.

Other polls indicate that some voters are still looking for more information about Harris, while views of Trump appear to be more settled. One-quarter of likely voters said they still feel like they need to learn more about Harris, according to a New York Times/Siena College poll conducted after her debate against Trump, while about three-quarters say they pretty much already know what they need to know about her.

Trump, on the hand, was more of a known quantity. One in 10 likely voters said they feel like they need to learn more about Trump, while roughly 9 in 10 said they pretty much already know what they need to know.

On ""Call Her Daddy,"" Cooper told Harris that people are ""frustrated and just exhausted with politics in general.""

""Why should we trust you?"" she asked.

Harris answered by saying ""you can look at my career to know what I care about.""

She continued: ""I care about making sure that people are entitled to and receive the freedoms that they are due. I care about lifting people up and making sure that you are protected from harm.""

"Israel's strikes are shifting the power balance in the Middle East, with US support",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/iran-israel-middle-east-war-united-states-36d7c0bbc35964ed6ac9d21de17c632a,2024-10-08T04:13:11Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Israeli military strikes are targeting Iran's armed allies across a nearly 2,000-mile stretch of the Middle East and threatening Iran itself. The efforts raise the possibility of an end to two decades of Iranian ascendancy in the region, to which the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq inadvertently gave rise.

In Washington, Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, and Arab capitals, opponents and supporters of Israel's offensive are offering clashing ideas about what the U.S. should do next, as its ally racks up tactical successes against Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen and presses its yearlong campaign to crush Hamas in Gaza.

Israel should get all the support it needs from the United States until Iran's government ""follows other dictatorships of the past into the dustbin of history,"" said Richard Goldberg, a senior adviser at Washington's conservative-leaning Foundation for the Defense of Democracies -- calls echoed by some Israeli political figures.

Going further, Yoel Guzansky, a former senior staffer at Israel's National Security Council, called for the Biden administration to join Israel in direct attacks in Iran. That would send ""the right message to the Iranians -- 'Don't mess with us,''' Guzansky said.

Critics, however, highlight lessons from the U.S. military campaign in Iraq and toppling of Saddam Hussein, when President George W. Bush ignored Arab warnings that the Iraqi dictator was the region's indispensable counterbalance to Iranian influence. They caution against racking up military victories without adequately considering the risks, end goals or plans for what comes next, and warn of unintended consequences.

Ultimately, Israel ""will be in a situation where it can only protect itself by perpetual war,"" said Vali Nasr, who was an adviser to the Obama administration. Now a professor at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies, or SAIS, he has been one of the leading documenters of the rise of Iranian regional influence since the U.S. invasion of Iraq.

With Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu giving limited weight to Biden administration calls for restraint, the United States and its partners in the Middle East are ""at the mercy of how far Bibi Netanyahu will push it,"" Nasr said, referring to the Israeli leader by his nickname.

""It's as if we hadn't learned the lessons, or the folly, of that experiment ... in Iraq in 2003 about reshaping the Middle East order,"" said Randa Slim, a fellow at SAIS and researcher at the Washington-based Middle East Institute.

Advocates of Israel's campaign hope for the weakening of Iran and its armed proxies that attack the U.S., Israel and their partners, oppress civil society and increasingly are teaming up with Russia and other Western adversaries.

Opponents warn that military action without resolving the grievances of Palestinians and others risks endless and destabilizing cycles of war, insurgency and extremist violence, and Middle East governments growing more repressive to try to control the situation.

And there's the threat that Iran develops nuclear weapons to try to ensure its survival. Before the Israeli strikes on Hezbollah, Iranian leaders concerned about Israel's offensives had made clear that they were interested in returning to negotiations with the U.S. on their nuclear program and claimed interest in improved relations overall.

In just weeks, Israeli airstrikes and intelligence operations have devastated the leadership, ranks and arsenals of Lebanon-based Hezbollah -- which had been one of the Middle East's most powerful fighting forces and Iran's overseas bulwark against attacks on Iranian territory -- and hit oil infrastructure of Yemen's Iran-allied Houthis.

A year of Israeli airstrikes in Gaza appears to have reduced the leadership of Iranian-allied Hamas to a few survivors hiding in underground tunnels. However, Israeli forces again engaged in heavy fighting there this week, and Hamas was able to fire rockets at Tel Aviv in a surprising show of enduring strength on the Oct. 7 anniversary of the militant group's attack on Israel, which started the war.

Anticipated Israeli counterstrikes on Iran could accelerate regional shifts in power. The response would follow Iran launching ballistic missiles at Israel last week in retaliation for killings of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

It also could escalate the risk of all-out regional war that U.S. President Joe Biden -- and decades of previous administrations -- worked to avert.

The expansion of Israeli attacks since late last month has sidelined mediation by the U.S., Egypt and Qatar for a cease-fire and hostage release deal in Gaza. U.S. leaders say Israel did not warn them before striking Hezbollah leaders in Lebanon but have defended the surge in attacks, while still pressing for peace.

Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, said in an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" aired Monday that the U.S. was dedicated to supplying Israel with the military aid needed to protect itself but would keep pushing to end the conflict.

""We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders,"" she said.

Israel's expanded strikes raise for many what is the tempting prospect of weakening Iran's anti-Western, anti-Israel alliance with like-minded armed groups in Lebanon, Iraq, Syria and Yemen to governments in Russia and North Korea.

Called the ""Axis of Resistance,"" Iran's military alliances grew -- regionally, then globally -- after the U.S. invasion of Iraq removed Saddam, who had fought an eight-year war against Iran's ambitious clerical regime.

Advocates of the U.S. invasion of Iraq, and overthrow of Saddam, said correctly that an Iraqi democracy would take hold.

But the unintended effects of the U.S. intervention were even bigger, including the rise of Iran's Axis of Resistance and new extremist groups, including the Islamic State.

""An emboldened and expansionist Iran appears to be the only victor"" of the 2003 Iraq war, notes a U.S. Army review of lessons learned.

""Two decades ago, who could have seen a day when Iran was supporting Russia with arms? The reason is because of its increased influence"" after the U.S. overthrow of Saddam, said Ihsan Alshimary, professor of political science at Baghdad University.

Even more than in 2003, global leaders are offering little clear idea on how the shifts in power that Israel's military is putting in motion will end -- for Iran, Israel, the Middle East at large, and the United States.

Iran and its allies are being weakened, said Goldberg, at the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies. So is U.S. influence as it appears to be dragged along by Israel, Nasr said.

The conflict could end up hurting Israel if it bogs down in a ground war in Lebanon, for example, said Mehran Kamrava, a professor and Middle East expert at Georgetown University in Qatar.

After four decades of deep animosity between Israeli and Iranian leaders, ""the cold war between them has turned into a hot war. And this is significantly changing -- is bound to change -- the strategic landscape in the Middle East,"" he said.

""We are certainly at the precipice of change,"" Kamrava said. But ""the direction and nature of that change is very hard to predict at this stage.""

What polling shows about Black voters' views of Harris and Trump,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-election-black-voters-biden-78e344ddea4886dd23582f4a51eb0da6,2024-10-08T04:06:13Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Black registered voters have an overwhelmingly positive view of Vice President Kamala Harris, but they're less sure that she would change the country for the better, according to a recent poll from the  AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research.

The poll, which was conducted in mid-September, found about 7 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very favorable view of Harris, with few differences between Black men and women voters on how they view the Democratic candidate. Younger and older Black voters also had similar views of the vice president.

Black voters' opinions of former President Donald Trump, by contrast, were overwhelmingly negative, underscoring the challenges that the Republican candidate faces as he seeks to erode Harris' support among Black men. Black voters are an important Democratic constituency, and few are aligned with the Republican Party. According to the survey, two-thirds of Black voters identify as Democrats, about 2 in 10 identify as independents and about 1 in 10 identify as Republicans.

But the poll also found that despite this dramatic gap in views of the candidates, Black voters are less certain of whether Harris would set the country on a better trajectory, or make a substantial difference in their own lives. Only about half of Black voters say ""would change the country for the better"" describes Harris very or extremely well, while about 3 in 10 say it describes her ""somewhat well"" and about 2 in 10 say it describes her ""not very well"" or ""not well at all."" And only about half believe the outcome of this presidential election will have ""a great deal"" or ""quite a bit"" of impact on them personally, an assessment that's in line with Americans overall.

""The Democratic Party is not strong enough for me,"" said Raina Johnson, 53, a safety case manager in Chicago. Johnson predicted that Harris would ""try to do something for the people"" but she felt that Harris would be limited as it was ""with (Barack) Obama, because the Republican Party shut him down.""

While Johnson felt that the stakes of the election were extremely high, she did not think it would have a large personal impact on her.

""Because I'll still live my life. I'll just have to roll with the punches,"" she said.

When asked which candidate would do a better job handling their top issues, including the economy, health care and crime, Black voters had the same answer: Harris.

Like voters overall, about 8 in 10 Black voters said the economy is one of the most important issues to their vote. But about three-quarters of Black voters said health care was one of their most important issues, compared to slightly more than half of registered voters, and they were also more likely than the electorate as a whole to say gun policy and crime were top issues.

In all of those areas, as well as on other topics like abortion and climate change, Harris held a commanding advantage over Trump among Black voters. But the size of that edge was bigger on some issues than others. About 6 in 10 Black voters said Harris was better positioned to handle the economy, while about 2 in 10 said this about Trump, giving Harris about a 40-point advantage. On abortion policy, she had around a 60-point advantage over Trump.

The Trump campaign has stepped up with some outreach to Black communities this year. The former president's campaign believes that his message on the economy, immigration and traditional values can make notable inroads into the Democrats' traditional base of support among Black voters, especially younger Black men.

Rod Wettlin, a retired Air Force veteran in Surprise, Arizona, who wants greater action on issues like health care and immigration, said he was deeply opposed to Trump and was concerned about the implications of the election for American democracy.

""What's going on now is the culmination of a lot of stuff that's been in our face for years,"" said Wettlin. ""Hopefully after the election it is civil, but these cats out here are already calling for bedlam. And that's their right, I fought for them to have that right. But don't infringe on mine.""

There are signs that some groups of Black voters see Harris as a stronger figure, though. Black women voters and older Black voters were especially likely to describe Harris as someone who would ""fight for people like you,"" compared to Black men and younger Black voters.

Relatively few Black voters have a positive view of Trump, or see him as a candidate who has important qualities for the presidency. The poll found that about 8 in 10 Black voters have a somewhat or very unfavorable view of Trump, while just 15%  have a somewhat or very favorable view. About 1 in 10 said ""would change the country for the better"" or ""would fight for people like you"" describes Trump at least very well, and a similarly low share of Black voters said that Trump would make a good president.

""I think we're headed in the right direction if Kamala Harris gets it,"" said Roslyn Coble, 63, and a resident of Oakboro, North Carolina. ""But if Donald Trump gets it, it's going to be bad. He already told us what he's going to do. He's going to be a dictator.""

About 7 in 10 Black voters say the phrase ""will say anything to win the election"" describes Trump at least very well.

In a sign of how former President Joe Biden's decision to withdraw as the Democratic candidate in July may have altered the race, only 55% of Black men voters have a favorable view of Biden, compared to 7 in 10 Black women voters.

""He did his best,"" said Wettlin. He said that Biden should have bowed out of the presidential race far sooner and was skeptical of some of his achievements.

Black voter engagement organizations say they have also seen a burst of energy from voters and advocates since Harris' entrance into the race, and both the Harris and Trump campaigns are continuing to focus on this group.

The Trump campaign has been conducting listening sessions and community events in Black neighborhoods in cities like Philadelphia, Detroit and Milwaukee. The campaign has also coordinated a ""Black Voices for Trump"" bus tour across cities in September. Meanwhile, the Harris campaign has held a number of events geared toward Black voters, especially Black men, and has deployed a number of high-profile surrogates, including lawmakers, celebrities and civil rights leaders, to Black communities in recent weeks.

The poll of 1,771 registered voters was conducted Sept. 12-16, 2024, using a sample drawn from NORC's probability-based AmeriSpeak Panel, which is designed to be representative of the U.S. population. The margin of sampling error for registered voters is plus or minus 3.4 percentage points."

The tour's North American leg continues in New Orleans and Indianapolis before heading to Toronto and Vancouver in November and December. The final show is scheduled for Dec. 8.

Swift also missed Kelce's annual Kelce Car Jam over the weekend, a charity car show that raises money for his 87 and Running foundation, which helps underserved youth in the areas around Kansas City and Cleveland. There was still plenty of star power with Patrick Mahomes and his wife, Brittany, joining Kelce's parents his brother, retired Eagles center Jason Kelce.

Swift began her high-profile romance with Kelce last season, when he invited the ""Anti-Hero"" singer to watch him in a September matchup with the Bears. Since then, the two have spent plenty of time together, often with cameras following every move.

Swift has stayed out of the spotlight the past couple of weeks, though. That after a particularly headline-grabbing week in which she endorsed Kamala Harris for president, took home seven trophies from the MTV Video Music Awards, and show up to see the Chiefs beat the visiting Cincinnati Bengals.

Swift has become close friends with the Mahomes family over the past year. That created some controversy when the 14-time Grammy winner said she supported Harris over Donald Trump in the November election; Trump has referenced the quarterback's wife after she had liked -- and then unliked -- an Instagram post by the Republican presidential nominee.

Patrick Mahomes has declined to endorse anyone in the election, instead urging people to register to vote.

""I don't want my place and my platform to be used to endorse a candidate,"" Mahomes said. ""My place is to inform people to get registered to vote. It's to inform people to do their own research and then make the best decision for them and their family."""
Intelligence officials say US adversaries are targeting congressional races with disinformation,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/congress-russia-trump-china-cuba-disinformation-election-a4de250124d7cb93f16718831d0715a9,2024-10-07T22:33:09Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- It's not just the presidential election: Foreign governments are targeting House and Senate races around the country in their effort to meddle with American democracy this election year, intelligence officials warned Monday.

Russia, China and Cuba have all launched influence operations designed to help or hurt candidates in specific congressional races. Without giving specifics about the number of affected races, an official from the Office of the Director of National Intelligence said Monday that all three countries have zeroed in on races where they believe they have a national security interest at stake.

The warning from intelligence officials comes during a particularly tight battle for the House and Senate, where control could be decided by just a handful of races. While much of the attention has focused on attempts by foreign adversaries to influence the presidential race, Monday's warning underscores the threat that online disinformation also poses in state and local contests.

Leaders in Russia, China and Cuba understand the American political system well enough to recognize that this year's close elections create good conditions for the use and spread of disinformation, said the official, who briefed reporters on condition of anonymity under rules set by the office of the director.

Foreign adversaries have also targeted some races even further down the ballot, including statewide offices and state legislative campaigns, the official said.

Moscow's goal is to erode support for congressional candidates who favor assisting Ukraine in its war with Russia. Officials wouldn't say which candidates were targeted, but it's likely that the Kremlin's effort is intended to hurt Democrats and centrist Republicans who have supported Ukraine.

China has targeted candidates from both parties based on their stance on issues of key importance to Beijing, including support for Taiwan. Officials said they have observed Chinese disinformation agencies focusing on candidates in ""tens"" of races.

Cuba's government has mounted a narrower operation aimed at boosting candidates it believes would favor better relations with the island, such as reduced economic sanctions.

Influence operations can include false or exaggerated claims and propaganda designed to mislead voters about specific candidates, issues or races. It can also include social media posts or other digital content that seeks to suppress the vote through intimidation or by giving voters false information about election procedures.

Along with cyberattacks on election systems, influence operations that stoke distrust and divisiveness are a critical threat facing the 2024 election, national security officials have said.

State and local authorities have invested heavily in securing the vote that last week, Jen Easterly, director of the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, told The Associated Press there is no way a foreign adversary could alter the overall results.

Disinformation can be a harder threat to quantify. Foreign adversaries create networks of fake websites and social media accounts mimicking Americans, and then work to amplify divisive and incendiary claims about contentious debates like immigration, the economy or the federal government's response to disasters.

Officials in Russia, China, Iran and Cuba have all rejected accusations that their governments are trying to interfere with the U.S. election, despite indications that the use of disinformation designed to influence the outcome of this year's elections is increasing.

When foreign governments target a specific candidate, office or organization with election information they are often given what's called a defensive briefing by intelligence officials. While ODNI won't say how many defensive briefings they have delivered so far this election cycle, they say the number is three times higher than the previous cycle.

In the presidential race, intelligence officials have concluded that Russia supports Trump, who has criticized Ukraine and the NATO alliance while praising Russian President Vladimir Putin. They have assessed that China is taking a neutral stance in the race between the Republican former president and Vice President Kamala Harris, a Democrat.

Iran opposes Trump's reelection, intelligence officials have said, seeing him as more likely to increase tension between Washington and Tehran. Trump's administration ended a nuclear deal with Iran, reimposed sanctions and ordered the killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran's leaders to vow revenge.

Last month federal authorities charged three Iranian men for their alleged involvement in Iran's hacking of Trump's campaign. Iran later offered the material to Trump's Democratic opponent, but no one replied.

Officials said Monday they have seen no indications that Iranian disinformation is targeting down ballot races so far in 2024."

"Trump dice que inmigrantes que cometieron asesinatos han introducido ""muchos genes malos"" en EEUU",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/politics/elecciones-en-eeuu-donald-trump-ecf46ca25565a65003b0727687d89ace,2024-10-07T21:20:39Z,"NUEVA YORK (AP) -- El candidato republicano a la presidencia de Estados Unidos, Donald Trump, insinuó el lunes que los migrantes que están en Estados Unidos y han cometido asesinatos lo hicieron porque ""está en sus genes"". Añadió que hay ""muchos genes malos en nuestro país ahora mismo"".

Este es el caso más reciente en que Trump alega que los migrantes están cambiando la composición genética de Estados Unidos. El año pasado, evocó palabras utilizadas en su día por Adolf Hitler para argumentar que los migrantes que entran ilegalmente en Estados Unidos están ""envenenando la sangre de nuestro país"".

Trump hizo sus comentarios el lunes en una entrevista radiofónica con el presentador conservador Hugh Hewitt. Estaba criticando a su oponente demócrata, la vicepresidenta Kamala Harris, cuando abordó el tema de la inmigración, y citó estadísticas que el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional dice que incluyen casos del gobierno de Trump.

""¿Qué hay sobre permitir que entren personas a través de una frontera abierta, 13.000 de las cuales eran asesinos? Muchos de ellos asesinaron a mucho más de una persona"", afirmó Trump. ""Y ahora viven felices en Estados Unidos. Ya saben, ahora un asesino... creo esto: está en sus genes. Y tenemos muchos genes malos en nuestro país ahora mismo. Entonces tuvieron 425.000 personas que entraron a nuestro país que no deberían estar aquí y que son criminales"".

El equipo de campaña de Trump dijo que sus comentarios con respecto a los genes se referían a los asesinos.

""Se refería claramente a asesinos, no a migrantes. Es bastante repugnante que los medios de comunicación sean siempre tan rápidos para defender a asesinos, violadores y criminales ilegales si eso significa escribir un titular malo sobre el presidente Trump"", dijo en un comunicado Karoline Leavitt, secretaria nacional de prensa de la campaña de Trump.

El Servicio de Control de Inmigración y Aduanas de Estados Unidos (ICE, por sus siglas en inglés) dio a conocer el mes pasado al representante republicano Tony Gonzales datos sobre las personas bajo su supervisión, incluidas las que no están bajo custodia del ICE. Eso incluyó a 13.099 personas que fueron declaradas culpables de homicidio y 425.431 personas que son criminales convictos.

Pero esas cifras abarcan décadas, incluso el gobierno de Trump. Y aquellos que no están bajo custodia del ICE podrían estar detenidas por agencias policiales estatales o locales, según el Departamento de Seguridad Nacional, que supervisa al ICE.

El equipo de campaña de Harris declinó hacer comentarios.

Cuando se le preguntó el lunes durante su rueda de prensa por el comentario de Trump sobre los ""genes malos"", la secretaria de prensa de la Casa Blanca, Karine Jean-Pierre, dijo que ""ese tipo de lenguaje es odioso, repugnante, inapropiado y no tiene cabida en nuestro país"".

El gobierno de Biden ha endurecido las restricciones de asilo para los migrantes, y Harris, tratando de hacer frente a una vulnerabilidad mientras hace campaña, se ha esforzado por proyectar una postura más dura en materia de inmigración.

El expresidente y candidato republicano ha hecho de la inmigración ilegal una parte central de su campaña para 2024, y ha prometido llevar a cabo la mayor operación de deportación de la historia de Estados Unidos si resulta elegido. Cuenta con un largo historial de comentarios que difaman a los migrantes, como referirse a ellos como ""animales"" y ""asesinos"", y decir que propagan enfermedades.

El mes pasado, durante su debate con Harris, Trump afirmó falsamente que los migrantes haitianos de Ohio raptaban y se comían a las mascotas.

Como presidente, cuestionó por qué Estados Unidos aceptaba migrantes de Haití y África en lugar de Noruega, y dijo a cuatro mujeres congresistas, todas ellas personas de color y tres de las cuales habían nacido en Estados Unidos, que ""se devolvieran y ayudaran a arreglar los lugares totalmente destrozados e infestados de delincuencia de los que procedían"".

Trump says migrants who have committed murder have introduced 'a lot of bad genes in our country',AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/donald-trump-immigration-2024-election-2157777f240142e5aed38be192a52b25,2024-10-07T19:27:27Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump on Monday suggested that migrants who are in the U.S. and have committed murder did so because ""it's in their genes."" There are, he added, ""a lot of bad genes in our country right now.""

It's the latest example of Trump alleging that immigrants are changing the hereditary makeup of the U.S. Last year, he evoked language once used by Adolf Hitler to argue that immigrants entering the U.S. illegally are ""poisoning the blood of our country.""

Trump made the comments Monday in a radio interview with conservative host Hugh Hewitt. He was criticizing his Democratic opponent for the 2024 presidential race, Vice President Kamala Harris, when he pivoted to immigration, citing statistics that the Department of Homeland Security says include cases from his administration.

""How about allowing people to come through an open border, 13,000 of which were murderers? Many of them murdered far more than one person,"" Trump said. ""And they're now happily living in the United States. You know, now a murderer -- I believe this: it's in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now. Then you had 425,000 people come into our country that shouldn't be here that are criminals.""

Trump's campaign said his comments regarding genes were about murderers.

""He was clearly referring to murderers, not migrants. It's pretty disgusting the media is always so quick to defend murderers, rapists, and illegal criminals if it means writing a bad headline about President Trump,"" Karoline Leavitt, the Trump campaign's national press secretary, said in a statement.

U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement released immigration enforcement data to Republican Rep. Tony Gonzales last month about the people under its supervision, including those not in ICE custody. That included 13,099 people who were found guilty of homicide and 425,431 people who are convicted criminals.

But those numbers span decades, including during Trump's administration. And those who are not in ICE custody may be detained by state or local law enforcement agencies, according to the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.

The Harris campaign declined to comment.

Asked during her briefing with reporters on Monday about Trump's ""bad genes"" comment, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, ""That type of language, it's hateful, it's disgusting, it's inappropriate, it has no place in our country.""

The Biden administration has stiffened asylum restrictions for migrants, and Harris, seeking to address a vulnerability as she campaigns, has worked to project a tougher stance on immigration.

The former president and Republican nominee has made illegal immigration a central part of his 2024 campaign, vowing to stage the largest deportation operation in U.S. history if elected. He has a long history of comments maligning immigrants, including referring to them as ""animals"" and ""killers,"" and saying that they spread diseases.

Last month, during his debate with Harris, Trump falsely claimed Haitian immigrants in Ohio were abducting and eating pets.

As president, he questioned why the U.S. was accepting immigrants from Haiti and Africa rather than Norway and told four congresswomen, all people of color and three of whom were born in the U.S., to ""go back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.""

A Michigan Senate candidate aims to achieve what no Republican has done in three decades,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/senate-michigan-rogers-slotkin-4d193fdb4043982c7d8b39354b07fb8f,2024-10-07T18:37:53Z,"ROCHESTER, Mich. (AP) -- As canvassers for U.S. Senate candidate Mike Rogers navigate the manicured lawns and gated communities of some of Detroit's wealthiest suburbs, they walk a fine line in their efforts to convince Republicans disillusioned with Donald Trump to back other GOP candidates next month.

Nowhere else in Michigan reflects the state's recent shift toward Democrats more than Oakland County just north of Detroit, home to the state's largest Republican base. Democrats have won decisively here in recent elections, and winning back voters in a county once dominated by traditional country club Republicans could be crucial to Rogers' chances to achieve what no Republican has done in more than three decades: win a U.S. Senate race in Michigan.

""We created a large, probably the best ground game, I would argue, in the country right now,"" Rogers said in a recent interview. ""And we are firing on all cylinders.""

With control of the Senate on the line, the race for Michigan's open seat could be pivotal. Democrats currently maintain a narrow margin in the Senate but are defending far more seats in this year's elections than Republicans.

Rogers and his Democratic opponent, Rep. Elissa Slotkin, are set to meet Tuesday for their first debate. Neither participated in debates during party primaries, making this event the first opportunity for voters to compare their dramatically different policy views.

Republicans have become increasingly confident that Rogers, who served in the U.S. House from 2001 to 2015, can flip a seat held for over two decades by Democratic Sen. Debbie Stabenow, who is retiring at the end of her fourth term. Standing in their way is Slotkin, long viewed as a rising star in the Democratic Party, with a fundraising advantage and an established track record in a competitive House district.

""Where I see Michigan as well as our races around the country is exactly as I would have predicted them last year,"" said Michigan Sen. Gary Peters, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee. ""These are going to come down to very close races.""

Slotkin entered the Senate race shortly after Stabenow's retirement announcement, effectively clearing the Democratic primary field and building a campaign war chest that dwarfed her potential Republican opponents. She had raised $42 million through the end of September, according to her campaign.

With a big boost from national GOP fundraising groups, Rogers and the Republicans have been hustling to catch up. He entered the race over six months later and faced the challenge of navigating a state GOP divided by internal strife between grassroots activists fired up by Trump's brand of conservative populism and the party's old guard.

Rogers also had to contend with a crowded Republican primary field that included two other former congressmen. Trump's endorsement in March had a coalescing effect and made Rogers the clear frontrunner, prompting many of his rivals to drop out and allowing him to coast to the GOP nomination in August.

Whether Rogers can hold the fractious GOP coalition together could go a long way toward deciding the race.

By mid-July, Rogers had raised just over $5 million, the most recent figure reported by his campaign. While he has seen a recent influx of outside funding, including $22.5 million from Sen. Mitch McConnell's Senate Leadership Fund announced last week, it hasn't given him the same opportunity to define his candidacy as Slotkin. She was already airing ads in May to highlight her background.

Ultimately, the outcome of the Senate race could turn on how the presidential candidates perform in Michigan. Some Democrats, including Slotkin, have expressed concerns about Vice President Kamala Harris' standing in Michigan with less than a month to go in a state considered crucial to the presidential race.

Republicans think they see an opening in both contests.

""Michigan will be a state where our outcome in the Michigan Senate race will be probably very closely tied to President Trump's outcome in Michigan,"" Montana Sen. Steve Daines, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said during a press roundtable in Las Vegas. ""Trump's number and Mike Rogers' number will be very close.""

Rogers' team is working hard to close the gap. His campaign has 36 paid staffers statewide, leading volunteer groups that Rogers' campaign says have knocked on 50,000 doors a week.

Slotkin's campaign says her field operation is integrated into One Campaign, a coordinated effort involving Democratic candidates at all levels. That initiative includes 52 field offices and nearly 400 staff members across Michigan.

Oakland, the state's second-largest county, was once a Republican stronghold, but President Joe Biden won it by over 14 percentage points, largely due to a shift among suburban women in a state where reproductive rights have been on voters' minds since the U.S. Supreme Court turned those matters back to the states in 2022. Rogers' team is now focused on winning those voters back.

On a crisp October morning, his canvassers knocked on doors in the Oakland County suburb of Rochester, where lawn signs and other indicators of the fierce political battle unfolding there were rare. Although Rogers' campaign materials highlight Trump's endorsement, canvassers in neighborhoods like this typically mention the former president's name only if voters bring it up first.

""Mike just seems like a genuinely good guy and someone I'd want to represent Oakland,"" said Donnell Green, a longtime Rochester resident. After speaking with canvassers on Oct. 4, she added, ""I like that he works across the aisle.""

Green declined to share her views on Trump. However, in a region where noted anti-Trump Republican Sen. Mitt Romney grew up, Trump remains a polarizing figure, and many Republicans in the county continue to be turned off by his combative brand of politics.

Slotkin believes reproductive rights are still on voters' minds in Oakland County, where in 2022, a ballot proposal enshrining abortion rights passed by a 28-point margin, helping secure its statewide approval. She continues to campaign on the issue, warning that Republicans could push for a nationwide ban.

Rogers, however, calls it a nonissue after the 2022 vote and has said that he would not support a federal ban.

Slotkin currently represents a mid-Michigan district that was expected to be one of the most competitive and expensive races of the 2022 cycle. She won reelection by over five percentage points, using a strategy she has replicated in her Senate campaign. This approach, she says, involves ""going to places where maybe Democrats haven't shown up in 40 years.""

""I'm a Democrat that represents a Republican-leaning district,"" Slotkin told reporters last month in Grand Rapids. ""I wouldn't have won if I hadn't engaged all kinds of different voters.""

Slotkin could be most vulnerable in metro Detroit, where divisions within the Democratic Party over the Biden administration's handling of the Israel-Hamas war are intensifying. The region has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the country, and frustration with Biden is spilling over to other Democratic candidates, including Slotkin, who is Jewish. She has remained a supporter of Israel, although she has been critical of the country's leader, Benjamin Netanyahu.

The growing discontent in metro Detroit could impact Slotkin's campaign.

""It is something that we have been spending a lot of time on and I think it's important for folks to know that our Democratic candidates, incumbents care deeply about listening to the Arab American community,"" said Peters.

Trump and Harris mark somber anniversary of Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-oct-7-hamas-israel-78ba85f87ea89fa93c6537f77ca81b25,2024-10-07T14:07:35Z,"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla. (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are marking the first anniversary of the deadliest attack on Jews since the Holocaust as the presidential candidates approach the final weeks of the campaign during a widening conflict in the Middle East.

Trump will speak before Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in the Miami suburb of Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and plant a pomegranate tree with her husband on the grounds of the Vice President's residence in honor of the 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, who were killed by Hamas-led militants in the Oct. 7 attack last year.

Harris' husband Doug Emhoff, who is Jewish, will recite a prayer at an event to commemorate the anniversary with the American Jewish Committee.

Trump has blamed both Harris and President Joe Biden for the war, arguing their administration empowered Iran, and tried to take advantage of some of the divisions within the Democratic Party with progressives protesting Israel's military campaign, which has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians.

Some of his statements on Israel overlook his association with people who spew antisemitic rhetoric such as far-right activist Nick Fuentes and rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West.

Trump has also repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats ""should have their head examined"" and recently said that if he loses the presidential election to Harris on Nov. 5 ""the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that.""

In an excerpt released from an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air Monday night, Harris appeared to avoid answering a question about whether Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is considered ""a real close ally,"" and said that ""The better question is: Do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people? And the answer to that question is yes.""

Trump's own relations with Netanyahu have been rocky. They soured after the Israeli prime minister became one of the first world leaders to congratulate President Joe Biden for his 2020 victory, which Trump continues to deny. A few days after the Oct. 7 attack last year, Trump publicly criticized Netanyahu and said he ""was not prepared"" for the deadly incursion from Gaza on Oct. 7. Trump said Netanyahu had let the U.S. down just before the U.S. killed top Iranian general Qassem Soleimani in 2020.

Since then, the two have met to talk about a cease-fire deal for Gaza.

Halie Soifer, head of the Jewish Democratic Council of America, said the conflict in the Middle East -- including fighting with Hezbollah and Iran -- has left Jewish voters ""with a sense of vulnerability and concern for Israel's future."" Soifer previously advised Harris on national security issues.

But she says Harris has been consistent with the message of commitment to Israel's defense for the last year, and said Harris and Biden have directed U.S. forces to shoot down Iranian missiles targeting Israel on multiple occasions."
The Latest: New analysis says both Trump and Harris' plans would increase the deficit,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-vance-walz-election-81a24ac1389f5d7a83d064f9e6d358d2,2024-10-07T13:06:56Z,"No one is likely to be happy with the projected higher deficits laid out in a new analysis of Kamala Harris' and Donald Trump's economic plans.

The analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests a Harris presidency could increase the national debt over 10 years by $3.5 trillion. The same analysis says former President Trump's ideas could heap another $7.5 trillion onto the debt and possibly as much as $15.2 trillion.

Soon, the ballots will be cast, the polls will close and a campaign marked by assassination attempts, animosity and anxiety will come to an end. But for U.S. adversaries, the work to meddle with American democracy may be entering its most critical phase.

Despite all the attention on efforts to spread disinformation in the months before the Nov. 5 election, the hours and days immediately after voting ends could offer foreign adversaries like Russia, Iran and China or domestic extremist groups the best chance to mess with America's decision.

That's when Americans will go online to see the latest results or share their opinions as the votes are tabulated. And that's when a fuzzy photo or AI-generated video of supposed vote tampering could do its most damage, potentially transforming online outrage into real-world action before authorities have time to investigate the facts.

It's a threat taken seriously by intelligence analysts, elected officials and tech executives, who say that while there's already been a steady buildup of disinformation and influence operations, the worst may be yet to come.

Turning Point's representatives have made two things clear in meetings with state and local Republican leaders -- Donald Trump has blessed their conservative organization to help lead his get-out-the-vote effort, and local party officials ought to use the group's new voter mobilization app.

Both prospects terrify fellow Republicans.

Soaring to prominence after Trump's unexpected 2016 win, Turning Point earned a reputation for hosting glitzy events, cultivating hard-right influencers and raising prodigious sums of money while enriching the group's leaders. They've had far less success helping Republicans win, especially in their adopted home state of Arizona.

Now the organization has leveraged its ties to Trump to expand its influence in a way that could be potentially lucrative. Turning Point has sought to lead an effort to remake the GOP's get-out-the-vote effort based on the theory that there are thousands of Trump supporters who rarely vote but could be persuaded to in this year's election. And they are pitching their new mobile app as vital to this effort's success."
Mideast violence is spiraling a year since the Gaza war began,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-war-hezbollah-lebanon-anniversary-73916b17394f093f01ca5554cf26b528,2024-10-07T05:00:00Z,"JERUSALEM (AP) -- A year after Hamas' fateful attack on southern Israel, the Middle East is embroiled in a war that shows no signs of ending and seems to be getting worse.

Israel's retaliatory offensive was initially centered on the Gaza Strip. But the focus has shifted in recent weeks to Lebanon, where airstrikes have given way to a fast-expanding ground incursion against Hezbollah militants who have fired rockets into Israel since the Gaza war began.

Next in Israel's crosshairs is archenemy Iran, which supports Hamas, Hezbollah and other anti-Israel militants in the region. After withstanding a massive barrage of missiles from Iran last week, Israel has promised to respond. The escalating conflict risks drawing deeper involvement by the U.S., as well as Iran-backed militants in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.

When Hamas launched its attack on Oct. 7, 2023, it called on the Arab world to join it in a concerted campaign against Israel. While the fighting has indeed spread, Hamas and its allies have paid a heavy price.

The group's army has been decimated, its Gaza stronghold has been reduced to a cauldron of death, destruction and misery and the top leaders of Hamas and Hezbollah have been killed in audacious attacks.

Although Israel appears to be gaining the edge militarily, the war has been problematic for Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, too.

Dozens of Israeli hostages are languishing in Hamas captivity, and a year after Netanyahu pledged to crush the group in ""total victory,"" remnants of the militant group are still battling in pockets of Gaza. The offensive in Lebanon, initially described as ""limited,"" grows by the day. A full-on collision with Iran is a possibility.

At home, Netanyahu faces mass protests over his inability to bring home the hostages, and to many, he will be remembered as the man who led Israel into its darkest moment. Relations with the U.S. and other allies are strained. The economy is deteriorating.

Here are five takeaways from a yearlong war that has upended longstanding assumptions and turned conventional wisdom on its head.

A long list of previously unthinkable events have occurred in mind-boggling fashion.

The Oct. 7 attack was the bloodiest in Israel's history. Young partygoers were gunned down. Cowering families were killed in their homes. In all, about 1,200 people died and 250 were taken hostage. Some Israelis were raped or sexually assaulted.

The ensuing war in Gaza has been the longest, deadliest and most destructive in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Gaza health authorities say nearly 42,000 people have been killed -- roughly 2% of the territory's entire population. Although they do not give a breakdown between civilians and combatants, more than half of the dead have been women and children. Numerous top Hamas officials have been killed.

The damage and displacement in Gaza have reached unseen levels. Hospitals, schools and mosques - once thought to be insulated from violence - have repeatedly been targeted by Israel or caught in the crossfire. Scores of journalists and health workers have been killed, many of them while working in the line of duty.

Months of simmering tensions along Israel's northern border recently boiled over into war.

A growing list of Hezbollah officials - including the group's longtime leader -- have been killed by Israel. Hundreds of Hezbollah members were killed or maimed in explosions of pagers and walkie-talkies. Israel's ground offensive is its first in Lebanon since a monthlong war in 2006.

Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah has displaced tens of thousands of Israelis and over 1 million Lebanese. Israel promises to keep pounding Hezbollah until its residents can return to homes near the Lebanese border; Hezbollah says it will keep firing rockets into Israel until there is a cease-fire in Gaza.

When the war erupted, the days appeared to be numbered for both Netanyahu and Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar.

Netanyahu's public standing plummeted as he faced calls to step aside. Sinwar fled into Gaza's labyrinth of tunnels as Israel declared him a ""dead man walking.""

Yet both men -- facing war crimes charges in international courts -- remain firmly in charge, and neither appears to be in a rush for a cease-fire.

The end of the war could mean the end of Netanyahu's government, which is dominated by hard-line partners opposed to a cease-fire. That would mean early elections, potentially pushing him into the opposition while he stands trial on corruption charges. Also looming is the prospect of an unflattering official inquiry into his government's failures before and during the Oct. 7 attack.

Fearing that, his coalition has hung together even through mass protests and repeated disagreements with top security officials pushing for a deal to bring home the hostages. After a brief period of post-Oct. 7 national unity, Israel has returned to its divided self -- torn between Netanyahu's religious, conservative, nationalist right-wing base and his more secular, middle-class opposition.

Sinwar, believed to be hiding in Gaza's tunnels, continues to drive a hard bargain in hopes of declaring some sort of victory. His demands for a full Israeli withdrawal, a lasting cease-fire and the release of a large number of Palestinian prisoners in exchange for scores of hostages have been rejected by Israel -- even as much of the international community has embraced them.

With cease-fire efforts deadlocked and Netanyahu's far-right coalition firmly intact, the war could go on for some time. An estimated 1.9 million Palestinians remain displaced in Gaza while an estimated 68 hostages remain captive in Gaza, in addition to the bodies of 33 others held by Hamas.

Early in the war, Netanyahu promised to destroy Hamas' military and governing abilities.

Those goals have been achieved in many ways. Israel says it has dismantled Hamas' military structure, and its rocket barrages have been diminished to a trickle. With Israeli troops stationed indefinitely in Gaza, it is difficult to see how the group could return to governing the territory or pose a serious threat.

But in other ways, total victory is impossible. Despite Israel's overwhelming force, Hamas units have repeatedly regrouped to stage guerrilla-style ambushes from areas where Israel has withdrawn.

Across the Middle East, bitter enemies are witnessing the limits of force and deterrence.

Israel's deepening invasion of Lebanon and repeated strikes on Hezbollah have failed to halt the rockets and missiles. Missile and drone attacks by Iran and its allies have only deepened Israel's resolve. Israel is vowing to strike Iran hard after its latest missile barrage, raising the likelihood of a broader, regionwide war.

Without diplomatic solutions, the fighting is likely to persist.

Israel is still deeply traumatized as people try to come to terms with the worst day in its history.

The Oct. 7 killings and kidnappings had an outsized impact on a tiny country founded in the aftermath of the Holocaust. Israelis' sense of security was shattered, and their faith in the military was tested like never before.

Photos of Israeli hostages are everywhere, and mass demonstrations are held each week calling on the government to reach a deal to bring them home. The prospect of ongoing war looms over families and workplaces as reserve soldiers brace for repeated tours of duty.

The trauma is far more acute in Gaza - where an estimated 90% of the population remains displaced, many of them living in squalid tent camps.

The scenes have drawn comparisons to what the Palestinian call the Nakba, or catastrophe - the mass displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians during the war surrounding Israel's creation in 1948. The Palestinians now find themselves looking at a tragedy of even greater scale.

It remains unclear when displaced Palestinians in Gaza will be able to return home and whether there will be anything to return to. The territory has suffered immense destruction and is littered with unexploded bombs. Children are missing a second consecutive school year, virtually every family has lost a relative in the fighting and basic needs like food and health care are lacking.

After a hellish year, the Palestinians of Gaza have no clear path forward, and it could take generations to recover.

The international community's response to this bloodiest of wars has been tepid and ineffective.

Repeated cease-fire calls have been ignored, and a U.S.-led plan to reinstate the Palestinian Authority in postwar Gaza has been rejected by Israel. It remains unclear who will run the territory in the future or who will pay for a cleanup and reconstruction effort that could take decades.

One thing that seems clear is that old formulas will no longer work. The international community's preferred peace formula - the establishment of a Palestinian state alongside Israel - seems hopelessly unrealistic.

Israel's hard-line government opposes Palestinian statehood, says its troops will remain in Gaza for years to come and has further cemented its undeclared annexation of the West Bank. The internationally recognized Palestinian Authority has been pushed to the brink of irrelevance.

For decades, the United States has acted as the key mediator and power broker in the region - calling for a two-state solution but showing little political will to promote that vision. Instead, it has often turned to conflict management, preventing any side from doing anything too extreme to destabilize the region.

This approach went up in smoke on Oct. 7. Since then, the U.S. has responded with a muddled message of criticizing Israel's wartime tactics as too harsh while arming the Israeli military and protecting Israel against diplomatic criticism. The result: The Biden administration has managed to antagonize both Israel and the Arab world while cease-fire efforts repeatedly sputter.

This approach has also alienated the progressive wing of the Democratic Party, complicating Kamala Harris' presidential aspirations. The warring sides appear to have given up on the Biden administration and are waiting for the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election before deciding their next moves.

Whoever wins the race will almost certainly have to find a new formula and recalibrate decades of American policy if they want to end the war."
"Tips, overtime, Social Security: A look at Donald Trump's no-tax pledges and what they might cost",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-taxes-social-security-overtime-tariffs-989016ef41dc1533b05d1871d69c03ff,2024-10-07T04:21:13Z,"Donald Trump has pledged to end taxes on everything from tips to Social Security and overtime pay if he's elected to the White House again. But he hasn't detailed how he would fund those ideas and avoid creating a huge budget shortfall, beyond arguing he will usher in an economic boom.

He argues his ideas would improve Americans' personal financial standing and the overall U.S. economy. A debate about the tax code will be a dominant legislative issue next year given that tax cuts Trump signed in 2017 will be set to expire. If he's elected again, Trump could push Congress to enact some or all of his proposals, though that might be difficult if Democrats end up in control of either the House or the Senate.

Estimates from outside economic analyses of the costs of the various tax cuts ranged between nearly $6 trillion and $10 trillion over 10 years, depending on which ideas become policy and how they're implemented.

A look at Trump's various tax-related ideas:

In June, Trump announced his plan to exclude workers' tips from federal taxes, saying he got the idea from a waitress at his Las Vegas hotel.

""To those hotel workers and people who get tips, you are going to be very happy, because when I get to office we are going to not charge taxes on tips, people making tips,"" Trump said, adding: ""We're going to do that right away, first thing in office.""

Trump made the announcement in Nevada, a key battleground state with six electoral votes and home to the highest concentration of tipped workers in the country. Nevada has an average of 25.8 waiters and waitresses per 1,000 jobs. President Joe Biden won the state in 2020, but the Trump campaign hopes to put it in play this fall.

Trump has not specified whether he wants to exempt tips from just income taxes or from the payroll tax -- which funds Medicare and Social Security -- as well.

Vice President Kamala Harris has echoed Trump's call for no taxes on tips, making a pledge that would apply to hospitality and service industry workers at a Nevada rally of her own two months after her GOP opponent's announcement.

Trump has also pledged tax cuts for older Americans, posting on Truth Social in July that ""SENIORS SHOULD NOT PAY TAX ON SOCIAL SECURITY!""

The challenge is that taxes on Social Security benefits help to pay for the program. The loss of revenue could mean that Social Security would be unable to pay out its full benefits in 2033, two years ahead of the current estimate, according to Brendan Duke of the liberal Center for American Progress.

According to the Social Security Administration, recipients must currently pay federal income taxes if combined income -- 50% of the benefit amount plus any other earned income -- is higher than $25,000 annually if filing individually, or $32,000 if filing jointly.

While in the Senate, Harris co-sponsored a bill that would have required the wealthy to pay higher Social Security taxes and made benefits more generous for some. The White House has said her views on the program are similar to Biden's, but Harris hasn't talked in detail about Social Security during her campaign.

Trump has also said he would support legislation to eliminate taxes on overtime pay.

""That gives people more of an incentive to work,"" Trump said in September at a campaign rally in Tucson, Arizona. ""It gives the companies a lot, it's a lot easier to get the people.""

Harris has not said if she would also call for cuts to taxes of overtime pay.

Trump's plans include proposed breaks for businesses, too. He's called for lowering the U.S. corporate tax rate from 21% to 15%, but only for companies that produce in the U.S.

""We're putting America first,"" Trump said. ""This new American industrialism will create millions and millions of jobs.""

As president, Trump signed legislation in 2017 that cut the corporate tax rate to 21% from 35%.

Harris has said she believes that big corporations and the ultra-wealthy should pay more in taxes -- including a 28% rate for corporations -- and wants to use those revenues to help spur the construction of 3 million homes and offer tax breaks for parents.

Ahead of a September rally on Long Island, Trump pledged that he would ""get SALT back,"" suggesting he would eliminate a cap on state and local tax deductions that were part of tax cut legislation he signed into law in 2017.

The so-called SALT cap has led to bigger tax bills for many residents of New York, New Jersey, California and other high-cost, high-tax states, and is an important campaign issue in those states, particularly among those New York Republicans serving in districts Biden won.

Some Democrats have pushed to lift the $10,000 cap, a move many Republicans have said they oppose. Some, including Trump's former GOP primary foe Nikki Haley, have called for making the 2017 tax cuts permanent. Some of that notion is enshrined in Republicans' 2024 platform, although the permanence provision specifically calls out portions ""that doubled the standard deduction, expanded the Child Tax Credit, and spurred Economic Growth for all Americans.""

Harris has not said that she would try to preserve Trump-era tax cuts, which are set to run out at the end of next year. But, like Biden, she has vowed not to raise taxes for Americans who earn less than $400,000 annually.

Angling to bring back more overseas jobs and manufacturing to the U.S., Trump has said repeatedly that he wants higher tariffs on imported goods, and has said the idea wouldn't increase inflation. He has floated the idea of a universal tariff as high as 20% on all imports and even higher tariffs on Chinese products and on U.S. companies that move factory jobs overseas.

In a recent speech at the Economic Club of New York, Trump suggested that tariffs could be used to solve seemingly unrelated challenges such as the rising cost of child care in the U.S., as part of a broader promise that tariffs can raise trillions of dollars to fund his agenda without those costs being passed along to consumers in the form of higher prices. That's a view with which many economists disagree since tariffs directly raise the prices of purchasing goods.

Particularly as it relates to the U.S. auto industry, it's a notion he called for again recently in Savannah, Georgia, where Trump said he'd put a 100% tariff on every car imported from Mexico. Calling for a ""new American industrialism,"" Trump suggested that the only way to avoid those charges would be for an automaker to build the cars in the U.S.

Harris has described Trump's ideas for tariffs as a ""sales tax"" on American households that could cost a typical family roughly $4,000 annually.

"New analysis suggests national debt could increase under Harris, but it would surge under Trump",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/budget-deficit-trump-harris-kamala-debt-1ee3ff65e22ccf19d19b792ee22c46da,2024-10-07T04:13:41Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- No one is likely to be happy with the projected higher deficits laid out in a new analysis of Kamala Harris' and Donald Trump's economic plans.

The analysis released Monday by the nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget suggests a Harris presidency could increase the national debt over 10 years by $3.5 trillion. That's even though the vice president's campaign insists her proposed investments in the middle class and housing would be fully offset by higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy. Her campaign policy guide states that Harris is ""committed to fiscal responsibility -- making investments that will support our economy, while paying for them and reducing the deficit at the same time.""

The same analysis says former President Trump's ideas could heap another $7.5 trillion onto the debt and possibly as much as $15.2 trillion. That's even though he suggests growth would be so strong under his watch that no one would need to worry about deficits.

The 34-page report released by the fiscal watchdog group puts a spotlight on the issue of government borrowing that will confront the winner of November's election. Total federal debt held by the public now tops $28 billion and is expected to keep climbing as revenues can't keep up with the growing costs of Social Security, Medicare and other programs. The analysis noted that the expense of servicing that debt in dollar terms has ""eclipsed the cost of defending our nation or providing health care to elderly Americans.""

Drawing on the candidates' speeches, campaign documents and social media posts, the analysis warns bluntly: ""Debt would continue to grow faster than the economy under either candidates' plans and in most scenarios would grow faster and higher than under current law.""

Neither candidate has meaningfully stressed budget deficit reduction in their pitch to voters. But multiple analyses show a clear difference of Harris being much more fiscally responsible than Trump.

Harvard University professor Jason Furman, who was the top economist in the Obama White House, estimated in an opinion article for The Wall Street Journal that Harris' plans could cut deficits by $1.5 trillion or raise them by $1.5 trillion. Meanwhile, his estimates show that Trump's plans would increase deficits by $5 trillion, though that figure does not include his plans to charge no taxes on overtime pay and scrap the limit on deductions of state and local taxes.

There are other estimates by The Budget Lab at Yale and the Penn Wharton Budget Model that also show Harris would be better at keeping the deficit in check.

The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget analysis estimates that Harris' policy ideas could add $3.5 trillion to the national debt through 2035. That conclusion depends on its treatment of how much various programs could cost.

It forecasts that Harris would implement $4.6 trillion in tax reductions, including extensions of some of the expiring 2017 tax cuts that Trump signed into law and tax breaks for parents and no taxes on tipped income for hospitality workers. Roughly $4 trillion in higher taxes on corporations and the wealthy would be insufficient to cover the total cost of her agenda and the additional interest on the debt that it could generate.

Still, the analysis notes that its numbers depend on various interpretations of what Harris has said. It's possible that Harris' agenda would add nothing to baseline deficits, but the report also said it might plausibly add as much as $8.1 trillion in debt in what appears to be a worse-case scenario.

By contrast, Trump's ideas would likely add another $7.5 trillion to the debt. His $2.7 trillion in tariff revenues would be unable to cover $9.2 trillion in tax cuts and additional expenditures such as $350 billion to secure the border and deport unauthorized immigrants.

But the analysis includes other possibilities that show far higher deficits under Trump. If his tariffs raised less money and there were higher costs for his mass deportations and tax breaks, the national debt could jump by $15.2 trillion.

On the other hand, if the tariffs raised $4.3 trillion and there were no costs tied to deportations, Trump's plans could only increase the debt by $1.5 trillion over 10 years."
US disaster relief chief blasts false claims about Helene response as a 'truly dangerous narrative',AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-fema-hurricane-helene-conspiracy-theories-criswell-07d5b1f6968cb2af11b63357186a1a15,2024-10-06T19:37:09Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. government's top disaster relief official said Sunday that false claims and conspiracy theories about the federal response to Hurricane Helene -- spread most prominently by Donald Trump -- are ""demoralizing"" aid workers and creating fear in people who need recovery assistance.

""It's frankly ridiculous, and just plain false. This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people,"" said Deanne Criswell, who leads the Federal Emergency Management Agency. ""It's really a shame that we're putting politics ahead of helping people, and that's what we're here to do. We have had the complete support of the state,"" she said, referring to North Carolina.

Republicans, led by the former president, have helped foster a frenzy of misinformation over the past week among the communities most devastated by Helene, promoting a number of false claims, including that Washington is intentionally withholding aid to people in Republican areas.

Trump accused FEMA of spending all its money to help immigrants who are in the United States illegally, while other critics assert that the government spends too much on Israel, Ukraine and other foreign countries.

""FEMA absolutely has enough money for Helene response right now,"" Keith Turi, acting director of FEMA's Office of Response and Recovery said. He noted that Congress recently replenished the agency with $20 billion, and about $8 billion of that is set aside for recovery from previous storms and mitigation projects.

There also are outlandish theories that include warnings from far-right extremist groups that officials plan to bulldoze storm-damaged communities and seize the land from residents. A falsehood pushed by Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., asserts that Washington used weather control technology to steer Helene toward Republican voters in order to tilt the presidential election toward Democrat Kamala Harris.

Criswell said on ABC's ""This Week"" that such baseless claims around the response to Helene, which caused catastrophic damage from Florida into the Appalachian mountains and a death toll that rose Sunday to at least 230, have created a sense of fear and mistrust from residents against the thousands of FEMA employees and volunteers on the ground.

""We've had the local officials helping to push back on this dangerous -- truly dangerous narrative that is creating this fear of trying to reach out and help us or to register for help,"" she said.

President Joe Biden said in a statement Sunday that his administration ""will continue working hand-in-hand with local and state leaders -- regardless of political party and no matter how long it takes.""

Meantime, FEMA is preparing for Hurricane Milton, which rapidly intensified into a Category 1 storm on Sunday as it heads toward Florida.

""We're working with the state there to understand what their requirements are going to be, so we can have those in place before it makes landfall,"" she said."
Walz says he'll 'own up' when he misspeaks as the Democratic ticket steps up media interviews,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/walz-harris-media-interview-presidential-campaign-83325184cd7f93ca505df590f7a27ede,2024-10-06T16:08:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a week after verbal stumbles in the only vice presidential debate, Democrat Tim Walz used his debut campaign appearance on a Sunday news show to try to fend off criticism of his stand on abortion rights and ""own up"" to past misstatements.

The interview on ""Fox News Sunday"" reflected a broader media blitz by presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate as the Democrats seek to garner public attention in the final 30 days of the campaign against Republicans Donald Trump and JD Vance.

Harris has taped an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air Monday night. She is booked Tuesday on Howard Stern's satellite radio show, ABC's ""The View"" and ""The Late Show"" with Stephen Colbert on CBS. Her interview on the podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" is scheduled to be released later Sunday. Walz will be on Jimmy Kimmel's ABC show on Monday.

Walz's Fox appearance also touched on the turmoil in the Middle East, with anchor Shannon Bream pressing the Minnesota governor on whether Israel has a right to preemptively attack Iran's nuclear and oil facilities in response to Tehran's firing of missiles against Israel. It was a question that Walz did not fully answer during his debate this past week with Vance, an Ohio senator.

Walz said Sunday that ""specific operations will be dealt with at the time."" He said Israel has a right to defend itself and that Harris worked with Israel this past week to repel the Iranian attack. President Joe Biden said last week he would not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran's nuclear program.

Walz defended a law that he signed as governor to ensure abortion protections, saying it ""puts this puts the decision with the woman and her health care providers."" He questioned the statement by Trump that he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

On the economy, Walz said Harris' proposals would make life more affordable for the middle class by helping with the construction of 3 million new homes and expanding tax credits for parents. He said tariffs floated by Trump could increase costs by an estimated $4,000 a year on a typical family.

Walz also faced questions in the interview about misstatements pertaining to his military service, drunken driving arrest, infertility treatment for his family and claims to have been in Hong Kong before the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China.

""I will own up when I misspeak,"" Walz said.

He said he believes voters are more concerned by the fact that Vance could not acknowledge during their debate that Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden and that there could restrictions on the infertility treatment of intrauterine insemination that his wife, Gwen, received.

""I think they're probably far more concerned with that than my wife and I used IUI to have our child and that Donald Trump would restrict that,"" Walz said. ""So I think folks know who I am.""

Bream noted that Trump has come out in support of fertility treatments, even as he has said that abortion questions should be decided by states."
Voters in North Carolina and Georgia have bigger problems than politics. Helene changed everything,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-georgia-trump-harris-8d583852967e3f56d062397965b7853f,2024-10-06T12:57:33Z,"VILAS, N.C. (AP) -- Brad Farrington pulls over to grab a case of water bottles being passed out in Vilas, a small rural community tucked away in the Blue Ridge Mountains. He's on his way to help a friend who lost much of what he owned when Hurricane Helene blew through last weekend.

His friend, like countless others across western North Carolina, is starting over, which explains why Farrington isn't thinking too much about politics or the White House race between Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris right now.

""I don't believe people's hope is in either people that are being elected,"" he said.

Farrington pauses, then gestures toward a dozen volunteers loading water and other necessities into cars and trucks.

""I believe we're finding a lot more hope within folks like this,"" he said.

In the election's final weeks, people in North Carolina and Georgia, influential swing states, are dealing with more immediate concerns: widespread storm damage. If that weren't enough, voters in Watauga County, a ticket-splitting Appalachian county that has become more Democratic in recent years, must contend with politicians laying blame while offering support as they campaign in a race that could be decided by any small shift.

Large uprooted trees litter the sides of roads, sometimes blocking driveways. Some homes in Vilas are inaccessible after bridges collapsed and roads crumbled. More populous areas like Boone, home of Appalachian State University, saw major flooding.

Residents wonder where are missing friends and relatives, is there enough food and water to last until new supplies arrive and how will they rebuild.

The focus is on survival, not politics -- and may remain that way for weeks.

Trump and Harris have visited North Carolina and Georgia five times since the storm hit. Trump was in North Carolina on Friday, and Harris was there the next day.

After Trump went to Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday, 20-year-old Fermin Herrera said the former president clinched his vote with his display of caring, not out of any frustration with how President Joe Biden and Harris, the vice president, are handling the federal disaster response. Herrera already leaned toward voting for Trump.

""I feel like everybody's kind doing what they can,"" he said. ""All the locals are appreciating the help that's coming.""

Trump, who has his own mixed record on natural disaster response, attacked Biden and Harris for what he said was a slow response to Helene's destruction. Trump accused the Democrats of ""going out of their way to not help people in Republican areas"" and said there wasn't enough Federal Emergency Management Agency money because it was spent on illegal immigrants. There is no evidence to support either claim.

""I'm not thinking about voters right now,"" Trump insisted after a meeting with Gov. Brian Kemp, R-Ga., on Friday. ""I'm thinking about lives.""

Biden pushed back hard, saying he is ""committed to being president for all of America"" and has not ordered aid to be distributed based on party lines. The White House cited statements from the Republican governors of Georgia, South Carolina and Tennessee expressing satisfaction with the federal government's response.

Criticism so soon after a natural disaster is ""inappropriate,"" especially when factoring in the daunting logistical problems in western North Carolina, said Gavin Smith, a North Carolina State University professor who specializes in disaster recovery. He said the perilous terrain from compromised roads and bridges and the widespread lack of power and cellphone service make disaster response in the region particularly challenging.

Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper has made several stops in western North Carolina, including Watauga County and surrounding areas, and Biden viewed the extensive damage via an aerial tour.

In Watauga County, Jessica Dixon was scraping muck and broken furniture off the ground with a shovel, then dumping it in the bucket of a humming excavator. The 29-year-old stood in a home she bought two years ago. It's now gutted after a rush of water forced Dixon, her boyfriend and their two dogs to flee to safety.

Without flood insurance, Dixon is not sure what will happen over the next month. She said she filled out a FEMA application but hasn't checked her email since. She had given the presidential election some thought before Helene, but now she's preoccupied with cleaning her home.

""It wouldn't change my views on anything,"" said Dixon, who was planning to vote for Harris.

The presidential election isn't top of mind for 47-year-old Bobby Cordell, either. He's trying to get help to neighbors in western Watauga County, which has become inaccessible in some parts.

His home near Beech Mountain is one of those places, he said, after a bridge washed away. Cordell rescued his aunt from a mudslide, then traveled to Boone and has been staying in Appalachian State's Holmes Convocation Center, which now serves as a Red Cross emergency shelter.

He's trying to send disaster relief back where he lives by contacting officials, including from FEMA. That conversation, he said, ""went very well.""

Accepting help isn't easy for people in the mountains, he said, because they're used to taking care of themselves.

Now, though, the people who are trapped ""need everything they can get.""

Over the past week of volunteering at Skateworld, where Farrington stopped for water, it's become harder for Nancy Crawford to smile. She's helped serve more than 1,000 people, she said, but the emotional toll has started to settle in for ""a lot of us that normally are tough.""

That burden added to the weight she was already feeling about the election, which she said was ""scary to begin with."" Crawford, a registered Republican, said she plans to vote for Harris. As a Latina of Mexican descent, she thinks Trump's immigration policies would have harmful effects on her community.

The storm, she said, likely won't change her vote but has made one thing evident.

""It doesn't matter what party you are, we all need help,"" she said.

Jan Wellborn had a similar thought as she made her way around the Watauga High School gym collecting supplies to bring to coworkers in need. A 69-year-old bus driver for the school district, she said the outpouring of support she's seen from the community has been a ""godsend.""

She takes solace from the county's ability to pull together. The election matters, she said, but helping people make their way through a harrowing time matters more.

""The election, it should be important,"" Wellborn said. ""But right now we need to focus on getting everybody in the county taken care of.""

"Trump ramps up his campaign in Wisconsin, where a Republican win could knock out Democrats",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-wisconsin-election-2024-harris-blue-wall-b22c2042c9e68115c3de71794dc9c985,2024-10-06T12:57:14Z,"MADISON, Wis. (AP) -- Donald Trump's fourth scheduled stop in eight days in Wisconsin is a sign of his increased attention as Republicans fret about the former president's ability to match the Democrats' enthusiasm and turnout machine.

""In the political chatter class, they're worried,"" said Brandon Scholz, a retired Republican strategist and longtime political observer in Wisconsin who voted for Trump in 2020 but said he is not voting for Trump or Democratic nominee Kamala Harris this year. ""I think Republicans are right to be concerned.""

Trump's latest rally was planned for 2 p.m. Central time Sunday in Juneau in Dodge County, which he won in 2020 with 65% of the vote. Jack Yuds, chairman of the county Republican Party, said support for Trump is stronger in his part of the state than it was in 2016 or 2020. ""I can't keep signs in,"" Yuds said. ""They want everything he's got. If it says Trump on it, you can sell it.""

Wisconsin is perennially tight in presidential elections but has gone for the Republicans just once in the past 40 years, when Trump won the state in 2016. A win in November could make it impossible for Harris to take the White House.

Trump won in 2016 over Democrat Hillary Clinton by fewer than 23,000 votes and lost to Democrat Joe Biden in 2020 by just under 21,000 votes.

On Tuesday, Trump made his first-ever visit to Dane County, home to the liberal capital city of Madison, in an effort to turn out the Republican vote even in the state's Democratic strongholds. Dane is Wisconsin's second most-populous and fastest-growing county; Biden received more than 75% of the vote four years ago.

""To win statewide you've got to have a 72-county strategy,"" former Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, said at that event.

Trump's campaign and outside groups supporting his candidacy have outspent Harris and her allies on advertising in Wisconsin, $35 million to $31 million, since she became a candidate on July 23, according to the media-tracking firm AdImpact.

Harris and outside groups supporting her candidacy had more advertising time reserved in Wisconsin from Oct. 1 through Nov. 5, more than $25 million compared with $20 million for Trump and his allies.

The Harris campaign has 50 offices across 43 counties with more than 250 staff in Wisconsin, said her spokesperson Timothy White. The Trump campaign said it has 40 offices in the state and dozens of staff.

Harris rallied supporters in Madison in September at an even that drew more than 10,000 people. On Thursday, she made an appeal to moderate and disgruntled conservatives by holding an event in Ripon, the birthplace of the Republican Party, along with former U.S. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of Trump's most prominent Republican antagonists.

Harris and Trump are focusing on Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the ""blue wall"" states that went for Trump in 2016 and flipped to Biden in the next election.

While Trump's campaign is bullish on its chances in Pennsylvania as well as Sunbelt states, Wisconsin is seen as more of a challenge.

""Wisconsin, tough state,"" said Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita, who worked on Republican Sen. Ron Johnson's winning reelection campaign in 2022.

""I mean, look, that's going to be a very tight -- very, very tight, all the way to the end. But where we are organizationally now, comparative to where we were organizationally four years ago, I mean, it's completely different,"" LaCivita said.

He also cited Michigan as more of a challenge. ""But again, these are states that Biden won and carried and so they're going to be brawls all the way until the end and we're not ceding any of that ground.""

The candidates are about even in Wisconsin, based on a series of polls that have shown little movement since Biden dropped out in late July. Those same polls also show high enthusiasm among both parties.

Mark Graul, who ran then-President George W. Bush's 2004 campaign in Wisconsin, said the number of campaign visits speaks to Wisconsin's decisive election role.

The key for both sides, he said, is persuading infrequent voters to turn out.

""Much more important, in my opinion, than rallies,"" Graul said.

Takeaways from AP's report on affordable housing disappearing across the U.S.,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/low-income-housing-tax-credit-affordable-harris-adf839e5ad5dcd18c02189f267f431bc,2024-10-06T05:44:42Z,"LOS ANGELES (AP) -- While Americans continue to struggle under unrelentingly high rents, as many as 223,0000 affordable housing units across the U.S. could disappear in the next five years alone.

It leaves low-income tenants facing protracted eviction battles, scrambling to pay a two-fold rent increase or more, or shunted back into a housing market where costs can easily eat half a paycheck.

Those affordable housing units were built with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, a federal program launched in 1987 that provides tax credits to developers in exchange for keeping rents low.

It has pumped out 3.6 million units nationwide, and its expansion is now central to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris' housing plan to build 3 million new homes.

The catch? The buildings typically only need to be kept affordable for a minimum of 30 years. For the wave of LIHTC construction in the 1990s, those deadlines are arriving now, threatening to hemorrhage affordable housing supply when Americans need it most.

Data on LIHTC units that will lose their affordability nationally remains a rough estimate.

The best nationwide analysis estimated that by 2030 roughly 350,000 LIHTC units are at risk of losing affordability. That's 1 million units by 2040, according to the National Housing Preservation Database.

Not all units that lose LIHTC's affordability protections become market rate. Some are kept affordable by other government subsidies, by merciful landlords or by states, including California, Colorado and New York, that have worked to keep costs low.

Still, it's a sizeable loss to a housing market already in dire need of new units.

""If we are losing the homes that are currently affordable and available to households, then we're losing ground on the crisis,"" said Sarah Saadian, vice president of public policy at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

""It's sort of like having a boat with a hole at the bottom,"" she said.

Local governments and nonprofits can purchase expiring apartments, new tax credits or other subsidies can be applied that extend the affordability, or tenants can organize to try to force action from landlords and city officials.

California now requires all new LIHTC properties to be affordable for 55 years. Expiring developments built before that rule are also prioritized for new tax credits, and the state essentially requires that all LIHTC applicants have experience owning and managing affordable housing.

California and Colorado require landlords to notify local governments and tenants before their building expires. Cities and nonprofits then have first shot at buying the property to keep it affordable.

However, unlike California many states haven't extended LIHTC agreements beyond 30 years, let alone taken other measures to keep expiring housing affordable.

Still, local governments or nonprofits scraping together the funds to buy apartment buildings is far from a guarantee. And while new tax credits can reup a lapsing LIHTC affordability, they are limited, doled out to states by the Internal Revenue Service based on population.

For more than two decades, the low rent on Marina Maalouf's LIHTC apartment in Los Angeles' Chinatown was a saving grace for her family, including a granddaughter who has autism.

When that grace expired, the landlord, no longer legally obligated to keep the building affordable, hiked rent from $1,100 to $2,660 in 2021 -- out of reach for Maalouf and her family. Tenant protests, a rent strike and eviction filings followed.

The eviction case is ongoing, haunting Maalouf's nights with fears of her family ending up in sleeping bags on a friend's floor or worse. Mornings she repeats a mantra: ""We still here. We still here."" But fighting day after day to make it true is exhausting.

Still, Maalouf's tenant activism has helped move the needle. The City of Los Angeles has offered the landlord $15 million to keep her building affordable through 2034, but that deal wouldn't get rid of over 30 eviction cases still proceeding, including Maalouf's, or the $25,000 in back rent she owes.

On a recent day in the courtyard of Maalouf's apartment, her granddaughter shuffled up with a glass of water. She is 5 years old, but with special needs, her speech is more disconnected words than sentences.

""That's why I've been hoping everything becomes normal again, and she can be safe,"" said Maalouf, her voice shaking with emotion. She has urged her son to start saving money for the worst.

""We'll keep fighting,"" she said, ""but day by day it's hard. ... I'm tired already.""

"As affordable housing disappears, states scramble to shore up the losses",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/low-income-housing-tax-credit-affordable-harris-8f68bcf189c17f910459142ee8a50289,2024-10-06T05:28:54Z,"LOS ANGELES (AP) -- For more than two decades, the low rent on Marina Maalouf's apartment in a blocky affordable housing development in Los Angeles' Chinatown was a saving grace for her family, including a granddaughter who has autism.

But that grace had an expiration date. For Maalouf and her family it arrived in 2020.

The landlord, no longer legally obligated to keep the building affordable, hiked rent from $1,100 to $2,660 in 2021 -- out of reach for Maalouf and her family. Maalouf's nights are haunted by fears her yearslong eviction battle will end in sleeping bags on a friend's floor or worse.

While Americans continue to struggle under unrelentingly high rents, as many as 223,0000 affordable housing units like Maalouf's across the U.S. could be yanked out from under them in the next five years alone.

It leaves low-income tenants caught facing protracted eviction battles, scrambling to pay a two-fold rent increase or more, or shunted back into a housing market where costs can easily eat half a paycheck.

Those affordable housing units were built with the Low-Income Housing Tax Credit, or LIHTC, a federal program established in 1986 that provides tax credits to developers in exchange for keeping rents low. It has pumped out 3.6 million units since then and boasts over half of all federally supported low-income housing nationwide.

""It's the lifeblood of affordable housing development,"" said Brian Rossbert, who runs Housing Colorado, an organization advocating for affordable homes.

That lifeblood isn't strictly red or blue. By combining social benefits with tax breaks and private ownership, LIHTC has enjoyed bipartisan support. Its expansion is now central to Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris' housing plan to build 3 million new homes.

The catch? The buildings typically only need to be kept affordable for a minimum of 30 years. For the wave of LIHTC construction in the 1990s, those deadlines are arriving now, threatening to hemorrhage affordable housing supply when Americans need it most.

""If we are losing the homes that are currently affordable and available to households, then we're losing ground on the crisis,"" said Sarah Saadian, vice president of public policy at the National Low Income Housing Coalition.

""It's sort of like having a boat with a hole at the bottom,"" she said.

Not all units that expire out of LIHTC become market rate. Some are kept affordable by other government subsidies, by merciful landlords or by states, including California, Colorado and New York, that have worked to keep them low-cost by relying on several levers.

Local governments and nonprofits can purchase expiring apartments, new tax credits can be applied that extend the affordability, or, as in Maalouf's case, tenants can organize to try to force action from landlords and city officials.

Those options face challenges. While new tax credits can reup a lapsing LIHTC property, they are limited, doled out to states by the Internal Revenue Service based on population. It's also a tall order for local governments and nonprofits to shell out enough money to purchase and keep expiring developments affordable. And there is little aggregated data on exactly when LIHTC units will lose their affordability, making it difficult for policymakers and activists to fully prepare.

There also is less of a political incentive to preserve the units.

""Politically, you're rewarded for an announcement, a groundbreaking, a ribbon-cutting,"" said Vicki Been, a New York University professor who previously was New York City's deputy mayor for housing and economic development.

""You're not rewarded for being a good manager of your assets and keeping track of everything and making sure that you're not losing a single affordable housing unit,"" she said.

Maalouf stood in her apartment courtyard on a recent warm day, chit-chatting and waving to neighbors, a bracelet with a photo of Che Guevarra dangling from her arm.

""Friendly,"" is how Maalouf described her previous self, but not assertive. That is until the rent hikes pushed her in front of the Los Angeles City Council for the first time, sweat beading as she fought for her home.

Now an organizer with the LA Tenants' Union, Maalouf isn't afraid to speak up, but the angst over her home still keeps her up at night. Mornings she repeats a mantra: ""We still here. We still here."" But fighting day after day to make it true is exhausting.

Maalouf's apartment was built before California made LIHTC contracts last 55 years instead of 30 in 1996. About 5,700 LIHTC units built around the time of Maalouf's are expiring in the next decade. In Texas, it's 21,000 units.

When California Treasurer Fiona Ma assumed office in 2019, she steered the program toward developers committed to affordable housing and not what she called ""churn and burn,"" buying up LIHTC properties and flipping them onto the market as soon as possible.

In California, landlords must notify state and local governments and tenants before their building expires. Housing organizations, nonprofits, and state or local governments then have first shot at buying the property to keep it affordable. Expiring developments also are prioritized for new tax credits, and the state essentially requires that all LIHTC applicants have experience owning and managing affordable housing.

""It kind of weeded out people who weren't interested in affordable housing long term,"" said Marina Wiant, executive director of California's tax credit allocation committee.

But unlike California, some states haven't extended LIHTC agreements beyond 30 years, let alone taken other measures to keep expiring housing affordable.

Colorado, which has some 80,000 LIHTC units, passed a law this year giving local governments the right of first refusal in hopes of preserving 4,400 units set to lose affordability protections in the next six years. The law also requires landlords to give local and state governments a two-year heads-up before expiration.

Still, local governments or nonprofits scraping together the funds to buy sizeable apartment buildings is far from a guarantee.

Stories like Maalouf's will keep playing out as LIHTC units turn over, threatening to send families with meager means back into the housing market. The median income of Americans living in these units was just $18,600 in 2021, according to the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

""This is like a math problem,"" said Rossbert of Housing Colorado. ""As soon as one of these units expires and converts to market rate and a household is displaced, they become a part of the need that's driving the need for new construction.""

""It's hard to get out of that cycle,"" he said.

Colorado's housing agency works with groups across the state on preservation and has a fund to help. Still, it's unclear how many LIHTC units can be saved, in Colorado or across the country.

It's even hard to know how many units nationwide are expiring. An accurate accounting would require sorting through the constellation of municipal, state and federal subsidies, each with their own affordability requirements and end dates.

That can throw a wrench into policymakers' and advocates' ability to fully understand where and when many units will lose affordability, and then funnel resources to the right places, said Kelly McElwain, who manages and oversees the National Housing Preservation Database. It's the most comprehensive aggregation of LIHTC data nationally, but with all the gaps, it remains a rough estimate.

There also are fears that if states publicize their expiring LIHTC units, for-profit buyers without an interest in keeping them affordable would pounce.

""It's sort of this Catch-22 of trying to both understand the problem and not put out a big for-sale sign in front of a property right before its expiration,"" Rossbert said.

Meanwhile, Maalouf's tenant activism has helped move the needle in Los Angeles. The city has offered the landlord $15 million to keep her building affordable through 2034, but that deal wouldn't get rid of over 30 eviction cases still proceeding, including Maalouf's, or the $25,000 in back rent she owes.

In her courtyard, Maalouf's granddaughter, Rubie Caceres, shuffled up with a glass of water. She is 5 years old, but with special needs, her speech is more disconnected words than sentences.

""That's why I've been hoping everything becomes normal again, and she can be safe,"" said Maalouf, her voice shaking with emotion. She has urged her son to start saving money for the worst.

""We'll keep fighting,"" she said, ""but day by day it's hard.""

South Korean leader says North Korea wants US attention by showing off nuclear might,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-yoon-north-nuclear-asean-3e6a6839383efed921afc12351e3ba8c,2024-10-05T23:14:09Z,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- North Korea's recent disclosure of a nuclear facility was likely an attempt to grab U.S. attention ahead of the presidential election, and the North will likely stage major provocations like a nuclear test explosion and a long-range missile test, South Korea's president says.

President Yoon Suk Yeol shared his government's assessment on the recent moves by North Korea with The Associated Press, before he leaves Sunday for a three-nation trip that includes a stop in Laos for summits with Southeast Asian and other world leaders. At Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)-related meetings, Yoon says he'll emphasize that North Korea's nuclear disarmament is essential to regional peace.

""At the upcoming ASEAN-related summits, I will stress the importance of denuclearization of North Korea, which is a prerequisite for realizing a free, peaceful and prosperous Indo-Pacific region,"" Yoon said in written responses to questions from the AP.

""This will serve to send a clear message that the international community will never condone North Korea's reckless actions,"" he said.

Concerns about North Korea have grown in recent weeks, with the country unveiling a secretive uranium-enrichment facility, vowing to build more nuclear weapons and continuing its provocative missile tests. Last week, North Korean leader Kim Jong Un threatened to destroy South Korea with his nuclear weapons, if provoked.

Many foreign experts say North Korea eventually hopes to use an expanded nuclear arsenal as leverage to win outside concessions like sanctions relief, after a new U.S. president is elected. They say Kim likely thinks a win by Republican candidate Donald Trump, whom he engaged in high-stakes nuclear diplomacy in 2018-19, would increase his chances to get what he wants than Democratic candidate Kamala Harris. During campaigns, Trump boasted about his personal ties with Kim, while Harris said she won't ""cozy up to tyrants and dictators like Kim Jong Un who are rooting for Trump.""

The Sept. 13 disclosure of the nuclear site showed Kim's defiance of U.S.-led efforts to eliminate his advancing nuclear program. It was North Korea's first unveiling of a facility to produce weapons-grade uranium since the country showed one at its main Yongbyon nuclear complex to visiting American scholars led by nuclear physicist Siegfried Hecker in 2010. Hecker said the centrifuge hall shown in the recent North Korean photos was not the same one that he saw in 2010.

""North Korea seems to have recently disclosed its nuclear facility in order to draw attention from the United States and the international community in the run-up to the U.S. presidential election, and it is likely that North Korea will carry out additional provocations such as nuclear tests and ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missile) launches going forward,"" Yoon said.

Yoon didn't elaborate whether South Korea has detected any suspicious activities in North Korea that indicate its preparations for nuclear and ICBM tests. He said South Korea is closely monitoring North Korea's movements through the South Korea-U.S. combined intelligence and surveillance assets.

North Korea has conducted six underground nuclear tests since 2006, and numerous ICBM test-launches in recent years. Additional tests are likely meant to further hone its nuclear and missile capabilities. Many observers assess North Korea has yet to possess functioning nuclear missiles that can reach the U.S. mainland, though it likely has ones that can strike all of South Korea and Japan.

Since his inauguration in 2022, Yoon, a conservative, has made a stronger military alliance with the United States the center of his foreign policy to cope with North Korea's evolving nuclear threats. He's also taken a major step toward moving beyond historical disputes with Japan to beef up a trilateral Seoul-Washington-Tokyo security partnership. Such moves have enraged North Korea, which has called Yoon ""a traitor"" and ignored his calls for dialogue.

There are some potential worries about the South Korea-U.S. alliance if Trump returns to the White House. He had previously asked South Korea to drastically increase its share for the cost of the U.S. military deployment on its soil. Some experts say Trump's possible push for a new round of negotiation with Kim could complicate Yoon's approach on North Korea's nuclear program.

But Yoon said that he's confident that the ""ironclad"" South Korea-U.S. alliance will continue to advance steadily regardless of the outcome of the U.S. election.

""There is a firm bipartisan support for the ROK-U.S. alliance in the United States,"" Yoon said. ""Numerous leading U.S. Democrats and Republicans have publicly stated their staunch support for the alliance and are continuously visiting Korea for consultations to enhance the bilateral relations.""

The ROK stands for the Republic of Korea, South Korea's formal name.

Yoon also expressed confidence that South Korea and Japan will continue to advance their bilateral ties under Japan's new Cabinet led by Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba, who took office last week. Yoon's office said the two countries are discussing arranging a meeting between Yoon and Ishiba on the sidelines of the ASEAN summit.

Yoon said he believes North Korea's nuclear threats against South Korea are aimed at fomenting internal divisions in South Korea and tightening its domestic control with heightened military tensions on the Korean Peninsula.

""The North Korean regime's past claim that its nuclear development was never intended to target the Republic of Korea, since we are one nation, has been debunked,"" Yoon said.

Asked about North Korea's repeated launches of trash-carrying balloons toward South Korea, Yoon said that North Korea ""will face consequences that it will find difficult to withstand"" if the safety of South Korean people is jeopardized. He didn't elaborate what specific steps his government is considering.

Before visiting Laos, Yoon is to travel to the Philippines and Singapore.

At the ASEAN-related summits, Yoon said that a key issue that South Korea plans to raise other than the North Korean nuclear program is the establishment of the ROK-ASEAN comprehensive strategic partnership. He said South Korea will further expand cooperation with ASEAN on a range of areas such as politics, military exchanges, cybersecurity, environments and a safety net against financial crises."
Mormon church leaders encourage civility as Trump and Harris rally religious voters,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mormon-voters-trump-harris-abortion-4b7d1b3fca00d341ba988d3390cfc3d5,2024-10-05T22:51:31Z,"SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- As both presidential campaigns have stepped up efforts to win over voters in western swing states who belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, a top church official urged members on Saturday to ""avoid what is harsh and hateful"" in the heat of election season.

Dallin H. Oaks, the top adviser and likely successor to 100-year-old church president Russell M. Nelson, encouraged congregants at the faith's twice-annual general conference to steer clear of contention and be peacemakers in their communities one month out from the Nov. 5 election.

The devil is the father of contention, which can stir up anger and stall important policy changes, he told a room of 18,000 church members in Salt Lake City and thousands more watching on a livestream.

""As we pursue our preferred policies in public actions, let us qualify for his blessings by using the language and methods of peacemakers,"" said Oaks, the second-highest-ranking leader of the faith known widely as the Mormon church.

The faith's leaders strive to remain politically neutral. But they sometimes give general advice about how members should approach key elections. About 7 million of the faith's 17 million worldwide members live in the United States, many in the battleground states of Arizona and Nevada, and in solidly red Utah and Idaho.

Latter-day Saints have been a reliably Republican voting bloc for decades, but many have half-heartedly embraced Donald Trump since his first run for the White House.

Some church members say the former president's demeaning rhetoric toward women, immigrants and refugees conflicts with their core values of humility, honesty and compassion. Others have raised concern about his felony convictions and his attempts to undermine the 2020 presidential election.

Vice President Kamala Harris is hoping to capitalize on her opponent's inability to lock down the Latter-day Saints vote. Her campaign formalized outreach efforts last month and enlisted prominent members of the faith to convince those in battleground Arizona, a state with nearly 450,000 church members, that Trump is not in alignment with the church's teachings.

Trump has also rallied influential church members at his Mar-a-Lago compound in Florida to help him convince swing voters that he will better protect their religious liberties.

Harris is unlikely to come close to winning a majority of Latter-day Saints. But by preventing Trump from running up big margins with a key demographic, she could tip the scales in Arizona and Nevada, which is home to upward of 180,000 Latter-day Saints.

One of Harris' greatest challenges is making her abortion policy palatable to members of a faith that has long opposed the procedure, with some exceptions.

It is a sticking point for Marilou Idos, a conference attendee from Herriman, Utah, who said she is not a fan of Trump's brash style but plans to vote for him because he opposes expanding abortion access. She also values Trump's support for Israel.

""He's the lesser of two evils,"" said Idos, 70. ""The basic things we believe in, Trump endorses. Abortion, that's kind of the main one, and the freedom to worship.""

The religion is also known for its belief in eternal families, tight-knit congregations and bans on alcohol, coffee, gambling and same-sex relationships.

Sammy Price, 38, of Las Vegas, said he is leaning toward voting for Harris because he thinks the nation needs her unifying rhetoric.

""Trump, he insults people, he makes people feel bad about who they are, and that's not something I think I can stand by,"" he said.

Undecided voters Jenna Winkel, 22, and her husband, Ben Winkel, 24, said just before the conference that they hoped church leaders would avoid addressing politics.

The couple from Draper, Utah, said there is room for a variety of political views under the Latter-day Saints umbrella. While Jenna said her religion doesn't really inform her politics, Ben said his does, but he wants to do more of his own research.

""The important thing about any general conference message is that it's general and then we're asked to take them and study them and apply them to our own lives, and maybe our politics,"" Jenna said. ""People will take what they need to hear from them and apply them in their lives."""
"Ohio court refers case brought by citizens' group against Trump, Vance to prosecutors",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/haitian-immigration-trump-vance-da370515db927ea9e6cbd9a92469da7a,2024-10-05T16:35:15Z,"SPRINGFIELD, Ohio (AP) -- An Ohio court has referred to county prosecutors a criminal case brought by a citizens' group against the Republican presidential and vice presidential candidates over their comments about Haitian immigrants but rejected the group's call to issue arrest warrants or misdemeanor summons.

Springfield officials said in a statement Saturday that the Clark County municipal court found no probable cause to issue warrants or summons on misdemeanor charges against former president Donald Trump and his running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance. ""The matter was then referred to the Clark County prosecutor's office for further investigation,"" city officials said.

The Springfield News-Sun reports that the judicial panel said particular consideration should be given to ""the strong constitutional protections afforded to speech, and political speech in particular"" with the election so close and the ""contentious"" nature of the issue of immigration.

The Haitian Bridge Alliance, a nonprofit group representing the Haitian community, last month invoked a private-citizen right to file charges over the chaos and threats experienced since Trump first spread false claims about legal immigrants there during a presidential debate.

""Their persistence and relentlessness, even in the face of the governor and the mayor saying this is false, that shows intent,"" said the group's attorney, Subodh Chandra of the Cleveland-based Chandra Law Firm. ""It's knowing, willful flouting of criminal law.""

Steven Cheung of the Trump-Vance campaign said the former president was ""rightfully highlighting the failed immigration system that (Vice President) Kamala Harris has overseen, bringing thousands of illegal immigrants pouring into communities like Springfield and many others across the country.""

The 15,000 to 20,000 Haitian immigrants who have arrived in Springfield over the past several years -- in many cases after being recruited to local jobs -- have been granted ""temporary protected status"" to be in the U.S. legally.

""It is crucial to foster discussions around sensitive issues, particularly those concerning immigration, with a commitment to truth and integrity,"" Springfield officials said. The city said it was ""dedicated to promoting constructive dialogue and addressing community concerns transparently"" and added that ""the safety and well-being of all residents, including the Haitian immigrant community, continue to be our highest priority."""
"Biden pledged to campaign hard for Harris. So far, he's been mostly a no-show",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-harris-lame-duck-joint-campaigning-79496a704736e8965010eea3bb6b6b5d,2024-10-05T14:54:19Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- On the last day of August, President Joe Biden was asked about his fall campaign plans. He promised a Labor Day appearance in Pittsburgh and said he would be ""on the road from there on.""

Biden did campaign with Vice President Kamala Harris on Labor Day, but he largely has been a campaign no-show since. Beyond that, sometimes his official events push hers to the background.

Case in point: After Hurricane Helene, Harris scrapped campaign events in Las Vegas to hurry back to Washington for a briefing at the Federal Emergency Management Agency. But as Harris stepped to a podium in the command center, Biden was delivering his own storm response comments from the Oval Office, pulling the political spotlight away from his intended successor.

The lack of presidential campaigning and occasional schedule clashes could matter not just for Harris but as Democrats try to hold control of the Senate and retake the House and compete in races further down the ballot.

Even former President Barack Obama announced he will campaign for Harris. Obama will appear in Pittsburgh on Thursday and plans to spend the remaining time before the Nov. 5 election traveling to battleground states. He also recorded ads promoting Democratic Senate candidates in Michigan, Maryland and Florida.

It is not uncommon for a lame-duck president to struggle with finding the right balance between fulfilling the job and carving out a role in a would-be successor's campaign. Biden's situation is unusual because he was seeking a second term until his dramatic departure from the race left Harris with a condensed time frame for her own run.

""I think he's doing his job as president,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Friday. ""I think that's the most important thing.""

Hurricane Helene has complicated matters in the short term. Biden canceled a campaign stop in Pennsylvania this past week and he and Harris made separate trips Wednesday to the Carolinas and Georgia, respectively, to survey the damage and offer support.

That time, their remarks did not overlap. But on Friday, while Harris was speaking about the importance of unions outside Detroit, Biden caused a stir by making a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room. It was the first of his presidency.

Biden has taken official trips to battleground states and he will be in suburban Philadelphia on Tuesday to campaign for Democratic Sen. Bob Casey. The Harris team had no comment on its hopes for Biden's campaign role.

The president was born in Pennsylvania and maintains a strong connection to its union leaders and blue-collar voters, and former Democratic National Committee chief Donna Brazile said she would ""put him on a bus"" to campaign there.

""I would make sure he is out there in the closing weeks and days of the campaign,"" Brazile said. ""He connects with people she will need.""

Biden and Harris have appeared together at several other official events, including a recent one at the White House on combating gun violence, and at a health care-related event in August where Biden said, ""We cannot let Kamala lose."" Both have been in the Situation Room frequently to discuss the growing conflict in the Middle East.

On Labor Day, when Biden and Harris made their lone joint political appearance since the vice president took over the top on the ticket, the White House asked that Biden introduce Harris. The break with protocol was meant to highlight her record of supporting union workers.

""If you elect Kamala Harris as president it will be the best decision you will have ever made,"" Biden told the crowd.

But when he finished speaking, Biden began shaking hands with those around him -- an awkward moment because Harris had yet to have her turn at the podium.

It is an open question whether Harris really wants Biden's help, given that Democratic voters say they are far happier with her than they were with Biden as their nominee. Harris has praised the administration and her work in it, while also seeking to show distance on some key issues.

That includes her call for raising long-term capital gains taxes for wealthy Americans when Biden had pushed to lower them, getting tougher on the U.S.-Mexico border by potentially further stiffening limits for immigrants seeking asylum and talking up being a gun owner in ways Biden does not.

Biden's campaign absence could now be compounded as his administration deals with the recovery effort after Helene and the expanding conflict in the Mideast.

""You don't need to campaign when you're just doing your job,"" said Nikki Fried, chair of the Democratic Party in Florida. Biden visited parts of the state on Thursday, demonstrating, as Fried put it, that ""the full force of the federal government stands with the people during times of heartbreak and uncertainty.""

But then there are always big demands on a president's time -- from the U.N. General Assembly meetings last month in New York to Biden's upcoming travel to Germany and Angola. Though the White House says there will be more political events after that, the trip means he will not have time to turn his attention to campaigning for Harris until at least mid-October -- just three weeks before Election Day,

Fried thinks Biden will make it work.

""Joe Biden loves being on the campaign trail,"" she said. ""You can see him walking around and talking to voters and to communities, and it certainly puts an extra lift in his step and a smile on his face.""

There are times when a president's absence can be helpful to that party's candidate.

In 2008, the financial crisis sent President George W. Bush's approval ratings crashing. Republican nominee John McCain distanced himself from the White House on the economy after criticizing the federal response to Hurricane Katrina and the Iraq War.

""If my showing up and endorsing him helps him -- or if I'm against him and it helps him -- either way, I want him to win,"" Bush said.

In 2000, when Democratic Vice President Al Gore was seeking the White House, he criticized President Bill Clinton over the Monica Lewinsky scandal and took other steps to distance himself from Clinton. Some Democrats later speculated that was the reason Gore lost an exceedingly close race to Bush.

Paul Begala, a key architect of Clinton's 1992 campaign, does not see a lot of parallels between Clinton and Biden.

""In 2000, Clinton was broadly popular,"" Begala said. ""Biden is not.""

Begala said Biden would do best to ""focus on governing, and leave the campaigning to Kamala"" and her top supporters.

""Lots of people can campaign for her: the Obamas, the Clintons, Oprah, Taylor Swift,"" Begala said. ""But only Joe Biden can be president."""
"After the deluge, the lies: Misinformation and hoaxes about Helene cloud the recovery",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-trump-musk-conspiracy-theories-misinformation-fe81869765d778ac2ff3dc5f9ac18e10,2024-10-05T13:43:23Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The facts emerging from Hurricane Helene's destruction are heartrending: Businesses and homes destroyed, whole communities nearly wiped out, hundreds of lives lost, hundreds of people missing.

Yet this devastation and despair is not enough for the extremist groups, disinformation agents, hucksters and politicians who are exploiting the disaster to spread false claims and conspiracy theories about it and the government's response.

According to former President Donald Trump, the federal government is intentionally withholding aid to Republican disaster victims. Far-right extremist groups warn on social media that officials plan to bulldoze affected communities and seize the land from residents. A tale straight from science fiction asserts that Washington used weather control technology to steer Helene toward Republican voters in order to tilt the presidential election toward Democratic nominee Kamala Harris.

The claims, according to experts and local officials dealing with disaster response, say less about the reality of the widespread damage from Helene than they do about America's fractured politics and the fear and distrust shadowing an election year marked by assassination attempts and escalating global tension.

As rescue work continues and authorities try to separate fact from fiction, the conspiracy theories are not helping. Elected leaders from both parties have had to set the record straight and urge people not to give into fear and rumor.

""If everyone could maybe please put aside the hate for a bit and pitch in to help, that would be great,"" posted Glenn Jacobs, the retired professional wrestler known as Kane, who is now the Republican mayor of Knox County, Tennessee. Jacobs' post was intended to rebut rumors that workers from the Federal Emergency Management Agency were seizing relief supplies from private citizens.

Many of the conspiracy theories focus on hard-hit North Carolina, a state key to winning the White House. Rumors circulated that FEMA was raiding storm donations and withholding body bags, forcing local hospitals to stack the bodies of victims. One claim suggested federal authorities would condemn the entire town of Chimney Rock and prohibit resettlement in order to commandeer a valuable lithium mine nearby.

Elon Musk, the owner of Tesla, X and SpaceX, posted that private relief flights to North Carolina were being blocked by the Federal Aviation Administration, a claim dismissed as false by Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg.

Despite the tradition of Democrats and Republicans putting aside politics for disaster response, many conspiracy theories suggest Democrats such as President Joe Biden or North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper are intentionally withholding aid from Republicans. Trump has pushed the claim, as has North Carolina's lieutenant governor, Mark Robinson, the embattled GOP nominee for governor.

""They're being treated very badly in the Republican areas,"" Trump told Fox News, ignoring reports and photo and video evidence of recovery efforts underway throughout the region. ""They're not getting water, they're not getting anything.""

Conspiracy theorist Alex Jones endorsed Trump's fact-free allegation. Jones, the founder of InfoWars, popularized the idea that the Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 children in 2012 was faked. ""Exclusive: Victims of Hurricane Helene Confirm The Federal Government is Purposely Blocking Rescuers and Stealing Aid In an Attempt to Keep Deep Red Areas From Voting,"" Jones posted Thursday on X.

State-run media and disinformation campaigns run by China and Russia have amplified false and misleading claims about the response to the storm. Both countries have used social media and state news stories to criticize responses to past U.S. natural disasters, part of a larger effort to stoke division and distrust among Americans.

State and local officials from both parties have condemned the conspiracy theories as rumors, saying the focus should be on recovery, not political division and hearsay. Responding to the hoaxes is taking up time that should go toward assisting victims, said North Carolina state Sen. Kevin Corbin, a Republican who urged his constituents not to give into hoaxes.

""Friends can I ask a small favor?"" Corbin posted Thursday on Facebook. ""Will you all help STOP this conspiracy theory junk that is floating all over Facebook and the internet... Please don't let these crazy stories consume you.""

After Robinson, the GOP candidate for North Carolina governor, posted that state officials had not prepared for the storm, a spokesman for the governor accused Robinson of mounting ""an online disinformation campaign."" North Carolina officials say the response to Helene is the largest in state history, including thousands of members of the National Guard and other recovery workers, millions of meals, dozens of aircraft and more than 1,000 chainsaws.

Trump has tried to tie the hurricane's aftermath to immigration, a leading issue of his campaign. He falsely claimed that FEMA had run out of money because all of it had gone to programs for undocumented immigrants.

The agency's funding for disaster aid is stretched, but that is because of the many parts of the country dealing with the effects of hurricanes, wildfires and other calamities. Disaster aid is funded separately from other Department of Homeland Security programs that support immigration-related spending.

Bizarre stories proposing that the government used weather control technology to aim the hurricane at Republican voters quickly racked up millions of views on X and other platforms.

Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, R-Ga., endorsed the idea, posting Wednesday on X: ""Yes they can control the weather. It's ridiculous for anyone to lie and say it can't be done.""

Far-out tales of space lasers, fake snow and weather control technology -- sometimes tinged with antisemitism -- have spread after recent natural disasters, including a snowstorm in Texas and last year's wildfire in Maui.

Experts who study conspiracy theories say big events like disasters -- or the Sept. 11 attacks or the COVID-19 pandemic -- create perfect conditions for conspiracy theories to spread because large numbers of anxious people are eager to find explanations for shocking events.

Responding to the volume of false claims about Helene, the Red Cross urged people to consult trustworthy sources of information and to think twice before reposting conspiracy theories.

""Sharing rumors online without first vetting the source and verifying facts ultimately hurts people -- people who have just lost their homes, neighborhoods, and, in some cases, loved ones,"" the organization wrote in a public plea."
The Supreme Court opens its new term with election disputes in the air but not yet on the docket,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-election-transgender-free-speech-guns-50d7d3d0a85932efe407a80aeaea75fa,2024-10-05T12:43:12Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Transgender rights, the regulation of ""ghost guns"" and the death penalty highlight the Supreme Court's election-season term that begins Monday, with the prospect of the court's intervention in voting disputes lurking in the background.

The justices are returning to the bench at a time of waning public confidence in the court and calls to limit their terms to 18 years that have wide support, including the backing of Democratic President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, the party's White House nominee.

Whether by design or happenstance, the justices are hearing fewer high-profile cases than they did in recent terms that included far-reaching decisions by the 6-3 conservative majority on presidential immunity, abortion, guns, and affirmative action.

The lighter schedule would allow them to easily add election cases, if those make their way to the high court in the run-up to the Nov. 5 election between Republican Donald Trump and Harris, or its immediate aftermath.

""I think there are legal issues that arise out of the political process. And so, the Supreme Court has to be prepared to respond if that should be necessary,"" Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson told CBS News last month in an interview to her promote new memoir, ""Lovely One.""

The court's involvement in election disputes might depend on the closeness of the outcome and whether the justices' intervention would tip the outcome, David Cole, the outgoing legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union, said at a recent Washington event.

""I don't think the court wants to get involved, but it may have to,"" Cole said.

The court turned away multiple challenges from Trump and his allies to the results of the 2020 election that he lost to Biden. It's been nearly a quarter-century since the Supreme Court effectively decided the 2000 presidential election, in which Republican George W. Bush edged Democrat Al Gore.

When the justices gather Monday morning on a date set by federal law, they will shake hands with each other as they always do. Just after 10 o'clock, they will emerge from behind freshly cleaned heavy red drapery and take their seats on the curved mahogany bench, Chief Justice John Roberts in the center chair and his eight colleagues seated in order of seniority.

There are likely to be smiles and shared private jokes. But the friendliness of that moment will not sweep away tensions that have barely been concealed.

During the summer, two justices, Elena Kagan and Jackson, voiced support for toughening the new ethics code that so far lacks a means of enforcement.

The leak to The New York Times of the contents of a memo Roberts wrote last winter that outlined his approach to the court's presidential immunity decision ""was nothing short of shocking,"" Supreme Court lawyer Lisa Blatt said last week at a Washington preview of the coming term.

Two years ago, Politico obtained the draft decision overturning Roe v. Wade, the landmark abortion case.

""Something does feel broken,"" Blatt said. Describing her experience arguing before the court, she said, some justices ""just seem visibly frustrated.""

Important cases dot the court's calendar, beginning Tuesday. The court will take up a challenge to a Biden administration attempt to regulate hard-to-trace ""ghost guns"" that had been turning up at crime scenes in increasing numbers. The Supreme Court jumped into the case after the conservative 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated the regulation.

Last term, conservatives voted 6-3 to strike down a gun regulation that had banned bump stocks, an accessory that allows some weapons to fire at a rate comparable to machine guns. Bump stocks were used in the nation's deadliest modern mass shooting in Las Vegas.

A day after the guns case, the justices will take up the latest twist in Oklahoma death row inmate Richard Glossip's long quest for freedom. His case is the rare instance in which prosecutors are conceding mistakes in the trial that led to Glossip's conviction and death sentence.

The highest-profile case on the agenda so far is a fight over transgender rights that is focused on state bans on gender-affirming care. It probably will be argued in December.

Republican-led states have enacted a variety of restrictions on health care for transgender people, school sports participation, bathroom usage and drag shows. The administration and Democratic-led states have extended protections for transgender people. The Supreme Court has separately prohibited the administration from enforcing a new federal regulation that seeks to protect transgender students.

The case before the high court involves a law in Tennessee that restrict puberty blockers and hormone therapy for transgender minors. About half the states have enacted similar restrictions.

Also on tap for the late fall is an appeal from the adult entertainment industry to overturn a Texas law that requires pornographic websites to verify the age of their users.

Only about half the court's calendar for the term has been filled, and several big cases could be added. Among those is a push by Republican-led states and conservative legal outlets to further restrict federal agencies.

The immediate target is the method the Federal Communications Commission has used to fund telephone service for rural and low-income people and broadband services for schools and libraries.

The case, which the administration has appealed to the Supreme Court, could give the justices the opportunity to revive a legal doctrine known as nondelegation that has not been used to strike down legislation in nearly 90 years. Several conservative justices have expressed support for the idea of limiting the authority Congress can delegate to federal agencies."
Trump returns to site of Pennsylvania assassination attempt for huge rally with Vance and Musk,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-butler-pennsylvania-elon-musk-assassination-attempt-24a8718393eb6fdab01336ca4438a0e0,2024-10-05T04:16:55Z,"BUTLER, Pa. (AP) -- Former President Donald Trump plans to return Saturday to the site where a gunman tried to assassinate him in July, setting aside what are now near-constant worries for his physical safety in order to fulfill a promise -- ""really an obligation,"" he said recently -- to the people of Butler, Pennsylvania.

""I'll probably start off by saying, 'As I was saying ...'"" the Republican presidential nominee has joked, in a bit of black humor about a speech cut short when a bullet struck Trump's ear and he was whisked off stage -- fist aloft -- with blood dripping across his face.

Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, also will be on hand at the Butler Farm Show grounds, as will billionaire Elon Musk, as the campaign elevates the headline-generating potential of his return with just 30 days to go in their tight campaign against Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

The campaign is predicting tens of thousands of people will attend what is being pitched as a ""tribute to the American spirit."" Local hotels, motels and inns are reportedly full and some eager rallygoers were already arriving Friday, according to a local Facebook page.

""President Trump looks forward to returning to Butler, Pennsylvania to honor the victims from that tragic day,"" said Trump campaign spokesperson Karoline Leavitt. ""The willingness of Pennsylvanians to join President Trump in his return to Butler represents the strength and resiliency of the American people.""

Trump will use the 5 p.m. Eastern time event to remember Corey Comperatore, a volunteer firefighter struck and killed at the July 13 rally, and to recognize the two other rallygoers injured, David Dutch and James Copenhaver. They and Trump were struck when 20-year-old shooter Thomas Matthew Crooks, of Bethel Park, Pennsylvania, opened fire from an unsecured rooftop nearby before he was fatally shot by sharpshooters.

How Crooks managed to outmaneuver law enforcement that day and scramble on top of a building within easy shooting distance of the ex-president is among myriad questions that remain unanswered about the worst Secret Service security failure in decades. Another is his motive, which has never been determined.

Butler County District Attorney Rich Goldinger told WPXI-TV this week that ""everyone is doubling down on their efforts to make sure this is done safely and correctly.""

Mike Slupe, the county sheriff, told the station he estimates the Secret Service -- which has undergone a painful reckoning over its handling of two attempts on Trump's life -- is deploying ""quadruple the assets"" it did in July.

Butler County, on the western edge of a coveted presidential swing state, is a Trump stronghold. He won the county -- where turnout hovers around an impressive 80% -- with about 66% of the vote in both 2016 and 2020. About 57% of Butler County's 139,000 registered voters are Republicans, compared with about 29% who are Democrats and 14% something else.

Three months later, townspeople are divided over the value of his return. Heidi Priest, a Butler resident who started a Facebook group supporting Harris, said Trump's last visit fanned political tensions in the city.

""Whenever you see people supporting him and getting excited about him being here, it scares the people who don't want to see him reelected,"" she said.

But Trump needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community, if he wants to win Pennsylvania in November. Harris, too, has targeted her campaign efforts at Pennsylvania, rallying there repeatedly as part of her aggressive outreach in critical swing states."
Harris is heading to North Carolina to survey Helene's aftermath one day after Trump visited,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-democrats-hurricane-helene-13475a09f3fed719a1b451105ab15ccf,2024-10-05T04:15:17Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris is heading to North Carolina on Saturday as the state recovers from Hurricane Helene, arriving there one day after a visit by Republican Donald Trump, who is spreading false claims about the federal response to the disaster.

Earlier in the week, Harris was in Georgia, where she helped distribute meals, toured the damage and consoled families hard-hit by the storm. President Joe Biden, too, visited the disaster zone. During stops over two days in the Carolinas, Florida and Georgia, Biden surveyed the damage and met with farmers whose crops have been destroyed.

The two have been vocal and visible about the government's willingness to help, and the administration's efforts so far include covering costs for all of the rescue and recovery efforts across the Southeast for several months as states struggle under the weight of the mass damage.

In a letter late Friday to congressional leaders, Biden wrote that while the Federal Emergency Management Agency's Disaster Relief Fund ""has the resources it requires right now to meet immediate needs, the fund does face a shortfall at the end of the year."" He also called on lawmakers to act quickly to restore funding to the Small Business Administration's disaster loan program.

More than 200 people have died. It's the worst storm to hit the U.S. mainland since Katrina in 2005, and scientists have warned such storms will only worsen in the face of climate change.

But in this overheated election year, even natural disasters have become deeply politicized as the candidates crisscross the disaster area and in some cases visit the same venues to win over voters in battleground states.

Trump has falsely claimed the Biden administration isn't doing enough to help impacted people in Republican areas and has harshly criticized the response. He has, in Helene's aftermath, espoused falsehoods about climate change, calling it ""one of the great scams of all time.""

During a stop in Fayetteville, North Carolina on Thursday, Trump renewed his complaints about the federal response and cited ""lousy treatment to North Carolina in particular."" In fact, the state's Democratic governor, Roy Cooper, said this week the state has already seen more than 50,000 people be registered for FEMA assistance, and about $6 billion has been paid out.

Biden, meanwhile, has suggested the Republican House speaker is withholding critical disaster funding.

Harris' visits, meanwhile, present an additional political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She's trying to step into a role for which Biden is well known -- showing the empathy that Americans expect in times of tragedy -- in the closing stretch of her White House campaign.

Until this week, she had not visited the scene of a humanitarian crisis as vice president -- that duty was reserved for Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and more.

Harris said this week that she wanted to ""personally take a look at the devastation, which is extraordinary."" She expressed admiration for how ""people are coming together. People are helping perfect strangers.""

She said that shows ""the vast majority of us have so much more in common than what separates us,"" an echo of a line she frequently uses on the campaign trail.

""We are here for the long haul,"" she said.

The Biden administration isn't extending a two-year program for migrants from 4 nations,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-immigration-election-4cb4c80e3a71ab79ef47406136653b1a,2024-10-04T22:38:10Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Biden administration will not extend a two-year program that allows migrants from certain nations into the U.S. if they came by plane with sponsorship.

The program began in 2022 with Venezuelans and was an effort to provide an alternative legal pathway for migrants who were increasingly coming to the U.S.-Mexico border while the administration simultaneously cracked down on illegal crossings. It later expanded to Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans -- the nationalities of the migrants who most frequently tried to cross the border. The program allowed them to live and work in the U.S. for two years while they sought other legal status.

The decision comes just a month before the 2024 presidential election, as Democrat Kamala Harris has worked to project a tougher stance on immigration. Republican Donald Trump has derided the administration's immigration policies and has increasingly insulted and spread lies about migrants in the U.S., particularly Haitians, in recent weeks.

Homeland Security officials said Friday that those at the two-year mark must apply for another type of legal status, depart the country or face deportation. There are multiple different pathways for many of the nationalities, including what's called ""temporary protected status"" for Venezuelans and Haitians, which allows them to stay in the U.S. because of extreme violence, unrest or devastating natural disasters in their home countries.

""This two-year period was intended to enable individuals to seek humanitarian relief or other immigration benefits for which they may be eligible, and to work and contribute to the United States,"" a spokesperson for Homeland Security said.

New migrants to the border may still apply for the program, and it does not affect those from Afghanistan or Ukraine."
"Supreme Court candidates dodge, and leverage, political rhetoric",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/montana-courts-u-s-republican-party-general-news-bd83d87893ce66f70a20b9f23453572b,2024-10-04T21:25:08Z,"Judicial forums are not typically known for their entertainment. But during an hour of questions and answers at a late September forum in Great Falls, hosted by the Montana Farmers Union, the four nonpartisan candidates for the open seats on the Montana Supreme Court successfully conveyed that their races are far from boring.

Two sitting state district court judges, Katherine Bidegaray of Sidney and Dan Wilson of Kalispell, are vying for the associate justice position currently held by Justice Dirk Sandefur. In the other race, Broadwater County Attorney Cory Swanson and former federal magistrate Jeremiah ""Jerry"" Lynch, a Missoula resident raised in Butte, are facing off to replace retiring Chief Justice Mike McGrath.

None of the candidates are allowed to run as Republicans or Democrats. But that hasn't stopped political parties and special interest groups from saturating the campaign with mailers and online advertisements, as has become a tradition in Montana judicial races.

Speaking before the audience gathered in a conference room at the Great Falls International Airport, all the candidates acknowledged the charged political environment surrounding their races but stressed their commitment to judicial independence.

""We can't control who supports us, really, or what they do,"" Bidegaray said. ""We only have the ability to control ourselves.""

But while Bidegaray and her opponent, Wilson, have often tried to dispel the heated political rhetoric surrounding the judicial races, Swanson and Lynch have used it to power attacks against one another and defend their own reputations.

""This race became partisan because the Democratic Party made it partisan,"" said Swanson, referencing a national Democratic political action group that pledged to spend millions in states with competitive Supreme Court races. ""Well, they're not spending the money for me.""

During the Great Falls event and other judicial forums, Bidegaray and Wilson have tried to appeal to voters by highlighting their respective legal experience and commitments to fair and impartial rulings.

Both candidates for associate justice have spent decades as lawyers practicing in diverse settings and, most recently, as district court judges adjudicating cases ranging from child welfare to criminal violations to constitutional conflicts.

Bidgaray has been elected to her district court seat, which adjudicates issues from Dawson, Prairie, McCone, Richland and Wibaux counties, four times. Previously, she spent a decade in private practice. Wilson has been a district court judge in Flathead County since 2017 and spent the six years prior as a justice of the peace. Wilson worked as a lawyer beginning in the 1990s, first as a prosecutor and later in private practice, where his cases included criminal defense.

Each candidate has occasionally made statewide headlines for high-profile cases. Wilson gained name recognition during the first year of the COVID pandemic after he ruled against the administration of former Democratic Gov. Steve Bullock when it tried to bring a restraining order against certain businesses over masking requirements.

More recently, Bidegaray ruled that the state Department of Environmental Quality erred in issuing a permit for a company's construction of the Black Butte Mine, a copper operation that could impact a tributary that feeds into the Smith River. The Montana Supreme Court later overturned that ruling.

Recent waves of political advertisements and mailers have tried to distill each judge into a liberal or conservative frame, in part drawing on those notable rulings. The American Civil Liberties Union and Wild Montana Voter Fund have lined up behind Bidegaray, portraying her as a candidate who will uphold Montana's longstanding protections for abortion access and public lands. Alternatively, the Montana Republican State Central Committee and many elected Republicans are backing Wilson, praising him as a restrained judicial conservative with a tough-on-crime record.

In Great Falls, Bidegaray said the groups endorsing her might be reacting to her repeated pledges to defend the individual rights outlined in the Montana Constitution. Those rights, as Bidegaray has mentioned, include the right to privacy, the well-known legal foundation for Montana's access to abortion.

""I have consistently and repeatedly said that I am willing to do my part to uphold the Montana Constitution,"" Bidegaray said. ""I have taken hard cases during my tenure as a district court judge ... and have held firm to protecting people's rights.""

Wilson, meanwhile, told the audience that he does not see the state Constitution as a liberal or conservative document but rather as a clear set of instructions for judges to follow that he has no desire to manipulate.

Both candidates insisted that the political narratives about their campaigns should not undermine their credibility as nonpartisan judicial figures. In response to a question about the support he's received from the Montana Republican State Central Committee, Wilson said, ""The voters can make of it what they will.""

""The message that I have been delivering from the time I started my campaign until the present time hasn't wavered. I am for the rule of law, for judges to follow it humbly and obediently, and don't legislate from the bench,"" Wilson said. ""To the extent I am supported by any group or party, I'm grateful for the support, but it's not going to change how I approach the campaign or is not going to cause me, one bit, to change my judicial philosophy or approach.""

The contest for chief justice between Lynch and Swanson has some parallels to the race for associate justice. Progressive interest groups are backing Lynch. The Republican Party is supporting Swanson.

Other key players include Montanans for Fair Judiciary, a group affiliated with prominent conservative strategist Jake Eaton, which is backing Swanson and Wilson. Another political committee, Montanans For Fair and Impartial Courts, linked to the Montana Trial Lawyers Association, is supporting Bidegaray and Lynch.

But compared to the mostly stoic rhetoric in the race for the associate justice position, the dynamic between Lynch and Swanson is boiling.

Part of the dynamic comes from the candidates' differing professional experiences. Lynch touts his roughly 40 years as a federal court clerk, trial attorney and federal magistrate as evidence of his passion for the law and interest in defending the judiciary. Swanson, alternatively, has a shorter and more diverse background. He started in private practice in 2006 and spent three years as a registered lobbyist for a variety of private interest groups. He spent two years as a deputy attorney general under former Republican Attorney General Tim Fox and was elected Broadwater County attorney in 2014.

Perhaps because of his long track record in federal courts, Lynch doesn't shy away from the third-party depictions of him as a staunch defender of constitutional liberties. As chief justice, he has passionately said he would protect individuals from groups -- including the government -- that seek to infringe upon their rights. Among the many spelled out in the Montana Constitution, Lynch often points to rights that are linked to ongoing policy disputes: the right to public education, the right to vote, the right to a clean and healthful environment and the right to privacy.

Lynch has also promised to fight to preserve the judiciary's autonomy, criticizing the Republican-led Legislature's efforts to change laws about the judiciary and launch pronounced investigations into the Montana Supreme Court.

""They are a fair court. They decide issues according to the law. And the attack on that court right now is a political attack. It's that simple,"" Lynch said during the Great Falls forum. ""As your chief justice ... I will stand toe-to-toe to make sure the independence of the judiciary stands.""

As he pushes his vision of a doggedly independent and defensive judiciary, Lynch has attacked Swanson with allegations that the current county attorney is too closely tied to conservative interest groups and the Republican Party. Lynch points to a 2008 case in which Swanson represented Eaton, then the director of the state GOP, after the party challenged roughly 6,000 voter registrations in several Democratic-leaning counties weeks before the November election. Lynch also publicly highlights that Swanson's judicial campaign is managed by lobbyist and former GOP official Chuck Denowh.

""I think it's fair to say he's a political partisan and a hyper-partisan,"" Lynch said about Swanson during an August podcast with Whitefish business owner Ed Docter.

At other points in the interview, Lynch justified his strong critique of his opponent by pointing to the attacks Swanson's supporters have made against him. ""I entered this race thinking I would be at a high level -- and I do want to be that because I respect the judiciary so much,"" Lynch said. ""However, I'm also from Butte. When someone punches me in the mouth, I'm going to punch back.""

Butte heritage aside, Swanson has appeared to abide by the same rule of thumb. As the two candidates appear together at forums around Montana, Swanson has accused Lynch of complimenting Democrats and aligning with progressive causes.

""My opponent recently went on a podcast and endorsed Jon Tester and Tim Walz. And I don't think we should be doing that,"" Swanson said at the Great Falls forum, referring to Lynch's podcast appearance with Docter. ""So my goal is to keep this nonpartisan. And if I get elected, I will operate as a nonpartisan justice. Period.""

Lynch wagged his finger and shook his head in disagreement. In the podcast, Lynch did not explicitly endorse either Montana's Democratic U.S. senator or the Democratic Minnesota governor currently running to be vice president alongside Democratic nominee Kamala Harris. However, the former magistrate called Tester ""a magnificent human being"" and said that he appreciated Walz's down-to-earth demeanor, opining that those types of individuals ""are the people that should be in the United States Senate."" Tester is running for reelection against Republican challenger Tim Sheehy.

The state code of judicial conduct prohibits Montana judges and judicial candidates from publicly endorsing or opposing any partisan or independent candidate for public office. Swanson has not specifically mentioned that prohibition in recent public appearances, instead opting to generally criticize Lynch's disposition and tout his own ability to navigate political tensions -- including the ongoing feud between the judiciary and Republican leadership in the Legislature.

""There is a political controversy in this state that has to be navigated with wisdom, with dexterity and with humility and with some diplomacy, and then occasionally with some firmness. That's called judicial temperament,"" Swanson said. ""A certain level of that leadership and temperament must be on display at all times.""

At a Bozeman forum hosted by the Gallatin County Bar Association in late September, the day after the Great Falls event, Lynch again sought to leverage Swanson's involvement with the GOP voter registration challenge from 2008. He accused Swanson of participating in voter suppression, an effort that Lynch suggested should be disqualifying for someone running for the Supreme Court.

Swanson reflected on the case but quickly pivoted, questioning the ethical implications of walking away from a client who did something wrong.

""I represented an entity that did something stupid. And the rules of ethics, as an attorney, tell you that when your client does something stupid, you don't just run away from them and abandon them. You say, 'Okay, I'm going to represent you despite the fact that you did something stupid and help you work your way through that.' And that's what I did,"" Swanson said.

Later, Swanson returned to the topic, criticizing Lynch for using the incident to malign his reputation. Speaking to a roomful of lawyers and pre-law students, he asked whether that type of judgment is what attorneys want from a justice when they're representing a challenging client. ""Think about that,"" Swanson said.

The county attorney has used other public comments to cast Lynch as unprofessional. Swanson has taken issue with Lynch's repeated pledges to defend the Montana Supreme Court's 25-year-old precedent in Armstrong v. State, the unanimous decision that found that the state Constitution protected abortion access through the right to privacy. Lynch has said that respecting precedent is not the same as pre-judging cases that may come before the court, but rather a display of respect for the weight of past rulings.

Swanson doesn't buy it.

""Those are dog whistles. They are intentionally crafted statements to tell liberal groups how you're going to vote,"" he told Montana Free Press shortly before the Bozeman forum. ""You can't do that.""

In Great Falls, Swanson and the other candidates were explicitly asked about abortion rights and the initiative to explicitly include those protections in the Montana Constitution, CI-128. Swanson again spoke against judges and candidates forecasting their stances on future issues. He likened his approach to the tradition among some top-ranking military officials not to vote in presidential races.

""I don't go to quite that extreme, but I intend to abstain from voting on all of these policy issues because I don't want to, even internally in my own soul, have a policy preference that then I might have to deal with as a judge,"" Swanson said. If the initiative passes and is the basis of future litigation, Swanson continued, the justices should ""take our own personal view and ideology out of it and decide that case with a methodology that is fair and impartial.""

At this point, third-party groups -- including the Montana Republican State Central Committee and the American Civil Liberties Union -- have collectively invested millions in the races for the two Supreme Court seats, mostly on direct mailers and online advertisements.

The Montana Values Action Fund, helmed by liberal powerbroker Mary Stranahan, has donated hundreds of thousands to Montanans for Fair and Impartial Courts, Montanans for Liberty and Justice and Montana Senior Vote Action Fund -- all groups advocating for Lynch and Bidegaray.

In August, the national group Fair Courts America made a $200,000 donation to Montana Judicial Accountability Initiative, another political action committee tied to Eaton, its largest received donation this cycle. Fair Courts America, a federal PAC, is primarily funded by Richard Uihlein, the shipping magnate and billionaire supporter of conservative political causes. Since that donation, Montana Judicial Accountability Initiative has transferred $35,000 to Eaton's other group, Montanans for Fair Judiciary, one of the entities backing Swanson and Wilson.

Other interest group spending is more difficult to track. The national money Swanson referenced, from the National Democratic Redistricting Committee and Planned Parenthood Votes, has not made a clear mark on Montana's elections, but could very well be circulating after transfers between other political committees.

The candidates themselves continue to eschew direct affiliation with those political undercurrents and speak to voters about their individual judicial philosophies in forums around the state.

One of the next events with all four contenders is scheduled for 6 p.m., Oct. 9 in Billings, hosted by the Montana Farm Bureau at the Billings Hotel and Convention Center.

Absentee ballots are scheduled to go out on Oct. 11. The election is Tuesday, Nov. 5.

"Biden talks election, economy and Middle East in surprise news briefing",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-trump-conference-hamas-israel-kamala-harris-lebanon-hezbollah-jd-vance-0093866898d9f9067ff0676672cba9d8,2024-10-04T20:48:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- After 1,080 days as president, Joe Biden on Friday decided to pop in and take questions in the White House briefing room for the first time, striding in with a grin after a strong monthly jobs report and the temporary settlement of a strike by ports workers.

The president has been less available than his recent predecessors to questions from White House press corps, making his surprise appearance welcome to the gathered reporters who waited as his press secretary's daily briefing was moved up 15 minutes, then delayed for nearly one hour.

The president stepped through the press room's blue door in a dark gray suit and red tie and proceeded to make news in response to questions about comments on the 2024 presidential election, the latest jobs numbers and the escalating conflict in the Middle East.

The 81-year old stepped aside from the Democratic nomination this summer, backing Vice President Kamala Harris instead. He acknowledged doubts about whether the November election would be peaceful, given comments by former President Donald Trump that the results could be rigged.

""I'm confident it will be free and fair. I don't know whether it will be peaceful,"" Biden said. ""The things that Trump has said, and the the things that he said last time when he didn't like the outcome of the election, were very dangerous.""

Biden has tried to rebut a political movement that has at times openly trafficked in conspiracy theories, with the latest revolving around the government reporting Friday that employers added 254,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate ticked down to 4.1%.

""Another fake jobs report out from Biden-Harris government today,"" Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., posted on social media. ""But all the fake numbers in the world aren't going to fool people dealing with the Biden-Harris.""

The jobs reports are legitimate and have capped a solid run for the U.S. economy. Growth has stayed solid even as the inflation rate has dropped from a four-decade high in 2022 to an annual rate of 2.5%.

Consumer confidence has been weak relative to overall economic growth, a sign that many people still don't feel the strength seen in the latest jobs and inflation numbers. But Biden stressed that he was operating on valid data despite unfounded claims of falsification by supporters of Trump's Make America Great Again movement.

""If you notice, anything the MAGA Republicans don't like they call 'fake,'"" Biden said. ""The job numbers are what the job numbers are. They're real. They're sincere.""

The president also highlighted the deal reached Thursday to suspend a strike by 45,000 dockworkers on East and Gulf coast ports until Jan. 15, creating time to try to hash out a new contract.

Still, challenges remain for Biden as his final months as president involve the risk of a wider war in the Middle East.

Since Hamas attacked Israel nearly a year ago, Israel has retaliated by bombarding the Gaza region in ways that have raised human rights concerns, as well as killing Hezbollah leaders and launching airstrikes in Lebanon. On Tuesday, Iran fired at least 180 missiles into Israel and there are concerns about additional retaliation that could cause the conflict to deepen.

When asked, Biden clarified his comments from a day earlier about Israel possibly striking Iranian oil facilities, which caused the price of the commodity to jump on the prospect of supplies being squeezed.

""Look, the Israelis have not concluded what they're going to do in terms of a strike,"" Biden said Friday. ""That's under discussion. I think if I were in their shoes, I'd be thinking about other alternatives than striking oil fields.""

The president emphasized that he and Harris are ""singing from the same song sheet"" on foreign and domestic policy, calling her a ""major player in everything we've done.""

As Biden began to leave the room, he was asked if he would reconsider his decision to exit the race. Biden cocked his head and smiled."
Donald Trump and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp use hurricane recovery to make first appearance together,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-brian-kemp-hurricane-helene-biden-75ed7f49ffd1a9b07ba82e18abecaa47,2024-10-04T19:46:26Z,"EVANS, Ga. (AP) -- After making up privately, former President Donald Trump and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp are using the aftermath of Hurricane Helene to put their détente on public display with a month to go before Election Day.

Trump, the 2024 Republican presidential nominee, and Kemp, a popular second-term governor, are slated to appear together Friday afternoon outside Augusta, Georgia, to tout recovery efforts after Helene made landfall in Florida and wrought widespread damage as it moved inland through Georgia and other states.

The appearance will take place at a public pavilion in the town of Evans, with Trump and Kemp surrounded by water, paper products and other relief supplies. It marks the latest turn in the two Republicans' contentious relationship tracing back to Trump's insistence that his 2020 election defeat was fraudulent and his repeated broadsides at Kemp for not helping him overturn Democrat Joe Biden's narrow victory in Georgia.

It also comes days after Kemp publicly disputed Trump's false assertions that Biden and his White House were not helping Georgia and other GOP-run states affected by the storm. Kemp told reporters plainly that Biden had called him personally and offered whatever assistance Georgia might need.

""The president just called me ... and I missed him and called him right back and he just said 'Hey, what do you need?' And I told him, you know, we've got what we need, we'll work through the federal process,"" Kemp said of Biden. ""He offered if there are other things we need just to call him directly, which I appreciate that.""

In Valdosta on Monday, Trump ignored reporters' questions about Kemp confirming that Biden and his administration were indeed directing federal response and working with officials in the affected states, which are led by governors from both major parties.

It was not clear Friday whether Trump and Kemp might take questions from reporters gathered in Evans -- a situation that almost certainly would put the governor in a position to again dispute Trump's false accounts with the former president standing beside him.

As recently as August, Trump used social media posts and an Atlanta rally to accuse the governor of ""fighting Unity and the Republican Party"" and criticizing Georgia's first lady for saying she planned to write in her husband's name on her presidential ballot. Kemp had been saying for months that he would support ""the Republican ticket,"" but without naming Trump specifically.

That spectacle raised concerns among Republicans in Georgia and nationally that GOP dissension would lead to a repeat of 2020, when Biden won the state by fewer than 12,000 votes out of 5 million cast.

South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham and Trump's running mate JD Vance helped negotiate a detente, with Kemp finally stating in a cable news interview that he supported Trump's comeback bid and Trump, in turn, praising the governor on social media. Not long after, Vance and Kemp spoke at a Faith & Freedom Coalition gala in Georgia and met privately backstage. During his speech at the dinner, Kemp did explicitly call for returning Trump to the White House. But he still spent most of his argument criticizing Democratic nominee and Vice President Kamala Harris rather than extolling Trump."
4 voters charged with intentionally voting twice in Michigan primary election,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/michigan-election-fraud-charges-d274ed39e3f298f3e75a44dfb38be4c4,2024-10-04T17:27:06Z,"DETROIT (AP) -- Four people intentionally voted twice in Michigan's summer primary election, the state attorney general said Friday as she announced felony charges against the suburban Detroit residents as well as public employees accused of enabling it to happen.

""It's shocking and simply unheard of,"" Attorney General Dana Nessel said.

The charges in St. Clair Shores come a month before the general election in a high-stakes state coveted by presidential candidates Donald Trump and Kamala Harris and where voter turnout is expected to be high.

""What occurred here cannot be allowed to be repeated in November,"" Nessel said. ""As to election workers, it is imperative that all election staff, volunteers and assistant clerks abide by the laws of this state.""

She said four people who had already cast absentee ballots for the Aug. 6 primary showed up to vote in St. Clair Shores on the day of the election. It's possible to cancel an absentee ballot, Nessel said, but not when a ballot has already been received before Election Day.

An electronic poll book showed that the four had already voted. But after poll workers consulted with local election staff, they were still allowed to vote again, Nessel said.

The extra votes did not affect race results, she said.

Four voters were charged with voting twice. Three people described as assistant clerks in St. Clair Shores were charged with falsifying election records.

Nessel said the motives of the seven were unknown. There's no evidence that they were working together.

The state stepped in after Pete Lucido, the Republican local prosecutor in Macomb County, said there was ""no malicious or criminal intent"" and declined to file charges.

Nessel, a Democrat, suggested Lucido didn't have expertise.

""There are so many different procedures that are involved here,"" she said. ""I think if you're not highly familiar with this, the way that our staff has become, it's easy to make mistakes."""

Harris was also an early supporter of Obama's 2008 presidential bid and knocked on doors for him in Iowa ahead of its caucus that led off voting in the Democratic primary.

Dockworkers' union suspends strike until Jan. 15 to allow time to negotiate new contract,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/longshoremen-strike-ports-dockworkers-agreement-ila-f136bdcd52738e94f2938aaa79a1fa2a,2024-10-04T10:57:53Z,"DETROIT (AP) -- Some 45,000 dockworkers at East and Gulf coast ports are returning to work after their union reached a deal to suspend a strike that could have caused shortages and higher prices if it had dragged on.

The International Longshoremen's Association is suspending its three-day strike until Jan. 15 to provide time to negotiate a new contract. The union and the U.S. Maritime Alliance, which represents ports and shipping companies, said in a joint statement that they have reached a tentative agreement on wages.

A person briefed on the agreement said the ports sweetened their wage offer from about 50% over six years to 62%. The person didn't want to be identified because the agreement is tentative. Any wage increase would have to be approved by union members as part of the ratification of a final contract.

Talks now turn to the automation of ports, which the unions says will lead to fewer jobs, and other sticking points.

Industry analysts have said that for every day of a port strike it takes four to six days to recover. But they said a short strike of a few days probably wouldn't gum up the supply chain too badly.

The settlement pushes the strike and any potential shortages past the November presidential election, eliminating a potential liability for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee. It's also a big plus for the Biden-Harris administration, which has billed itself as the most union-friendly in American history. Shortages could have driven up prices and reignited inflation.

The union went on strike early Tuesday after its contract expired in a dispute over pay and the automation of tasks at 36 ports stretching from Maine to Texas. The strike came at the peak of the holiday season at the ports, which handle about half the cargo from ships coming into and out of the United States.

Most retailers had stocked up or shipped items early in anticipation of the strike.

""With the grace of God, and the goodwill of neighbors, it's gonna hold,"" President Joe Biden told reporters Thursday night after the agreement.

In a statement later, Biden applauded both sides ""for acting patriotically to reopen our ports and ensure the availability of critical supplies for Hurricane Helene recovery and rebuilding.""

Biden said that collective bargaining is ""critical to building a stronger economy from the middle out and the bottom up.""

The union's membership won't need to vote on the temporary suspension of the strike. Until Jan. 15, the workers will be covered under the old contract, which expired on Sept. 30.

The union had been demanding a 77% raise over six years, plus a complete ban on the use of automation at the ports, which members see as a threat to their jobs. Both sides also have been apart on the issues of pension contributions and the distribution of royalties paid on containers that are moved by workers.

Thomas Kohler, who teaches labor and employment law at Boston College, said the agreement to halt the strike means that the two sides are close to a final deal.

""I'm sure that if they weren't going anywhere they wouldn't have suspended (the strike),"" he said. ""They've got wages. They'll work out the language on automation, and I'm sure that what this really means is it gives the parties time to sit down and get exactly the language they can both live with.""

Kohler said the surprise end to the strike may catch railroads with cars, engines and crews out of position. But railroads are likely to work quickly to fix that.

Just before the strike had begun, the Maritime Alliance said both sides had moved off their original wage offers, a tentative sign of progress.

Thursday's deal came after Biden administration officials met with foreign-owned shipping companies before dawn on Zoom, according to a person briefed on the day's events who asked not to be identified because the talks were private. The White House wanted to increase pressure to settle, emphasizing the responsibility to reopen the ports to help with recovery from Hurricane Helene, the person said.

Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su told them she could get the union to the bargaining table to extend the contract if the carriers made a higher wage offer. Chief of Staff Jeff Zients told the carriers they had to make an offer by the end of the day so a manmade strike wouldn't worsen a natural disaster, the person said.

By midday the Maritime Alliance members agreed to a large increase, bringing about the agreement, according to the person.

Harris and Trump battle for labor support as dockworkers suspend strike,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-labor-michigan-georgia-dockworkers-98eee32bc975ed5bc284d3e0785e5d7b,2024-10-04T04:16:32Z,"DETROIT (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris will visit the union stronghold of Flint on Friday as she battles with Donald Trump for working-class voters who could tip the scales in this year's election.

Her appearance in the battleground state of Michigan comes the day after U.S. dockworkers suspended their strike in hopes of reaching a new contract, sparing the country a damaging episode of labor unrest that could have rattled the economy. A tentative agreement was reached to raise salaries, although other issues still need to be resolved.

Harris issued a statement saying the development ""indicates progress toward a strong contract and represents the power of collective bargaining."" She added that ""dockworkers deserve a fair share for their hard work getting essential goods out to communities across America.""

Unions have long been a bedrock of support for Democrats, but Harris has failed to secure some key endorsements. The International Association of Fire Fighters announced this week that it wouldn't back a candidate this year, following a similar announcement from the Teamsters. Both unions endorsed Joe Biden four years ago.

It's not a total cold shoulder for Harris. Some Teamsters locals are supporting her, and she won quick endorsements from national teachers unions, the building trades, the AFL-CIO and the United Auto Workers after replacing Biden at the top of the Democratic ticket.

But the divide within the labor community is a reminder of shifting loyalties in American politics. Democrats have increased their support among white-collar professionals while Republicans try to make inroads among voters who didn't attend college.

During a rally in Michigan on Thursday, Trump claimed that Republicans are now ""the party of the American worker,"" glossing over his anti-union record as president. In a reference to labor unrest at the country's ports, he insisted that ""under my leadership Americans won't have to go on strike for a better wage or a better life.""

Trump is heading to Georgia on Friday to appear with Gov. Brian Kemp, the latest sign that he's patched up his rocky relationship with the top Republican in a key battleground state. Later in the day, he's holding a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina.

Union voters have traditionally leaned toward Democrats, with 56% supporting Biden in 2020. But Trump has pushed hard to win over blue-collar workers traditionally represented by some of the biggest unions. He won 62% of white voters without college degrees -- though only 24% of non-white voters without college degrees -- in 2020.

It's frustrating for Democrats, who point to the White House's firm support for unions. Biden even joined a UAW picket line last year.

Lisa Anderson, 59, drove more than an hour from Green Bay in her green ""AFSCME for Harris-Walz"" shirt to hear the vice president speak Thursday in Wisconsin.

She's been an elementary school administrative assistant for 17 years, and she's confident that Harris' union support runs deep.

""I'm not worried about it,"" Anderson said. ""If you're voting for Trump, how can you believe in unions?"" AFSCME is the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees.

Labor relations could have been a dominant issue in the closing weeks of the presidential campaign if the dockworkers strike continued, leading to snarled ports and shortages on store shelves.

Biden expressed satisfaction that a deal was being worked out.

""We've been working hard on it,"" he said at the White House. ""With the grace of God, and the goodwill of neighbors, it's gonna hold."""
Assassination attempts and new threats have reshaped how Donald Trump campaigns,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-assassination-rallies-secret-service-iran-2c7fa3966e06b5d7e84c39d27cbc2159,2024-10-04T04:12:03Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Donald Trump was onstage at a rally on Long Island last month, talking about taxes, when he appeared momentarily spooked by something he'd spotted over his shoulder.

""I thought this was a wise guy coming up,"" he explained, joking that he was getting his elbow ready to fight back.

""You know I got a little bit of a yip problem here, right?"" he added to laughs, using a term familiar to golf aficionados to describe a phenomenon once blamed on performance anxiety where players suddenly lose the ability to make easy shots. ""I was all ready to start duking it out.""

It was a fleeting moment passed off as a joke. But as he returns to Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday for a rally at the site where a gunman opened fire in July, grazing his ear with a bullet, the scare underscores the lasting fallout for the candidate and his campaign even as much of the national attention has shifted to other crises.

Beyond the two attempts on his life in as many months, the former president and GOP nominee faces ongoing death threats from Iran, which has also been blamed for hacking top campaign officials and allies, exacerbating anxieties already heightened by a stepped-up security apparatus and new restrictions on how he can campaign.

Trump's allies insist he was not fundamentally changed by the gunman who fired from an unsecured roof at the rally in July or the would-be assailant in September who shoved a rifle barrel through the fence at his West Palm Beach golf course.

The picture of Trump standing, with blood streaked across his face, as he raised his fist and shouted ""Fight!"" has become the indelible image of the campaign.

""When you almost lose your life, it stays with you. It stays with him,"" said Florida Rep. Byron Donalds, a close Trump ally. ""But that doesn't change his resolve. His resolve is just as strong as it ever has been.""

Trump staffers are on edge. There have been death threats directed at his aides, and his team isn't as able to quickly organize the mass rallies that have always been the signature of his campaigns.

Armed security officers now stand guard at the campaign's Florida headquarters, and staff have been told to remain vigilant and alert.

Events have been canceled and moved around because the U.S. Secret Service lacked the resources to safely secure them. Even with the use of glass barricades to protect Trump onstage, there are concerns about holding additional rallies outdoors due to fears about drones.

Trump has accused President Joe Biden's administration of intentionally denying security resources to help Vice President Kamala Harris, his Democratic opponent, by preventing him from addressing large crowds.

""They couldn't give me any help. And I'm so angry about it because what they're doing is interfering in the election,"" he said in a recent Fox News interview.

U.S. Secret Service spokesperson Anthony Guglielmi said in a statement that Trump ""is receiving heightened levels of U.S. Secret Service protection"" and that ""our top priority is mitigating risks to ensure his continued safety at all times."" Biden expressed concern for Trump after both assassination attempts, saying in September, ""Thank God the president is OK.""

Trump also now travels with a larger security footprint, with new traffic restrictions outside his Mar-a-Lago home in Florida, and a line of dump trucks and big guns on display outside Trump Tower in New York when he's staying there.

As reporters filed into his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey, for a press conference this summer, guests -- including a little girl wearing a red, white and blue bathing suit -- were forced to exit their cars and go through airport-style metal detectors as their vehicles were searched for bombs.

Trump's campaign last week was briefed on continued threats from Iran in presumed retaliation for his administration's killing of Iranian Gen. Qassem Soleimani, an act that prompted Iran's leaders to vow revenge. In August, a Pakistani man alleged to have links to Iran was charged in a plot to carry out political assassinations on U.S. soil. Law enforcement did not name the targets of the alleged plot, but legal filings suggest Trump was a potential target.

Iranian hackers have also been charged with stealing information from Trump's campaign and trying to pass it along to news organizations. In May, prosecutors say, the men charged began trying to penetrate the Trump campaign, successfully breaking into the email accounts of campaign officials and other Trump allies. They then sought to ""weaponize"" the stolen campaign material by sending unsolicited emails to people associated with Biden's campaign. None of the recipients who worked for Biden responded.

The cyberattacks have forced some staff to change their email addresses and others to be wary of communicating online.

Trump already faced unprecedented legal jeopardy for a presidential candidate, with four criminal indictments -- one resulting in a felony conviction with sentencing delayed until after the election, one case dismissed, and two pending -- along with civil lawsuits that carry hundreds of millions of dollars in potential penalties.

""I think that from our perspective, just from the campaign standpoint, operationally, if there's one group of people that can handle something like this thrown in their lap, it's the team that Donald Trump assembled to run this campaign, just based on everything we've had to deal with, whether it's lawsuits to keep him off the ballot, to indictments, to assassination attempts,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Chris LaCivita said.

As for Trump, he speaks more often publicly of divine intervention, musing that God saved him in order to save the country. He also often says that assailants only go after consequential presidents.

""Obviously, when you come within a half an inch of a very different outcome, that's going to impact you,"" said New York Rep. Elise Stefanik, another ally who said she spoke to Trump the morning after the Butler shooting.

""Of course, those moments really make you consider a higher power, why you are so committed to helping save this country,"" she said. ""I think it has further empowered and energized President Trump.""

Trump was recently asked by NewsNation if he's concerned about his safety ahead of his return to Butler. ""Well, I'm always worried,"" he responded.

""I'm going back to Butler because I feel I have an obligation to go back to Butler. We never finished what we were supposed to do,"" he said. ""And I said that, when I was shot, I said, we're coming back. We're going to come back. And I'm fulfilling a promise; I'm fulfilling really an obligation.""

His most loyal supporters at his rallies, including the one on Long Island where he joked about the ""yips,"" haven't been dissuaded from seeing him in person.

""I know some people are scared to come, but I'm not,"" said Eileen Deighan, 63, a nurse from nearby Yonkers, New York, who said she was inspired by Trump's decision to keep on campaigning given the threats.

""The fact that he didn't give up, he's willing to fight for our country, how could you not support that?' she asked. ""That will that he has -- doesn't give up. It's very contagious.""

Trump told his supporters at a rally in Wisconsin on Saturday that he would continue fighting ""no matter what obstacles and dangers are thrown on our path."" But he had another point to make.

""I tell you what, I had a good life before I did this,"" he said. ""Nobody was shooting at me. I had a hell of a life.""

The September fundraising figure, which Trump's campaign released on Wednesday, is up from the $130 million he reported raising in August. It covers money raised by Trump's campaign and affiliated committees.

Vice President Kamala Harris, Trump's Democratic rival, has not yet released her fundraising numbers for the full month, but numbers previously released suggest she'll exceeded Trump's haul.

Harris aides have said she raised $55 million during a fundraising swing through California last weekend alone, which included stops in Los Angeles and San Francisco. The prior weekend, she raised $27 million at a packed New York City fundraiser, which was at the time her largest fundraising haul since she took over at the top of the ticket from President Joe Biden, according to a Harris campaign aide.

Trump has proven to be a prolific fundraiser, but the newness of Harris' bid has prompted a boost in cash from Democratic donors.

Though Harris has far more money than Trump, the former president is getting a boost from pricey advertising by deep-pocketed outside groups that support him

""These supporters have allowed us to bank the funds we need as we move into the campaign's final weeks,"" Brian Hughes, a Trump campaign senior adviser, said in a statement. ""Our momentum continues to grow from supporters and donors across the country as we enter the homestretch toward victory."""
"Melania Trump says she supports abortion rights, putting her at odds with the GOP",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/melania-trump-harris-abortion-election-2024-vance-walz-a9a44cf9d3113eb55e8c4346c7e1fe59,2024-10-03T18:10:42Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Melania Trump revealed her support for abortion rights Thursday ahead of the release of her upcoming memoir, exposing a stark contrast with her husband, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, on the crucial election issue.

In a video posted to her X account Thursday morning, the former first lady defended women's ""individual freedoms"" to do what they want with their body -- a position at odds with much of the Republican Party and her own husband, who has struggled to find a consistent message on abortion while wedged between anti-abortion supporters within his base and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights.

""Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard,"" she said in the video. ""Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom. What does 'my body, my choice' really mean?""

The video appears to confirm excerpts of her self-titled memoir reported by The Guardian on Wednesday.

Melania Trump has rarely publicly expressed her personal political views and has been largely absent from the campaign trail. But in her memoir, set to be released publicly next Tuesday, she argues that the decision to end a pregnancy should be left to a woman and her doctor, ""free from any intervention of pressure from the government,"" according to the published excerpts.

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?"" she wrote, according to The Guardian. ""A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.""

Melania Trump writes that she has ""carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

These views contrast sharply with the GOP's anti-abortion platform and with Donald Trump, who has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade and boasted about returning the abortion question to the states. Democrats have blamed the former president for the severe deterioration of reproductive rights as abortion bans were implemented in large swaths of the country following the overturning of the landmark case, which had granted a constitutional right to abortion.

Vice President Kamala Harris ' campaign noted Trump's role in ending Roe v. Wade in a statement reacting to Melania Trump's defense of abortion rights.

""Sadly for the women across America, Mrs. Trump's husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump Abortion Ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives,"" Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. ""Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear: If he wins in November, he will ban abortion nationwide, punish women, and restrict women's access to reproductive health care.""

Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would veto a federal abortion ban, the first time he has explicitly said so after previously refusing to answer questions on the subject. Abortion rights advocates are skeptical, however, saying Trump cannot be trusted not to restrict reproductive rights.

Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment Thursday about Melania Trump's book or video.

Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said the memoir is another example of ""the Trumps playing voters like a fiddle.""

""As president, (Trump) made it his mission to get Roe v. Wade overturned,"" she said in a statement. ""Melania stood by him, never once publicly disavowing his actions until weeks before an election where our bodies are again on the ballot and they are losing voters to this issue. Read between the lines.""

Democratic strategist Brittany Crampsie called the memoir's release a ""clear attempt to appeal to more moderate voters and to moderate JD Vance's very clearly extreme views on the issue."" But she is skeptical that the move would work in favor of Trump, saying his shifting views ""have already confused voters and sowed distrust.""

Melania Trump also defends abortions later in pregnancy, asserting that ""most abortions conducted during the later stages of pregnancy were the result of severe fetal abnormalities that probably would have led to the death or stillbirth of the child. Perhaps even the death of the mother.""

""These cases were extremely rare and typically occurred after several consultations between the woman and her doctor,"" she writes.

These views appear diametrically opposed to her husband, who has often parroted misinformation about abortions later in pregnancy, falsely claiming that Democrats support abortion ""after birth,"" though infanticide is outlawed in every state.

Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law who focuses on reproductive rights law and history, said it is unclear if the memoir's release so close to the election was an attempt to help Donald Trump. But she did note that Melania Trump's split from Trump on the issue is not uncommon historically.

There is ""a pretty deep history of first ladies being more supportive of abortion rights than their husbands,"" including Betty Ford, a vocal abortion rights supporter and the wife of former President Gerald Ford, Ziegler said.

Donald Trump promoted his wife's book at a September rally in New York, calling on supporters to ""go out and get her book."" It is unclear if the former president has read the book.

""Go out and buy it,"" he told the crowd. ""It's great. And if she says bad things about me, I'll call you all up, and I'll say, 'Don't buy it.'""

The Latest: Harris campaigns in Wisconsin and Trump in Michigan in battle for 'blue wall' states,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-cheney-wisconsin-trump-michigan-14918e156095e691246bd84d5346562b,2024-10-03T15:07:12Z,"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris is opening a two-day stay in Wisconsin and Michigan, and Republican candidate Donald Trump will be in Michigan on Thursday as the two candidates grapple for wins in the ""blue wall"" battleground states, which also include Pennsylvania.

Liz Cheney, one of Trump's fiercest Republican antagonists, will join Harris at a campaign event in Wisconsin on Thursday aimed at reaching out to moderate voters and rattling the former president.

Cheney was the top Republican on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021, insurrection, earning Trump's disdain and effectively exiling herself from her own party.

Cheney lost her Wyoming seat to a Trump-endorsed candidate two years ago and she endorsed Harris last month. The two women will appear together in a historic white schoolhouse in Ripon, where a series of meetings held in 1854 to oppose slavery's expansion led to the birth of the Republican Party.

Harris' visit to Wisconsin comes one day after a federal judge unsealed a 165-page court filing outlining prosecutors' case against Trump for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and obstruction.

Harris on Friday will hold a campaign rally in Flint, Michigan, continuing her tour of states that have been critical to Democratic victories. Trump won Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan in 2016, and Joe Biden won them in 2020.

Trump on Thursday will hold a rally in Saginaw County, a bellwether in the center of the state.

The Republican candidate has ramped up his focus on Michigan, holding two rallies there less than a week ago. In 2020, Biden's win in Saginaw County by a slim 303 votes contributed to his victory in the state.

President Joe Biden said Thursday that he wasn't concerned the 2024 presidential race between Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump was close

""It always gets this close,"" he said to reporters on the South Lawn of the White House on his way to visit storm-ravaged Georgia and Florida. ""She's gonna do fine,"" he said of his vice president.

Biden was also asked how Harris' running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz did in the vice presidential debate.

""The other guy lost the debate,"" Biden said. ""He misrepresented everything.""

The devastation wrought by Hurricane Helene has brought climate change to the forefront of the presidential campaign after the issue lingered on the margins for months.

Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Georgia Wednesday to see hard-hit areas, two days after her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, was in the state and criticized the federal response to the storm, which has killed at least 180 people. Thousands of people in the Carolinas still lack running water, cellphone service and electricity.

President Joe Biden toured some of the hardest-hit areas by helicopter on Wednesday. Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and other natural disasters, traveled to the Carolinas to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. He is expected to visit Georgia and Florida later this week."
Influential prophesizing pastors believe reelecting Trump is a win in the war of angels and demons,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/conservative-christians-spiritual-warfare-donald-trump-kamala-harris-9c861aa7c58907ff67bde3c3499a9365,2024-10-03T12:13:32Z,"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa (AP) -- Thousands sang, cheered and prayed as multiple preachers declared Donald Trump to be God's favored candidate to defeat what one called the ""forces of darkness.""

Headliners denounced Democrat Kamala Harris -- Trump's campaign rival -- as influenced by demons and the spirit of the wicked biblical queen Jezebel.

Attendees stood and recited in unison a ""Watchman Decree,"" invoking a government that honors God and has ""righteous"" laws and ""biblical"" judicial rulings. They pledged to ""take back and permanently control"" positions of leadership in sectors such as government, business and culture.

""We break every curse against Donald Trump -- we break every satanic incantation against his presidency,"" declared the host preacher, Hank Kunneman, at the annual Opening the Heavens conference, held in mid-September at the Mid-America Center arena in Council Bluffs.

The conference is one of several of its type around the country this election year, featuring exuberant worship and speeches by influential preachers. It represents a highly politicized wing of charismatic Christianity, a larger movement that emphasizes spiritual gifts such as healings, prophecy and speaking in tongues.

As a sign of this movement's influence, Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance appeared recently at a similar conference, called the Courage Tour, in Pennsylvania.

Goals for the conference included getting out the vote for Trump and his allies, and mobilizing believers to pray and take part in what's proclaimed to be a literal spiritual war surrounding the election.

""Get your butt out there and vote. Get your voice and raise it!"" declared Kunneman, who pastors Lord of Hosts Church in nearby Omaha, Nebraska, with his wife, Brenda. ""Let every devil fall. ... We push back any attempt to steal the executive office.""

The conference emerges from a movement that emphasizes authoritative direction from leaders considered to be modern-day apostles and prophets. It also incorporated Christian nationalism, a fusion of American and Christian identity.

Critics view the movement with alarm, seeing it as anti-democratic and supporting a candidate with authoritarian ambitions and incendiary rhetoric. Many of its leaders rallied behind Trump's claims that the 2020 election was stolen despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary.

""The attitude coming into 2024 is, 'The demons are probably going to try to steal this election again, and so we need to do spiritual warfare in advance to prevent that,'"" said Matthew Taylor, author of the new book on the movement, ""The Violent Take It By Force: The Christian Movement That Is Threatening Our Democracy.""

""It's very hard to have a pluralistic democracy,"" Taylor said, when many distrust the electoral system.

Several leaders in this movement were present at rallies in Washington protesting Biden's presidential victory before and on Jan. 6, 2021, said Taylor.

Leaders weren't among the Capitol rioters, but some issued decrees and prayers that the certification of Biden's win be blocked and Trump returned for a second term.

Such ideology ""is one of those golden threads"" in the social media feeds of many participants of the Jan. 6 rallies, said Taylor, Protestant scholar at the Baltimore-based Institute for Islamic, Christian, and Jewish Studies.

Headliners at the Council Bluffs conference repeatedly spoke of being in a true spiritual war, merging decrees of political victory and Christian revival.

The ""favor of the Lord"" is on Trump, said one preacher, Dutch Sheets. ""America is going to be saved, and I believe this election is a part of it.""

His brother and fellow preacher, Tim Sheets, recounted seeing a vision of a warrior angel firing an arrow that landed in front of the White House, claiming the territory for God.

""We must move into battle for the Lord,"" he said. ""The drums of spiritual war are beating.""

Preachers repeatedly denounced abortion -- one described it as an outpouring of blood craved by demons -- and the ""mutilation"" of children, as they depicted gender-affirming treatment for transgender youths.

The arena appeared a little more than half full, with thousands of attendees from multiple states. Many wore T-shirts with slogans like, ""Defender of Territory"" and ""We the People Trust Jesus,"" while several bundled up with American flag-themed fleece blankets amid chilly air conditioning.

Participants at the Council Bluffs conference, mostly but not exclusively white, aligned with the larger evangelical Christian support of Trump.

About 8 in 10 white evangelicals supported Trump in 2020, according to AP VoteCast. Pew Research Center's validated voter survey found similar support levels in 2016.

This year, about 7 in 10 white evangelical Protestants view the Republican nominee favorably, an AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research survey found.

Behind that supermajority is a diverse evangelicalism. The charismatic exuberance and focus on the supernatural contrast in tone with the relatively restrained approach of groups such as Southern Baptists, though they have allied in their political conservatism and opposition to abortion and LGBTQ+ rights.

And the charismatic movement has its own diversity. This heavily politicized branch teaches that in the present day, God has re-established the ancient biblical roles of apostle -- an authoritative leader -- and prophet, someone issuing divine proclamations.

The movement isn't a denomination. Churches and ministries largely operate independently, even as its leaders speak at each others' conferences, endorse each others' books and appear on each others' broadcasts.

As one example of the overlap: The Opening the Heavens conference in Council Bluffs featured one segment called FlashPoint Live -- an in-person version of a television show that mixes charismatic Christianity and conservative politics. It's one of several such FlashPoint Live conferences this year, hosted by pastor Gene Bailey -- whose recent interview with Trump demonstrated the close ties between the movement and the former president.

The ReAwaken America tour, started by Trump's former national security advisor Michael Flynn, has similarly blended the political with revival-like rallies and featured members of Trump's family.

While a range of evangelicals served as Trump's faith-based advisors during his administration, charismatic leaders were especially prominent.

The apostles-and-prophets movement overlaps with two related, popular ideas: dominionism, which says Christians are to be in charge of society, and the ""Seven Mountain Mandate,"" which specifies seven areas where Christians are to lead -- politics, religion, media, business, family, education and the arts and entertainment.

Bailey led in the reciting of the Watchman Decree at Council Bluffs, which included a pledge to ""permanently control positions of influence and leadership in each of the seven mountains.""

Bailey and Kunneman declined interview requests through a media representative.

Taylor said that according to this strand of charismatic theology, Holy Spirit-filled Christians have the power not just to ask God for results but to speak them into being.

""It's not just spouting off or praying prayers,"" he said. ""They believe that they are changing reality with these Watchman Decrees.""

He added: ""It looks wild when you encounter it, but it is very popular, and it's very dangerous.""

Separate from the Council Bluffs conference organizers, but with an overlapping cast of speakers, is the Courage Tour. It's led by Lance Wallnau, who popularized the Seven Mountain concept and was an early booster of Trump's 2016 candidacy.

The tour has been held in crucial battleground states, mixing worship, prayers for miraculous healings and overt politics -- including a call for Christians to become election workers or poll watchers to ""fight the fraud"" in swing states.

Taylor said this appears to lay groundwork for a campaign to delegitimize the 2024 election results if Harris wins.

While movement leaders speak of spiritual warfare -- that is, angel vs. demon rather than human vs. human -- Taylor said such rhetoric can stoke some people into taking matters into their own hands.

He said it's no surprise that some rioters at the Capitol in 2021 were loudly praying and displaying Christian symbols.

""I really do worry that we could see a lot more political violence,"" he said.

Republican Liz Cheney to join Kamala Harris at Wisconsin campaign stop,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-cheney-wisconsin-trump-89396853e5521c3870a3c88e04cbfd99,2024-10-03T09:09:24Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former congresswoman Liz Cheney, one of Donald Trump's fiercest Republican antagonists, will join Democrat Kamala Harris at a campaign event in Wisconsin on Thursday aimed at reaching out to moderate voters and rattling the GOP nominee.

Cheney was the top Republican on the House committee that investigated the Jan. 6, 2021 insurrection, earning Trump's disdain and effectively exiling herself from her own party.

Cheney lost her House seat to a Trump-endorsed candidate two years ago and she endorsed Harris, the Democratic nominee, last month. The two women will appear together in a historic white schoolhouse in Ripon, where a series of meetings held in 1854 to oppose slavery's expansion led to the birth of the Republican Party.

Harris is opening a two-day stay in Wisconsin and Michigan, and Trump himself will be in Michigan on Thursday as the two candidates grapple for wins in the so-called ""blue wall"" battleground states, which also include Pennsylvania.

Harris' visit to Wisconsin comes one day after a federal judge unsealed a 165-page court filing outlining prosecutors' case against Trump for his attempt to overturn his 2020 election defeat. Trump has pleaded not guilty to charges of conspiracy and obstruction.

It's uncommon, to say the least, for a candidate to give a nod to the origins of the opposing party in the closing weeks of a presidential campaign. Not only that, the Cheney name was once anathema to Democrats who deplored Dick Cheney, Liz's father, for his role as vice president under George W. Bush.

But now both Cheneys are backing Harris, part of a cadre of current and former Republican officials who have broken with the vast majority of their party, which remains in Trump's corner. Harris wants to portray her candidacy as a patriotic choice for independent and conservative voters who were disturbed by Trump's unwillingness to cede power. Trump continues to deny his defeat with false claims of voter fraud.

Harris on Friday will hold a campaign rally in Flint, Michigan, continuing her tour of so-called ""blue wall"" states that have been critical to Democratic victories in presidential races. Trump won Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan in 2016, and Joe Biden won them in 2020.

How Trump credits an immigration chart for saving his life  --  and what the chart is missing,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/immigration-trump-chart-butler-border-67866bd05a894a6bea0d670de2adc4f7,2024-10-03T04:23:46Z,"Ever since the assassination attempt at his rally in Pennsylvania, Donald Trump has professed a unique fondness for a bar chart he credits for saving his life.

Trump was addressing the crowd in Butler about illegal immigration and reviewing a chart that detailed U.S.-Mexico border crossings during his administration and President Joe Biden's term. He had his head turned to the right to review the graphic on a projection screen when the gunfire began. One bullet nicked his right ear, coming millimeters from maiming or killing him.

He has said having his head turned ""probably saved my life,"" adding at times that he loves the chart ""more than I even love the police"" and saying he will ""sleep with that chart for the rest of my life."" He has made it a recurring campaign prop and is likely to show it again when he returns to Butler on Saturday.

The chart helps the Republican presidential nominee connect an iconic moment from his 2024 campaign to his signature issue since he entered politics. It also is representative of how the Trump campaign has addressed immigration, making a strident argument for tougher border measures while erasing or misstating key parts of his record.

Here are more details about the chart and how Trump has used it along the campaign trail.

U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisc., said he was aboard Trump's plane in April to hitch a ride from an Easter family holiday in Florida to campaign events in the Midwest. While on the flight, Johnson showed Trump the chart, which depicts a dramatic increase in encounters with migrants at the southern border using statistics that are tallied by the U.S. Border Patrol.

Trump asked Johnson to send it to his communications team, which changed the title, description and edited some of the annotations, to begin rolling it out that same day at an event with law enforcement officers in Grand Rapids, Michigan. At that event, Trump referred to people in the U.S. illegally who are suspected of committing crimes as ""animals.""

""It's obvious what the Biden administration has done in that chart. It shows what Trump had to deal with and how he successfully dealt with it,"" Johnson said in an interview. ""And then it shows just the explosion of illegal immigration under President Biden and Vice President (Kamala) Harris.""

Border crossings hit record highs during the Biden administration but have fallen since Biden instituted a curb on asylum claims by executive order earlier this year.

The Harris campaign blames Trump for pressuring Republicans in Congress not to support a bipartisan border security package that Democrats say would have helped fix a broken immigration system.

The Border Patrol has tallied about 7.1 million arrests of people crossing illegally from Mexico from the start of the Biden administration through July, but many of those arrests were repeat crossers. Trump regularly hammers Biden and Harris for allowing record-high numbers, often claiming without evidence that the figure is upwards of 30 million.

The chart notes policies Trump instituted such as ""Remain in Mexico,"" a program that makes asylum seekers wait south of the border that Biden halted when he took office. The policies are intended to show Trump drove down border crossings during his term.

The description of the chart says ""Biden world record illegal immigrants, many from prisons and mental institutions,"" a claim Trump usually makes in rallies even though there is no evidence countries are sending their criminals or mentally ill across the border.

The graphic incorrectly identifies the month Trump left office, marking it as if it had happened during the spring of 2020, when the coronavirus pandemic prompted travel restrictions and vastly lowered the number of arrivals. Prior to the pandemic, the Trump administration struggled to manage large influxes of migrants, too.

U.S. Rep. Robert Garcia, a California Democrat, showed the chart recently at a hearing in Congress to point out this error.

""It's important to note and to point out how incorrect it actually is,"" he said, as he pointed out that border encounters had started to trend upwards in the months that followed and while Trump was still in office.

The chart also leaves out what perhaps was Trump's most controversial immigration policy. Between 2017 and 2018, border agents separated children from their parents at the U.S.-Mexico border in a policy that was condemned globally as inhumane and one that Trump himself halted under pressure from his own party.

Trump rarely talks about family separation. Last weekend, Trump claimed not to understand what Harris meant when she said he was responsible for taking children from their parents.

The former president has pledged to conduct the largest mass deportation operation, prioritizing migrants with criminal records. Trump has said he could rely on like-minded governors to provide National Guard support to carry out deportations.

The chart was displayed on numerous screens on stage during his Republican National Convention speech less than a week after the Butler rally.

""The last time I put up that chart, I never really got to look at it,"" he said. ""But without that chart, I would not be here today.""

Trump also took the chart on his recent border visit to Arizona, displaying it on a piece of paper as he spoke from a podium below a desert hill. He has been using it increasingly more since the assassination attempt, often retelling the story of how it saved his life.

Johnson says he is happy to have played ""a small little role.""

""Either the hand of God or just plain serendipity is why he avoided being assassinated, quite honestly,"" he said. ""That's just the historical fact now.""

He wouldn't say if Trump has mentioned anything about the chart to him since the assassination attempt. ""Those are private conversations,"" he said."
"Haunted by 2016, some Michigan Democrats worry that Harris remains ill-defined in swing state",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/michigan-democrats-harris-election-voters-46306c264cd27fa553eda0c2df55ced7,2024-10-03T04:23:26Z,"EASTPOINTE, Mich. (AP) -- Bill Clinton stood with Michigan Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell outside a suburban Detroit grocery store two days before the 2016 election when it was clear to both that Hillary Clinton would lose the state. ""They didn't listen to you,"" Dingell recalled the former president saying.

Democrats in the state have seemed ascendant since, controlling the governorship, both Senate seats and the state legislature. But some party leaders here are worried that trend is not enough to put distance between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. Harris' campaign is banking on the fact that they have spent considerably more money than Trump on ads and have a stronger voter outreach program.

Michigan is a state that Harris almost certainly must win to capture the White House, and Democrats' concerns are rooted in the fear that polls don't register all Trump supporters both here and in other battleground states as the campaign enters a critical final phase.

""Anyone who's from Michigan knows that, if you believe the polling, like, I got a bridge I'm going to sell you somewhere,"" said Michigan Rep. Elissa Slotkin, the Democratic Senate nominee.

Dingell and others have said Harris is still relatively new to many voters and that she needs to make her plans clearer to voters. The congresswoman also said Harris needed to counter efforts by Republicans to paint her as out of touch with Michigan workers.

The state of play today? ""No one is winning this state right now,"" Dingell said.

Patrick Schuh, a veteran Michigan Democratic campaign strategist now deputy national states director for the Democratic voter outreach group America Votes, said voters they have canvassed ""are still wanting to hear more about what Harris stands for as a candidate.""

In some ways, it is simply the worrying point in a campaign, and some Michigan Republicans have concerns that mirror Harris supporters, pointing to Harris' spending edge and lack of a get-out-the-vote effort directly from the Trump campaign.

Trump and allied groups have focused in this automotive manufacturing stronghold on the false claim that Harris ""wants to end all gas-powered cars,"" as one ad that began airing this week states.

As vice president, Harris was the tie-breaking vote for the Biden administration's 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, which includes $7,500 tax credits for new electric vehicle purchases.

In an ad airing in Detroit this week, Harris emphasized her biography as a former California attorney general and district attorney ""fighting on behalf of others.""

A complication for Harris has been opposition to the Biden administration's support for Israel in the war in the Middle East within metro Detroit, especially Dearborn, an area that is home to the nation's largest Arab American community. After months of ongoing discussions with Harris' team, communication with some Arab American leaders has stalled, according to Arab American News Publisher Osama Siblani, a prominent leader in the community. Phil Gordon, Harris' national security adviser, met virtually with some Arab and Muslim leaders on Wednesday to discuss the escalating war in the Middle East.

The death of a Dearborn resident, who Dingell and other community leaders this week said was killed in south Lebanon, has only ignited anger in the traditionally Democratic area. Kamel Ahmad Jawad's death was confirmed Wednesday by a spokesperson for the White House's National Security Council.

Harris may overcome divisions within the Democratic coalition by boosting voter turnout in Wayne County, home to Detroit, where low turnout in 2016 contributed to Clinton's loss. Black community leaders noted that excitement surged when Harris entered the race in the summer, and that some momentum continues in the majority-Black city of Eastpointe, just north of Detroit.

Canvassers knocking on doors there for Harris last week encountered several who were firmly committed to voting for her, though some undecided voters wanted to learn more.

""I just go off of what I see in the commercials, and Kamala just seems like she's more for the middle class,"" said Taneisha Stinson, a single mother for whom affordable child care is a top issue.

It's understandable for some Democrats to be nervous, given Michigan's recent narrow presidential election margins, said Amy Chapman, a Democratic strategist in Michigan. Trump won in 2016 by fewer than 11,000 votes. In 2020, Biden carried it by a little more than 154,000 votes, but only by 2.8 percentage points.

""If people are worried, they should be,"" said Chapman, who was Barack Obama's state campaign director in 2008. ""But, not in an 'oh no' way, rather in a we-have-to-work-hard way.""

Harris has not ignored pleas to compete aggressively in Michigan, as Hillary Clinton did in 2016 when she became the first Democrat to lose Michigan in 28 years.

Since entering the race on July 23, Harris' campaign and outside groups that support her candidacy have spent more than $79 million in advertising in Michigan, compared to Trump and groups supporting him which have spent more than $62 million, according to the media-tracking firm AdImpact. From Oct. 1 through Election Day, Harris and pro-Harris groups have reserved more than $40 million in Michigan ad spending, compared to $25 million for Trump's campaign and allied groups, according to the firm.

Harris' campaign also has 52 staffed campaign offices in Michigan, including three in Detroit, two in the Grand Rapids area, the state's second-largest metro area and two in vote-rich Oakland County, Detroit's more affluent northwest suburbs. Trump's campaign said they had dozens of offices across the state and in similar places.

""Democrats' financial resources absolutely dwarf anything that the Republicans have,"" said former Republican Michigan Gov. John Engler. ""But Trump is making stops in locations that have never had presidential visits before, and those are impactful with margins this close.""

Due, in part, to an abbreviated campaign, Harris has visited Michigan three times, with a fourth stop planned for Friday in Flint. In contrast, Trump has made 11 visits to the state, with a 12th planned Thursday in Saginaw. His stops have spread across various regions, while Harris' efforts have largely focused on the Detroit area.

Public polling, along with insights from campaign operatives in both major parties, indicates that neither candidate holds a clear advantage. On a call with donors this week, Slotkin said her campaign's polling showed Harris ""underwater"" in the state, a synonym for trailing. Her comments to donors were first reported by Axios.

Slotkin dismissed the term as ""just an expression that this is an exceptionally close race,"" when asked to clarify her remark.

Still, the scenario isn't what Democratic activist Lori Goldman expected after the party's enthusiasm spiked with Harris' July entry into the race.

""What did we see? Money coming in like crazy. Everybody was excited. There was such a bump,"" said Goldman, who founded Fems for Dems, a leading Michigan Democratic voter outreach group based in Oakland County. ""And now, you know, it's neck and neck.""

""It is PTSD,"" Goldman said.

Goldman was referring to what Dingell remembers as the outcome of her unheeded warnings in 2016. The Democratic nominee campaigned in Michigan only four times from June through the election. Instead, she focused more on Florida, Ohio, North Carolina and Pennsylvania, all of which she also lost.

Polls that showed Clinton ahead in Michigan, said Michigan Democratic strategist Adrian Hemond, as others did at the time, did not accurately reflect Trump's support in the state.

""Smart Democrats have a healthy sense of paranoia,"" Hemond said. ""If polling is as far off as it was in 2016, we're cooked."""
Human connections bring hope in North Carolina after devastation of Helene,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/helene-asheville-north-carolina-64fe5ca1b80f22fd2fd3b7c50b291d85,2024-10-03T04:23:00Z,"BLACK MOUNTAIN, N.C. (AP) -- Sarah Vekasi is a potter who runs a store in Black Mountain, North Carolina, called Sarah Sunshine Pottery, named after her normally bubbly personality. But these days she's struggling with the trauma of Hurricane Helene and uncertainty about the future of her business.

""All I can say is that I'm alive. I'm not doing great. I'm not doing good. But I'm extremely grateful to be alive, especially when so many are not,"" Vekasi said.

One thing that makes her feel a little better is the fellowship of the daily town meeting at the square.

""It's incredible being able to meet in person,"" said Vekasi, who was cut off by impassible roads for days. At Wednesday's session more than 150 people gathered as local leaders stood atop a picnic table shouting updates.

In the midst of the devastating destruction left by the deadliest hurricane to hit the mainland U.S. since Katrina, human connections are giving the survivors hope in western North Carolina. While government cargo planes brought food and water into the hardest-hit areas and rescue crews waded through creeks searching for survivors, those who made it through the storm, whose death toll has topped 180, were leaning on one another.

Martha Sullivan, also at the town meeting, was taking careful notes so she could share the information -- roads reopened, progress in getting power restored, work on trying to get water flowing again -- with others.

Sullivan, who has lived in Black Mountain for 43 years, said her children invited her to come to Charlotte after the storm, but she wants to stay in her community and look after her neighbors.

""I'm going to stay as long as I feel like I'm being useful,"" Sullivan said.

In remote mountain areas, helicopters hoisted the stranded to safety while search crews moved toppled trees so they could look door to door for survivors. In some places, homes teetered on hillsides and washed-out riverbanks.

Nearly a week after the storm, more than 1.1 million customers still had no power in the Carolinas and Georgia, where Helene struck after barreling over Florida's Gulf Coast as a Category 4 hurricane. Deaths have been reported in Florida, Georgia, Tennessee and Virginia, in addition to the Carolinas.

Robin Wynn lost power at her Asheville home early Friday and was able to grab a bag of canned goods and water before getting to a shelter despite water up to her knees.

""I didn't know where I was going, didn't know what was going to happen next. But I got out and I'm alive,"" Wynn said on Wednesday.

Now that she's back home, her neighbors have been watching out for one another. Plenty of people have come around to make sure everyone has a hot meal and water, she said.

Eric Williamson, who works at First Baptist Church in Hendersonville, normally makes home visits to members who can't physically get to church. This week, he's their lifeline, delivering food that meets dietary restrictions and tossing out food that had spoiled.

Beyond checking in on the essentials, he says it's important to just socialize with folks in a moment like this to help them know they aren't alone.

He has a handwritten list of everyone he needs to visit. ""They don't have telephone service, even if they have a landline, a lot of that isn't working,"" Williamson said. ""So we're bringing them food and water, but also just bringing them a smile and a prayer with them just to give them comfort.""

Volunteers in Asheville gathered on Wednesday before going out to help find people who have been unreachable because of phone and internet outages. They took along boxes of drinking water and instructions to return in person with their results.

Even notifying relatives of people who died in the storm has been difficult.

""That has been our challenge, quite honestly, is no cell service, no way to reach out to next of kin,"" said Avril Pinder, an official in Buncombe County where at least 61 people have died. ""We have a confirmed body count, but we don't have identifications on everyone or next-of-kin notifications.""

President Joe Biden flew over the devastation in North and South Carolina, getting a firsthand look at the mess left by a storm that now has killed at least 189 people.

Speaking afterwards in Raleigh, North Carolina, Biden praised the Democratic governor of North Carolina and the Republican governor of South Carolina for their responses to the storm, saying that in the wake of disasters, ""we put politics aside.""

""Our job is to help as many people as we can as quickly as we can and as thoroughly as we can,"" he said.

That includes a commitment from the federal government to foot the bill for debris removal and emergency protective measures for six months. The money will address the impacts of landslides and flooding and will cover costs of first responders, search and rescue teams, shelters, and mass feeding.

""We're not leaving until you're back on your feet completely,"" Biden said.

Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to neighboring Georgia, where she said the president had approved a request to pick up the tab for similar emergency aid there for three months.

Biden plans on traveling to disaster areas in Florida and Georgia on Thursday.

Employees at a plastics factory in rural Tennessee who kept working last week until water flooded their parking lot and power went out at the plant were among those killed. The floodwaters swept 11 workers away, and only five were rescued. Two are confirmed dead.

Tennessee state authorities said they are investigating the company that owns the factory after some employees said they weren't allowed to leave in time to avoid the storm's impact.

Hospitals and health care organizations in the Southeast mostly stayed open despite dealing with blackouts, wind damage, supply issues and flooding. Many hospitals halted elective procedures, while only a few closed completely.

In Florida, officials were turning to ""low-risk"" state prisoners to help clear the mountains of debris left behind.

""Department of Corrections, they do prison labor anyways. So they're bringing them to do debris removal,"" Gov. Ron DeSantis told reporters on Wednesday.

Vice President Kamala Harris traveled to Georgia Wednesday to see hard-hit areas, two days after her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, was in the state and criticized the federal response to the storm, which has killed at least 178 people. Thousands of people in the Carolinas still lack running water, cellphone service and electricity.

President Joe Biden toured some of the hardest-hit areas by helicopter on Wednesday. Biden, who has frequently been called on to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires, tropical storms and other natural disasters, traveled to the Carolinas to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. He is expected to visit Georgia and Florida later this week.

""Storms are getting stronger and stronger,"" Biden said after surveying damage near Asheville, North Carolina. At least 70 people died in the state.

""Nobody can deny the impact of the climate crisis any more,'' Biden said at a briefing in Raleigh, the state capital. ""They must be brain dead if they do.""

Harris, meanwhile, hugged and huddled with a family in hurricane-ravaged Augusta, Georgia.

""There is real pain and trauma that resulted because of this hurricane'' and its aftermath, Harris said outside a storm-damaged house with downed trees in the yard.

""We are here for the long haul,'' she added.

The focus on the storm -- and its link to climate change -- was notable after climate change was only lightly mentioned in two presidential debates this year. The candidates instead focused on abortion rights, the economy, immigration and other issues.

The hurricane featured prominently in Tuesday's vice presidential debate as Republican JD Vance and Democrat Tim Walz were asked about the storm and the larger issue of climate change.

Both men called the hurricane a tragedy and agreed on the need for a strong federal response. But it was Walz, the governor of Minnesota, who put the storm in the context of a warming climate.

""There's no doubt this thing roared onto the scene faster and stronger than anything we've seen,"" he said.

Bob Henson, a meteorologist and writer with Yale Climate Connections, said it was no surprise that Helene is pushing both the federal disaster response and human-caused climate change into the campaign conversation.

""Weather disasters are often overlooked as a factor in big elections,'' he said. ""Helene is a sprawling catastrophe, affecting millions of Americans. And it dovetails with several well-established links between hurricanes and climate change, including rapid intensification and intensified downpours.""

More than 40 trillion gallons of rain drenched the Southeast in the last week, an amount that if concentrated in North Carolina would cover the state in 3 1/2 feet of water. ""That's an astronomical amount of precipitation,"" said Ed Clark, head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's National Water Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama.

During Tuesday's debate, Walz credited Vance for past statements acknowledging that climate change is a problem. But he noted that Trump has called climate change ""a hoax"" and joked that rising seas ""would make more beachfront property to be able to invest in.''

Trump said in a speech Tuesday that ""the planet has actually gotten little bit cooler recently,"" adding: ""Climate change covers everything.""

In fact, summer 2024 sweltered to Earth's hottest on record, making it likely this year will end up as the warmest humanity has measured, according to the European climate service Copernicus. Global records were shattered just last year as human-caused climate change, with a temporary boost from an El Niño, keeps dialing up temperatures and extreme weather, scientists said.

Vance, an Ohio senator, said he and Trump support clean air, clean water and ""want the environment to be cleaner and safer."" However, during Trump's four years in office, he took a series of actions to roll back more than 100 environmental regulations.

Vance sidestepped a question about whether he agrees with Trump's statement that climate change is a hoax. ""What the president has said is that if the Democrats -- in particular Kamala Harris and her leadership -- really believe that climate change is serious, what they would be doing is more manufacturing and more energy production in the United States of America. And that's not what they're doing,"" he said.

""This idea that carbon (dioxide) emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. If you believe that, what would you want to do?"" Vance asked.

The answer, he said, is to ""produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.''

Vance claimed that policies by Biden and Harris actually help China, because many solar panels, lithium-ion batteries and other materials used in renewable energy and electric vehicles are made in China and imported to the United States.

Walz rebutted that claim, noting that the Inflation Reduction Act, the Democrats' signature climate law approved in 2022, includes the largest-ever investment in domestic clean energy production. The law, for which Harris cast the deciding vote, has created 200,000 jobs across the country, including in Ohio and Minnesota, Walz said. Vance was not in the Senate when the law was approved.

""We are producing more natural gas and more oil (in the United States) than we ever have,"" Walz said. ""We're also producing more clean energy.""

The comment echoed a remark by Harris in last month's presidential debate. The Biden-Harris administration has overseen ""the largest increase in domestic oil production in history because of an approach that recognizes that we cannot over rely on foreign oil,"" Harris said then.

While Biden rarely mentions it, domestic fossil fuel production under his administration is at an all-time high. Crude oil production averaged 12.9 million barrels a day last year, eclipsing a previous record set in 2019 under Trump, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

Democrats want to continue investments in renewable energy such as wind and solar power -- and not just because supporters of the Green New Deal want that, Walz said.

""My farmers know climate change is real. They've seen 500-year droughts, 500-year floods back to back. But what they're doing is adapting,'' he said.

""The solution for us is to continue to move forward, (accept) that climate change is real"" and reduce reliance on fossil fuels, Walz said, adding that the administration is doing exactly that.

""We are seeing us becoming an energy superpower for the future, not just the current'' time, he said.

"FACT FOCUS: Claims that more than 300,000 migrant children are missing lack context",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/fact-check-misinformation-migrant-children-missing-7ab0cea2fd2238346197429e952baa8b,2024-10-02T22:53:06Z,"Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, have recently claimed that hundreds of thousands of migrant children who crossed the U.S.-Mexico border unaccompanied are missing, then criticized the border policies of the Biden administration and Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican vice presidential nominee, repeated the claim during Tuesday night's debate.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" he said as he met Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz in what is likely the last debate of the 2024 presidential campaign.

But immigration experts say the claims regarding missing migrant children lack significant context.

Here's a closer look at the facts.

CLAIM: The Biden administration has lost more than 300,000 unaccompanied migrant children.

THE FACTS: This claim misrepresents information in an August report published by the Department of Homeland Security's Office of the Inspector General, which faulted Immigration and Customs Enforcement for failing to consistently ""monitor the location and status of unaccompanied migrant children"" once they are released from federal government custody.

The report noted that more than 291,000 unaccompanied migrant children had not, as of May 2024, received a notice to appear in court. Additionally, more than 32,000 unaccompanied migrant children got a notice to appear but then failed to show up for immigration court hearings. Those figures came from ICE and covered a period from October 2018 to September 2023. During that period there were a total of 448,820 unaccompanied children released by ICE to the Department of Health and Human Services' Office of Refugee Resettlement.

But experts say it is a stretch to refer to roughly 300,000 children as ""lost"" or ""missing.""

""This is not a 'missing kids' problem; it's a 'missing paperwork' problem,"" Jonathan Beier, associate director of research and evaluation for the Acacia Center for Justice's Unaccompanied Children Program, wrote in an email.

Plus, President Joe Biden only entered the White House partway through this period. It includes approximately 15 months when Trump was president and does not specify how many children arrived in the U.S. under each president.

Experts say there are many reasons why the children might not have appeared for hearings or received a notice to appear in the first place. For example, they only get a notice to appear when removal proceedings against them have begun, and if ICE hasn't started that removal process, they wouldn't have gotten a notice in the first place.

A lack of communication between government agencies could mean a notice is sent to the wrong address if it has been updated with one agency and not another. A child's guardian may be unable to take them to court, perhaps because they live on the other side of the state.

The report does not provide any explanations.

""All of these factors can explain some of the deficiencies and a conclusion that the children are missing could be very, very premature,"" said Raul Pinto, deputy legal director for transparency at the American Immigration Council.

Carmen Hills, an ICE spokesperson, said the agency agreed with the inspector general's recommendations to improve information sharing within ICE and externally with HHS, but disagreed with the suggestion that the children are missing.

""We are concerned that the report's findings are misleading and may be misconstrued because they fail to acknowledge key facts,"" she said.

Hills said ICE does not generally issue court notices to unaccompanied children ""until after they have been placed with sponsors who have been vetted by HHS"" so that they can get settled and seek legal help.

Representatives for HHS and Vance did not respond to requests for comment from The Associated Press.

An unaccompanied migrant child is defined by the U.S. government as someone who is under 18, lacks lawful immigration status and has no parent or guardian in the country to take custody of them. When they're apprehended by the Department of Homeland Security, they're transferred to the HHS's Office of Refugee Resettlement.

They are then placed ""in the least restrictive setting that is in the best interests of the child,"" according to the resettlement office. That can mean shelters, foster care or residential treatment centers, among other options. If possible, children are released to sponsors, often family members, who can care for them.

Removal proceedings may be initiated by ICE and the Department of Justice. Some children are able to stay in the U.S. legally if they qualify for asylum, special visas for victims of abuse, trafficking and other crimes, or other types of immigration relief. In those cases, removal proceedings may never start."
Mayorkas warns FEMA doesn't have enough funding to last through hurricane season,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-congress-fema-funding-5be4f18e00ce2b509d6830410cf2c1cb,2024-10-02T22:47:46Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Federal Emergency Management Agency can meet immediate needs but does not have enough funding to make it through the hurricane season, Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas told reporters Wednesday.

The agency is being stretched as it works with states to assess damage from Hurricane Helene and delivers meals, water, generators and other critical supplies. The storm struck Florida last week, then plowed through several states in the Southeast, flooding towns and killing more than 160 people.

Mayorkas was not specific about how much additional money the agency may need, but his remarks on Air Force One underscored concerns voiced by President Joe Biden and some lawmakers earlier this week that Congress may need to pass a supplemental spending bill this fall to help states with recovery efforts.

""We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. We are expecting another hurricane hitting,"" Mayorkas said. ""FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.""

Hurricane season runs June 1 to Nov. 30, but most hurricanes typically occur in September and October.

Congress recently replenished a key source of FEMA's response efforts, providing $20 billion for the agency's disaster relief fund as part of a short-term government spending bill to fund the government through Dec. 20. The bill also gave FEMA flexibility to draw on the money more quickly as needed.

Both chambers of Congress are scheduled, however, to be in their home states and districts until after the election, as lawmakers focus on campaigning.

House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., gave no hint he was considering changing that schedule during a speech Tuesday. He said that Congress just provided FEMA with the funds it needs to respond and that lawmakers would make sure those resources are appropriately allocated.

A bipartisan group of Senators from affected states wrote their leadership this week saying it's clear Congress must act to meet constituents' needs. They said that may even require Congress to come back in October, ahead of the election.

Mayorkas made his comments as Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris fanned out across the Southeast to witness the damage from the hurricane and seek to demonstrate commitment and competence in helping devastated communities. Biden is heading to North and South Carolina, while Harris is going to Georgia.

More than 150,000 households have registered for assistance with FEMA, and that number is expected to rise rapidly in the coming days, said Frank Matranga, an agency representative.

The devastation was especially severe in the Blue Ridge Mountains, where at least 57 people died in and around Asheville, North Carolina, a tourism haven known for its art galleries, breweries and outdoor activities.

""Communities were wiped off the map,"" North Carolina's governor, Roy Cooper, said at a news conference Tuesday."
JD Vance again refuses to say Donald Trump lost the 2020 presidential election,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jd-vance-2020-election-trump-biden-e9c1f285777a63eec251ed089a47c9e6,2024-10-02T22:06:02Z,"AUBURN HILLS, Mich. (AP) -- Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance on Wednesday again refused to say who he believed won the 2020 presidential election, which has been the persistent focus of false claims by his running mate, Donald Trump.

Vance, speaking in Michigan a day after debating Democrat vice presidential candidate Tim Walz, was asked about an exchange during Tuesday night's face off when he refused to acknowledge that Joe Biden won the presidential race four years ago.

""Well look, here's the simple reason: The media's obsessed with talking about the election of four years ago,"" Vance said. ""I'm focused on the election of 33 days from now because I want to throw Kamala Harris out of office and get back to common-sense economic policies.""

Vance then went on to speak about the need for secure elections and said he believes the 2024 election will be ""the safest and most secure election.""

Trump's denial of his 2020 election loss had been the fuel for much of his campaign and embracing it has been a key test of those hoping to have his support. His efforts to overturn his loss led to federal criminal charges, which he has pleaded not guilty, and a split with his past running mate, former Vice President Mike Pence.

Trump pressured Pence to overturn Biden's election win as he presided over the Jan. 6, 2021, ceremonial certification of the results. Pence refused, and when rioters stormed the Capitol, some chanted that they wanted to ""hang Mike Pence.""

On the debate stage Tuesday night, Walz brought up the pressure campaign against Pence, noting the reason that Vance was on stage instead of Walz."
Anti-abortion leaders undeterred as Trump for the first time says he'd veto a federal abortion ban,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-harris-vance-walz-debate-2024-election-abortion-64c739e99ffa1ad51b973e420e1fe92d,2024-10-02T20:55:36Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Anti-abortion leaders said Wednesday that they're undeterred after Donald Trump said he would veto a federal abortion ban, the first time he has explicitly said so after previously refusing to answer questions on the subject.

During Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, the Republican presidential nominee posted on his social media platform Truth Social that ""everyone knows I would not support a federal abortion ban, under any circumstances, and would, in fact, veto it.""

He then said that abortion rights should be left up to the states -- his most common response to questions about the issue since Roe v. Wade was overturned by a conservative majority that included three of Trump's own appointees to the Supreme Court. In the two years since the ruling, abortion rights have emerged as a major vulnerability for the GOP, which has struggled to find a consistent message on the path forward, while driving turnout for Democrats.

With the election less than five weeks away, Trump has been trying to thread a divide between his own base of anti-abortion supporters and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights. The former president is trying to make up ground with women -- a group that views Democratic nominee Kamala Harris more favorably nationally -- in the handful of battleground states that will likely determine the winner.

""Trump's statement last night is just one more example of Republicans trying desperately to rebrand themselves on the issue of abortion,"" said Ryan Stitzlein, vice president of political and government relations at the national abortion rights organization Reproductive Freedom for All. ""But at the end of the day, the only thing that has actually changed is their rhetoric on the issue. It's their reaction to seeing the political consequences for this deeply unpopular policy position.""

Major anti-abortion groups, while voicing disagreement with Trump, said they weren't discouraged by his latest comments on a national abortion ban.

Kristan Hawkins, president of the national anti-abortion Students for Life of America, said, ""There are differing approaches in the pro-life movement on how best to achieve our goal.""

""Donald Trump has his own strategy to get the federal government out of the business of abortion,"" she said. ""We might disagree with him about the long-term goals of our movement, but in the short term, we can work with that direction.""

Hawkins added that there are other avenues Trump could use to restrict abortion nationally, including through defunding Planned Parenthood and appointing anti-abortion officials to lead major federal departments.

Carol Tobias, president of the National Right to Life Committee, said she wasn't surprised by Trump's remarks.

""But quite frankly, unless something really unusual happens in this election, neither side is going to have the votes in Congress to pass a national law,"" she said. ""So that wasn't really at the top of our list anyway.""

Angela Vasquez-Giroux, vice president of communications for Planned Parenthood Votes, meanwhile, said she doesn't believe Trump's vow to veto a national abortion ban, calling him ""a legendary flip-flopper who says whatever he thinks helps him most in that moment."" She said that even without a national abortion ban, Trump would be able to restrict abortion across the country by appointing anti-abortion judges and federal officials or reviving the Comstock Act, a 19th-century ""anti-vice"" law that abortion rights advocates say could imperil access to medication abortion.

Trump had not previously said whether he would veto a national ban. In fact, he repeatedly declined to say if he would veto such a ban during September's presidential debate with Harris, although it is extremely unlikely that either political party would be able to win enough votes in Congress to pass national abortion legislation.

In August, Trump's running mate, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, said the former president would veto a national ban. But Trump demurred on the subject during the September debate, saying, ""I didn't discuss it with JD.""

The question has since lingered amid Trump's shifting stances on the crucial issue.

Trump senior adviser Jason Miller on Tuesday rejected the idea that Trump had changed his position on the matter.

""President Trump made clear, which he's said all along, it should be back in the states,"" he told reporters after the debate. ""Nothing changed. He's always said it should be back in the states.""

Vance falsely claimed during Tuesday's debate that he never supported a national ban himself, though he said in 2022 that he ""certainly would like abortion to be illegal nationally"" and supported Sen. Lindsey Graham's proposal to impose a national ban on abortion at 15 weeks of pregnancy. In 2023, he voiced support for a ""minimum national standard"" for abortion, including at 15 weeks of pregnancy.

Republicans have been accused of attempting to recast federal abortion restrictions as ""minimum national standards"" in order to distort their own stances on the issue amid the political unpopularity of the GOP's position on abortion.

""It doesn't matter what they call it,"" Vasquez-Giroux said. ""What matters is how it's going to impact everyone that we know and love and care about. If you call it a limit or a ban, it's the same thing, and everyday people will suffer.""

Around 6 in 10 Americans think their state should generally allow a person to obtain a legal abortion if they don't want to be pregnant for any reason, according to a July poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. Voters in seven states, including conservative-leaning Kentucky, Montana and Ohio, have either protected abortion rights or defeated attempts to restrict them in statewide votes over the past two years.

Harris' campaign, meanwhile, has maintained that Trump would sign a national abortion ban if reelected and blamed him for the abortion restrictions in swaths of the country since the overturning of Roe v. Wade, which once granted a constitutional right to abortion.

Trump has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade and boasted about returning the abortion question to the states. But voters don't have a direct say through citizen initiatives in about half of states, and in states that will have abortion on the ballot this year, anti-abortion groups and their Republican allies are using a wide array of strategies to counter proposed ballot initiatives.

UC says federal law prevents it from hiring undocumented students. A lawsuit seeks to change that,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/lawsuits-colleges-and-universities-legal-proceedings-gavin-newsom-california-cbc2143933bfe8feb6d222311b55b656,2024-10-02T16:34:53Z,"Members of the coalition that's been pushing to get the University of California to hire its undocumented students for campus jobs are now suing the university system, days after Gov. Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill that would have made such employment a reality.

The suit, filed Tuesday in the California Court of Appeals, argues that as a state agency, the UC has the legal authority to hire undocumented students. That legal theory builds on the argument legal scholars at UCLA debuted two years ago that said the long held view that no U.S. employer can hire undocumented immigrants due to a 1986 federal law doesn't apply to state employers. The suit says UC's policy is ""discriminatory"" and is asking the court to order UC to comply with state law, which would mean granting undocumented students the ability to work. The legal team behind the suit is asking the court to make a ruling by Nov. 30 -- the due date for UC admissions applications. The UC Board of Regents considered the advocates' legal theory for several months before rejecting the idea to make it system policy in January. A majority of regents were persuaded by UC President Michael Drake's arguments that hiring undocumented students could expose campus employers to civil or criminal litigation and put at risk the billions of dollars in federal contracts the system receives.

""The University of California has not been served with the filing,"" wrote UC spokesperson Ryan King, in an email Tuesday evening. ""When we are served, we will respond as appropriate.""

Without the ability to work, undocumented students struggle to raise the money needed to afford the full cost of their education, including housing. While undocumented students are eligible for state grants and tuition waivers, they're barred from accessing federal grants and loans. That pushes many undocumented students to find jobs under the table or in unsafe conditions, students and advocates have said. Students who rallied for the idea then paired with Assemblymember David Alvarez, a Democrat from Chula Vista, to create a state law that would allow all undocumented students attending a public college or university to be employed at their campuses. The Legislature passed the bill -- Assembly Bill 2586 -- but Newsom struck it down, echoing the UC's concerns. State Senate staffers for the judiciary committee said the legal arguments in favor of the bill were sound, largely swatting down UC's worries. Newsom also wrote in his veto message that the courts should weigh in on the matter before California adopts such a policy. ""So today, two brave leaders have taken up the governor's invitation,"" said Ahilan Arulanantham, at a press conference Tuesday afternoon. He's a UCLA legal scholar, one of the architects of the legal theory and also a lawyer for the petitioners in the case -- a former UCLA student and a UCLA lecturer. The suit argues that the UC is violating state law on fair employment by not hiring undocumented students. The basis for that argument is that the UC is not interpreting federal employment law in the way Arulanantham and some of the nation's top legal minds on immigration have put forward. The suit only applies to the UC, not the other public colleges and universities in California.

The basis for the legal theory is this: Because the federal 1986 immigration law does not specifically say that state employers are subject to the law, then they're not bound by the law. ""No court has ever interpreted (the 1986 federal law) the way the regents do,"" said Jessica Bansal, legal director of Organized Power in Numbers, a worker legal advocacy group. She's a lawyer representing the petitioners. ""To the contrary, the U.S. Supreme Court has consistently held that federal laws regulating hiring do not apply to state employers unless they clearly and unambiguously say they do."" It's possible Newsom vetoed the bill because immigration is a top -- and contentious -- campaign issue. Vetoing this and other bills gives fellow Democrat and nominee for president Kamala Harris cover against GOP attacks, some have argued. The former student suing the UC, Jeffry Umaña Muñoz, said at the press conference that he was ""forced to have a lesser educational experience than many of my peers."" He was a student leader in advocating for the change in policy last year and this. Munoz graduated from UCLA this year and is now a master's student at Cal State Los Angeles.

The president could invoke a 1947 law to try to suspend the dockworkers' strike. Here's how,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/port-strike-longshoremen-dockworkers-union-law-27c7eaa7b199fba1903a637eb6c7db0c,2024-10-02T16:33:22Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some manufacturers and retailers are urging President Joe Biden to invoke a 1947 law as a way to suspend a strike by 45,000 dockworkers that has shut down 36 U.S. ports from Maine to Texas.

At issue is Section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, better known as the Taft-Hartley Act. The law authorizes a president to seek a court order for an 80-day cooling-off period for companies and unions to try to resolve their differences.

Biden has said, though, that he won't intervene in the strike.

The law was introduced by two Republicans -- Sen. Robert Taft of Ohio and Rep. Fred Hartley Jr. of New Jersey -- in the aftermath of World War II. It followed a series of strikes in 1945 and 1946 by workers who demanded better pay and working conditions after the privations of wartime.

President Harry Truman opposed Taft-Hartley, but his veto was overridden by Congress.

In addition to authorizing a president to intervene in strikes, the law banned ""closed shops,"" which require employers to hire only union workers. The ban allowed workers to refuse to join a union.

Taft-Hartley also barred ""secondary boycotts,'' thereby making it illegal for unions to pressure neutral companies to stop doing business with an employer that was targeted in a strike.

It also required union leaders to sign affidavits declaring that they did not support the Communist Party.

The president can appoint a board of inquiry to review and write a report on the labor dispute -- and then direct the attorney general to ask a federal court to suspend a strike by workers or a lockout by management.

If the court issues an injunction, an 80-day cooling-off period would begin. During this period, management and unions must ""make every effort to adjust and settle their differences.''

Still, the law cannot actually force union members to accept a contract offer.

According to the Congressional Research Service, about half the time that presidents have invoked Section 206 of Taft-Hartley, the parties worked out their differences. But nine times, according to the research service, the workers went ahead with a strike.

President George W. Bush invoked Taft-Hartley in 2002 after 29 West Coast ports locked out members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union in a standoff. (The two sides ended up reaching a contract.)

Despite lobbying by the National Association of Manufacturers and the National Retail Federation, the president has maintained that he has no plans to try to suspend the dockworkers' strike against ports on the East and Gulf coasts.

William Brucher, a labor relations expert at Rutgers University, notes that Taft-Hartley injunctions are ""widely despised, if not universally despised, by labor unions in the United States.""

And Vice President Kamala Harris is relying on support from organized labor in her presidential campaign against Donald Trump.

If the longshoremen's strike drags on long enough and causes shortages that antagonize American consumers, pressure could grow on Biden to change course and intervene. But experts like Brucher suggest that most voters have already made up their minds and that the election outcome is ""really more about turnout"" now.

Which means, Brucher said, that ""Democrats really can't afford to alienate organized labor.""

Meanwhile, those new trials -- along with a dockworkers strike that threatens the U.S. economy -- are looming over the final weeks of the presidential campaign and could help shape the public mood as voters decide between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

Over the past four years, President Joe Biden has jetted off to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires and tropical storms. It's not a role Kamala Harris has played as vice president.

But on Wednesday, they'll both fan out across the Southeast to grapple with the damage from Hurricane Helene, seeking to demonstrate commitment and competence in helping devastated communities after Donald Trump's false claims about their administration's response. Biden is heading to North and South Carolina, while Harris is going to Georgia.

Harris' stop will also serve as a political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She's trying to step into the role for which Biden is best known -- showing the empathy Americans expect in times of tragedy -- in the closing stretch of her campaign for president.

Former President Donald Trump is going back to Butler, Pennsylvania, where the world saw him pump his fist and beseech followers to ""fight,"" even as blood streaked his face from a would-be assassin's bullet.

In announcing his return, the current Republican nominee said he planned to ""celebrate a unifying vision for America's future in an event like the world has never seen before.""

The question is: Is Butler ready?

While many are predicting a large crowd to hear Trump speak back at the very Farm Show property where a bullet grazed his right ear on July 13, there's also apprehension in town, along with a sense that Butler is still healing."
Fact-check fight: CBS News cuts candidates' mics after JD Vance objects to a moderator's correction,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-cbs-vance-walz-fact-check-639ceab0831b4c304fb132bcf254e48a,2024-10-02T04:41:25Z,"CBS News briefly cut off the microphones of vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz during an exchange in their debate Tuesday when the Republican objected to an attempt by moderator Margaret Brennan to correct something he said about immigration.

It was one of the evening's more contentious moments and reminded viewers again of the difficulty that the news outlets organizing debates this political season are facing in trying to point out in real time statements that are misleading or untrue.

After Vance had talked about illegal immigrants overwhelming some American cities like Springfield, Ohio, Brennan interjected that the Haitians that had moved to that city were there legally.

""Since you're fact-checking me, it's important to say what is actually going on,"" Vance said.

After briefly letting Vance speak, Brennan interrupted him and said it was time to move on to other issues. They spoke over each other, until CBS News muted the microphones of both Vance and Walz, who were appearing at a studio in New York City.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Brennan said.

Prior to the debate, CBS News had said it would be up to the two candidates -- not moderators Brennan and Norah O'Donnell -- to fact-check each other and the journalists would encourage them to do so. Vance said that it appeared CBS News was breaking the rules it had set down.

Fact-checking was an issue during last month's debate between presidential contenders Donald Trump and Kamala Harris after moderators corrected Trump at least four times, angering the former president and his supporters. When Trump debated President Joe Biden last spring, CNN moderators did not attempt any on-air corrections.

In an echo of what followed the ABC debate, Trump posted on his Truth Social site during Tuesday's debate that ""both young ladies have been extremely biased Anchors!""

At one other point Tuesday, wrapping up a discussion about climate change, O'Donnell said it was the overwhelming consensus of scientists that the planet was warming. Earlier, she had asked Vance whether or not he agreed with his running mate's comment that climate change was a hoax.

There were points at which the moderators sought to encourage the candidates to police each other. During a discussion about whether illegal migration was driving up housing costs, Brennan said to Walz, ""I do want to let you respond to the allegation that the vice president is letting in migrants.""

Yet it was a discussion about abortion that most illustrated the difficulties of that approach, and how there is no easy way during a live debate to make sure viewers are getting accurate information. Vance cited a provision in a Minnesota law, where Walz is governor.

""As I read Minnesota law, it says that a doctor that presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide life-saving care,"" Vance said.

Vance called that ""fundamentally barbaric,"" while Walz said his opponent's interpretation of the law was untrue.

What did the law actually say? That was unclear, and viewers were left to decide which candidate they wanted to believe. The CBS moderators cut to a commercial, unable or unwilling to clarify the question.

Throughout the debate, CBS News ran on its screen a message that viewers could log onto its ""CBS News Confirmed"" website to read about claims in the debate that were untrue or misleading. At some points, the network even showed a code that enabled viewers to instantly call up the information on their mobile phones. Yet those entreaties were not shown on the screens of other networks that simulcast the debate, which was produced by CBS.

The debate may have represented the last chance for viewers to see representatives of the two presidential campaigns duke it out onscreen. Harris has called for a second debate between her and Trump, but the Republican candidate has not accepted the challenge.

"Harris, Trump's approach to Mideast crisis, hurricane to test public mood in final weeks of campaign",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/harris-trump-mideast-dockworkers-hurricane-biden-a17bb5abe3c9bcfbea58a6ed17eb0ba6,2024-10-02T04:29:21Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A trio of new trials -- a devastating hurricane, expanding conflict in the Mideast and a dockworkers strike that threatens the U.S. economy -- are looming over the final weeks of the presidential campaign and could help shape the public mood as voters decide between Democrat Kamala Harris and Republican Donald Trump.

How events shake out -- and how the candidates respond -- could be decisive as they claw for votes in battleground states.

The sitting president, Joe Biden, is still the steward of a U.S. economy and foreign policy at this tumultuous moment and may well bear ultimate responsibility for how they play out. But how Harris and Trump approach the three disparate issues could have rippling impact on how Americans perceive their two choices this November.

""Unfortunately, there are going to be events like this, and this is where you see the leadership of a president show up,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre told reporters on Tuesday. ""I think this should send a message to Americans: It matters. It matters who sits behind the Resolute Desk.""

Harris, with Biden's help, is trying to display steady calm as a flurry of difficult problems arise all at once.

She and Biden on Tuesday toggled between directing Hurricane Helene recovery and rescue response work and huddling with aides in the White House Situation Room to watch as the U.S. helped Israel defend against a massive attack by Iran in retaliation for the killing of Tehran-backed leaders of Lebanese Hezbollah.

All the while, they were keeping close contact with economic advisers as dockworkers took to the picket line Tuesday, a walkout stretching from ports in Maine to Texas that threatens to snarl supply chains and cause shortages and higher prices if it stretches on for more than a few weeks.

Trump, for his part, lashed out at Harris as in over her head, while claiming that this sort of crush of problems never would have happened under his watch.

""We have been talking about World War III, and I don't want to make predictions,"" Trump said at a campaign event in Wisconsin. ""The whole world is laughing at us. That's why Israel was under attack just a little while ago. Because they don't respect our country anymore.""

Yet voters cast Trump aside four years ago in large part because of how they viewed his handling of the swirling economic, social and public health challenges that emerged from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Biden, in comments to reporters before meeting with aides Tuesday to discuss the ongoing hurricane response, seemed to acknowledge the growing frustration with the federal response to the massive storm.

""I've been in frequent contact with the governors and other leaders in the impacted areas, and we have to jumpstart this recovery process,"" Biden said. He will travel to the Carolinas on Wednesday to get a closer look at the hurricane devastation. He is also expected to visit hurricane-impacted areas in Georgia and Florida later this week. ""People are scared to death. People wonder whether they're going to make it.""

Harris, meanwhile, is headed to Georgia on Wednesday and North Carolina in the coming days to do the same.

Tuesday's vice presidential debate offered a sampling of how the two campaigns were reacting to new developments to bolster their own messages and sharpen their attacks on their rivals. Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz promised ""steady leadership"" under Harris while Ohio Sen. JD Vance pledged a return to ""peace through strength"" if Trump is returned to the White House.

Biden has stayed off the campaign trail since announcing in July that he was ending his reelection effort amid sliding public approval ratings.

His conspicuous absence underscores that Democrats see him as more of a liability than an asset in making the case for Harris, said Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion in Pennsylvania.

But how well Biden deals with the three latest emergency situations could have a big impact in how undecided voters perceive Harris in these final days.

""President Biden can't help Kamala Harris on the stump,"" Borick said. ""But in a campaign where you are turning over every rock in a few states to get that undecided voter, how he manages these crises over the next several weeks could have an impact.""

The Harris campaign understands the risks it faces with multiple crises converging all at once, especially given their varied and unpredictable nature. A prolonged strike, a bungled disaster response or a further expansion of Middle East conflict could raise doubts about Biden's leadership, and by extension that of his second-in-command.

At the same time, Harris campaign aides believe the perilous moment presents an opportunity to demonstrate to voters the stakes of who's in the job and the seriousness with which they approach it, according to campaign officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal thinking.

The former president, in a speech in Waunakee, Wisconsin, and in social media postings Tuesday, offered a mixture of prayer and concern for those impacted by Helene, jabs at Harris for the dockworkers strike, and an aside about the casting of Stanley Kubrick's film ""Full Metal Jacket.""

""The situation should have never come to this and, had I been president, it would not have,"" Trump said in a statement about the strike.

Harris aides made a point of having the vice president deliver brief remarks on the Iranian attack Tuesday in between taping interviews for her campaign, aiming to portray her as ready to take command.

Late-term tumult has been fixture in American presidential politics, sometimes in the form of scandal and other times with an incumbent hoping to demonstrate that he or his preferred successor would be a steady head at an uncertain time.

George W. Bush pushed a rescue package through Congress to stabilize a reeling financial system by creating the Troubled Asset Relief Program amid fears that the economy was on the verge of collapse. The broader economic conditions didn't help Republican John McCain in the race he lost to Barack Obama.

Jimmy Carter's reelection campaign in 1980 was paralyzed by the Iran hostage crisis. Fifty-two hostages were released on January 20, 1981, soon after his successor, Ronald Reagan, was inaugurated.

Lyndon Johnson announced a halting of bombings in North Vietnam days before the 1968 election, a step he hoped would bring the conflict toward a peace settlement. But the South Vietnamese indicated they would not negotiate and Johnson's vice president, Hubert Humphrey, lost narrowly to Republican Richard Nixon.

""The efforts by incumbents to help themselves or their party's nominee with 'October surprises' go back quite a ways,"" said Edward Frantz, a University of Indianapolis historian. ""In this current climate, I'm not sure how many voters can be persuaded by a candidate this late in the game trying to show competency.""

Harris and Biden are fanning out across the Southeast as devastation from Helene grows,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/biden-harris-hurricane-helene-survey-damage-48baf62af5560a9617ae2032f8776d1e,2024-10-02T04:28:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Over the last four years, President Joe Biden has jetted off to survey damage and console victims after tornadoes, wildfires and tropical storms. It's not a role that Kamala Harris has played as vice president.

But on Wednesday, they will both fan out across the Southeast to grapple with the damage from Hurricane Helene, seeking to demonstrate commitment and competence in helping devastated communities after Donald Trump's false attacks on their administration's response. Biden is heading to North and South Carolina, while Harris is going to Georgia.

Harris' stop will also serve as a political test in the midst of a humanitarian crisis. She's trying to step into the role for which Biden is best known -- showing the empathy that Americans expect in times of tragedy -- in the closing stretch of her campaign for president.

She last visited scenes of natural disasters as a U.S. senator from California, including when she went to Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria in 2017 and when she walked through charred wreckage in Paradise, California, after the Camp Fire in 2018.

Trump, the Republican nominee, traveled to Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday with a Christian charity organization that brought trucks of fuel, food, water and other supplies.

After arriving, Trump accused Biden of ""sleeping"" and not responding to calls from Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp. However, Kemp had spoken with Biden the previous day, and the governor said the state was getting everything it needed.

Biden was infuriated by Trump's claim on Monday, snapping that Trump was ""lying, and the governor told him he was lying.""

On Tuesday, the president said he has directed administration officials to ""send every available resource"" to communities harmed by Helene. The death toll approached 160 people, and power and cellular service remains unavailable in some places.

""We have to jumpstart this recovery process,"" he said. ""People are scared to death. This is urgent.""

Trump claimed without evidence that Democratic leaders were withholding help from Republican areas, an accusation that better describes his own approach to disaster relief. He recently threatened that he would withhold wildfire assistance from California because of disagreements with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom.

When Trump was president, Puerto Rico was devastated by Hurricane Maria, which killed 3,000 people. His administration waited until the fall of 2020, just weeks before the presidential election, to release $13 billion in assistance for Puerto Rico's recovery. A federal government watchdog also found that Trump administration officials hampered an investigation into delays in the aid delivery.

And during a visit there, he was criticized for tossing paper towel rolls to survivors at a relief center. The gesture seemed to go over well in the room but was widely panned as insensitive to those who were suffering. He also questioned whether the death toll was accurate, claiming it rose ""like magic.""

Harris visited Puerto Rico after Maria as part of a bipartisan delegation.

""When disaster hits anywhere in America, our government has a basic responsibility to commit the resources necessary to save lives, accurately assess damage, and rebuild communities,"" she wrote on Twitter in 2018. ""We now know that after Hurricane Maria, our government failed Puerto Rico at every level.""

Last month, on the seventh anniversary of Maria, Harris recalled speaking with Puerto Ricans who had lost businesses and homes.

""They didn't need paper towels thrown at them -- they needed real help and partnership,"" she said."
FACT FOCUS: A look at false and misleading claims during the vice presidential debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-walz-vance-misinformation-fact-check-a3f67b1fdef425038dfac9267861247c,2024-10-02T04:13:45Z,"The vice presidential candidates, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance, on Tuesday engaged in a fast-moving, largely civil debate on a wide range of issues. Here's a look at some false and misleading claims from the debate.

___

VANCE: ""Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration. What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies.""

THE FACTS: The Biden administration agreed last year to unfreeze $6 billion in Iranian assets as part of a deal to free five U.S. citizens being held by Iran. But administration officials say not a dollar of that has yet been given to Iran. It was part of a deal negotiated by the Obama administration, before Biden and Harris took office, that could have allowed Iran to access frozen assets in exchange for accepting limits on its nuclear program.

In 2016, Iran said it had received access to more than $100 billion worth of frozen overseas assets following the implementation of a landmark nuclear deal with world powers. The money had been held in banks in China, India, Japan, South Korea and Turkey since international sanctions were tightened in 2012 over Tehran's nuclear program. Then-Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew told Congress that only about $50 billion of the frozen assets would actually be accessible by Iran.

WALZ: ""They were charging $800 before this law went into effect.""

THE FACTS: Walz overstated how much Americans were paying for insulin before a new law capped prices at $35 per month for millions of older Americans on Medicare. A December 2022 study found that people who were on Medicare or enrolled in private insurance paid $452 yearly on average before the new law took effect.

VANCE: ""You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.""

THE FACTS: Most economists blame a long-term decline in the housing supply for the steady increase in home prices. The number of new homes under construction plunged from an annual pace of 1.4 million in April 2006 to barely above 400,000 in August 2011, and didn't recover to 2006 levels until 2021.

Vance said at least one prominent economic analysis from the Federal Reserve supports his claims that immigrants are pushing up housing costs, but he didn't provide details. He was likely citing a May 2024 blog post by Neel Kashkari, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis. Kashkari says immigration's long-run effect on inflation is ""unclear,"" but immigrants need a place to live and their arrival has overlapped with higher prices.

There might be upward pressure on home prices in some markets because of immigrants arriving, but most economists say the issue is a lack of supply of homes on the market. Homebuilders say they need the immigrants to build the homes. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a September news conference that high mortgage rates mean people aren't listing their homes for sale and there has not been enough supply.

WALZ: ""Their Project 2025 is going to have a registry of pregnancies.""

THE FACTS: That's not true. The conservative initiative calls for the collection of ""accurate and reliable statistical data about abortion, abortion survivors, and abortion-related maternal deaths,"" but not a record of every pregnancy that occurs.

More specifically, Project 2025 proposes that the Department of Health and Human Services require all states to report detailed information about abortions that are performed within their borders, including the total number of abortions, the age and state of residence of the mother, the gestational age of the fetus, the reason for the abortion and the method used to perform the abortion. It suggests that this data be separated into categories such as spontaneous miscarriages, intentional abortions, stillbirths and other medical treatments that result in the death of the fetus, like chemotherapy.

VANCE: ""We've got 20, 25 million illegal aliens who are here in the country.""

THE FACTS: That figure is highly inflated. U.S. Customs and Border Protection reports more than 10 million arrests for illegal crossings from Mexico from January 2021 through September 2024.

That's arrests, not people. Under pandemic-era asylum restrictions, many people crossed more than once until they succeeded because there were no legal consequences for getting turned back to Mexico. So the number of people is lower than the number of arrests.

According to the Department of Homeland Security's latest available estimate, there were approximately 11 million people living illegally in the U.S. as of January 2022, 79% of whom entered prior to January 2010.

VANCE: ""It says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late-term abortion.""

THE FACTS: This claim misrepresents a bill Walz signed into law in 2023, updating language about the care of newborns.

The new language uses the phrase ""an infant who is born alive"" instead of ""a born alive infant as a result of an abortion."" It states that medical personnel are required to ""care for the infant who is born alive"" rather than ""preserve the life and health of the born alive infant.""

Both the current version of the law and the 2015 version that was amended state that ""an infant who is born alive shall be fully recognized as a human person, and accorded immediate protection under the law.""

Infanticide is criminalized in every state, including Minnesota, and the bill does not change that.

VANCE: ""Remember he said that on January the 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully.""

THE FACTS: It's true that Trump told the crowd gathered near the White House, ""I know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the Capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard.""

But Vance ignored the incendiary language Trump used throughout his speech, during which he urged the crowd to march to the Capitol, where Congress was meeting to certify President Joe Biden's victory. Trump told the crowd: ""If you don't fight like hell, you're not going to have a country anymore."" That's after his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, declared: ""Let's have trial by combat.""

Pennsylvania town grapples with Trump assassination attempt ahead of his return,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-butler-assassination-attempt-54f385fbdac215b89c6df047fa399039,2024-10-02T04:13:36Z,"BUTLER, Pa. (AP) -- Donald Trump is going back to Butler, where the world last saw him pump his fist and beseech followers to ""fight,"" even as blood streaked his face from a would-be assassin's bullet.

In announcing his return, the former president and current Republican nominee said he planned to ""celebrate a unifying vision for America's future in an event like the world has never seen before.""

The question is: Is Butler ready?

While many are predicting a large crowd to hear Trump speak back at the very Farm Show property where a bullet grazed his right ear on July 13, there is also apprehension in town, along with a sense that Butler is still healing.

""I've consulted with, at least, like 500 people since this has happened,"" said registered nurse Shanea Clancy, who runs a mental health consulting service in Butler County and has seen people more anxious since the shooting. Some show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder.

""The big theme, if you will, is just, 'How did something like that happen in our backyard?'"" Clancy said. ""People don't expect trauma to show up at their door on any given day.""

The assassination attempt has resonated deeply in the mountainous community north of Pittsburgh. Trump enjoys wide support there, having easily doubled Hillary Clinton's vote total on his way to winning the White House in 2016. He nearly did so again against Joe Biden in 2020. But Butler County was better for Democrats two years ago, when the party's gubernatorial nominee, Josh Shapiro, took about 43% of the vote there.

To claim the pivotal swing state of Pennsylvania in November, Trump needs to drive up voter turnout in conservative strongholds like Butler County, an overwhelmingly white, rural-suburban community with a record of voting for Republicans.

On Saturday, the former president will speak where thousands of people, including children, witnessed him and the others get shot. Former Buffalo Township Fire Company Chief Corey Comperatore was killed, while David Dutch and James Copenhaver were both hospitalized with injuries. U.S. Secret Service killed the gunman, 20-year-old Thomas Matthew Crooks.

Stunned in the aftermath, some rally goers held impromptu prayer groups as they walked back to their cars. It seems just about everyone in Butler County was either at the rally or knows someone who was.

Last weekend, retired food service worker Sally Sarvey was picking up Trump signs and a T-shirt from a Republican Party tent at a street festival in nearby Slippery Rock. She said she will ""make it a point"" to witness Trump's return this Saturday, but she's mindful of what happened in July.

""Hopefully they'll have more security that acts faster,"" Sarvey said.

There are visible signs of the tension left behind. ""Fight"" graffiti -- echoing Trump's words in the immediate aftermath of the shooting -- began showing up around Butler County in the ensuing two weeks. In some places, the word ""fight"" on roadways was countered by another spray painted message: ""love.""

The assassination attempt has been the ""No. 1 topic"" of conversation since July 13, said Jim Hulings, chairman of the Butler County Republican Committee. He has so many lingering questions about the shooting and consequent investigations that he keeps a running list.

""There's a lot of activity going on right now, people wanting answers,"" Hulings said. ""I am not in a minority there at all. There's a lot of people asking questions.""

Police and emergency officials have faced questions from investigators looking into the shootings from the state police, FBI and Congress. The county government has fielded some 300 open records requests, five times what it normally gets in a year. Many are bracing for litigation that could extend for years.

""I'm not going to lie -- it's a burden on all of us,"" said Butler Emergency Services Director Steve Bicehouse. ""It wears on you. And it's been a trying time the last several months.""

County Commissioner Kevin Boozel, the only Democrat holding countywide elected office in Butler, said what happened two months ago has some concerned about Saturday's rally. The previous security failure is the major issue, but authorities at the July event also contended with extreme heat and humidity that kept emergency responders busy treating people in distress even before the shooting. Several people required hospital treatment.

Boozel has fielded ""plenty of emails saying, 'Don't let him back here,'"" he said of Trump. ""Because emotionally, we're not ready for that.""

Retired librarian Kathy Kline, who lives in Butler, said she supports Vice President Kamala Harris in the presidential race and feels there has been insufficient consideration for those who oppose Trump returning. Kline belongs to a Facebook group, ""Butler PA Women for Kamala Harris,"" that's grown to some 1,500 members in recent months.

""I personally am never opposed to any political figure coming into our community and sharing their policies,"" Kline said. ""That's the American way. But you know, you need to come in with some respect and integrity and leave all of that chaos and ugliness out of it.""

Barry Cummings' coffee shop near the Farm Show property where the shooting occurred was closed briefly after the shooting. In the immediate aftermath, he said, he was determined to reach out to people who don't share his political views.

""I tended to try to listen more than speak,"" said Cummings, a registered Democrat. He wanted to hear ""the feelings on the other side, you know, and I think that brought us a little closer together.""

Kim Geyer, a Republican Butler County commissioner, plans to attend the rally Saturday, just as she did in July when she sat behind Trump.

""I kind of have mixed feelings about it, but I'm resolved to moving forward,"" Geyer said. ""I think that the people that may be affected more negatively are going to just stay home. And the people that want to feel the inspiration and the energy from the Trump movement are going to attend to support President Trump and let him finish what he began.""

Some Trump supporters have been looking for ways to memorialize the attempted assassination. One artist is working on a 9-foot-high sculpture of Trump in Butler, although it's unclear where it might be installed. Another artist, Butler metal worker and Trump supporter Bill Secunda, spent two weeks reworking an existing life-sized Trump sculpture to better reflect his response after being shot, with his right arm raised and fist clenched.

Secunda and a friend quietly installed it in a tent at the Butler Farm Show in August, where it became popular for selfies. He's already had a $50,000 offer for the sculpture.

""I don't even think I saw a sour look, which was kind of surprising because, you know, I've lost customers over doing a piece like that,"" Secunda said.

Meanwhile, the Butler Historical Society has put on hold until spring, at least, its plans to collect local residents' stories about the shooting. The organization is looking into how it would keep the stories sealed for 75 years, as had been the plan.

Geyer said she expects Butlerites will find more ways to pay tribute to the victims.

""It was a tragic day and nobody wishes it happened or occurred in their county,"" Geyer said. ""I believe that the people who live and work here are resilient people. We're going to move forward."""
Some of the most notable quotes from the JD Vance-Tim Walz vice presidential debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/vance-walz-debate-cbs-quotes-94e552d1a7100225a0003db618351601,2024-10-02T04:09:09Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The first and only vice presidential debate between Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz featured an often orderly, policy-focused and even civil dialogue between the two men seeking to serve as the next president's second in command.

One of the sharpest comments came from a debate moderator. Here are some of the most notable quotes from the debate:

-- CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan, who intervened after a tense back and forth between the candidates over immigration. Vance protested a clarification by a moderator about the legal status of Haitian immigrants in Springfield, Ohio. ""Since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said before both he and Walz's exchanges were muted.

-- Walz, agreeing with Vance that some regulations limit the construction of new housing units. Both candidates throughout the debate expressed agreement on some points before driving home their own messages.

-- Vance, after Walz noted his son had witnessed gun violence. ""I appreciate that,"" Walz replied.

-- Walz, when discussing discrepancies in his travel history to Hong Kong in 1989 that have been reported by multiple news organizations.

-- Vance, arguing Harris could have acted as vice president to make housing more affordable. ""If Kamala Harris has such great plans for how to address middle class problems, she ought to do them now,"" Vance also said during the debate.

-- Walz, when discussing Vance's unfounded claims about immigrant communities in Springfield, Ohio. Walz said Vance ""will create stories to bring attention to this that vilified a large number of people who were here legally in the community of Springfield. The Republican governor said, it's not true. Don't do it.""

-- Walz, discussing the high rate of gun violence in the United States compared to other rich nations. Walz cautioned against using mental illness as a ""scapegoat"" for the country's high levels of gun violence rather than ""find solutions on this that protect the Second Amendment, protect our children, that settlement.""

- Walz, noting that he is a longtime gunowner and the need to address firearm deaths by suicide and violent crime.

-- Vance, responding to how Republicans should navigate potentially unpopular and dangerous realities that face women surrounding pregnancy. Vance, who opposes abortion, said Republicans ""have got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they, frankly, just don't trust us.""

-- Walz, criticizing Trump's record on abortion. Walz said Trump ""bragged"" about appointing three Supreme Court justices who would go on to join a majority ruling that overturned the abortion protections in Roe v. Wade. ""52 years of personal autonomy and then he tells us 'Oh, send it to the states,'"" Walz said of Trump.

-- Walz, discussing the riot at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021. Walz said Trump's rhetoric and refusal to concede defeat in the 2020 presidential election led to the riot at the U.S. Capitol and deep ensuing divisions across politics. ""All of us say there's no place for this,"" Walz said.

-- Vance, when asked whether Trump won the 2020 presidential election and if he would support efforts to contest the election which Trump carried out that have since been deemed illegal or unconstitutional. ""First of all, I think that we're focused on the future,"" Vance said. ""But what President Trump has said is that there were problems in 2020, and my own belief is that we should fight about those issues, debate those issues peacefully in the public square."""
Vance and Walz focus their attacks on the top of the ticket  --  not each other: VP debate takeaways,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/debate-takeaways-vance-walz-harris-trump-5b6f219b555416ff579764048ac238a1,2024-10-02T02:25:01Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice Presidential hopefuls Tim Walz and JD Vance squared off Tuesday night in what may be the last debate of the 2024 presidential campaign. It was the first encounter between Minnesota's Democratic governor and Ohio's Republican senator, following last month's debate between the tops of their tickets, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.

No more debates are on the political calendar before Election Day. Tuesday's confrontation came as the global stakes of the contest rose again as Iran fired missiles at Israel. The vice presidential hopefuls sparred over the violence in the Middle East, climate change and immigration. Here are some takeaways from Tuesday's debate.

Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel on Tuesday elicited a contrast between the Democratic and Republican tickets on foreign policy: Walz promised ""steady leadership"" under Harris while Vance pledged a return to ""peace through strength"" if Trump is returned to the White House.

The differing visions of what American leadership should look like overshadowed the sharp policy differences between the two tickets.

The Iranian threat to the region and U.S. interests around the world opened the debate, with Walz pivoting the topic to criticism of Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, then referenced the ""nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes"" and responding to global crises by tweet.

Vance, for his part, promised a return to ""effective deterrence"" under Trump against Iran, brushing back on Walz's criticism of Trump by attacking Harris and her role in the Biden administration.

""Who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years and the answer is your running mate, not mine,"" he said. He pointedly noted that the Hamas attacks on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023, happened ""during the administration of Kamala Harris.""

Vance and Walz trained the bulk of their attacks not on their on-stage rival, but on the running mates who weren't in the room.

Both vice presidential nominees sought to convey a genial mien as they lobbed criticism at Harris and Trump, respectively.

It was a reflection of the fact that most voters don't cast a ballot based on the vice president, and on a vice presidential nominee's historic role in serving as the attack dog for their running mates.

Walz pointedly attacked Trump for failing to meet his pledge of building a physical barrier across the entire U.S.-Mexico border at the country's southern neighbor's expense.

""Less than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime,"" Walz said.

Underscoring the focus on the top of the ticket, during a back-and-forth about immigration, Vance said to his opponent: ""I think that you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does.""

In the wake of the devastation of Hurricane Helene, Vance took a question about climate change and gave an answer about jobs and manufacturing, taking a detour around Trump's past claims that global warming is a ""hoax.""

Vance contended that the best way to fight climate change was to move more manufacturing to the United States, because the country has the world's cleanest energy economy. It was a distinctly domestic spin on a global crisis, especially after Trump pulled the U.S. out of the international Paris climate accords during his administration.

Walz also kept the climate change focus domestic, touting the Biden administration's renewable energy investments as well as record levels of oil and natural gas production. ""You can see us becoming an energy superpower in the future,"" Walz said.

It was a decidedly optimistic take on a pervasive and grim global problem.

The two running mates agreed that the number of migrants in the U.S. illegally is a problem. But each laid the blame on the opposing presidential nominee.

Vance echoed Trump by repeatedly calling Harris the ""border czar"" and suggested that she, as vice president, single-handedly rolled back the immigration restrictions Trump had imposed as president. The result, in Vance's telling, is an unchecked flow of fentanyl, strain on state and local resources and increased housing prices around the country.

Harris was never asked to be the ""border czar"" and she was never specifically given the responsibility for security on the border. She was tasked by Biden in March 2021 with tackling the ""root causes"" of migration from the Central American countries of Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador and pushing leaders there and in Mexico to enforce immigration laws. Harris was not empowered to set U.S. immigration policy -- only the president can sign executive orders and Harris was not empowered as Biden's proxy in negotiations with Congress on immigration law.

Walz advanced Democrats' arguments that Trump single-handedly killed a bipartisan Senate deal to tighten border security and boost the processing system for immigrants and asylum seekers. Republicans backed off the deal, Walz noted, only after Trump said it wasn't good enough."
Speaker Johnson lays out agenda for Republicans as they fight to hold House majority,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/house-republican-agenda-speaker-johnson-fb0d90c029b5ba595d3ef58b887794b5,2024-10-01T23:34:48Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Speaker Mike Johnson laid out on Tuesday a policy agenda should Republicans take the majority next year that extends the tax cuts approved when Donald Trump was president, reduces the size of the federal workforce and gives parents more choice on where they can send their children to school.

Johnson emphasized five main policy points during a speech at the New York Stock Exchange. He talked of extending and building on the Trump tax cuts, confronting China, boosting oil and gas production, expanding school choice and cutting the size and scope of the federal government.

""The survival of the American dream depends upon our victory,"" Johnson said.

The speaker and House Republicans are fighting this election season to hold their narrow House majority, with just a handful of seats to spare. Republicans are hopeful that a Trump victory over Vice President Kamala Harris in the election will help propel them to majorities in the House and Senate, which would give them unified control of Washington for the first time since 2018 and the ability to enact a sweeping legislative agenda.

Against the campaign backdrop, Johnson provided a bleak view of the economy under President Joe Biden, though the economy continues to grow at a solid pace, inflation is on the decline and the unemployment rate is still low by historical standards. He spoke to an audience of Wall Street investors, traders and others who have witnessed stock markets reach record highs in recent days.

But Johnson said that as he has traveled the country, he's meeting business owners on the verge of collapse because of high inflation, high taxes and over-regulation. And he said he's met moms and dads who have resorted to donating plasma and setting up crowdfunding pages so that they didn't lose their homes.

""Our incredible people are hanging on right now in spite of so many unprecedented challenges, but many can't afford to do it much longer,"" Johnson said.

The first policy priority he outlined was enhanced tax breaks, citing specifically immediate expensing for research and development costs. He also cited the need for a ""strong"" child tax credit, though he did not provide specific numbers. He said the Republican tax policies would ""respect the dignity of work, and it doesn't pay people more for staying out of the workforce.""

Trump has laid out a series of tax cuts on the campaign trail, such as extending the expiring provisions of his 2017 overhaul, and not taxing tips and Social Security. Outside experts say the tax cuts proposed by Trump and Democratic nominee Kamala Harris would cause the debt to rise even faster the pace under current law.

Doing more to confront China and rolling back environmental regulations are a common denominator for Republicans that Johnson embraced in his speech. On education, he said millions of Americans have the opportunity to send their children to a school that best fits their need, and ""Republicans want to expand that choice so that every American has that opportunity.""

Johnson also emphasized cutting the debt by cutting the size of the federal government, saying ""we're going to reduce the size of the federal workforce and root out a long list of non-essential jobs through the federal bureaucracy.""

""It's hard to roll back the entrenched bureaucracy and face the system that has produced the decline. It's a difficult task, but it's a task that can be achieved,"" Johnson said."
Trump won't participate in interview for '60 Minutes' election special,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/trump-cbs-60-minutes-harris-interview-759c54bf1b8225644dd7e69ae0ceb4a7,2024-10-01T22:57:11Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS News said Tuesday that Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump has declined to participate in an interview with ""60 Minutes"" for its election special, which will go forward next Monday with Democratic opponent Kamala Harris alone.

Television's top-rated news program regularly invites the two presidential contenders for separate interviews that air back-to-back on a show near the election. This year, it is scheduled for Monday instead of its usual Sunday time slot.

Asked for comment, the former president's campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said, ""Fake news,"" adding that there were discussions but nothing was ever locked in.

""60 Minutes"" said Trump's campaign had initially agreed to an interview before telling CBS that the former president would not appear. The network said its invitation to sit for an interview still stands, and correspondent Scott Pelley will explain Trump's absence to viewers.

Vice President Harris will appear in a pretaped interviewed with Bill Whitaker.

There are currently no other scheduled opportunities for voters to compare the two candidates together. Harris and Trump previously debated on Sept. 10. Although Harris has accepted an invitation from CNN for a second debate later this month, Trump has not accepted..

The interview special is scheduled to air Monday instead of the usual ""60 Minutes"" time slot because CBS is showing the American Music Awards on Sunday.

Trump's interview with ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl prior to the 2020 election proved contentious, with the former president ending the session early and his campaign posting an unedited transcript of the session."
Key swing state faces 'daunting' level of uncertainty after storm ravages multiple counties,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-voting-ballots-46a7fbecb44464409d796dd687d3cb9d,2024-10-01T19:37:24Z,"ASHEVILLE, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina election officials say they will do everything in their power to ensure that voters in the crucial presidential swing state will be able to cast their ballots despite the devastation of Hurricane Helene and the destruction of basic infrastructure only about a month before the November election.

Karen Brinson Bell, the executive director of the state's election board, said Tuesday that 12 county election offices in the hard-hit western part of the state remain closed after the storm unleashed ""unprecedented"" damage. Absentee ballots, some of which already have been mailed to voters who requested them, also face obstacles, from U.S. Postal Service delays to road and residential damage that could render them undeliverable. The viability of early and Election Day voting sites remains unknown, she said.

She described the storm as causing a ""daunting"" level of uncertainty, with early in-person voting scheduled to start in just over two weeks on Oct. 17. Still, she said the state is prepared to help voters navigate the emergency.

""We've battled through hurricanes and tropical storms and still held safe and secure elections, and we will do everything in our power to do so again,"" Brinson Bell told reporters during a media call. ""Mountain people are strong, and the election people who serve them are resilient and tough, too.""

Helene, which battered large swaths of the Southeast late last week with torrential rain and strong winds and massive storm surges along the Gulf Coast, caused devastation ""beyond belief"" in the popular mountain city of Asheville and other parts of western North Carolina, Gov. Roy Cooper said during a media briefing Tuesday.

""This disaster is unlike anything our state has ever experienced,"" he said.

The level of destruction could have far-reaching implications beyond the immediate damage to the flooded communities, especially if it has any impact on voting. North Carolina is among seven swing states being hotly contested by Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee. Trump barely defeated Democrat Joe Biden in the state four years ago, winning by about 74,500 votes out of 5.5 million cast.

Asheville is the most populous city in the 25-county region under a disaster declaration and is a Democratic stronghold. The counties surrounding it are largely Republican, so the eventual impact on any statewide race, including a nationally watched contest for governor, is unknown.

On Tuesday, emergency workers were still engaged in rescue efforts across the broad swath of the Southeastern U.S. that bore the brunt of the storm. Election officials in Florida, Tennessee and the presidential battleground of Georgia were assessing the damage and the potential impacts to mail balloting, early voting and Election Day operations.

Georgia election workers have returned to work even as some offices face power outages, limited internet and infrastructure damage. Absentee ballots are scheduled to go out on Oct. 7 as planned, said Robert Sinners, communications director for Georgia's secretary of state.

In North Carolina, officials said they are considering moving or combining voting locations if some are unusable or inaccessible.

More urgently, state officials are offering guidance and some special accommodations for absentee voters, who may not receive their ballots because of evacuations, suspended Postal Service operations or residential mailboxes swept away in the storm.

Paul Cox, general counsel for the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said displaced voters can contact their county election office to request that their absentee ballot be spoiled and sent to a different location. They also can use the state's BallotTrax service to track their ballot's location.

Those voters also have the option of waiting to cast a ballot in person, either during the early voting period of Oct. 17 to Nov. 2 or on Election Day, Nov. 5, Cox said. State law requires all voters to show voter ID, but those who are from a county under a disaster declaration and have lost their ID can fill out an exception form so they can cast a ballot.

Officials are still weighing whether to take further steps to accommodate voters, such as extending the absentee ballot deadline or allowing more people to cast ballots through an online portal already used by military, overseas and visually impaired voters, Brinson Bell said.

The Postal Service said in a statement Monday that it is ""still assessing damage and impacts"" and is communicating with local election boards in the affected areas to ""ensure the ongoing transport and delivery of Election Mail as soon as it is safe to do so.""

Kelly Godfrey, who has lived in Asheville for over three years, is one of the few voters who returned their absentee ballot before the storm hit. In Buncombe County, which includes Asheville, nearly 9,990 voters had requested absentee ballots as of Tuesday -- 85% of them Democrats or voters who are not affiliated with any party, according to Associated Press election research. Only about 170 had been returned.

Godfrey said she hopes rules and procedures will be adjusted to make it easier for voters who were displaced by the storm. She worries that any changes could lead to misinformation and false claims of voter fraud after the election.

""It's going to be spun a lot of different ways,"" she said.

For now, though, voting feels ""so far out in the distance,"" Godfrey said. ""Right now, people are thinking food and water.""

Brinson Bell said officials were not aware of any physical damage to election offices or the voting equipment or ballots stored inside them, but they are in close communication with tabulation machine vendors should any machines need to be repaired or replaced.

Some of the county boards whose offices remain closed or are dealing with outages have been given special emergency kits from the state, which were initially intended for use in case of a ransomware attack, she said. The kits are equipped with laptops, cellphones, Wi-Fi hotspots and other essentials to allow election operations to continue even without power, phone or internet service.

No one expects a judge's rollback of Georgia's abortion ban to be the last word,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-georgia-ban-overturned-appeal-ec732417c9c3b714ccee3b0c9e77bc7d,2024-10-01T18:23:21Z,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- When a Georgia judge overturned the state's abortion ban this week, abortion rights advocates praised the ruling and opponents denounced it -- all knowing the state's top court could put it on hold in coming days or weeks.

Any changes to abortion policy in Southern states could have an impact that resonates beyond their borders. Most states in the region have bans in place, forcing women who are seeking abortion procedures to travel to obtain them.

So as long as the ban is lifted, it could change abortion-related travel patterns. And the ruling puts another spotlight on a contested state in this year's presidential election, in which Democrats have sought to make abortion a major issue.

Here's a look at where things stand.

Georgia's abortion law violates women's rights to liberty and privacy guaranteed by the state constitution, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled Monday.

Since 2022, the law effectively prohibited abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy, which is before women often know they're pregnant. That's the point when cardiac activity in an embryo's cells can be detected by ultrasound. The law banned abortions once a ""detectable human heartbeat"" was present -- with some exceptions.

McBurney ruled that the law infringed on the liberty ""of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices."" He also wrote that Georgia gives women a constitutional right to privacy that includes making personal health decisions.

The judge wrote that his ruling reverts Georgia's abortion law to its prior status, which allowed abortions until viability, which is generally considered to be about 22 to 24 weeks' gestational age.

It was the judge's second ruling striking down the same law. In 2022, McBurney declared the law invalid because it was enacted by state lawmakers in 2019, when Roe v. Wade still protected abortion rights nationally.

The Georgia Supreme Court overturned that earlier ruling and sent the case back to McBurney to consider the merits of other legal arguments raised by abortion providers challenging the law. That paved the way for the Monday ruling.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, blasted the ruling, saying: ""Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge.""

Republican state Attorney General Chris Carr planned an immediate appeal to the state Supreme Court, a spokesperson said.

Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate in Georgia noted the state's high court could keep McBurney's order from taking effect while the state's appeal is pending.

It took the Georgia Supreme Court just over a week to overrule McBurney and reinstate the law after it was struck down the first time, in November 2022.

Georgia clinic officials told The Associated Press that they would accept patients whose pregnancies are past six weeks' gestation -- and also that they know the ban could be reimposed quickly.

That could make a big difference in the state. There were about 4,400 abortions monthly in Georgia before the ban took effect, and there have been about 2,400 monthly since then, according to estimates from the Society of Family Planning.

Allowing more abortions could mean that more women who want them can obtain them. It could also ease the flow of patients to clinics in other states, particularly North Carolina, the closest place where abortion is legal further into pregnancy. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that nearly 6,000 Georgia residents traveled to North Carolina for abortions last year.

Most Southern states have abortion bans that are either similar to the one overturned in Georgia or that are in effect at all stages of pregnancy.

So when a state lifts a ban, it could become a destination for people from nearby states seeking abortion. It's not clear whether that will happen in Georgia, given the possibility the state Supreme Court could reinstate the ban.

Even before this week, Georgia, a hotly contested state in the presidential election, has been a flashpoint in the political debate over abortion.

Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris traveled there last month to highlight reporting that two women in the state died after they didn't get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies. The vice president used the occasion to blast her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, for appointing justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who cleared the way for states to impose bans.

After Monday's ruling, it leaves 13 states with bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and three that bar them after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy."
"Harris will tour Helene devastation in Georgia, North Carolina as storm scrambles campaign schedule",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/kamala-harris-hurricane-helene-georgia-north-carolina-948b9f7356c5954faac7b8ca15d6567c,2024-10-01T17:13:18Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Vice President Kamala Harris will tour damage caused by Hurricane Helene in Georgia and North Carolina as the deadly storm roils the political calendar just over a month from Election Day.

The Democratic nominee plans to visit Georgia on Wednesday and survey the devastation in North Carolina in the coming days, according to aides who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss the travel plans. Harris' team has been working to coordinate her plans to avoid impacting local disaster response efforts.

Harris had been scheduled to join her running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on a bus tour across Pennsylvania on Wednesday, the day after he faced off with Ohio Sen. JD Vance in Tuesday night's vice presidential debate. Walz will instead be joined by Pennsylvania Sen. John Fetterman.

After Georgia, Harris plans to continue with scheduled campaign visits to Wisconsin and Michigan later this week, with the North Carolina trip coming sometime after that.

President Joe Biden will visit North Carolina on Wednesday, checking out the worst damage in the Asheville area by helicopter to avoid tying up local resources.

Republican nominee Donald Trump visited Georgia on Monday, where he spread falsehoods about the federal response to the storm despite claiming not to be politicizing the disaster."
The Latest: VP candidates Vance and Walz meet in last scheduled debate for 2024 tickets,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-harris-trump-walz-vance-debate-9d7e3087d38a0e4b308613c0e2a91a94,2024-10-01T15:18:15Z,"Barring a late addition to the schedule, Tuesday night's vice presidential debate between J.D. Vance and Tim Walz could be the last debate of the 2024 campaign between the Republican and Democratic tickets.

Both Vance, a GOP senator from Ohio, and Walz, the Democratic governor of Minnesota, have embraced the traditional role of attack dog for the person at the top of the ticket. That could be on full display during the vice presidential debate in New York hosted by CBS News.

Although conventional wisdom says the matchup between the candidates with second billing on the ticket seldom have much impact, polls are so tight that it could sway voters on the margins. It also could be the last head-to-head matchup between the tickets because Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democratic presidential nominee, and former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, haven't agreed to a second meeting.

A new AP-NORC poll found that Walz is better liked than Vance, potentially giving the Republican an added challenge.

Although Vance has said he didn't ""have to prepare that much"" for the debate because he had ""well-developed views on public policy,"" he had been doing debate prep sessions with his wife, Usha Vance, senior aides, and Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who has played Walz, according to a person familiar with his preparations who requested anonymity to discuss strategy.

Walz's debate prep included sessions hunkered down in a Minneapolis hotel, with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg standing in for Vance, according to a person familiar with the process who requested anonymity to discuss the campaign's internal dynamics.

Trump was scheduled to speak about the economy Tuesday in the critical swing state of Wisconsin.

The former president was visiting a manufacturing facility in Waunakee, a suburb of Wisconsin's capital city of Madison in the Democratic stronghold of Dane County. Later he planned to hold an event at a museum in the state's largest city of Milwaukee, with hopes of reaching that city's conservative suburbs, where his support has softened.

Dane County, the location of Trump's first stop, is Wisconsin's fastest-growing county and an economic engine for the state, fueled by jobs in the health care and tech industries. It is also home to the University of Wisconsin.

""President Trump's appearance will be a big shot in the arm for demoralized conservatives here,"" the Dane County Republican Party Chairman Brandon Maly posted on X, the social media platform, when the visit was announced. He has said Trump must get at least 23% of the vote in Dane County to have a chance of winning statewide.

Democratic presidential candidates have long come to Dane County to hold massive rallies to fire up the base. Harris campaigned there on Sept. 20, holding a rally in Madison that attracted more than 10,000 people.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, Harris cut short a campaign visit to Las Vegas to return to Washington for briefings while Trump headed to Georgia to see the storm's impact.

Hurricane Helene's death toll is more than 130 people and rising, with some of the worst damage caused by inland flooding in North Carolina.

In addition to being humanitarian crises, natural disasters can create political tests for elected officials, particularly in the closing weeks of a presidential campaign.

Presidents typically avoid racing toward disaster zones so they don't interfere with recovery efforts. The White House said Harris would visit impacted areas ""as soon as it is possible without disrupting emergency response operations.""

President Joe Biden planned to survey the devastation on Wednesday.

A GoFundMe campaign launched by former president Donald Trump to help the victims of Hurricane Helene has raised more than $1 million.

The website calls the effort ""an official response for MAGA supporters to offer their financial assistance to their fellow Americans impacted by Hurricane Helene"" and promises that all donations will be directed to those who have been impacted by the devastation.

Trump earlier Monday paid a visit to Valdosta, Georgia, and said he had brought with him supplies, including fuel, that will be distributed by the Christian relief group Samaritan's Purse.

Former President Trump criticized the Biden administration's response to the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Helene, even as his supporters have called for cuts to federal agencies that warn of weather disasters and deliver relief to hard-hit communities.

As president, Trump delayed disaster aid for hurricane-devastated Puerto Rico and diverted money from the Federal Emergency Management Agency in order to finance an effort to return undocumented migrants to Mexico. And Project 2025, backed by Trump supporters, would restructure FEMA to limit aid to states and says that the National Weather Service, which provides crucial data on hurricanes and other storms, ""should be broken up and downsized.""

President Biden criticized Trump for ""lying"" about federal contacts with Georgia officials during the response to Hurricane Helene. Trump falsely claimed during a Monday tour of the damage that Biden hadn't been in touch with the state's Republican governor. ""He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying.""

""I don't know why he does this,"" Biden continued. ""I don't care about what he says about me, but I care what he what he communicates to people that are in need. He implies that we're not doing everything possible. We are. We are.""

State election officials in North Carolina are gathering information about options available to voters in the counties hardest hit by Hurricane Helene and plan a press conference for Tuesday.

Karen Brinson Bell, executive director of the North Carolina State Board of Elections, said during an emergency board meeting on Monday that she will be providing more information, including details on how voters could declare ""natural disaster"" as their reason for not being able to provide a photo ID.

The board met Monday to approve a resolution granting counties flexibility for holding weekly meetings required under state law to review absentee ballots. These meetings are required to begin every Tuesday between now and Election Day, officials said. The resolution passed unanimously."
Stephen Curry's gold-medal summer and 'nuit nuit' gesture still resonates as NBA camps open,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stephen-curry-warriors-night-night-9bc754ff955d481cd58695d09ca0d0d8,2024-10-01T14:40:24Z,"Stephen Curry got the question and didn't even have to think about the answer. Someone wanted to know what French words that the Golden State Warriors star picked up during his gold-medal experience at the Paris Olympics this summer.

The hottest basketball move in the world this summer wasn't a crossover dribble, or a stepback jumper, or some sort of no-look pass. It was the summer of ""night night,"" Curry's signature hands-to-the-side-of-the-face gesture, one that he breaks out when the game is over -- basically, when he's put the other team to sleep. The whole world saw it after his dazzling stretch of four 3-pointers, the drama growing with each one, in the final couple minutes of USA Basketball's gold-medal win over France in August.

Inter Miami's Lionel Messi -- only the biggest soccer star in the world -- did the night-night a few weeks ago. At the Presidents Cup last weekend, Si Woo Kim celebrated a chip-in by doing the night-night (a bit prematurely, given that the U.S. went on to win the event yet again) and at the Democratic National Convention, even Warriors coach Steve Kerr capped his speech in support of Vice President Kamala Harris by making the gesture.

And as this NBA season starts -- all teams are now in training camp -- it's still the rage.

""I've seen it at the DNC, I've seen it at the Presidents Cup in golf, I've seen it all over, Messi did it,"" Curry said. ""I think Steve takes the cake in knowing that was a good time to pull it at the end of a great speech and getting some good energy in the building. Si Woo Kim, shout out to you. I appreciate him doing it -- even though I told him he's got to remind himself about time and score and knowing when you pull a night-night out, you got to win.""

The night-night was epic.

The four shots that preceded the gesture -- the four shots that delivered gold to the U.S. -- they're still the talk of the NBA, too.

Warriors teammate Brandon Podziemski has seen Curry pull off all sorts of remarkable feats, both in practices and games.

And as he watched the gold-medal game, he had a hunch Curry had something special coming.

""I just really thought, like, this is Steph being Steph,"" Podziemski said. ""And what I mean by that is, he just gets in these modes and these phases where, like, I don't know what happens. You just give him the ball and you just let him do his thing and that's it.""

That's exactly what the Americans did for those couple of minutes. He tried passing the ball to Kevin Durant a couple of times; Durant just immediately sent it back his way. Devin Booker had a layup chance; he threw the ball back beyond the arc to Curry instead. It was his time. They knew it. France knew it. Podziemski knew it.

""I see it all the time in practice,"" Podziemski said. ""He just lets his body take over.""

Karl-Anthony Towns was on his couch with about 3 minutes left in the gold medal game, watching just like the rest of the world.

He didn't stay seated for long.

""It got me off the couch,"" said Towns, the four-time NBA All-Star who's about to enter his 10th season. ""I am 28 going on 29. I've been in the NBA 10 years. I've played against this man four times a year. I've never had a man make me feel like I was 15 years old and I've got to get off the couch and shoot some damn basketballs. I've never -- never -- had that.""

Towns said what made it even better was that Curry made four different shots, four different ways, four different sets of footwork involved.

""It was the greatest shooting expo I've ever seen,"" Towns said.

Miami guard Tyler Herro saw earlier in the Olympics that Curry was struggling a bit with his shot.

He knew that wasn't going to last. Sure enough, he was right.

""It's the preparation that he does, the mindset that he has,"" Herro said. ""It didn't surprise me. Everyone knows how good he is and how hard he works and prepares. That's kind of what I kind of try to take away from him, what he does, how he works, how he does everything game speed.""

Herro knows the shots -- and the night-night -- will be replayed forever.

""I mean, the influence he has, not only on basketball in America, but everywhere,"" Herro said. ""They're doing it in FIBA games. Messi's doing it. I can only imagine what the rest of the world is like. That's Steph. It's so crazy."""
Trial on new Georgia election certification rules set to begin,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-state-election-board-rules-certification-trial-f35c4f568dcefdb16ebd54cd74643ff1,2024-10-01T05:20:53Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- A trial is set to get underway Tuesday on a lawsuit filed by Democrats challenging two new rules passed by the Georgia State Election Board that have to do with county certification of election results.

Supporters of the rules say they are necessary to ensure the accuracy of the vote totals before county election officials sign off on them. But critics say they worry that supporters of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump could use the rules to delay or deny certification if the former president loses the state to Democratic Vice President Kamala Harris, causing confusion and casting doubt on the results.

The lawsuit is to be decided in a bench trial, which means there's a judge but no jury, before Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney.

One of the rules provides a definition of certification that includes requiring county officials to conduct a ""reasonable inquiry"" before certifying results, but it does not specify what that means. The other includes language allowing county election officials ""to examine all election related documentation created during the conduct of elections.""

The lawsuit was filed by the state and national Democratic parties, as well as county election board members, Democratic voters and two Democratic state lawmakers running for reelection. It asks the judge to confirm that election superintendents, which are multi-person election boards in most counties, have no discretion to withhold or delay certification. It also asks him to declare the two new rules invalid if he believes they allow such discretion.

The lawsuit was filed against the State Election Board, which is dominated by three Republican partisans whom Trump praised by name at a recent rally in Atlanta. The state and national Republican parties have joined the lawsuit on the side of the election board.

While the Democrats concede that the two certification rules may not be counter to Georgia law, they argue the rules were drafted on the assumption that certification by county officials is discretionary. They worry that some officials allied with Trump could use the new rules to try to refuse to certify the election results by the deadline set in law.

Lawyers for the state argue that the Democrats are asking the judge to reinforce what is already in state law -- that county certification must happen by 5 p.m. the Monday after the election, or the next day if that Monday is a holiday.

The Republicans who have a 3-2 majority on the State Election Board have used their power to pass numerous election rules in recent months, mostly over the objections of the Democratic appointee to the board and the nonpartisan chair. Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, an association of county election officials and the state attorney general's office have all cautioned against adopting new rules so close to the general election, saying it could cause confusion and put unnecessary burden on election workers.

The new rules have drawn multiple lawsuits.

State and local Democrats, and some county election officials, on Monday filed a lawsuit challenging a rule that requires three poll workers to each count the paper ballots -- not votes -- by hand at polling places once voting ends on election day.

A separate lawsuit filed by a group led by a former Republican lawmaker initially challenged the two certification rules and was amended last week to also challenge the ballot-counting rule and some others that the board passed."

"Democratic donors prop up far-right candidates, including Wisconsin gun activist in Senate race",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/wisconsin-senate-election-democrats-far-right-4e473639f23c257096684d83146d6e1f,2024-10-01T04:21:41Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- David Steinglass, a wealthy donor, has supported scores of Democrats running for office and calls himself an activist for transgender rights.

So his donation earlier this year to a far-right candidate in Wisconsin's U.S. Senate race seemed wildly out of character. He gave the maximum $3,300 to help get a man on the ballot who had these items in his background: He was investigated in the plot to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, he is a gun rights activist and he has called for banning some gender-affirming treatments for minors.

Far from an anomaly, the donation is part of a larger design. Steinglass' contribution to ""America First"" candidate Thomas Leager, and thousands more he and his wife gave to other far-right independents in key congressional races, is supporting a plan to boost Democrats and siphon votes from Republicans, an Associated Press examination found.

As the election cycle enters an urgent, final five weeks, both Democrats and Republicans are engaging in questionable tactics that threaten to subvert the democratic process by trying to shape the ballot through deceptive means.

""Whether it's congressional or presidential races, this kind of activity is a real problem and it undermines the functioning of democracy,"" said Edward B. Foley, a law professor who leads Ohio State University's election law program.

Leager told the AP he was recruited last year to run by operatives who said they were with the Patriots Run Project. That group promoted itself as a pro-Trump grassroots movement that attacked both parties and urged conservatives to run for office as independents. The AP found the group was supported by Democratic firms and donors who worked to install several pro-Trump independent candidates in key House races. Most of them were disabled, retired or both.

Records show Democrats have given tens of thousands of dollars seeking ballot access for the far-right candidates. The supporters include Steinglass and his wife, Liz, who have given more than $5 million to support Democratic political groups, and others who have contributed to and worked for Democratic candidates.

While the strategy hasn't always worked, Leager is among the candidates who qualified for the Nov. 5 ballot and could complicate Republicans' efforts to reclaim the Senate. He's running as a right-wing alternative to GOP nominee Eric Hovde, who is challenging two-term Democratic Sen. Tammy Baldwin.

The AP's findings triggered a criminal investigation in Iowa and prompted a conservative group to file a legal complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging that it had violated political disclosure laws.

The Patriots Run Project came under scrutiny after the AP reported that one of its candidates in a House race in Iowa suspected he'd been tricked and removed his name from the ballot last month.

The man, Joe Wiederien, who is impaired after suffering a stroke, said an Iowa Division of Criminal Investigation agent visited him last week and he filed an election fraud complaint.

""Whoever it is, I think that project is going down sooner or later,"" said Wiederien, who was among several recruited to run through the group's network of now-shuttered Facebook pages.

The Patriots Run Project is not a registered business, nonprofit organization or political committee. After AP's report last month, the group moved even further underground, disabling its account for X, formerly Twitter, and websites. More than 10 donors and consultants supporting its efforts haven't returned messages.

Liz Steinglass declined comment when a reporter visited her at the family's Washington, D.C., home. Her husband, a retired private equity fund manager, didn't return a message. The couple has given at least $9,900 to three candidates who said they were recruited by the Patriots Run Project, records show.

When an operative for Patriots Run Project called him last summer and urged him to enter the Senate race in Wisconsin, Leager said he told the group that he would be a controversial candidate because of his association with some of the men charged in the 2020 plot to kidnap Whitmer. He was not among several defendants charged in state and federal court, and he has said he never discussed plans to kidnap her. Court documents show he was among 16 others listed by the Michigan attorney general's office as an unindicted co-conspirator.

But the Patriots Run Project nonetheless arranged roughly $20,000 in donations from Democratic donors to gather the signatures needed to qualify for the ballot, which went to a firm that usually works for Democrats.

Leager was subpoenaed to testify at a 2022 trial for four defendants and exercised his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination after a judge found he had legal exposure. A prosecutor said at that hearing Leager was ""under investigation for a similar plot involving a different"" politician, had encouraged violence against the FBI on his podcast, and had invited armed protesters to appear outside a courthouse in an effort to intimidate jurors. Leager has denied supporting violence.

Leager is former executive director of Wisconsin Gun Owners Inc., which takes a maximalist position on the Second Amendment. In 2020, he organized protests for ReOpen Wisconsin, which included armed demonstrations opposing government closures and mandates intended to curb the spread of COVID-19.

Through his activism he became acquainted with Stephen Robeson, with whom he later broke after correctly suspecting he was an FBI informant. Leager attended a field training exercise in Cambria, Wisconsin, where investigators alleged the idea of attacking government officials was discussed.

Leager said he was an associate of alleged kidnapping plot leader Barry Croft, who is serving a lengthy prison term. Croft argues he was entrapped by government informants and is asking for a new trial.

""I was the Wisconsin target for the FBI in the Whitmer case. We just happened to slip through their nets,"" Leager said in March on ""The Free Men Report,"" a show he streams on Rumble.

Leager said an operative calling himself ""Johnny Shearer"" told him Patriots Run Project had seen his work and he was the exact type of candidate they wanted, saying the group was impressed ""that I had not caved under pressure from the feds.""

Six donors gave Leager the maximum $3,300 donation. In addition to David Steinglass, they include venture capitalist Richard Thompson of Wyoming and political consultant Joe Fox, a veteran of Democratic campaigns and House Majority PAC, congressional Democrats' super PAC.

Leager said their money paid for signature-gathering efforts by Urban Media LLC, a Milwaukee firm that usually works for Democrats and has done work for Vice President Kamala Harris and Baldwin.

The Steinglass family, Fox and Thompson also donated to independent conservative candidates Robert Reid and Thomas Bowman in House races in Virginia and Minnesota, records show.

A small network of Democratic donors also supported the three candidates as well as Vann Whitley, who unsuccessfully sought ballot access as a Libertarian in a Colorado House race.

Leager said he was ""suspicious a little bit"" of the group's motives but that he ultimately didn't care. ""I was like, 'if this gets me on the ballot, that's the main point.' I wanted to get in the game,"" he said.

Leager said the Patriots Run Project had no other ""real influence"" on his campaign but he was angry to have been misled.

Hovde has alleged publicly that Leager is a ""Democrat plant"" intended to take votes from him.

Baldwin's campaign said it had no role in getting Leager on the ballot.

Leager rejected the allegation that he would hurt only Hovde, saying he expects to take votes from both sides.

""They are trying to say I am some kind of Democratic operative, which is silly because I am more conservative than Hovde is,"" he said.

Walz and Vance will meet in their first and possibly only vice presidential debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/vance-walz-vice-presidential-debate-election-66ff2e5e45a8dda55b0a2242fc238fdc,2024-10-01T04:21:37Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Tim Walz and JD Vance will meet for their first and possibly only vice presidential debate Tuesday, in what could be the last debate for both campaigns to argue their case before the election.

The debate in New York hosted by CBS News will give Vance, a Republican freshman senator from Ohio, and Walz, a two-term Democratic governor of Minnesota, the chance to introduce themselves, make the case for their running mates, and go on the attack against the opposing ticket.

Tuesday's matchup could have an outsized impact. Polls have shown Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a close contest, giving added weight to anything that can sway voters on the margins, including the impression left by the vice presidential candidates. It also might be the last debate of the campaign, with the Harris and Trump teams failing to agree on another meeting.

The role of a presidential running mate is typically to serve as an attack dog for the person at the top of the ticket, arguing against the opposing presidential candidate and their proxy on stage. Both Vance and Walz have embraced that role.

Vance's occasionally confrontational news interviews and appearances on the campaign trail have underscored why Trump picked him for the Republican ticket despite his past biting criticisms of the former president, including once suggesting Trump would be ""America's Hitler.""

Walz, meanwhile, catapulted onto Harris' campaign by branding Trump and Republicans as "" just weird,"" creating an attack line for Democrats seeking to argue Republicans are disconnected from the American people.

A new AP-NORC poll found that Walz is better liked than Vance, potentially giving the Republican an added challenge.

After a Harris-Trump debate in which Republicans complained about the ABC News moderators fact-checking Trump, Tuesday's debate will not feature any corrections from the hosts. CBS News said the onus for pointing out misstatements will be on the candidates, with moderators ""facilitating those opportunities.""

Ahead of the debate, allies of both men were lowering expectations that their candidate will have a decisive performance.

Sen. Amy Klobuchar, D-Minn., called Vance ""an accomplished debater"" and contrasted that with Walz, saying he was ""not a lawyer-debater type."" Klobuchar said Walz spent time growing up thinking about football, not debating.

Jason Miller, a senior adviser to Trump, portrayed Walz much differently than Klobuchar.

""Tim Walz is very good in debates, really good. He's been a politician for nearly 20 years. He'll be very well prepared for tomorrow night,"" Miller told reporters Monday. He predicted the Democratic governor of Minnesota will be much more ""buttoned up"" than he is on the campaign trail and ready to defend his record, but added, ""That's not to say that JD Vance won't be prepared tomorrow, or that somehow he isn't up to the challenge.""

Vance, speaking to reporters last week, said he didn't ""have to prepare that much"" for the debate because he had ""well-developed views on public policy.""

But Vance has been doing debate prep sessions where he's been joined by his wife, Usha Vance, Miller, senior Vance aides, and Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., who has played Walz, according to a person familiar with his preparations who requested anonymity to discuss strategy. Moderating their mock debates was Monica Crowley, who served in the Trump administration, hosts a podcast and contributed to Project 2025, a conservative blueprint for remaking government that Trump claims he knows "" nothing about.""

""JD Vance is prepared to wipe the floor with Tim Walz and expose him for the radical liberal he is,"" Emmer told reporters on Monday.

Walz's debate prep has included sessions hunkered down in a Minneapolis hotel, with Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg standing in for Vance, according to a person familiar with the process who requested anonymity to discuss the campaign's internal dynamics. Others helping in the preparations include Rob Friedlander and Zayn Siddique, who helped Harris prepare for her debate with Trump, along with other aides to Walz and the campaign.

Klobuchar said Walz will show the American people ""a real person"" who brings ""buoyancy"" and positivity to the debate stage that will contrast with Vance, but ""he is not going to be shy about pointing out the problems.""

""Just because he's an optimistic, positive person doesn't mean he's a pushover,"" she said.

"Navigating US presidential politics, Zelenskyy met Trump and Harris. Now comes a harder part",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/zelenskyy-trump-harris-russia-ukraine-united-nations-0b9d9e1717e47f0ff69d547e2664a9b0,2024-10-01T04:21:19Z,"KYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- President Volodymyr Zelenskyy is back home leading Ukraine's fight against Russia after a U.S. trip that brought him face to face with the American leaders who will help decide his country's future.

The Biden administration pledged more than $8 billion in continued support to Ukraine, guaranteeing military aid until a new U.S. administration takes power.

But Zelenskyy found himself briefly mired in domestic politics before meeting with Trump in New York.

And the Ukrainian's leader's longer-term strategic aim -- convincing his allies to adopt a victory plan that he is promoting -- remains elusive and out of his control, analysts and officials said. So does the aim of using far-reaching Western weapons against Russia, the most immediate element of Zelenskyy's plan.

Zelenskyy's visit to an ammunition plant in the swing state of Pennsylvania upset Republicans and House Speaker Mike Johnson fired off an open letter saying the visit was part of a partisan campaign to support Democrats. He demanded that Zelenskyy fire his ambassador to the U.S., which hasn't happened.

There was talk of a meeting with Republican candidate Donald Trump being called off but the two men met in New York on Friday. Zelenskyy also irritated some Republications when he told The New Yorker that Ohio Sen. JD Vance, the Republican nominee for vice president, ""is too radical.""

Still, Zelenskyy presented his vision for victory to both Trump, Democratic nominee Kamala Harris and President Joe Biden, and walked away with more assistance, which will guarantee that Ukraine will be able to count on American aid until the new administration comes to power.

""The outcome of these two meetings was that Ukraine publicly showed it is engaging equally with both candidates. Ukraine has no favorites and is ready for open, normal relations with any future administration,"" said Oleksandr Kraiev, an analyst from the Foreign Policy Council Ukrainian Prism.

But the Biden administration's red line remains long-range Western weapons to strike deep inside Russia, even though Ukraine has long been lobbying for the U.S. to drop that limit.

The U.S. fears escalation but Zelenskyy thinks providing Ukraine with such capabilities would be a step toward ending the war, presidential advisor Mykhailo Podolyak said.

""The lifting of these informal restrictions will undoubtedly serve as a key indicator that decisive steps toward ending the war have been taken,"" Podolyak said. ""Of course, this won't lead to an immediate end to everything. But we want to see the light at the end of the tunnel, and we want to understand how and when this war will be resolved.""

Ukraine's leadership is waiting for the next meeting of the Ukraine Defense Contact Group at Ramstein Air Base in Germany -- defense leaders from the 50-plus partner nations who regularly gather to coordinate weapons aid for the war. There, Ukraine will see how the group has digested a victory plan that Zelenskyy has been presenting.

Zelenskyy hasn't publicly presented that plan, but U.N. Ambassador Linda Thomas-Greenfield of the U.S. said on Sept. 17 that she had seen parts of it and that ""it lays out a strategy and plan that can work.""

Podolyak said that Ukraine ""succeeded in delivering the message"" with respect to the resources required to sustain its defenses in the current, and potentially decisive, stage of the war.""

No public pledges of support were made for Ukraine's vision during the meetings, but Podolyak says Kyiv anticipated that a response to the victory plan would likely come during the Ramstein meeting on Oct. 12.

""We just need to wait a little, as our partner countries are now holding internal discussions,"" he said. ""We will see the results soon enough.""

Ukrainian lawmakers have been trying to win over Trump-allied officials for months, two of them said. One lawmaker said that attempts to solicit Republicans sympathetic to Ukraine's cause haven't yielded breakthroughs. He spoke on condition of anonymity in order to speak freely about sensitive matters.

Zelenskyy said that everything necessary for Ukraine to win the war with Russia is ""on the partner's table"" - an indication Kyiv has no option but to wait for their decision.

He made this statement while addressing the nation at the end of his trip to the U.S.

""The victory plan has been presented to America, and we have explained every point,"" he said.

But analysts and lawmakers said Ukraine sees both presidential candidates as potentially problematic.

Many are concerned by Trump's claims that the war could be resolved quickly, fearing that could mean negotiating on Russia's terms, potentially involving territorial concessions and giving up on security guarantees from Western allies.

Meanwhile, others said they believe Harris would continue Biden's foreign policy, which many Ukrainians and outside observers say is driven primarily by fear of wider war rather than than a well thought-out strategy for beating Russia.

Allowing Ukraine to use long-range missiles would be one crucial signal that the US is committed to bolstering Kyiv's hand in the long and difficult war.

""Biden is too cautious to give this permission before the elections,"" another lawmaker on the foreign policy committee said, speaking on condition of anonymity to openly discuss sensitive matters. ""But once the elections are over he might give this permission,"" he said, echoing a hope that many Ukrainian officials have."
Jimmy Carter and hometown of Plains celebrate the 39th president's 100th birthday,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jimmy-carter-100th-birthday-1e540c277dea07bd84242d290b4ebcdc,2024-10-01T04:21:18Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- Jimmy Carter is preparing to celebrate his 100th birthday on Tuesday, the first time an American president has lived a full century and the latest milestone in a life that took the son of a Depression-era farmer to the White House and across the world as a Nobel Peace Prize-winning humanitarian and advocate for democracy.

Living the last 19 months in home hospice care in Plains, the Georgia Democrat and 39th president has continued to defy expectations, just as he did through a remarkable rise from his family peanut farming and warehouse business to the world stage. He served one presidential term from 1977 to 1981 and then worked more than four decades leading The Carter Center, which he and his wife Rosalynn co-founded in 1982 to ""wage peace, fight disease, and build hope.""

""Not everybody gets 100 years on this earth, and when somebody does, and when they use that time to do so much good for so many people, it's worth celebrating,"" Jason Carter, the former president's grandson and chair of The Carter Center governing board, said in an interview.

""These last few months, 19 months, now that he's been in hospice, it's been a chance for our family to reflect,"" he continued, ""and then for the rest of the country and the world to really reflect on him. That's been a really gratifying time.""

The former president was born Oct. 1, 1924 in Plains, where he has lived more than 80 of his 100 years. He is expected to mark his birthday in the same one-story home he and Rosalynn built in the early 1960s -- before his first election to the Georgia state Senate. The former first lady, who was also born in Plains, died last November at 96.

The Carter Center on Sept. 17 hosted a musical gala in Atlanta to celebrate the former president with a range of genres and artists, including some who campaigned with him in 1976. The event raised more than $1.2 million for the center's programs and will be broadcast Tuesday evening on Georgia Public Broadcasting.

In St. Paul, Minnesota, Habitat for Humanity volunteers are honoring Carter with a five-day effort to build 30 houses. The Carters became top ambassadors for the international organization after leaving the White House and hosted annual building projects into their 90s. Carter survived a cancer diagnosis at age 90, then several falls and a hip replacement in his mid-90s before announcing at 98 that he would enter hospice care.

Townspeople in Plains planned another concert Tuesday evening.

The last time Jimmy Carter was seen publicly was nearly a year ago, using a reclining wheelchair to attend his wife's two funeral services. Visibly diminished and silent, he was joined on the front row of Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church in Atlanta by the couple's four children, every living former first lady, President Joe Biden and his wife Jill and former President Bill Clinton. A day later, Carter joined his extended family and parishioners at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, where the former president taught Sunday School for decades.

Jason Carter said the 100th birthday celebrations were not something the family expected to see once his grandmother died. The former president's hospital bed had been set up in the same room so he could see his wife of 77 years and talk to her in her final days and hours.

""We frankly didn't think he was going to go on much longer,"" Jason Cater said. ""But it's a faith journey for him, and he's really given himself over to what he feels is God's plan. He knows he's not in charge. But in these last few months, especially, he has gotten a lot more engaged in world events, a lot more engaged in politics, a lot more, just engaged, emotionally, with all of us.""

Jason Carter said the centenarian president, born only four years after women were granted the constitutional right to vote and four decades before Black women won ballot access, is eager to cast his 2024 presidential ballot -- for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat who wants to become the first woman, second Black person and first person of south Asian descent to reach the Oval Office.

""He, like a lot of us, was incredibly gratified by his friend Joe Biden's courageous choice to pass the torch,"" the younger Carter said. ""You know, my grandfather and The Carter Center have observed more than 100 elections in 40 other countries, right? So, he knows how rare it is for somebody who's a sitting president to give up power in any context.""

Jason Carter continued, ""When we started asking him about his 100th birthday, he said he was excited to vote for Kamala Harris.""

Early voting in Georgia begins Oct. 15, two weeks into James Earl Carter Jr.'s 101st year."
Biden admin's response to Hurricane Milton could be 'huge potential problem' for Harris campaign: CNN guest,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-admins-response-hurricane-milton-could-huge-potential-problem-harris-campaign-cnn-guest,2024-10-08T23:12:15Z,"The Biden administration's hurricane response could be a ""huge potential problem"" for Kamala Harris' campaign, according to former Bush adviser Mark McKinnon.

Mark McKinnon, a former adviser to President George W. Bush, joined CNN on Monday and suggested that Hurricane Milton could be a ""huge potential problem"" for Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign.

""What do you think the risks are for Harris?"" CNN host Kasie Hunt asked McKinnon. ""Because she's in office, the risk to her, seems to me that it might be higher for her here heading into the final stretch of the election. What's your take on it?""

""The risk is that she's an incumbent and she's going to be incumbent during one of the worst storms in our history possibly. So yeah, the risk is very high because all the responsibility for the response is going to be on her and Biden,"" McKinnon responded.

After Hurricane Helene caused massive destruction in the south, Florida is preparing for Hurricane Milton, which is poised to make landfall on Wednesday and wreak further devastation.

""It's a huge potential problem for Harris, it's also an opportunity if they respond well, but man, something as massive as this. It's just you know, people are going to be unhappy. So you know, it's a factor that you know, in an election that's this close, could be a big factor,"" he added.

He also warned earlier in the segment that the hurricane stories would likely dominate coverage in the weeks before the election.

""Major storms are the one time when people really do look to government to say, 'This is your job. This is the one time we count on you to respond.' So, I mean not only will there, you know, they'll be looking to see how the Harris-Biden Administration responds, but think about this too. If it's anywhere near as big as it's likely to be, this is going to dominate news coverage for the next couple of weeks,"" he said.

A group that has labeled Vice President Harris a ""pro-genocide candidate"" has endorsed third-party presidential candidate Jill Stein in the 2024 contest.

The Abandon Harris campaign says America, as well as presidential candidates Harris and former President Trump, is supporting an ""Israeli project of Palestinian annihilation"" and urges Muslim Americans and those who oppose genocide to cast their ballot for the Green Party this year.

""In October 2023, under the darkening shadow of the U.S.-backed Israeli project of Palestinian annihilation, the Abandon Harris campaign - formerly Abandon Biden - was born. Our movement remains dedicated to ensuring that the American people, especially the Muslim-American community, recognize the responsibility we share in standing up against oppression and using all our power to stop genocide - wherever it may arise,"" the group declared in a press release.

ABANDON BIDEN CAMPAIGN RELAUNCHES, TARGETS HARRIS IN KEY SWING STATES

""We are confronting two destructive forces: one currently overseeing a genocide and another equally committed to continuing it. Both are determined to see it through. We call on Muslim-Americans and all those who stand firmly against genocide to vote for the Green Party in 2024,"" the press release states.

Stein has expressed her gratitude to the group and its support of her candidacy.

The Abandon Harris campaign says on its website that its ""current goal is to hold Harris accountable for her continued support of genocide.""

""It's painfully obvious that Kamala Harris can only sound articulate and firm when parroting US support for Israel,"" the group wrote in an August post on X. ""She fumbles through everything else, but when it comes to endorsing the killing of Palestinians, she suddenly finds a pristine level of eloquence,"" the post added.

Israel launched a war effort last year in the wake of the Oct. 7, 2023, attacks perpetrated by Hamas terrorists who committed atrocities that included rapes, kidnappings, and murders.

""What Hamas did that day was pure evil - it was brutal and sickening,"" Harris said in a statement marking the one-year anniversary of the attack on Monday. ""I will do everything in my power to ensure that the threat Hamas poses is eliminated, that it is never again able to govern Gaza, that it fails in its mission to annihilate Israel, and that the people of Gaza are free from the grip of Hamas,"" she declared in the statement.

Sirius XM radio host Howard Stern suggested Tuesday there would be a climate catastrophe if Vice President Kamala Harris did not win the 2024 election.

During an hour-long live interview with the Democratic presidential candidate, Stern repeatedly ripped into Harris' opponent, former President Trump, and expressed disbelief that anyone would vote for him. At one point, he claimed the sun would ""go out"" if Trump was re-elected.

""With all this pressure on you right now, and you've got to win, you just have to,"" he told Harris. ""I really believe we're in for the darkest skies on the planet, like the sun's literally going to go out. God bless you for doing this,"" he said about her presidential bid.

At one point, Stern said he didn't even like comedians portraying Harris on ""Saturday Night Live"" because there was ""too much at stake"" in the election.

KAMALA HARRIS TELLS 'THE VIEW' SHE CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING SHE WOULD HAVE DONE DIFFERENTLY FROM BIDEN

""I hate it. I don't want you being made fun of,"" Stern told Harris of actress Maya Rudolph portraying her on ""Saturday Night Live.""

""There's too much at stake. I believe the entire future of this country right now, land of the brave, home of the free, it's literally on the line,"" he said.

Harris said she thought the portrayal was funny but confessed she ""literally loses sleep"" about ""what is at stake in this election.""

""I end the day, pretty much every day these days, asking, 'What can I do more?' The stakes are so high,"" she told Stern.

At another point, Stern defended the idea of people going to therapy, and asked Harris if she could ""unload"" from the pressures she's under at a therapist's office.

""This is my form of therapy right now, Howard,"" Harris joked, before explaining she had support from her friends and husband when she needed someone to talk to.

FOUR CELEBRITIES WHO HAVE REJECTED CONSERVATIVE FANS: 'I HAVE NO RESPECT FOR YOU'

Stern's interview with Harris also covered the vice president's career as a prosecutor, her relationship with her husband Doug Emhoff, her pledge to bring Republicans into her cabinet if elected, and a discussion on whether voters were ready to elect a female presidential candidate.

The softball interview follows Stern telling his audience last month that he hates Trump supporters.

""I don't agree with Trump politically, I don't think he should be anywhere near the White House. I don't hate the guy. I hate the people who vote for him. I think they're stupid. I do. I'll be honest with you, I have no respect for you,"" he said on his show in September.

Harris' appearance on Stern's show came after she sat down for a friendly interview on ABC's ""The View."" Her friendly media blitz will continue Tuesday night on ""The Late Show,"" where she will be interviewed by Democratic Party supporter and comedian Stephen Colbert.

On CBS' ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, Harris repeatedly dodged questions about her economic policy proposals and if the Biden administration's immigration policies were ""a mistake.""

While Harris and her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, have ramped up their media appearances in recent weeks, the Democratic ticket still lags behind the Republican ticket in the number of formal interviews they have sat for.

Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, have sat down for at least 69 interviews since the Harris-Walz ticket was formed, compared to at least 31 non-scripted interviews for the Democratic presidential ticket thus far."

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States.

Biden undermines Harris claim that Ron DeSantis is politicizing hurricane response: 'Doing a great job',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-undermines-harris-claim-ron-desantis-politicizing-hurricane-response-doing-great-job,2024-10-08T21:36:12Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

President Joe Biden praised GOP Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for being ""cooperative"" and doing a ""great job"" in his response to Hurricanes Helene and Milton, despite Vice President Kamala Harris slamming DeSantis for ""playing political games"" instead of doing his job in response to the storms.

NBC News reported Monday that DeSantis was denying phone calls from Harris' team. ""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games with this moment, in these crisis situations, these are the height of emergency situations, it's just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris told reporters Monday.

Meanwhile, on Tuesday, President Joe Biden's opinion about the GOP Florida governor's response to Hurricane Helene and his preparation for Milton, diverged substantially from that of his vice president's.

""The governor of Florida has been cooperative. He said he's gotten all that he needs. I talked to him again yesterday, and I said - no - you're doing a great job, it's all being done well and we thank you for it,"" Biden said at a press conference from the White House Tuesday. ""There was a rough start in some places, but every governor, every governor - from Florida to North Carolina - has been fully cooperative and supportive.""

RON DESANTIS: 51 COUNTIES ARE UNDER A STATE OF EMERGENCY

After a DeSantis staffer told NBC on Monday that the Florida governor had chosen not to take the vice president's call, DeSantis later clarified that he was never even aware Harris was trying to contact him.

DeSantis also shot back at Harris' claims that he was playing politics with the storm, accusing her of being the actual culprit of engaging in political gamesmanship.

""I've worked on these hurricanes under both President Trump and President Biden. Neither of them ever tried to politicize it. She has never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now,"" DeSantis told ""Fox & Friends"" Tuesday morning following reports of the vice president's criticism. ""Why, all of the sudden, is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past? We know it's because of politics, we know it's because of her campaign.""

""Harris is not even in the chain of command. She has no role in this,"" DeSantis added. ""The idea that I should be, like, worrying about her when I'm focused on the task at hand is just quite frankly absurd.""

BIDEN CANCELS OVERSEAS TRIP AS MILTON BEARS DOWN ON FLORIDA; DESANTIS TELLS VP 'IT'S NOT ABOUT YOU KAMALA'

Biden, who has had multiple phone calls with DeSantis since Hurricane Helene began barreling down on the Southeast, told him and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor to ""call him directly"" if any further support is needed. DeSantis, meanwhile, noted Tuesday morning that ""every"" one of his federal requests for more support have been answered.

DeSantis pointed out as well that, at the state level, he has been reallocating resources as necessary to help Florida's smaller communities that have fewer resources.

Gov. DeSantis' office declined to comment to Fox News Digital on the record, but pointed to the governor's comments on both ""Fox & Friends"" and ""Hannity,"" respectively. Fox News Digital also reached out to the Harris campaign for comment, but did not receive a response in advance of publication time.

As Florida continues to clean up the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, it is now preparing for a potentially even worse storm in Hurricane Milton and is calling on millions of residents to evacuate.

""Helene was a wake-up call - this is literally catastrophic,"" Castor said Tuesday. ""And I can say without any dramatization whatsoever: If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you are going to die."""
"If 2024 polling errors mirror those in 2020 election, Trump 'wins in a blowout,' CNN data guru says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/2024-polling-errors-mirror-those-2020-election-trump-wins-blowout-cnn-data-guru-says,2024-10-08T20:50:50Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten said Tuesday that if the 2024 presidential election polls are as off as they were in 2020, former President Trump ""wins in a blowout.""

Enten broke down current swing state polling numbers between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump, noting that they show a race ""too close to call."" However, he pointed out that polls have been off significantly in recent elections, and if that's the case this time, Trump could win by a landslide.

""But let's say we have a polling miss like we had in 2020,"" Enten told CNN anchor John Berman.

""What happens then? Well, then Donald Trump wins the election in a blowout with 312 electoral votes because he carries all these Great Lake battleground states plus Nevada, plus the other states he was leading in -- Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia,"" he said.

CNN DATA GURU SAYS HARRIS STRUGGLING WITH 'UNDERPERFORMANCE' FROM YOUNG VOTERS AMID TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSEMENT

The reporter began by displaying the close race numbers between Trump and Harris in the seven battleground states. As his aggregate polls showed, Harris is up by one point in Nevada and Pennsylvania, and up by two in Michigan and Wisconsin. Trump, on the other hand, is up by one in North Carolina and Georgia, and two points up in Arizona.

Enten reminded viewers that these point differences are within the polling margin of error according to FiveThirtyEight, so currently, it's impossible to know who is winning.

He mentioned that on average since 1972 - provided that presidential candidates are polling within ten points of one another ­- swing state polls have an error rate of 3.4 points, so there is room for the actual race to swing in Harris' or Trump's favor when they're within one or two points of each other.

He further noted that in 5% of cases, swing state polling can be off by 9.4 points, making things even less certain for people looking at the polls right now.

""So, the bottom line is, the state polling averages tell us- what it tells us is it's just a race that is too close to call. Maybe one candidate has an advantage over the other one. But the bottom line is, it is way too close to call and it will remain so,"" he said.

Still, Enten offered multiple hypothetical situations, the first one being what the election results would look like if the current swing state polling is 100% accurate. ""If the polls are exactly right, Kamala Harris gets 276 electoral votes to Donald Trump's 262 because she carries those Great Lake battleground states despite losing North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona.""

He then followed up by showing what would happen if polling errors matched those found in the 2020 election. According to Vanderbilt University, polls overstated President Biden's lead over Trump by 3.9 percentage in the two weeks prior to election day, calling it the ""largest polling error since 1980 when support for Democratic nominee Jimmy Carter was overestimated by 6 percentage points.""

Enten argued if today's polls had the similar errors of the last cycle, Trump could walk away with 312 electoral college votes to Harris' 226.

Conversely, Enten discussed what would happen if polling errors predicting a red wave in the 2022 midterm elections appeared on Nov. 5, 2024.

""What happens if we have a polling miss like 2022?"" he asked. ""Well, in that particular case, now, the winner has flipped again. And Kamala Harris wins in a blowout with 319 electoral votes because she retakes those Great Lake battleground states, carries North Carolina, Georgia and Arizona."""
Kamala Harris' tough words on Iran confounds critics,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-iran-biggest-us-adversary-china,2024-10-08T19:40:49Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris told the women of ABC's 'The View' that she would put a greater emphasis on small businesses and crimes against women and children.

Vice President Kamala Harris had harsh words for Iran in an interview Monday evening as she said the regime is America's biggest foe.

In a sit-down with CBS' ""60 Minutes,"" the Democratic presidential nominee was asked to name the U.S.'s greatest foreign adversary. ""I think there's an obvious one in mind, which is Iran. Iran has American blood on their hands.""

""This attack on Israel, 200 ballistic missiles. What we need to do to ensure that Iran never achieves the ability to be a nuclear power. That is one of my highest priorities.""

Harris declined to say whether she would take military action if given proof that Iran is building a nuclear weapon.

""I'm not going to talk about hypotheticals at this moment,"" she told Bill Whitaker.

The suggestion that Iran was the greatest U.S. adversary raised some eyebrows -- as China is thought by many to be foe No. 1.

""Iran is our biggest adversary, not China?,"" Mary Kissel, former adviser to ex-Sec. of State Mike Pompeo, wrote on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

""Harris is completely clueless for claiming that Iran is America's greatest adversary rather than China,"" former Trump adviser Steve Cortes said.

""Really? It's not Russia? It's not China? A middle power is America's greatest adversary?"" Iranian nuclear researcher Sina Azodi questioned.

Harris also defended U.S. aid to Israel -- at a time when many liberals are calling on her to halt that aid or put conditions on it amid the rising death tolls across Gaza and Lebanon.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel,"" she said.

Harris highlighted threats from ""Hamas, Hezbollah... Iran,"" asserting it is ""without any question our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks.""

Still, she held out hope that Israel and its enemies could get to a ceasefire deal.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done, which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire."" She added, ""We're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.""

""China is the far greater threat just about, I think, everyone's estimation,"" said Rob Greenway, a former Trump aide and senior director of the National Security Council. ""If you really do view Iran as a threat, then the behavior they've made makes absolutely no sense.""

Former President Donald Trump has blamed President Joe Biden and Harris for loosening sanctions on Iran, which he said made the U.S. adversary ""very rich in a very short period,"" and prompted the turmoil that began with the Hamas attack on Oct. 7, 2023.

During a rally last week, Trump tore into the September 2023 prisoner exchange between the U.S. and Iran that facilitated a detainee swap in Qatar and resulted in the release of $6 billion in frozen Iranian assets from oil sales.

""If they have somebody who was kidnapped, it's always $6 billion. Whoever heard of that?"" Trump said. ""Somebody else gets like $4,000.""

Iran said it had reached a ""good understanding"" to access the money from a Qatari bank account on Monday.

The Biden administration, meanwhile, has long claimed it has not rolled back sanctions on Iran. But ""it's not enforcing any sanctions,"" according to Greenway. Iran is now bringing in nearly $36 billion per year from oil sales.

Last week, Iran rained down 200 missiles toward Tel Aviv, many of them intercepted by both Israeli Defense Forces and U.S. capabilities. Though Iran's proxies have long attacked both Israeli and U.S. postures, it was the regime's first direct attack on Israel since April.

Harris was sharply critical of Trump for pulling out of the Iran deal in 2018. President Joe Biden campaigned on returning to the deal, but failed to do so in office.

""[Iran] made a tremendous amount of money. They have had doors opened by the U.S. administration,"" Greenway said.

HARRIS' 'WORD SALAD' ON ISRAEL ALLIANCE

The Trump administration's policies ""brought them to the brink of financial collapse.""

After Biden rolled back sanctions on Iran, the regime went from 500 centrifuges needed to make a nuclear bomb to 7,000. It went from 5% enriched uranium to 60% (90% is needed for a nuclear weapon.) It went from exporting 400,000 barrels of oil per day in 2019 under the Trump administration's harsh sanctions to 1.7 million barrels per day today.

Reports also suggest renewed activity in two nuclear weaponization sites in Iran - Sanjarian and Golab Dareh.

Last week, Biden warned Israel to make sure its response to the Iranian missile attacks was ""proportional,"" and urged them not to go after Iranian nuclear facilities.

While speaking at a campaign event in Fayetteville, North Carolina, he said when Biden was asked about Israel attacking Iran, the president answered, ""'As long as they don't hit the nuclear stuff.' That's the thing you wanna hit, right? I said, 'I think he's got that one wrong. Isn't that what you're supposed to hit?'""

He added nuclear proliferation is the ""biggest risk we have.""

Trump said when Biden was asked about Israel and Iran: ""His answer should have been: 'Hit the nuclear first. Worry about the rest later.'"""

Increased support from Republicans appears to be one factor fueling Vice President Kamala Harris with four weeks to go until Election Day in her White House showdown with former President Trump, according to a new national poll.

The vice president and Democratic presidential nominee stands at 49% support among likely voters nationwide, with the former president and GOP nominee at 46%, in a New York Times/Siena College survey released on Tuesday.

According to the poll, Harris stands at 47% and Trump at 44% in a multi-candidate field. Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver each grabbed 1%, with roughly 7% supporting another candidate or undecided.

Harris' edge - which is within the survey's sampling error - is up from the New York Times/Siena poll from last month, when the two major party nominees were deadlocked at 47%.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLS IN THE 2024 ELECTION SHOW

The top-line number in the new poll is in the range of most other national surveys, which indicate the vice president with a slight edge over Trump.

The poll indicates Harris' support among Republican voters stands at 9%, up four points from last month.

As she turns up the volume on her efforts to court Republicans disgruntled with Trump, Harris last week teamed up with the most visible anti-Trump Republican in the town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP.

Harris campaigned in battleground Wisconsin with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney and a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021, riot on the U.S. Capitol, has vowed to do everything she can to prevent Trump from returning to power.

""I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience as she formally endorsed the Democrat presidential nominee. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self, a true patriot.""

The campaign event took place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

The new poll also indicated Harris consolidating her support among older voters, and for the first time taking a slight edge over Trump in being identified as the candidate of change.

That's crucial in a race where voters have repeatedly shared with pollsters that they think the country's headed in the wrong direction. And the Trump campaign, feeding off such polling data, has repeatedly tied Harris to President Biden and their administration in the nearly three months since she replaced her boss at the top of the Democrats' 2024 ticket.

The poll was conducted Sept. 29-Oct. 6, with 3,385 likely voters nationwide questioned. The survey's overall sampling error is plus or minus 2.4 percentage points."

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was asked about whether he ""can be trusted to tell the truth"" during Monday's special election edition of ""60 Minutes.""

CBS News' Bill Whitaker told viewers that Walz ""has been criticized for embellishing or telling outright falsehoods about his military record and about his travels to Asia in the 1980s.""

During his sit-down with the Democratic vice presidential nominee, Whitaker highlighted Walz's comments during last week's vice presidential debate when he referred to himself as a ""knucklehead"" after admitting he was not in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

""Is that kind of misrepresentation, isn't that more than just being a knucklehead?"" Whitaker asked.

""I think folks know who I am and I think they know the difference between someone expressing emotion, telling a story, getting a date wrong ... than a pathological liar like Donald Trump,"" Walz told the journalist.

""But I think it comes down to the question of whether - whether you can be trusted to tell the truth,"" Whitaker followed.

""Yeah, well, I can. I think I can,"" Walz responded.

""I will own up to being a knucklehead at times, but the folks closest to me know that I keep my word,"" Walz added.

MEDIA CRITICS PAN WALZ'S 'UNSTEADY' DEBATE PERFORMANCE: 'CLEAR LACK OF PREPARATION AND EXECUTION'

Walz has faced intense media scrutiny in recent weeks since Vice President Kamala Harris tapped him to be her running mate, particularly about various falsehoods he has peddled over the years.

During his appearance on ""Fox News Sunday,"" Walz shrugged off the criticism.

""I've got to be honest with you, Shannon. I don't think people care whether I used IUI or IVF when we talk about this, what they understand is that Donald Trump would resist those things,"" Walz told host Shannon Bream.

ABC's Kimmel fails to disclose fundraising for Harris campaign during friendly Walz interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/abcs-kimmel-fails-disclose-fundraising-harris-campaign-friendly-walz-interview,2024-10-08T18:17:38Z,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz shared a laugh with host Jimmy Kimmel after the Democratic vice presidential nominee made a comical gaffe during his first appearance on late-night TV.

ABC late night host Jimmy Kimmel interviewed Democratic vice-presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., Monday night without disclosing that he has both endorsed and led fundraising for the Harris campaign.

The ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!"" host hosted a celebrity-studded fundraiser in June that raised tens of millions of dollars for the then-Biden-Harris campaign and lent his name to a Harris campaign fundraising email last month, in which he endorsed Harris for president and trashed former President Trump.

Viewers would have missed those details in his interview with Walz, where they talked about the Harris campaign's vision for America, softened the vice-presidential candidate's recent gaffes with jokes and slammed the Trump campaign.

The anti-Trump late night host made no mention that he is backing the Harris-Walz campaign while giving Walz a late night network platform to speak to voters.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

During the interview, Kimmel called Walz a ""really nice man"" that the country needs, and referred to him as ""America's sweetheart.""

In turn, Walz told Kimmel about his campaign's positive vision for the country, noting that they will ""turn the page"" on the Trump era.

""For me, and being an eternal optimist, I always say that. I supervised a high school lunchroom - you're an optimist or you're dead,"" he said, adding, ""This idea that look, we get to turn the page on that, and I plan on waking up on November 6 with Madam President.""

Kimmel poked fun at Walz's last line, stating, ""I want to be clear, you won't be waking up together."" ""No,"" Walz replied laughing, as the host shot back, ""Unless you guys have gotten closer than we thought.""

""I have a problem about not being specific with my language. So thank you for that, specifically right,"" Walz responded, referencing the fact that he has been criticized for inaccurate claims about his career which he has chalked up to having ""misspoke.""

That Kimmel conducted a softball interview with Walz is no surprise considering how much the comedian has supported the Democratic presidential ticket.

JIMMY KIMMEL SAYS BIDEN'S TRUMP JOKE WAS CLEVER 'FOR A GUY WHO CAN'T PUT TWO SENTENCES TOGETHER'

In a joint September email from Kimmel and the Harris campaign that Fox News Digital recently obtained, the host stated, ""Sorry to break your cold little heart, Donald, but I endorse Kamala Harris for president. I've had the privilege of interviewing our Vice President several times. She is a kind, brilliant and delightful person who cares very much about our country.""

The email provided links for recipients to send money to the Harris-Walz campaign, and added another message from Kimmel. ""I want my four children to know I was on the right side of history (which is the left side). We need to protect our kids from the self-serving trolls who pretend to be fighting for 'freedom.' I believe in truth, justice and all the stuff we learned from Superman. Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are our best hope in this battle for sanity.""

Kimmel also hosted a June fundraiser for the Biden-Harris campaign that featured celebrity guests George Clooney, Julia Roberts, and others, along with former President Barack Obama and raked in over $30 million for the Democratic ticket.

Kimmel's network, ABC, has also been scrutinized for its connections to the Harris-Walz campaign, as Dana Walden, a senior Disney executive whose portfolio includes ABC News, is one of Vice President Kamala Harris' ""extraordinary friends,"" according to a report in the New York Times. Walden and Harris have known each other since 1994, while their husbands, Matt Walden and Doug Emhoff, have known each other since the 1980s.

The executive has donated to dozens of Democrats and contributed to Harris' political campaigns since at least 2003, when she ran for district attorney in San Francisco. She went on to donate to her subsequent campaigns for California Attorney General and U.S. Senate, as well as her 2020 White House bid. Harris even credited the Waldens for her marriage at a fundraiser in April 2022, which was held at their home in Los Angeles.

Former President Donald Trump holds a razor-thin two-point edge over Vice President Kamala Harris in battleground Arizona, according to a new public opinion poll.

Fueling the former president's margin appears to be support from voters age 50 and over.

Trump stands at 49% among likely voters in Arizona, with Harris at 47%, according to an AARP poll conducted Sept. 24-Oct. 1 and released on Tuesday. According to the survey, Green Party candidate Jill Stein grabs 1% support, with 3% undecided.

The poll also points to a gender gap in Arizona which favors Trump.

The former president and Republican nominee is up 11-points over the vice president and Democratic nominee among men, but down only 6 points among female voters, the survey indicates.

The survey is the latest to indicate a margin of error race between Harris and Trump in Arizona, a state President Biden narrowly carried over Trump in the 2020 election.

Arizona's one of seven crucial battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's White House victory four years ago and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump win the 2024 election.

""We're much better off with tariffs than having that government printing press printing out money,"" he added.

At Cozy Nook Farm, Oberhaus said their biggest struggle has been inflation. ""We've been [eaten] alive by inflation,"" he claimed.

He explained that they do not set their own prices, and they tend to ""run a couple of years behind everybody else.""

They're now paying ""twice as much for tires and fuel and feed and everything else."" However, ""our milk price stays the same, until just now in the last month that it finally came up.""

He also stressed illegal immigration as a top issue for him, even hundreds of miles from the southern border. But the problem is surfacing even as far north as Wisconsin, he explained.

""Little town of Whitewater 35 minutes away,"" he said. ""It's a town of, what, 15,000 people? And then they got a thousand new immigrants.""

Local Wisconsin outlets reported that last year Whitewater Police Chief Daniel Meyer and City Manager John Weidl penned a letter to Biden, asking for help after the ""rapid increase"" of about 800 to 1,000 immigrants since 2022.

""As a municipal government, our focus is not on legal status, but rather ensuring we are providing the resources expected of a municipality to all residents of the City. Unfortunately, we are increasingly finding it difficult to do that,"" the letter reportedly read.

""How do you handle that?"" asked Oberhaus.

As for those who argue that with strict immigration enforcement there would result in fewer people to work on farms, he called it ""baloney.""

On Trump, who recently ventured into Wisconsin's biggest Democratic enclaves in Dane and Milwaukee counties, the farmer said, ""I think that's the sign of a leader - that you're not afraid to go into the other camp and tell them what your ideas are."""
Biden cancels overseas trip as Milton bears down on Florida; DeSantis tells VP 'it's not about you Kamala',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-cancels-overseas-trip-milton-bears-down-florida-desantis-tells-vp-its-not-about-you-kamala,2024-10-08T17:08:04Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

With a second powerful hurricane in less than two weeks bearing down on Florida, President Biden on Tuesday canceled an upcoming international trip in order to oversee federal storm preparations and response efforts.

As the death toll rises and nearly 200,000 people remain without power or running water over a week and a half after Hurricane Helen tore a path of destruction through the southeast United States, Hurricane Milton - an extremely dangerous Category 4 storm - is on course to slam into Florida on Wednesday.

""Given the projected trajectory and strength of Hurricane Milton, President Biden is postponing his upcoming trip to Germany and Angola in order to oversee preparations for and the response to Hurricane Milton, in addition to the ongoing response to the impacts of Hurricane Helene across the Southeast,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said in a statement on Tuesday.

The president was scheduled to leave for Berlin on Thursday, followed by a stop in Angola before returning home on Oct. 15. The trip would have marked Biden's first stop on the African continent during his tenure as president.

EYE OF THE STORM: BACK-TO-BACK HURRICANES IMPACT HARRIS-TRUMP PRESIDENTIAL RACE

Speaking with reporters on Tuesday, the president called Milton a potentially ""devastating"" storm that could be one of the worst to hit Florida in a century. He also urged anyone under an evacuation order to ""evacuate now, now, now.""

""It's a matter of life and death,"" Bien emphasized.

Biden also said he spoke on Monday with Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, adding that the conservative governor had been cooperative and that he gave his personal phone number to DeSantis.

When asked about the federal storm response, DeSantis said during a news conference on Monday that ""we have gotten what we need from the feds... the president has approved what we asked for... I'm thankful for that.""

""Everything we've asked for from President Biden, he's approved,"" DeSantis highlighted.

The governor reiterated those comments Tuesday morning in an interview on ""Fox and Friends.""

""Every request that we've made - I've been in contact with the president, I've been in contact with the FEMA director,"" DeSantis highlighted. ""All of our requests have been answered.""

While DeSantis has complimented the president's actions, he has taken aim at Vice President Kamala Harris. The Democrats' presidential nominee on Monday - reacting to reports that the governor had refused to take her calls regarding federal storm efforts - described him as ""selfish.""

When asked about the dispute, DeSantis argued in his ""Fox and Friends"" interview that ""my focus has not been on dealing with Kamala Harris. I saw the news report. I didn't know that she tried to contact me. But I'd also say it's not about you, Kamala. It's about the people of Florida. My focus is exactly where it should be.""

""I've worked on these Hurricanes under both President Trump and President Biden. Neither of them ever tried to politicize it. She's never called on any of the storms we've had since she's been vice president until apparently now. Why all of a sudden is she trying to parachute in and inject herself when she's never shown any interest in the past? We know it's because of politics. We know it's because of her campaign. I have zero time to entertain these political games,"" DeSantis charged.

The war of words appeared to be triggered by reports from NBC and later ABC News on Monday afternoon that the Florida governor was not taking calls from Harris regarding storm recovery efforts, citing unnamed aides to the governor who said the calls seemed political in nature.

When asked a couple of hours later, DeSantis said he was not aware Harris was trying to reach him.

""I didn't know that she had called. I'm not sure who they called. They didn't call me,"" he said. ""It wasn't anything that anybody in my office did, in terms of saying it was political.""

Speaking around the same time, as she departed the nation's capital for New York, the vice president took aim at DeSantis.

""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations...is just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris charged. ""It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.""

However, DeSantis, pushing back in his Fox News interview, argued that ""Harris is not even in the chain of command. She has no role in this. The idea that I should be...worrying about her when I'm focused on the task at hand is quite frankly absurd.""

When asked if his vice president has been helpful as the federal government deals with back-to-back dangerous hurricanes, Biden nodded and told reporters ""yes.""

Harris, speaking on Tuesday on the popular daytime program ""The View,"" said ""I have called and talked with, in the course of this crisis, this most recent crisis, with Democrat and Republican governors.... So, obviously, this is not an issue that is about partisanship or politics for certain leaders, but maybe it's for others.""

With four weeks to go until Election Day in November and Harris and former President Donald Trump locked in a bitter margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene -- North Carolina and Georgia -- among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election - the politics of federal disaster relief are once again front and center on the campaign trail.

Trump, for a week and a half, has been repeatedly attacking Biden and Harris over the federal response to Hurricane Helene, and making unproven claims.

On Monday, Harris clapped back, accusing Trump of pushing ""a lot of mis and disinformation.""

Kamala Harris's 'joy' is quietly turning to panic for Democrats,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harriss-joy-quietly-turning-panic-democrats,2024-10-08T16:59:02Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In the days after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential election to be replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, there was real joy among Democrats across the country. That was not just a made-up media story, I saw it, but with less than a month to go, the joy is gone and a quiet panic is setting in.

In the first week of August I was, appropriately enough, in Harrisburg, Pa. and Democrats I spoke to were ebullient and effervescent at the change atop the ticket. One woman told me of calling her mother to celebrate together the chance at a Black female president.

Other left-leaning voters told me that they didn't love how Biden had been shown the door but that they felt Harris could turn the race around and take down Donald Trump. For about a month, it sure looked that way.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM KAMALA HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

In San Francisco, most voters I spoke to, red and blue alike, felt like Harris was likely to win, that the Democrats' stalled campaign had called AAA, gotten a jump, and was back on the road.

Harris had erased the lead Trump had over Biden, quickly eclipsing him as the frontrunner and much like a new restaurant opening in a small town, voters were eager to give her a try.

While Republicans and some in the media were frustrated by her unwillingness to do traditional interviews or hold so much as one press conference, her arrogant advisers smirked and said basically, ""So what? She's winning.""

Well, she's not winning anymore, and with her back against the wall appeared on ""60 Minutes"" this week, showing voters the real reason why she is camera shy when it comes to tough questions.

Asked if she and the Biden administration had lost America's influence with our Middle East ally Israel, the veep once again proved herself to be a walking, talking salad bar, here is what she had to say:

""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.""

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

The most generous interpretation of this odd assemblage of verbiage is that she is saying, ""we're trying,"" the more likely one is that she has no idea what she is talking about.

Over the past two weeks in my travels, it has been increasingly difficult to engage Democrats about the presidential race, much like a fan whose team has dropped a few playoff games and who is avoiding the sports page, they just don't want to talk about it.

As one lifelong Democrat in Ohio who I did get to talk to put it, ""I don't know, she's just kind of there.""

It is hard to say exactly when the shine started wearing off the Harris penny, when joy gave way to frustration, but the failure of the Teamsters to endorse her, and the massive union's internal polling showing Trump with a lead seems significant.

It was only after that, that I started hearing Democrats uttering words that seemed unthinkable back in August, namely, ""Maybe we should have stuck with Biden."" Ouch.

Biden himself even joked about it at a press conference, something he is at least still capable of, quipping ""I'm back in.""

Harris spokespeople are busy trying to talk Democratic voters down off the bridge, they insist she still leads in the polling averages, she has a war chest worth more than Fort Knox, and a ground game that Trump can only envy.

These points are all true, and the latter may prove decisive. The Harris movement may be Astroturf and not grassroots, much like her crowning as the nominee, but those busloads of supporters in matching teachers' union T-shirts are the same machine that gets out the vote.

But still, there is no mistaking that the thrill is gone.

It is not clear what Harris can do to reverse the clear trends favoring Trump today, ""60 Minutes"" wasn't it, and her appearances on podcasts, late night shows, and ""The View"" make her look like she is pitching a new Rom Com, not running for president of the United States.

The only answer left may be for Harris to make this fight uglier and dirtier as the clock runs out. If the joy is gone, and it is, the only thing left to do may well be to rage and rage, against the dying of the light."

""I vote we put this woman into that Black job,"" she declared.

Co-host Ana Navarro, a Republican who has supported Democratic candidates since 2016 and hosted night two of the Democratic National Convention, asked Harris bluntly at the end of the interview if she would come back on the show ""when"" she's elected president.

""The current administration are very, very responsible,"" Demesio Guerrero, a Trump supporter at a GOP Hispanic outreach event in Clark County, Nevada, told Fox News Digital in response to a question about recently released ICE data showing tens of thousands of illegal immigrants with sexual assault and murder convictions are living in the United States.

""They are like traitors of the United States. Because you know what, all the crimes, all the innocent Americans that are dying every day in many, many, many cities in the United States are the result of those criminals being loose.""

Blanca Fox, a Trump campaign volunteer originally from Guatemala, told Fox News Digital that the Biden administration should have warned the American public about the ICE numbers.

We're not against people to come to the United States, but the legal way, if you come to look for a better future, do it the right way and don't come and commit crimes and be a problem.""

Lydia Dominguez, a Trump supporter from Clark County who spoke on a panel at the Latinos for Trump event, told Fox News Digital that ""there is a crisis occurring at the border.""

HARRIS SUPPORTERS SAY SHE'LL FIX IMMIGRATION, BLAME TRUMP FOR BORDER CRISIS

""Between the drugs, the human trafficking, and now the millions of illegal immigrants that we have crossing over that we have not vetted or that have actually been charged for murder in other countries,"" Dominguez said. ""So it's alarming what's happening at the border.""

""They say that that's only a very small group,"" RNC Hispanic communications director Jaime Florez told Fox News Digital about criminal illegal aliens in the United States. ""You know, try to explain those statistics to the parents of the girl that was killed in the University of Georgia. When 10 million people come into this country without being vetted in any way, it is impossible to think that no criminal is going to come among them.""

A Las Vegas resident called the current status of the southern border ""terrible,"" pointing out that ""anyone can declare"" asylum and ""they're just allowed to come in."" Former Texas congressional candidate Rolando Rodriguez told Fox News Digital that he grew up around the border and explained that today it is a ""disaster like never before in the history of this nation and probably in the history of the world.""

This week, a pair of Suffolk University/USA Today surveys showed that Harris leads Trump among Hispanic voters in the key swing states of Nevada and Arizona, but also showed Trump has made gains with younger male Hispanic voters compared to four years ago.

""So far, Harris is falling short of the 24-26 point advantage that Joe Biden carried with Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada in 2020, according to the exit polls from those states,"" Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos highlighted. ""This Democratic shortfall is largely due to young Hispanic men.""

The Hispanic voters who spoke to Fox News Digital expressed a similar sentiment to what was highlighted in the polling and said they expect Trump will increase his numbers with Hispanic voters in 2024, in part because of the immigration crisis.

""President Reagan used to say Hispanics are Republicans. They just don't know it yet,"" Florez told Fox News Digital. ""We're finding out.

""We had a great time, it was a very prosperous time for us when President Trump was in the White House,"" Florez added, noting that Hispanic household income was up during the Trump presidency.

PA gov takes victory lap after Supreme Court rejects GOP bid to overturn election law 'usurpations',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pa-gov-takes-victory-lap-after-supreme-court-rejects-gop-bid-overturn-election-law-usurpations,2024-10-08T15:59:03Z,"Fox News host Sean Hannity analyzes 2024 election polls and Vice President Kamala Harris' upcoming interviews on 'Hannity.'

The U.S. Supreme Court rejected hearing a Republican-backed challenge to an executive order signed by President Biden that works to broaden voting access and registration, just roughly one month before Election Day.

The Supreme Court reconvened Monday for its 2024-2025 term and rejected a bevvy of cases, including one backed by dozens of Republican lawmakers in Pennsylvania who claimed President Biden's 2021 executive order on voter access was unconstitutional and attempted to interfere with the election. The lawsuit also targeted an edict from Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro for enacting automatic voter registration across the state.

The justices did not comment when rejecting the appeal.

Shapiro's office took a victory lap following the Supreme Court's rejection of hearing the case, calling GOP efforts a ""bad faith attempt"" to disenfranchise voters.

""This petition was yet another bad faith attempt to disenfranchise Pennsylvania voters - and the U.S. Supreme Court made the right decision to deny the Pennsylvania Freedom Caucus petition,"" Shapiro spokesman Manuel Bonder told Fox News Digital on Tuesday.

GOP STATE LAWMAKERS APPEAL TO SCOTUS TO CHALLENGE BIDEN'S 'USURPATIONS' OF THEIR POWER TO RUN ELECTIONS

""Governor Shapiro has consistently fought to protect our democracy - including defeating Donald Trump and his allies in court dozens of times to defend Pennsylvanians' votes and protect access to the ballot box. Yesterday, election deniers went 0-2 at the U.S. Supreme Court,"" Bonder said.

Biden signed the executive order on Promoting Access to Voting in March 2021, which directs federal agencies to expand access to voter registration, works to overhaul the government's Vote.gov website, and notes that the federal government has a ""duty to ensure that registering to vote and the act of voting be made simple and easy for all those eligible to do so.""

DOJ 'STONEWALLING' REQUESTS FOR DETAILS ON IMPLEMENTATION OF BIDEN'S 'FEDERAL ELECTION SCHEME'

Executive Order 14019 states that ""executive departments and agencies should partner with State, local, Tribal, and territorial election officials to protect and promote the exercise of the right to vote, eliminate discrimination and other barriers to voting, and expand access to voter registration and accurate election information.""

The executive order set off a firestorm of criticism among Republicans, most notably with 27 Republican Pennsylvania lawmakers filing a lawsuit challenging its constitutionality, Fox News Digital previously reported.

The lawmakers argued that the executive order essentially serves as an executive get-out-the-vote effort targeting demographics that would benefit the Democratic Party. They argued the move was unconstitutional as Congress never enacted a law that grants such an action from the White House.

A federal judge rejected the lawsuit in March, citing it lacked legal standing, setting up a legal showdown in the U.S. Supreme Court.

""We think it's really important for President Biden to be held accountable,"" Erick Kaardal, an attorney for the lawmakers, told Fox News Digital in April.

""For him to violate such a big law when all the little people have to follow the laws, even little laws ... it's clear President Biden has issued an executive order without congressional enactments to get himself re-elected. It's ridiculous,"" Kaardal added.

BIDEN'S GET-OUT-THE-VOTE EXECUTIVE ORDER CHALLENGED, HEADING TO SUPREME COURT: 'TARGET WELFARE POPULATIONS'

In their petition filed to the Supreme Court in April, the Republican lawmakers asked the court to weigh in on the case. They argued that, for the 2024 election, they cannot ""do their part"" in suing to stop ""federal and state executive usurpations of Pennsylvania state law, pursuant to the Elections Clause and Electors Clause, unless the Court does its part and declares individual state legislator standing in this case.""

The lawmakers had called on the Supreme Court to bypass the federal appeals court, and determine if they have standing to bring the case ahead of the 2024 election.

Following the court's rejection of the case, Shapiro's office told Fox Digital that the governor is zeroed-in on ""protecting our democracy and ensuring our elections are free, fair, safe, and secure.""

GOP lawmaker unveils effort to ban illegal immigrants from using IDs to buy guns,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-lawmaker-unveils-effort-ban-illegal-immigrants-using-ids-buy-guns,2024-10-08T15:31:39Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A House lawmaker is raising concerns about the possibility of people who are in the country illegally being able to purchase firearms through the same process a U.S. citizen would use.

Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., is unveiling a new bill called the ""No Guns for Illegal Aliens Act,"" which would explicitly ban illegal immigrants from buying firearms using government-issued IDs.

He also expressed support for former President Trump's controversial mass deportations plan, which would likely be the largest such move in U.S. history, while criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

MEXICAN GOVERNMENT BUSES MIGRANTS TO US BORDER AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BECOMES TOP ELECTION ISSUE

""Border Czar Kamala Harris has allowed criminal illegal aliens to enter our country and roam our streets. Meanwhile, radical liberals like Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz are offering driver's licenses to illegals - creating a recipe for disaster,"" Clyde told Fox News Digital.

""As we await President Trump's historic mass deportation effort, we must ensure illegal aliens with government-issued IDs cannot obtain firearms and wreak havoc on our communities.""

It's the latest move in a wider push by House Republicans to direct attention to crime perpetuated in the U.S. by illegal immigrants after several high-profile incidents in the last few years, including the killings of Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, and 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray.

FOCUS GROUP REACTS TO TRUMP CLAIM THAT MIGRANTS ARE 'EATING THE DOGS' IN OHIO TOWN

The three high-profile killings did not involve a gun, but Clyde argued that progressive policies allowing illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses could open the door to more crime.

Clyde, a gun store owner, has had his own firearms license for over 30 years, according to his office.

As of now, 19 states plus Washington, D.C., offer driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also recently developed a pilot program to distribute federal IDs called ""Secure Docket Cards"" to people who cross the border illegally and are awaiting immigration proceedings. It's not immediately clear if these IDs can be used to purchase guns, however.

The rate of crimes committed by illegal immigrants is lower than that of U.S. citizens, according to a study by the National Institute of Justice.

But Republicans argue that the act of entering the U.S. illegally is a crime in itself, and that instances of violent crime by such groups could be prevented just by having tougher border and immigration laws.

""60 Minutes"" recently disclosed that former President Trump canceled an interview with the program after demanding an apology for how it conducted a sit-down with him in 2020. He also allegedly complained that the CBS News show would ""fact-check"" him.

CBS News correspondent Scott Pelley revealed the information at the opening of the show's Monday night episode, which featured an interview with Vice President Kamala Harris, explaining why a conversation with her opponent was absent.

""Then, a week ago, Trump backed out. The campaign offered shifting explanations. First, it complained that we would fact-check the interview. We fact-check every story. Later, Trump said he needed an apology for his interview in 2020,"" Pelley said.

CBS NEWS CASTS LONG SHADOW OF ANTI-TRUMP BIAS AHEAD OF ITS VICE-PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

The reporter began by noting that it has been ""tradition for more than half a century"" that each major presidential candidate do an interview with the show the month prior to election day. He detailed how Trump's team had initially agreed to the interview but backed out last week.

""But, unfortunately, last week, Trump canceled. The Trump campaign had told us that the interview would be this past Thursday at Mar-a-Lago. They also asked us whether we would meet 78-year-old Trump in Butler, Pennsylvania, where he was grazed in an assassination attempt. We agreed,"" Pelley said.

He added that Trump campaign communications director Steven Cheung initially negotiated the sit-down and told ""60 Minutes,"" ""The president said, 'Yes.'"" However, days later, the campaign declined the invitation.

In addition to explaining that Trump didn't want to be fact-checked, the campaign slammed veteran ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl for how she conducted her interview with Trump ahead of the 2020 election, demanding an apology for how she dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop scandal during their conversation.

At the time, Trump insisted that then-candidate Joe Biden was ""in the midst of a scandal."" ""He's not,"" Stahl replied. ""Of course he is, Lesley,"" Trump sternly doubled down.

""No, c'mon,"" Stahl continued to reject the president's claim, before lecturing him, ""This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things that we can't verify.""

CBS News eventually verified the laptop in 2022.

The network released a statement on X last week saying that Trump punted on the interview after agreeing to it. At the time, Cheung replied, calling it ""Fake News.""

""Fake News. 60 Minutes begged for an interview, even after they were caught lying about Hunter Biden's laptop back in 2020. There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in. They also insisted on doing live fact checking, which is unprecedented,"" he posted on X.

Cheung reiterated the statement when asked for comment by Fox News Digital on Tuesday.

He said, ""Fake News. 60 Minutes begged for an interview, even after they were caught lying about Hunter Biden's laptop back in 2020. There were initial discussions, but nothing was ever scheduled or locked in. They also insisted on editing the President's answers with jump cuts, which is unprecedented...

Vice President Kamala Harris sat down for an interview on ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, when she dodged or refused to get specific about her plans for the country.

With less than a month before the election, CBS correspondent Bill Whitaker repeatedly pressed Harris for details on how to pay for her economic proposals, on whether President Biden's loose immigration policies were a mistake and how a Harris foreign policy might differ from Biden or former President Donald Trump. There were several moments when Whitaker had to ask follow-up questions after Harris did not directly answer his inquiries.

Overall, the Democratic vice president did not differentiate herself much from her 2020 running mate, the sitting president of the United States. CBS said her Republican rival, former President Trump, backed out of an invitation to appear on ""60 Minutes,"" though the Trump campaign said there was never a formal agreement for Trump to appear on the program.

Here are some standout moments from the Harris interview.

'60 MINUTES' ASKS HARRIS WHETHER IT WAS A 'MISTAKE' FOR BIDEN ADMIN TO GO SOFT ON BORDER, VP REPEATEDLY DODGES

Whitaker asked Harris about the ongoing crises in the Middle East and Eastern Europe, with Israel under assault from Iranian proxies and Ukraine persevering in the fight against Russia's invasion. In her answers, Harris did not do much to distinguish her foreign policy from that of the current administration.

On Israel, Harris echoed Biden's call for the war with Hamas to end, though she acknowledged the Jewish nation's right to defend itself after the Oct. 7, 2023 massacre, when terrorists slaughtered 1,200 people and took 250 captives back to Gaza.

""I maintain Israel has a right to defend itself. We would. And how it does so matters. Far too many innocent Palestinians have been killed. This war has to end,"" Harris said.

Whitaker pointed out that although the United States has handed billions of dollars to Israel in military aid, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has resisted the Biden-Harris administration's call for a cease-fire with Hamas. When asked if the U.S. holds no sway over Netanyahu, Harris dodged the question and stayed on message, emphasizing the current administration's diplomatic efforts.

""The work that we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles,"" she said.

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

Whitaker pressed, ""but it seems Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening.""

Harris declined to answer that point. ""We are not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where we stand on the need for this war to end.""

On Europe, Harris stuck with Biden's position that Ukraine must be involved in any resolution to the war with Russia.

""There will be no success in ending that war without Ukraine and the U.N. charter participating in what that success looks like,"" she said.

In a definitive statement, Harris said she would not meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin to discuss an end to the war unless Ukrainian representatives were present. However, she was less specific on whether Ukraine should join NATO.

""Those are all issues that we will deal with if and when it arrives at that point. Right now, we are supporting Ukraine's ability to defend itself against Russia's unprovoked aggression,"" Harris said. ""Donald Trump, if he were president, Putin would be sitting in Kyiv right now. He talks about, oh, he can end it on day one. You know what that is? It's about surrender.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREET TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Whitaker confronted Harris on her apparent flip-flop on immigration, noting that she supported Biden's efforts to reverse Trump's strict policies even as a historic flood of illegal immigrants crossed the border. Now, the vice president has ""embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers,"" he said.

Whitaker asked, ""If that's the right answer, now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

Harris responded by pointing to congressional Republicans who backed out of a bipartisan agreement on a border security bill negotiated by Sen. James Lankford, R-Okla. ""Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed. And he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress kill the bill. Don't let it move forward,"" she said.

However, Whitaker pushed back on the vice president, observing that in the first three years of the Biden-Harris administration, border arrivals quadrupled and there was no action from Biden or Harris.

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?""

Harris did not answer the question but asserted that her administration has offered solutions ""from day one, literally.""

""We need Congress to be able to act to actually fix the problem,"" she said, again echoing Biden.

To fight inflation, Harris said she intends to ask Congress to pass a federal ban on price gouging for food and groceries. She would expand the child tax credit to $6,000, give first-time homebuyers $25,000 in down payment assistance and offer generous assistance to people starting a small business.

The nonpartisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget has estimated that the total cost of her economic proposals would add $3 trillion to the federal deficit over the next decade.

""How are you going to pay for that?"" asked Whitaker.

""Okay, so the other economists that have reviewed my plan versus my opponent and determined that my economic plan would strengthen America's economy, his would weaken it,"" Harris answered. ""But my plan, Bill, if you don't mind, my plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy.""

HARRIS SAYS WEALTHY AMERICANS, CORPORATIONS WILL PAY HIGHER TAXES TO FUND ECONOMIC PLAN

Whitaker pressed again. ""Pardon me, madam vice president. The question was, how are you going to pay for it?""

The Democratic candidate's answer was that the rich must ""pay their fair share in taxes.""

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations, and I plan on making that fair,"" Harris asserted.

Whitaker followed up again, stating, ""we're dealing with the real world here"" and observing that Congress has shown no inclination to raise taxes.

""I disagree with you,"" Harris responded. ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

""None of us, and certainly I cannot afford to be myopic in terms of how I think about strengthening America's economy,"" she continued. ""Let me tell you something. I am a devout public servant. You know that I am also a capitalist, and I know the limitations of government.""

After a discussion on foreign policy, Whitaker took ""a hard left turn"" and asked Harris about her recent admission that she is a gun owner.

""I have a Glock, and I've had it for quite some time,"" Harris said after he asked what kind of gun she owns. ""And, I mean, look, my background is in law enforcement, and so there you go.""

Harris served as the district attorney of San Francisco from 2004-2011 and was California's attorney general from 2011-2017 before she was elected to the U.S. Senate and later selected as Biden's 2020 running mate.

She told Whitaker she has fired her handgun ""at a shooting range.""

Though Harris had served in government for decades before becoming vice president, she remains a largely unknown figure in national politics. She did not run for president in the 2024 Democratic primary and only became a candidate two and a half months ago, when Biden decided to drop out of the race amid mounting pressure from Democrats concerned that he was too old to win.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you,"" Whitaker told Harris. They don't know what makes you tick. And why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

""It's an election, Bill,"" Harris replied. ""And I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote. This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support."
"Biden White House has 'very low' trust in Netanyahu regime, urges transparency: report",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-white-house-warns-very-low-trust-netanyahu-regime-demands-transparency-report,2024-10-08T14:45:33Z,"Israel's air defense systems have been under pressure since Oct. 7 last year as the country fights a multi-front war against Iran and its proxies. (COURTESY: IDF Spokesman's Unit)

The Biden-Harris administration has privately warned of ""very low"" trust in Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's regime following several Israeli strikes the U.S. was not warned about, Axios reported Tuesday.

White House national security adviser Jake Sullivan reportedly told Israeli officials that the U.S. expects ""clarity and transparency"" about Israel's plans, specifically regarding any retaliation against Iran for last week's missile attack.

""Our trust of the Israelis is very low right now and for a good reason,"" one U.S. official told the outlet.

The report comes after weeks of the Biden-Harris administration growing more and more willing to criticize Netanyahu's regime. They have repeatedly stated that they support Israel's right to defend itself, however.

Vice President Kamala Harris wouldn't say whether she thought the administration had influence over Netanyahu in an interview this week.

CBS' Bill Whitaker asked Harris about why Netanyahu seemed to be ""charting his own course,"" despite the billions of dollars of military aid the U.S. has provided to Israel. ""Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?"" he asked.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel.

""Now the work we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire. And we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders,"" Harris responded.

I am not buying the 'hate speech' ruse and you shouldn't either,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/i-am-not-buying-hate-speech-ruse-you-shouldnt-either,2024-10-08T14:14:28Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Kamala Harris' pick for vice president, Tim Walz, has repeated the claim during the campaign that ""there's no guarantee to free speech."" The aspect that he targets is ""hate speech."" However, the Supreme Court has stated that our constitution's first amendment protects even hate speech. One may argue that one should not have the right to call a gay man or a black man a derogatory name, but that is not the point here. The First Amendment protects the views and opinions that our government may label as ""hateful."" I'm thankful for that, for I would not be where I am today without free speech.

When I first moved to Chicago from Indiana over 20 years ago, I kept my mouth shut. Liberal politics held sway over the Black community and one did not swim against the current. I saw many things I did not like, mainly the continual reinforcement of Black dependency on the government. I saw failures in education and the job market that did not have to happen. I saw teens mapping their families around government policies. I saw far too much and I kept my mouth shut.

I feared the repercussions of speaking out. The penalty for a Black person is often higher than other Americans and that is often due to the stronghold that Black politicians and their white liberal counterparts hold over the community. I feared being delegitimized as an Uncle Tom. Look at Ralph Ellison or Shelby Steele or Thomas Sowell -- smeared as Uncle Toms for speaking truth to power.

THE SERIOUS CRISIS GRIPPING AMERICA THAT NO ONE WANTS TO TALK ABOUT

Eventually, my resentment of the fear building up within me and my shame in looking away from the realities that I saw on the streets became too much to bear for me. When a young man born to good parents was shot and killed, I felt the nudge of God. I walked across the street from my church to the motel infested with drugs, prostitution, gamblers, and murderers and I climbed the roof in protest.

That was the moment I began to exercise my freedom of speech. I wasn't going to take it anymore. I would begin to speak the truth. I drew my strength from the civil rights foot soldiers who used the power of free speech to illustrate the horrors of segregation and white supremacy and to argue for a more moral America.

I didn't stop there. A few years after raising enough funds to buy and tear down the motel, I came out as a Republican. In doing so, I broke publicly with the politics of my community. I began to speak out against the 60-plus years of liberal policies that destroyed my community.

In response, I faced death threats and had to put my family into hiding. My church was robbed. Most of all, people accused me of speaking hatred.

That is why freedom of speech is so important. Imagine if those people, some of them employed by the government, had the power to shut me down for hate speech. All I did was say these liberal policies are killing my community and that was labeled as hate speech. They did that to protect their power, their money, and their identity.

We can never allow the principle of free speech to be compromised in any way. It is the greatest principle and power that man could ever possess -- just look back at the history of mankind and you will see that nearly every advance of some sort starts with man speaking his mind.

Look no further than me. I never stopped speaking since I announced that I was a Republican. Several years ago, Fox News asked if I wanted to work with them and we created the ""Rooftop Revelations"" series. What makes me most proud of that series is that we allowed so many people from the South Side to speak without varnish to the public. It was raw and truth. It allowed outsiders to see directly into our community and to see what the need is.

That is why, today, I am in the middle of building a $40 million Leadership and Economic Center right across the street from my church. Yes, the very same location where that motel once stood. That is the power of free speech and that is why we must never allow it to be compromised in any way. We have everything to gain from it, especially the truth that gives us the power to advance society."
'No guns for illegal aliens' bill rolled out by House GOP lawmaker,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/no-guns-illegal-aliens-bill-rolled-out-house-gop-lawmaker,2024-10-08T14:09:10Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A House lawmaker is raising concerns about the possibility of people who are in the country illegally being able to purchase firearms through the same process a U.S. citizen would use.

Rep. Andrew Clyde, R-Ga., is unveiling a new bill called the ""No Guns for Illegal Aliens Act,"" which would explicitly ban illegal immigrants from buying firearms using government-issued IDs.

He also expressed support for former President Trump's controversial mass deportations plan, which would likely be the largest such move in U.S. history, while criticizing Vice President Kamala Harris and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

MEXICAN GOVERNMENT BUSES MIGRANTS TO US BORDER AS ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION BECOMES TOP ELECTION ISSUE

""Border Czar Kamala Harris has allowed criminal illegal aliens to enter our country and roam our streets. Meanwhile, radical liberals like Minnesota Governor Tim Walz are offering driver's licenses to illegals -- creating a recipe for disaster,"" Clyde told Fox News Digital.

""As we await President Trump's historic mass deportation effort, we must ensure illegal aliens with government-issued IDs cannot obtain firearms and wreak havoc on our communities.""

It's the latest move in a wider push by House Republicans to direct attention to crime perpetuated in the U.S. by illegal immigrants after several high-profile incidents in the last few years, including the killings of Rachel Morin, Laken Riley, and 12-year-old Jocelyn Nungaray.

FOCUS GROUP REACTS TO TRUMP CLAIM THAT MIGRANTS ARE 'EATING THE DOGS' IN OHIO TOWN

The three high-profile killings did not involve a gun, but Clyde argued that progressive policies allowing illegal immigrants to obtain drivers' licenses could open the door to more crime.

Clyde, a gun store owner, has had his own firearms license for over 30 years, according to his office.

As of now, 19 states plus Washington, D.C., offer driver's licenses to illegal immigrants.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has also recently developed a pilot program to distribute federal IDs called ""Secure Docket Cards"" to people who cross the border illegally and are awaiting immigration proceedings. It's not immediately clear if these IDs can be used to purchase guns, however.

The rate of crimes committed by illegal immigrants is lower than that of U.S. citizens, according to a study by the National Institute of Justice.

But Republicans argue that the act of entering the U.S. illegally is a crime in itself, and that instances of violent crime by such groups could be prevented just by having tougher border and immigration laws.

Ron DeSantis says Harris has 'no role' in Hurricane response: 'I don't have time for political games',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ron-desantis-says-harris-has-no-role-hurricane-preparation-i-dont-have-time-political-games,2024-10-08T13:08:05Z,"Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis discusses Vice President Kamala Harris accusing him of 'political gamesmanship' on 'Hannity.'

Gov. Ron DeSantis hit back at Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday during an interview on Fox News' ""Hannity,"" as the Florida governor prepares for another hurricane, Hurricane Milton, to hit the state.

""For Kamala Harris to try to say my sole focus on the people of Florida is somehow selfish is delusional,"" DeSantis said. ""She has no role in this, in fact, she's been vice president for three and a half years, I've dealt with a number of storms under this administration, she's never contributed anything to any of these efforts.""

NBC News, and later ABC News, reported on Monday that the Florida governor was not taking calls from Harris regarding storm recovery efforts, citing unnamed aides to the governor who said the calls seemed political in nature.

Asked by Fox News' Sean Hannity if she has ever called before while preparing for hurricanes, DeSantis said, ""no.""

""She has no role in this process. I'm in contact with the President of the United States. I'm in contact with the FEMA director, I'm obviously managing all of our state agencies, we're supporting all our local government,"" he added.

When Harris was asked about DeSantis reportedly dodging her phone calls on Monday, the vice president accused him of playing politics.

""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations ... is just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris said to reporters on Monday. ""It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.""

DeSantis said he worked well with both the Trump and the Biden administrations when it came to dealing with hurricane preparation and response efforts.

""She's the first one who's trying to politicize the storm, and she's doing that just because of her campaign,"" DeSantis said. ""I don't have time for political games.

Regarding the White House response, spokesperson Andrew Bates told Fox News Digital, ""A wide range of leaders in both parties and from every affected state have praised the bipartisan response to Hurricane Helene. The Republican governor of South Carolina, Henry McMaster, has called the response 'superb.' Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a Republican, said, 'They're doing a great job.' Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer said, 'We are seeing incredible help from the Federal government to the state.' The Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, has said he 'appreciated' President's Biden's offer to 'call him directly' with any 'other things we need.'""

Bates then listed other Republican officials, including Republican governor of Virginia and Republican Senator Lindsey Graham who offered praise for Biden.

Fox News Power Rankings: The biggest surprises come after October,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-power-rankings-biggest-surprises-come-after-october,2024-10-08T13:04:54Z,"Fox News Poll Republican partner Daron Shaw on how Trump and Harris are polling with significant voter groups and in swing states ahead of the general election.

A Democratic win in Indiana. A Republican victory in New Mexico. And an election where Missouri was decided by less than 4,000 votes.

They've all happened in the last twenty years.

These results are little more than trivia questions today (the answers are 2008, 2004, and 2008 again). At the time, they raised eyebrows and changed our understanding of the electorate.

Surprises happen on election week. And when the national race looks this close, one unexpected flip can decide who wins the White House.

Vice President Harris still has the edge in this week's forecast. It predicts that Harris will take home at least 241 electoral college votes to Trump's 219.

Her advantage is no larger than it was in September, and as this column has mentioned, battleground states are usually - and mostly - won and lost together. The six toss-up states in this forecast are worth 78 votes, enough to give either candidate a victory on election night.

National polls show a tight race: a Quinnipiac survey has Harris and former President Trump tied at 48%-48% with likely voters, while Marist has the candidates at 50%-48%, well within the polls' margins of sampling error.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON TWO TOP ISSUES

Neither poll shows Trump slipping with the national electorate. Other recent polls showed a point worth of erosion after the September presidential debate.

Battleground state polls have been sparse. (Hurricane Helene has devastated communities in Georgia and North Carolina, and Hurricane Milton will soon make landfall in Florida. This will affect the accuracy of polling in these areas.)

Overall, this race is still anyone's game.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance debated a week ago in New York City. Vance mostly broke through the character that Democrats had constructed for him, while Walz stumbled out of the gate.

A flash poll showed neither candidate winning the night. As always, wait for results from multiple polls conducted in the weeks after the debate to properly assess the polling impact.

That was the only scheduled event that could surprise voters this month. (Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate later in October.)

Of course, it's the unexpected events in years past that have done more to reshape the race. And events in two categories have already resurfaced.

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Polarization will limit the impact of these events on the horserace. But watch Harris and Trump's support with independents over the coming weeks. Those voters made up 5% of the electorate in 2020, and they broke for President Biden by 15 points; recent polls put Harris in that ballpark. Trump likely needs to claw that back to win the race.

Two states that could surprise in November

There are nine ""likely"" races on the Power Rankings map. The two that would have the biggest impact on the race are Florida and Virginia.

Former President Trump improved his performance in Florida in the 2020 presidential election, bringing his margin up to about 372,000 votes.

That's a win of 3.4 points, or his second-closest victory of the cycle. (The closest was North Carolina, a toss-up in the rankings, which he won by 1.3 points.)

Republicans have strong advantages. The state's White working-class and senior voters lean towards Trump, while its large Hispanic population, particularly the Cuban and Venezuelan communities, has shifted right in recent years.

The GOP won big at every level in the midterms and enjoys a 1 million-plus voter registration advantage, and most tellingly, the Democratic Party is not making significant investments.

Democrats hope that a competitive Senate race, where incumbent Republican Rick Scott has personally spent more than $8 million, means the presidential election is closer than people think. Florida is also one of three competitive states with an abortion measure on the ballot.

It would take a blowout night for Harris to flip the Sunshine State. It would also be the first state after the battlegrounds to go blue.

Florida stays at Likely R in the rankings.

A win for Trump in Virginia would also be shocking, especially since Biden won this state by more than 10 points in 2020.

The state has a higher proportion of Black, suburban, and college-educated voters than the rest of the country, and all three groups help Democrats run up the margin. While Republicans talked about Virginia after the June presidential debate, the race has changed, and neither party is making big investments in the state today.

Some polls show a race that isn't over for the GOP. A survey from Virginia Commonwealth University in September put Harris at 47% with registered voters and Trump at 37%. A poll from the Washington Post earlier in the month had Harris at 50% to Trump's 42%.

Still, it would take a blowout in the other direction for the Old Dominion to reject Harris. Virginia remains a Likely D race.

Four weeks until election night

More than 1.5 million voters have cast their ballot as the countdown to election night continues. Early voting has now begun in:"
Harris takes slim lead over Trump in new poll as voters view her as candidate of change,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-takes-slim-lead-over-trump-new-poll-voters-view-her-candidate-change,2024-10-08T12:30:58Z,"Reason senior editor Robby Soave and syndicated columnist Josh Hammer on the media interviews agreed to by Kamala Harris and Hillary Clinton suggesting social media censorship.

Vice President Kamala Harris has taken a slight edge over former President Donald Trump in a new poll released Tuesday that looked into which candidate voters view as the candidate representing change. Trump, however, maintained his lead among male voters and has kept the trust of most voters on economic issues.

The latest New York Times/Sienna College national poll found that if the election were held today, 49% of respondents would vote for Harris while 46% would vote for Trump. It marks the first time Harris has led Trump in the Times/Sienna poll since President Biden dropped out in July.

Harris took a slim lead among respondents who saw the vice president, not Trump, as a break from the status quo, garnering 46% compared with 44% for the former president.

Harris' lead in this category was greater when broken down into non-White and younger voters, garnering 61% and 58%, respectively, compared to 29% of non-White and 34% of younger voters favoring Trump, according to the poll.

Despite the slight change for Harris, the poll found Trump still maintained the majority of voter trust on what they consider their most important issues, such as the economy, with 48% compared to 46% for Harris.

Trump is also leading Harris with male voters by 11 points, a group which also favored Trump over Biden in the 2020 election, according to the poll.

In the latest Fox News survey of registered voters in North Carolina, viewed as one such battleground state, Harris has a 2 percentage-point edge over Trump, 50% to 48%. A month earlier, Trump was ahead by 1 point (50% to 49%), for a 3-point shift in the presidential race.

The ABC morning program commented on Harris' recent appearance on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast Sunday night and the start of what some are referring to as a ""media blitz"" by Harris, who started making more stops on podcasts, radio shows and other programs. On Tuesday, she will do interviews with ""The View,"" Howard Stern and Stephen Colbert.

The panel praised Harris' media tour for reaching out to voters, with Goldberg pointing out that she is still the vice president alongside the ""acting president.""

""I think people should just know it is not easy to do what she's doing. Because she's still also the vice president, so she's still got other things she's supposed to be doing, as does our acting president Joe Biden,"" Goldberg said, in an apparent Freudian slip.

'THE VIEW' CO-HOST JOY BEHAR BEGS REPUBLICANS TO VOTE FOR DEMOCRATIC PARTY: 'JUST DO IT THIS ONE TIME'

The term ""acting president"" historically refers to people who temporarily hold the position while the actual president is incapacitated, such as the vice president assuming the powers of the office while the president is having a medical procedure done. Biden stepped aside from seeking the 2024 Democratic nomination amid growing party concerns about his mental acuity and ability to defeat Donald Trump.

Other women on the panel also complimented Harris' upcoming media appearances, particularly her attention to podcasts.

Alyssa Farah Griffin added, ""I think it's incredibly smart. I would have done it two months ago, but I'm glad she did it.""

In a fiery rant, Ana Navarro complained how ""[t]here's been a lot of moaning and groaning for weeks now that Kamala Harris hasn't been doing interviews and then doing interviews.""

'Tough call': Atlanta voters split on who will win Georgia,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tough-call-atlanta-voters-split-who-win-georgia,2024-10-08T12:11:05Z,"ATLANTA - Voters in Georgia's capital city are split over which presidential candidate has the best chance of winning their pivotal swing state in November.

""I see a lot more signs for Kamala than I do for Trump,"" Atlanta resident Stephanie Roberts, who works at a financial advisory firm, told Fox News Digital. ""However, go to the south, go to the more rural areas, and you will see a lot more Trump signs.""

Roberts, a Vice President Kamala Harris supporter herself, added, ""I do feel like the energy is more positive for Kamala.""

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

The Peach State could be critical to deciding the winner of the 2024 presidential race between Harris and former President Donald Trump.

The traditionally red Georgia has trended more favorably toward Democrats in recent years, particularly since Trump became the face of the GOP. Its pivotal turning point came in 2020, when President Biden won the state by just over 11,000 votes.

SPEAKER JOHNSON RIPS 'LACK OF LEADERSHIP' IN BIDEN ADMIN'S HELENE RESPONSE: 'ALARMED AND DISAPPOINTED'

""I think it's going to be a tough call. I think the current polls are pretty tight,"" said Atlanta resident Jose Malabo, who spoke with Fox News Digital in the city's Piedmont Park.

""I think if people show up and vote in numbers, I think Kamala has an edge here.""

Another person who only identified himself as Kevin said Harris would ""definitely"" win Georgia.

""She's the best candidate, in my opinion, from what I've read. And I follow it closely,"" he said.

However, despite Atlanta's reputation as a blue stronghold, not everyone there agreed Harris would take the state - a testament to Georgia's purple trends.

""Really, we're a Republican state,"" Tramel Simpson, a music producer, told Fox News Digital. ""Most people who voted in 2020 were just voting non-Trump...it's more of a decision now.""

Taylor Swift appeared at her third Kansas City Chiefs game of the season, and for the first time, was spotted in the same suite as Brittany Mahomes at Arrowhead Stadium.

For the first two games of the season, Swift and Mahomes sat separately as it seemed there may have been a growing rift between the two women because of the latter's apparent support for former President Donald Trump during the 2024 election cycle, while the former openly endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris.

The two showed face to the world at the U.S. Open when they went on a double date with their significant others - Swift with Travis Kelce and Mahomes with her husband Patrick. But still, they had not sat next to each other like they did for most of the 2023 season when the pop star first started to come to games.

That changed Monday night as the Chiefs went on to defeat the New Orleans Saints, 26-13. The ESPN broadcast showed the two women in the same suite cheering on the team.

Swift showed up to the stadium wearing a plaid dress while Mahomes had on a red get-up in which she posted about on her Instagram page.

Former President Trump announced a campaign rally in Aurora, Colorado, for Oct. 11 on Tuesday, vowing to highlight the ""flood"" of migrants in the city.

The rally comes after weeks of Trump blasting the migrant situation in Colorado, saying some 43,000 illegal immigrants have made their way into nearby Denver and Aurora. His campaign also highlighted the Tren De Aragua gang's takeover of multiple apartment buildings.

""Aurora, Colorado has become a 'war zone' due to the influx of violent Venezuelan prison gang members from Tren de Aragua. With approximately 43,000 migrants flooding the neighboring city of Denver since December 2022, many of these migrants have made their way to Aurora, bringing chaos and fear with them,"" the campaign said in a statement.

""Local families have been forced to flee their homes as Tren de Aragua members terrorize apartment complexes with guns, theft, and rampant drug activity. Kamala Harris' open-border policies are turning once-safe communities into nightmares for law-abiding citizens,"" the statement continued.

AURORA POLICE REACT TO ALLEGED VENEZUELAN GANG PRESENCE AT APARTMENTS: 'HAVE NOT TAKEN OVER'

""Kamala's border bloodbath has made every state a border state, leaving Colorado families at the mercy of criminals. The only solution to stop the border crisis is to elect President Trump, who will secure the border, deport dangerous criminals, and Make America Safe Again,"" the campaign added.

Liberal filmmaker and activist Michael Moore knocked Democrats who are panicking over the tight 2024 presidential race, admitting he's stunned that people on the left believe former President Trump could win the election.

""Democrats, they're such a frightened group of people,"" Moore said during a Monday interview on CNN. ""I mean, they still think that Trump is going to win.""

""This is kind of shocking to me. Like, don't you live with people? Are you not aware that there's going to be a tsunami of women voting between now and Election Day?"" he said, referring to backlash over the U.S. Supreme Court overturning Roe v. Wade in 2022.

""Anybody who thinks women are going to stay home, that women are going to stay home -- Do you not know any women? Do you not live with a woman?"" Moore continued.

MICHAEL MOORE WARNS KAMALA HARRIS TO NOT GO 'CENTRIST'

CNN anchor Brianna Keilar asked Moore if he believed polling which shows the race is close.

According to the latest national Fox News poll from September, Harris currently holds a two-point edge over Trump with voters.

""I don't think it's a dead heat,"" Moore responded. He clarified that while he wasn't outright dismissing polling, he had more faith in surveys that questioned voters on the issues, rather than the candidates.

He pointed to polling misses from the 2016 campaign, such as when The New York Times predicted on Election Day, 2016, that Hillary Clinton had an 85% chance at winning the presidential election.

""No, I don't think people should be running their lives based on these polls,"" he said.

BLUE PHILLY WORKING-CLASS VOTERS START LEANING TOWARD TRUMP AHEAD OF THE ELECTION: 'PEOPLE ACTUALLY LOVE HIM'

Moore ripped Democrats pushing Harris to the center because of these concerns, arguing that the VP's progressive policy positions on abortion, the environment, guns and jobs are actually in the mainstream.

""You mentioned Democrats who want [Harris] to 'tone it down,'"" Moore continued. ""That's something women have been told for decades.""

""The reason she's so progressive -- because she believes in a woman's right to choose, she believes a 14-year-old shouldn't take an assault rifle to school....you go down all her positions and they line up exactly with where the majority of Americans are at,"" he continued.

""The majority of Americans believe climate change is real. The majority of Americans believe the minimum wage is too low. Just go down the list,"" Moore argued.

""The majority of Americans want regulation. They want people to be making sure that, when you have a hurricane and only 1% of the people have flood insurance -- That's not the country I live in. That's not the country I'm going to live in, where people now are suffering because of this,"" he said, referring to devastation from Hurricane Helene.

Last week, Moore warned Harris to not ""move to the center"" or it could backfire for Democrats.

""If Harris is advised by her wealthy donors to shun the left and drop her more progressive positions in favor of a 'move to the center,'"" Moore warned in a post on Substack, that could ""reduce or depress the vote."""

Vulnerable Dem Jon Tester turns on Biden admin over DEI after Montana universities stripped of federal funds,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vulnerable-dem-jon-tester-turns-biden-admin-over-dei-after-montana-universities-stripped-federal-funds,2024-10-08T10:23:57Z,"FIRST ON FOX: Sen. Jon Tester, D-Mont., is calling on President Biden and his administration's Department of Education to promptly reverse a grant rejection for Montana universities because of a failure to meet certain diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) hiring standards.

In a statement exclusively to Fox News Digital, the senator said, ""The Biden Administration's decision to strip critical funding from local schools is just another example of one-size-fits-all policies from Washington bureaucrats who don't understand Montana.""

""I'm calling on the Biden Administration and the Department of Education to immediately reverse this decision, because Montana's students are more important than [made-up] D.C. hiring practices.""

SENATE REPUBLICANS MARK OCT 7 ATTACK 1 YEAR OUT AS ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR CONTINUES

Tester, who is fighting for his political life in a competitive re-election match in a traditionally Republican state, first voiced his concerns about the grant rejection due to insufficiently diverse hiring practices in a letter to Education Secretary Miguel Cardona last month.

""I am deeply troubled by indications that the Department rejected Montana's application based primarily on an unfair scoring decision related to subjective diversity hiring requirements that failed to recognize the work already being done on this front,"" he wrote.

HERE'S WHAT 2 UNDECIDED WISCONSIN VOTERS ARE HOLDING OUT FOR IN 2024 ELECTION

The senator's office revealed that after 25 years of receiving the Gaining Early Awareness and Readiness for Undergraduate Programs (GEAR UP) grant, Biden's DOE rejected the Montana university systems' federal funding because Montana supposedly did not include sufficient details about its hiring practices for ""a diverse group of individuals.""

According to Tester, the denial was ""embarrassing"" for the DOE.

The DOE told Fox News Digital it had received the letter and was in the process of reviewing it. Tester's office confirmed that it had yet to receive a response despite reaching out on Sept. 9.

The pointed criticism of the Biden administration's implementation of DEI standards sets him apart from his party, which has been generally supportive of the initiatives. On the other hand, Republicans have criticized the continued efforts to prioritize diversity over merit in hiring.

In less than a month, the Montana Democrat will face off in one of the most competitive races in the country against Republican candidate Tim Sheehy, a former Navy SEAL. Recently, several political handicappers have indicated Sheehy has the advantage going into the election.

A spokesperson for Sheehy's campaign criticized Tester's stance against the Biden administration on DEI, telling Fox News Digital, ""Jon Tester loved the radical Left's Woke agenda when he voted to exclude white farmers from getting assistance just because they were white, supported AOC's Green New Deal moving forward, and blamed Biden's border crisis on Climate Change.""

""After voting 95% of the time with Biden and Harris, Two-Faced Tester is doing the Tester Two-Step just ahead of an election because he's a desperate career politician making an all-out effort to save his political career that made him rich in Washington.""

TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM ONLY VP DEBATE BETWEEN VANCE, WALZ BEFORE ELECTION

Tester voted in line with Biden 90% of the time in the last Congress, according to FiveThirtyEight. In the first half of the 118th Congress, he voted with the president roughly 95%.

The three-term senator has held off explicitly endorsing Vice President Harris in the presidential election, repeatedly telling reporters he is focused on Montana and his own race.

However, critics have pushed back at this, pointing to reports that the senator was responsible for recruiting Harris to run for Senate in 2015 when he served as chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee.

Former President Trump continued to hit the Biden-Harris administration for its response to Hurricane Helene amid criticism that he's attempting to politicize the disaster.

Trump spoke with Fox News host Laura Ingraham Saturday at his Butler, Pa., rally, which marked a return to the place where would-be assassin Thomas Matthew Crooks attempted to end the GOP presidential nominee's life in July.

Ingraham asked the former president how he would have responded to the devastation wrought by Helene.

""I'd have a tremendous team of people here. They don't have any people here, the people who, look, I was in North Carolina yesterday. I was in Georgia -- and Georgia's different. You have a good governor. He's doing a very good job. But North Carolina is a disaster. And it was also hit very hard. But they don't have the people and they're complaining there's no people around to help,"" Trump said.

Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Administrator Deanne Criswell hit back at some claims that agency personnel haven't been seen on the ground in the aftermath of the storm, telling ""Special Report"" on Monday such insinuations are ""false.""

""We have been on the ground since before Hurricane Helene in Florida and before it crossed over [to] North Carolina. And what I would say is just because somebody doesn't see a person in a shirt doesn't mean that we're not in the area. We have a team located with the state side-by-side to help them understand their needs and move resources where they're needed,"" Criswell said.

""We've moved food and water, and much of what you're seeing delivered by the amazing National Guardsmen across North Carolina are the supplies that we've brought in. The entire federal family is there to support this response. We've been there. We will continue to be there as long as it's needed to make sure we're meeting everybody's needs.""

The White House announced over the weekend that President Biden ordered 500 active-duty troops to western North Carolina to assist in relief efforts, bringing the total number of troops to 1,500.

More than 6,100 National Guardsmen and more than 7,000 federal personnel have been mobilized to help residents and affected counties.

TRUMP LAUNCHES GOFUNDME TO HELP HURRICANE HELENE VICTIMS, RAISES MORE THAN $1M

The White House took aim at Trump and others for allegedly spreading false information about how disaster relief funds were being used, specifically a claim that FEMA money was used on migrants in the United States.

""No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. None. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,"" a memo from the White House read in part.

""You know, anything I do, they'll say, oh, it's political. If I do anything good, no matter what I do, they'll say, oh, he did it for politics. I mean, they could have gotten there way before me,"" Trump said on ""The Ingraham Angle.""

Trump, Biden and Kamala Harris have all visited states impacted by Helene.

Ingraham asked the GOP nominee how he's working to ensure voters can cast their ballots amid the devastation.

""Republican areas got hit very hard. You know that. They got hit very, very hard. I believe - and many people are dead. You know, many people are dead. They don't even know what it's going to be in terms of the number. You know, they have hundreds are missing and I can't really speak to it. I can only say that I believe they're going to go out and vote, if they have to, crawl to a voting booth,"" Trump said.

He added Republican National Committee co-chair and daughter-in-law Lara Trump is working to address the issue.

""Other people are working on it and we're trying to make it convenient for them, too. But they just lost their house.

""We have to have swifter incarceration at the border,"" Mary from Phoenix said. ""And if there's a suspicion that they're going to commit a crime, lock them up.""

More than 425,000 illegal immigrants with criminal convictions are currently out of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) custody, according to data provided to lawmakers late last month. That includes more than 13,000 people convicted of homicide and nearly 16,000 convicted of sexual assault, according to ICE.

""That is pretty tragic,"" Bob from Tempe said when asked about the data. ""The whole immigration needs to be reformed, and they need to get serious about it.""

Mary and Bob both thought Harris would do a better job of addressing immigration. Mary said Harris and Biden had a ""strong immigration bill before the Senate"" this past spring before Trump rallied his allies to block the legislation.

""That was infuriating,"" she said. ""And they all marched in step. So I know that if Kamala gets in, she will get it signed.""

But Nick from Sun City West said Harris' immigration policy has been ""dismal at best.""

""Control the border,"" he said. ""At least keep the border safe. Keep people from being able to get in that aren't supposed to be able to come in unless they come in through the regular normal channels.""

BATTLEGROUND SENATE CANDIDATE UNLOADS ON 'RADICAL' DEM OPPONENT FOR DISPARAGING TRUMP VOTERS

Trump narrowly leads Harris in the presidential contest in Arizona, according to a recent Fox News poll. Biden won the state in 2020 by less than half a percentage point, making him the first Democrat to capture the state since Bill Clinton in 1996.

In the Fox News poll, 56% of Arizona voters surveyed said they trust Trump to do a better job on the border, compared to 41% who preferred Harris.

""It sucks. Excuse my language,"" Greg from Phoenix said of Harris' handling of the immigration crisis. ""It's just bad. They need to keep track of people.""

"Kamala Harris set for extremely friendly interview blitz with 'The View,' Stephen Colbert and Howard Stern",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/kamala-harris-set-extremely-friendly-interview-blitz-the-view-stephen-colbert-howard-stern,2024-10-08T09:14:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Vice President Kamala Harris will sit for a trio of interviews Tuesday, but don't expect a thorough grilling at any of them from some of the media's most fervent Democratic Party supporters.

Harris will make appearances with ABC's ""The View,"" radio star Howard Stern and CBS late-night comic Stephen Colbert, all hosts of extremely friendly venues for the Democratic candidate who have repeatedly railed against her opponent.

The co-hosts of ""The View,"" a talk-show under ABC's news division, have repeatedly expressed support for Harris and devote segments on an almost daily basis to attacking former President Trump as a threat to democracy.

The co-hosts quickly got behind the vice president in September in their season premiere after President Biden dropped out of the race and praised her ""flawless"" campaign.

ABC'S 'THE VIEW' WAS 100% NEGATIVE ABOUT TRUMP FOLLOWING ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT: STUDY

Harris did an about-face on multiple far-left policies she openly supported when she ran for president in 2020, including on fracking, the Green New Deal, and on getting rid of private health insurance. Liberal co-host Sunny Hostin argued in early September that the vice president had always been ""moderate.""

""People evolve and grow,"" Whoopi Goldberg said, dismissing Harris' flip-flops during the discussion. ""The difference, perhaps now, is that someone has actually admitted it.""

Co-host Joy Behar even recently demanded Republicans vote Democrat to ""save the country.""

The show's two Republican hosts, former Trump aide Alyssa Farah Griffin and Ana Navarro, join the liberal hosts in criticizing the former president as an existential threat to the nation. Navarro even hosted night two of the Democratic National Convention in August.

""For me to have the chance to stand on that stage and help my girl, Kamala, make history, and become the Democratic nominee, it's just such a mind-blowing moment,"" Navarro said.

Griffin has not emphatically endorsed the vice president, but plans to headline an anti-Trump event in Pennsylvania alongside other anti-Trump Republicans such as Liz Cheney, who has endorsed Harris.

Navarro touted the Harris interview on ""The View"" and said her Tuesday media blitz was evidence the vice president was facing tough questions. CNN's Brian Stelter also suggested on Monday that the co-hosts of ""The View"" would have ""sharp"" questions for Harris on Tuesday.

Late-night comedy has become a hotbed for Democratic Party support in recent years, but Colbert has taken it to another level with his fawning monologues and interviews in recent years.

Colbert hosted a fundraiser alongside Barack Obama, Bill Clinton and President Biden in March, prior to Biden dropping out of the race. The star-studded Democratic fundraiser brought in over $25 million for Biden's campaign. In 2020, he popped champagne on the air over Biden and Harris winning the election.

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

Colbert's political and media guests have almost solely consisted of Democrats and liberal media figures. Colbert has hosted Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, CNN's Abby Phillip, Sen. Bernie Sanders, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, MSNBC's Alex Wagner, former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, Hillary Clinton, Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, Sen. Mark Kelly, MSNBC's Rachel Maddow, CNN's Anderson Cooper, Bill Gates, MSNBC's Chris Hayes, and more.

Stern, who had the rare chance to sit down with Biden before he dropped out, has said he ""hates"" anyone who supports Donald Trump.

""I don't agree with Trump politically, I don't think he should be anywhere near the White House. I don't hate the guy. I hate the people who vote for him. I think they're stupid. I do. I'll be honest with you, I have no respect for you,"" Stern said during one of his shows in September.

The blitz this week follows a ""60 Minutes"" appearance and an interview on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast. Media analysts said Harris' approach of doing more softball interviews made sense given some of her shortcomings.

""Harris tends not to communicate effectively, whether it's her long-winded, non-answer answers or her demeanor, so for her it does make more sense to appear in friendly venues,"" said communications expert Tobe Berkovitz, a Professor Emeritus at Boston University.

Even Harris' other interviews before Tuesday have skewed toward being friendly, such as with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle. Lesley Lopez, a public affairs professional and assistant professor at George Washington University, dismissed the idea that Harris was erring by avoiding difficult interviews.

""One man's so-called bubble campaign is another's strategic earned media plan. I think her campaign is being really targeted in the final days of an election where the margins are slim,"" she told Fox News Digital.

Former White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, who is now a Fox News host, said the trio of friendly interviews is a ""great idea"" but questioned the timing as Hurricane Milton has strengthened into a Category 5 monster storm heading towards Florida.

""I would have her, if I was on her team, in FEMA headquarters in the mornings, then you can go out and do a campaign stop, and then back to FEMA headquarters,"" McEnany said Monday on ""Outnumbered."""
Trump vs. Harris: The 'October surprise' is already here,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/trump-vs-harris-october-surprise-already-here,2024-10-08T09:13:18Z,"The infamous ""October surprise"" - the black swan event that could bend the arc of the 2024 presidential election -- has arrived.

Hurricane Helene, which clobbered the Southeast recently, is not the surprise; after all, October is hurricane season, and we expect big storms. Rather, it is the disgraceful aftermath - the shockingly poor and tone-deaf response from Vice President Kamala Harris and the White House, the administration lying about FEMA spending hundreds of millions of dollars on illegal immigrants and then warning that emergency funds for hurricane victims may run short. The frantic warnings from liberal news organizations that complaints about the government's relief efforts are ""misinformation"" and speculation that the tardy recovery effort might prevent Trump voters from participating in the upcoming election.

For Harris' campaign, it was the perfect storm. And, it could get even worse as monster Hurricane Milton barrels into Florida, creating even more challenges for the incapable White House.

KJP SLAMMED AFTER HURRICANE HELENE OVER MIXED MESSAGES ON WHETHER FEMA RESOURCES USED FOR MIGRANTS

As early rescue efforts began, Homeland Security head Alejandro Mayorkas announced the federal government was close to running out of funds to help hurricane relief efforts. He said FEMA was ""meeting immediate needs"" but that ""FEMA does not have the funds, to make it through the season."" That, despite President Biden recently signing a stopgap funding bill that included an extra $20 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund. And, despite Mayorkas three months ago assuring the nation that FEMA was ""tremendously prepared"" for hurricane season. Now that Milton threatens even more damage, where will Mayorkas find the funds necessary for the recovery of yet another blockbuster storm?

Soon after, Mayorkas issued that ominous warning about federal fund running low, as bodies were still being discovered in the western towns of North Carolina and thousands were without power or water, Harris posted this on X: ""I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there. To that end, the United States will provide nearly $157 million in additional assistance to the people of Lebanon for essential needs such as food, shelter, water, protection, and sanitation...""

Talk about tone deaf!

The idea...the idea, as an irate Joe Biden might say, that suffering Americans might take second chair to war victims in the Middle East is repugnant and ignited a firestorm on social media. Yes, the federal government budget is vast - too vast- and agencies that send aid overseas are separate from those that help with emergencies at home. But the impression given those trying to dig out from Helene is that their needs were not Kamala's priority.

That impression was reinforced by Harris and President Biden taking five days to finally visit the storm-damaged Southeast. That's the same number of days it took President George W. Bush to travel to Texas in the wake of Hurricane Katrina. Voters read Bush's delay as a sign of indifference; his popularity never recovered.

When Kamala Harris finally arrived at the scene, she announced that FEMA would be giving out $750 checks for immediate aid. Families whose homes and lives had been swallowed by a tsunami of mud were incredulous; $750 does not go very far. FEMA was further mocked for putting out a statement encouraging people, who had no power or cell service, to apply for assistance online or by phone.

Critics were outraged by the paltry sum. Donald Trump Jr. posted on X: ""$750 for Americans in desperate need... $250 BILLION spent in Ukraine with a population of +\- 38 million equals a bit more than $6500 per person in F$&?ing UKRAINE!!! For what? Enough of this madness!""

To be fair, Harris also announced that the feds would in the future provide ""tens of thousands more dollars for folks to help them be able to deal with home repair"" and other needs. In the future.

Our government is not only spending billions on the people of Lebanon and the war in Ukraine; it is also supporting the millions of migrants that Border Czar Harris allowed to enter our country illegally. The Biden-Harris White House and sanctuary cities rolled out the welcome mat, encouraging illegal immigration with free housing, free food, cell phones and other goodies. FEMA has helped fund that effort, leading critics to charge that the Biden-Harris White House is putting people in the country illegally ahead of our own citizens.

White House spokesperson Karine Jean-Pierre has adamantly denied that FEMA money has been spent on illegal immigrants. But there is video of her saying on September 16, 2022, that funding was available ""through FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter Program.... to support humanitarian relief for migrants."" In fact, the agency's Shelter and Services Program (SSP) spent $650 million in fiscal 2023 to assist migrants.

Unhappily, it is not just money that has been in short supply. Help has come too slowly, and some blame the federal government. Reports have circulated of hundreds of GIs arriving in North Carolina but remaining idle awaiting FEMA orders. Some, including Elon Musk's team, have complained that FEMA officials have barred them from delivering critical goods to stranded towns without water or food. The tiny town of Bat Cave, which was almost entirely demolished, was told by FEMA they were on their own because rescue workers could not drive around a ""road closed"" sign, though many helpers managed to do so.

As complaints have rolled in, panicky members of the legacy media have rushed to defend the White House, accusing critics of spreading ""misinformation."" Amazingly, they are even blaming ""misinformation"" for impeding the relief work!

None of this is surprising. The Biden-Harris White House contains few individuals with private sector managerial experience; stories about $8 billion spent to build one charging station or Harris being allocated $42.5 billion to deliver broadband to rural communities but not managing to break ground on a single project, are instructive. The Biden-Harris White House is, at its core, incompetent.

As Milton crashes ashore in Florida, will the Biden-Harris response improve? Or will this be, for Harris campaign, another perfect storm?"
Morning Glory: Trump stands with Israel,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-trump-stands-israel,2024-10-08T09:13:17Z,"Former President Donald Trump agreed to an interview on the first anniversary of the horrific massacre and mass kidnapping in Israel on October 7, 2023. The focus was primarily on Israel of course, but also on the explosion of antisemitism in the United States.

HH: Now Mr. President, when we spoke in April, you said to me that Israel needed to win and win quickly. They are winning, but they're still fighting, and they're now fighting in Lebanon. Do you think Biden and Harris have been holding back Israel from winning?

DT: I do. I think everything they do is the opposite. In particular, him. Now she's a dumber person than him, but he has the worst foreign policy of anybody in history, probably. You know what you do with him? I realized it the other day. You could be one of the greatest foreign policy presidents. All you do is listen to what he says and do the opposite. If you've done the opposite for 30 years with this poor guy, this poor, pathetic guy, if you've done the opposite for 30 years, you would have been successful. But he's never gotten it right. And you know, I don't have to go back into the old secretaries of state and all the people that talk about it.

HH: If Israel hits [Iran's] nuclear sites, will you applaud?

DT: Yeah. I dealt with Kim Jong-un. And he has nuclear weapons. And you tend to speak a little bit differently when they have nuclear weapons.

HH: Yes.

DT: Does that make sense to you?

HH: Yes, it does. Well, Nixon met with Mao, who was the greatest murderer of the 20th Century, because they had nukes. He met with Brezhnev.

DT: Right.

HH: I noticed you didn't meet with Khamenei, and he did not have nukes. Can they be allowed to have nukes?

DT: No, they can't have nukes. No, they can't have nukes. Nukes, if you would see the power of these weapons that I renovated and rebuilt at great cost, I rebuilt the whole military. And then, you know, they gave $85 billion of it away to the Taliban and to Afghanistan. Can you imagine? They gave $85 billion dollars away. They gave everything. This is the worst group of people, these are the worst negotiators in history.

Exchange three:

HH: Let me turn to antisemitism in the United States. Your daughter is Jewish. Some of your grandchildren are Jewish. Your son-in-law is Jewish. Jewish students are not safe on many American campuses. Your alma mater, my alma mater, Biden and Harris have ignored this. I mean, they really have ignored it. If you're president, will you send the DOJ to those campuses, the office of Civil Rights from the Department of Education to enforce the law?

DT: 100%. I mean, the law is being broken. 100%. You wouldn't think you'd even have this. Did you ever think two years ago, three years ago, that you'd ever have this discussion?

HH: No, I didn't.

DT: I'm unbelievable what's happening. And when you see these riots, and you see a lot of people, too. But you know, a lot of the people in that, a lot of those people are Jewish people. You know that. They're Jewish kids.

HH: Oh, yeah. There are some outliers, but most Jewish students are afraid to be overt on places like Harvard and Penn.

DT: Yeah, but then you have other Jewish students that are afraid. Yeah, that's true, and they should be afraid. I never thought I would see this in my life with the campus riots and what they're saying and what they're doing. And they have to put them down quickly. They really have to put them down quickly.

Some pro-Israel Americans would prefer that zero attention be given to the outliers, but as the excellent Commentary Magazine podcast occasionally mentions the insidiousness of Jewish Americans attacking Israel and defending, implicitly or even explicitly, Hamas, then it should not be shocking when the former president notices it too.

I highlight these three exchanges because the result in November's election will reverberate around the world but most especially in Israel.

US ON ALERT FOR POSSIBLE 'VIOLENT EXTREMIST ACTIVITY' ON AMERICANS ONE YEAR AFTER OCT. 7

It seems clear to me that a President Kamala Harris will be the least supportive American president of the Jewish State in Israel's 76-year history.

By contrast, the argument is solid that Trump in his first term was at least the equal of any previous president when it comes to a record of support for Israel in peacetime. (Richard Nixon ordering the Pentagon to ""send everything that can fly"" to Israel in an arms resupply during the 1973 Yom Kippur War is the sole example of when an American president stepped up at a moment of existential peril to Israel and does everything to help it short of sending American forces. Trump did not face such a choice in his first term, but might very well in a second if Iran crosses the nuclear threshold.)

The choice should be clear for any American who supports Israel and for whom the continued existence and vibrancy of the Jewish State and the Middle East writ large is a priority: They should vote for Trump.

Eye of the Storm: Back-to-back hurricanes threaten to upend Harris-Trump presidential showdown,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/eye-storm-hurricanes-theaten-upend-harris-trump-presidential-showdown,2024-10-08T08:10:52Z,"Fox News' Chad Pergram reports on the politics of disaster relief as FEMA pushes back on the 'dangerous' criticism of their Hurricane Helene response.

As the death toll rises and roughly a quarter of a million people remain without power or running water a week and a half after Hurricane Helen tore a path of destruction through the southeast United States, another powerful storm is bearing down on the region.

Hurricane Milton, now an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm, is on course to slam into Florida Wednesday evening.

With four weeks to go until Election Day in November and Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump locked in a bitter margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed President Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene -- North Carolina and Georgia -- among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election - the politics of federal disaster relief are once again front and center on the campaign trail.

Trump has been attacking the vice president and her boss over the federal response to Hurricane Helene for well over a week. Harris, on Monday, fired back, accusing Trump of pushing ""a lot of mis and disinformation.""

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS WEATHER UPDATES ON HURRICANE MILTON

The former president has repeatedly charged that Biden and Harris have been incompetant in their handling of rescue and recovery efforts.

""It is going down as the WORST & MOST INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED 'STORM,' AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, EVER SEEN BEFORE,"" Trump claimed last week.

On Monday, he argued in a social media post that the administration's storm response was ""the WORST rescue operation in the history of the U.S.""

And Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, charged Monday in a ""Fox and Friends"" interview that the administration's efforts were ""incompetence of the highest order.""

The Trump campaign, in announcing Vance would hold a town hall Thursday in Greensboro, North Carolina, argued that Harris ""completely left North Carolina behind in the wake of devastation post-Hurricane Helene.""

And in a blatant pitch for votes, the former president claimed that ""NORTH CAROLINA HAS BEEN VIRTUALLY ABANDONED BY KAMALA!!! DROP HER LIKE SHE DROPPED YOU - VOTE FOR PRESIDENT DONALD J. TRUMP. MAGA2024!""

Trump's repeatedly made unsubstantiated claims as he's targeted Biden and Harris - among them that Republican Gov. Brian Kemp of Georgia had been unable to reach Biden when Helene first tore through the Peach State. Kemp later confirmed that he had already been in contact with the president.

Despite the untruths from the former president, he did beat Biden and Harris to the scene, surveying the storm-damaged region two days before they did last week.

The optics put the president and vice president on defense, and they've been forced to repeatedly correct the record.

The White House has publicized FEMA's [Federal Emergency Management Agency] efforts in assisting the hard-hit states. Biden made back-to-back trips to the southeast last Wednesday and Thursday, as he stopped in the four hardest hit states, and Harris also made two trips to survey damage.

Huddled with Democratic and Republican politicians from the region last week, Biden emphasized that ""in a moment like this, we put politics aside, at least we should put it all aside. We have here -- there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans -- our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can.""

Trump - along with his allies - has repeatedly aimed to tie the storm response to the combustible issue of border security, as he claimed that FEMA funds for the rescue and relief efforts in North Carolina were being diverted to support undocumented migrants.

The Harris campaign, firing back, said that Trump and Vance and their allies have been ""pushing debunked lies about Hurricane Helene response.""

A top North Carolina Republican - Sen. Thom Tillis - asked about the charges, said on the Sunday talk shows that ""I believe that we have to stay focused on rescue operations, recovery operations, clearing operations, and we don't need any of these distractions on the ground.""

Harris, on Monday, called Trump's actions ""extraordinarily irresponsible.""

""It's about him. It's not about you. And the reality is that FEMA has so many resources that are available to folks who desperately need them now, and resources that are about helping people get back on their feet and rebuild and have places to go,"" Harris emphasized.

But longtime Republican strategist David Kochel noted that Trump had been ""very aggressive"" with his initial quick trip to the storm-damaged region.

""I think he put a lot of pressure on them to try to do something,"" Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News. ""He's out there pushing a line that they don't care, they're not doing anything, and I think they're reacting to it.""

Now, with Hurricane Milton bearing down on Florida, the Biden administration highlighted their efforts in a release headlined ""Federal Assistance for Hurricane Helene Exceeds $210 Million, FEMA Prepares for Dual Response with Hurricane Milton Strengthening as it Moves Toward Gulf Coast of Florida.""

As Biden declared a state of emergency in Florida on Monday, Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida said during a news conference that 5,000 National Guardsmen had been mobilized in his state, with another 3,000 on the way.

""We have gotten what we need from the feds,"" DeSantis said. ""The president has approved what we asked for....I'm thankful for that.. Everything we've asked for from President Biden, he's approved.""

This is far from the first time that a tropical storm has impacted a presidential race.

Then-President George H.W. Bush took a political hit over FEMA's disorganized efforts to provide relief in Florida from Hurricane Andrew, which pounded the then-key battleground state weeks before Election Day.

Fast-forward a decade and his son - then-President George W. Bush - likely enjoyed a political bounce in Florida during his 2004 re-election thanks to his aggressive response to Hurricane Charley, which hit in August of that year.

Bush was narrowly re-elected, thanks in large part to carrying the Sunshine State, but his administration's image in handling storms took a major hit the next year, over the botched response in Louisiana to Hurricane Katrina.

As he ran for re-election in 2012, then-President Barack Obama's aggressive response in dealing with Superstorm Sandy -which slammed into the Eastern Seaboard days before the election - likely boosted him to victory.

Trump, in his first year in office, faced criticism as Puerto Rico struggled to recover from a powerful storm. The president was pilloried for throwing paper towels to the crowd as he stopped by a relief center during a storm-related visit to the island.

But the incident - which took place three years before his re-election effort - was vastly overshadowed by his response to the COVID crisis, the worst pandemic to hit the globe in a century."
"Kamala 2.0's challenge? Making more news, and not just with ultra-friendly hosts",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-2-0s-challenge-making-more-news-not-just-ultra-friendly-hosts,2024-10-08T07:11:26Z,"For well over a month, Kamala Harris rode a wave of the most positive press any presidential candidate has gotten in two decades, and her own skills, to turn what had been a lost cause for the Democrats into an extremely tight race.

But does she have a second act?

Kamala 2.0, under constant attack by Donald Trump and the Republicans, doesn't have much new to say. She is conducting a play-it-safe campaign, like a basketball team sitting on a lead and running out the clock.

But Harris doesn't have a lead in the three ""blue wall"" midwestern states she needs to win, and the loss of any one of them could hand Trump the presidency once again.

VANCE-WALZ VP DEBATE ENDED IN A 'DRAW': DEMOCRAT REP. DEBBIE DINGELL

For all the focus on Pennsylvania, Harris leads by 0.7 percent in Michigan - a statistical tie, based on the Real Clear Politics average.

On Sunday's ""Media Buzz,"" Democratic Rep. Debbie Dingell told me her state could go either way.

""The vice president has a problem with union workers,"" Dingell said. ""Many of the men, as well as, quite frankly, African-American young men who have said to me, I was with a group with them last week. 'You know what, Donald Trump talks to us. Democrats take us for granted.'""

The lawmaker recalls how ""everybody got mad at me"" when she predicted in 2016 that Trump would win Michigan - which he did, along with Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

A major problem for Harris is that she doesn't seem to know how to make news. With less than 30 days to go, with many voters understandably believing they don't know her, or enough about her policies, since she took over for Joe Biden, the VP is stitching together parts of her stump speech and recycling the same anecdotes virtually verbatim.

A presidential candidate has to deliver a few new lines, a new proposal, something to break into the news cycle, which is currently being dominated by Trump.

So what's on this week's agenda? Kamala will sit down with Howard Stern (who is totally against his old pal Donald); ""The View,"" where the ladies despise Trump, and Stephen Colbert, who hosted fundraisers for Joe Biden in 2020 and this year.

For good measure, she's also spoken to Alex Cooper, whose podcast, ""Call Your Daddy,"" is about sex.

WHY VANCE EASILY BEAT WALZ IN DEBATE, SOFTENING HIS IMAGE IN THE PROCESS

I'll go out on a limb here and say these sessions are designed to be friendly - not unlike the conversation with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle, who kept agreeing with Harris and had just pronounced Trump a danger to democracy.

In fairness, Harris also sat for a ""60 Minutes"" interview, an invitation declined by Trump.

Look, there's nothing wrong with candidates showing their softer side with unorthodox outlets in our fragmented media universe. We've come a long way since critics scoffed at candidate Bill Clinton answering the ""boxers or briefs"" question on MTV, calling it unpresidential.

On ""Call Your Daddy,"" Harris was actually quite thoughtful in responding to Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying that her kids keep her humble and the VP doesn't have anyone to keep her humble.

Rather than jab at the Arkansas governor, which would have produced a cheap headline, she ruminated that families come in all shapes, bound by blood or love, that she is deeply involved with her stepchildren, and this isn't the 1950s anymore. They also discussed, uh, tampons.

Still, the party is getting nervous. ""Democratic operatives, including some of Kamala Harris' own staffers,"" says Politico, ""are growing increasingly concerned about her relatively light campaign schedule, which has her holding fewer events than Donald Trump and avoiding unscripted interactions with voters and the press almost entirely.""

Since the convention, the veep has spent more than a third of days on meeting and briefings, with no public events.

With early voting under way in more than half the states, Politico describes this ""a do-no-harm, risk-averse approach to the race.""

GEORGIA GOP CHAIR SHARES 2-PRONGED ELECTION STRATEGY AS TRUMP WORKS TO WIN BACK PEACH STATE

Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan, who fervently doesn't want Trump to win, nonetheless is whacks Harris pretty hard:

""She hasn't fleshed out her political intent -- what she stands for, what she won't abide, what she means to establish, what she won't let happen.

What is her essential mission? Is it national 'repair,' is it to 'stabilize' an uncertain country, is it 'relaunch'?..

""She so far hasn't conveyed a sense of intellectual grasp. Her campaign has placed too many chips on the idea of the mood, the vibe, the picture.""

And vibes can only take you so far.

But the VP has certain duties, and spent two days visiting hurricane victims and relief workers in North Carolina and Georgia-which also happens to be good politics. She also met with Volodomyr Zelenskyy.

Harris attended a fundraiser over the weekend. Why bother? Her campaign has already had $400 million roll in. She's already outspending Trump 2-½ to 1 on ads. She doesn't need any more money. What's more, Harris doesn't make news at these fundraisers, which in any event are off camera. A ground game is great, but it has to be married to a winning message.

Here's one more: Dan Pfeiffer, a former top Obama White House official, says on Message Box, his Substack column, that ""the media -- and Politico Playbook in particular -- are fuming over the Harris-Walz media strategy.""

Kamala ""must be on offense at all times -- say new things, be edgy enough to get attention, and dictate the terms, or the campaign could ""take on water...In this media world, there is a never-ending, insatiable appetite for content. Either serve lunch or become the menu...

""Dominating attention is Trump's political superpower...Even when he doesn't have a big moment, Trump speaks so outrageously that it shifts attention to his issues of choice.""

Now it's easy to snipe from the sidelines. For Harris to be neck and neck in the core battleground states means she's obviously done many things right. She had to overhaul the Biden operation and vet a running mate while the campaign was in full swing, like changing the tires on a speeding hot rod. She could still win.

One positive sign: The Harris camp took off the bubble wrap and allowed Tim Walz to appear on ""Fox News Sunday."" This was an attempt at damage control, since he lost the debate so badly to JD Vance.

While Shannon Bream repeatedly pressed the governor on late-term abortions, his Minnesota record and his history of falsehoods and exaggerations, Walz was far more forceful than he'd been in the CBS debate. He ducked certain questions, but an interview format is much better suited to him than friendly exchanges with his opponent.

So on Saturday, Donald Trump returned to Butler, Pa., where roughly three months ago, he was almost assassinated by a loser who couldn't make his high school rifle club but somehow mastered slanted roof technology. It was huge. So huge, the rest of the media had to cover it. First, Trump returns to the scene of his near death, and then opens with this.

MUSK ENERGIZES TRUMP SUPPORTERS AT BUTLER RALLY, 3 MONTHS AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON FORMER PRESIDENT

Yes, Trump's got charts while Biden's got sharts. Elon Musk showed up jumping around like a human embodiment of the First Amendment. All it needed was Hulk Hogan tearing his shirt off or Kid Rock putting a shirt on. The crowd was even bigger this time around, and it's solemn. It was funny and, dare I say it, joyous. Now compare that to the existential prophecies of a future Trump presidency. A ""threat to democracy, dictatorship, chaos."" Was there anything in Butler resembling that?

Tens of thousands of people from all over standing together to hear speeches that painted America as a place worth protecting, where safety matters, where borders matter, where American jobs matter, where our leaders would actually put our country first. All things that a Harris presidency would make disappear faster than an erection on Bikini Day at The View. That sentence started out so well.

Tens of thousands of people, the people that the legacy media demonizes all day long, people who happen to be in the ultimate swing state, by the way. Who do you think, though, our media is going to blame if Trump wins this thing? Just listen to these chuckleheads continue to push violent retribution if Trump wins.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: This is an increasingly desperate person who's preparing for civil war.

MSNBC GUEST: People right now in the Republican Party are, in fact, actively rooting for and inciting a split, you know, a division in the country.

MICHAEL COHEN: What he says he intends to do. And when he turns around and says he intends to use Seal Team Six or the military within which to round up his critics or his opponents, he intends to do it.

MSNBC GUEST: He's putting in place what he needs to disrupt the process and to create enough tension and confusion that you'll have people on the streets protecting and defending him.

So, you get the sense there's going to be chaos if Trump wins. That's the sense they want you to have. It's less an election and more of an extortion. And sadly, they may be right. There will be chaos if Trump wins because it will come from them. What they're saying is if you win, there will be blood, your blood. It's the mafia saying, nice country you got here. It'd be a shame if something were to happen to it. At least the thugs from Goodfellas had style. Democrat fellas look like this. Think about it. Has Kamala Harris articulated a single original policy point?

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

Sure, she mentioned not taxing tips, which she lifted from Trump like a Cartier watch during a smash-and-grab. She doesn't bother with policy because she doesn't have to. Because as the woman who babbles on about not going back from her own administration, it's always followed by 'or else.' Or else disaster, chaos, chaos they seem to be guaranteeing. We've seen their chaos in Chicago, New York, San Fran and Minneapolis. Well, Tim Walz, he missed that one. He was busy fighting ISIS in Iraq with exploding tampons.

Now, some of us might be a bit scared, but that's what they want. But you can't let them blackmail or threaten you into a Democrat win because, clearly, this is their last sure sign of desperation. From a side that doesn't have policy or history or even common sense on their side, only threats. But the good news, like Gerald Nadler's deodorant, it's not working. Tens of thousands of people standing shoulder to shoulder in a field that had the blood of Trump and three others in it showed him that. Trump came back like he promised.

He didn't let them set the limits. They took their best shot, literally, then he boldly returned to the scene of the crime. Like Brian Stelter, returning to steal from the CNN fridge. Trump showed up saying, 'Forget it.' The threats won't stop us. So it wasn't just about Butler, but the election itself. By gathering all those people in the same field where a weaponized nutcase tried to end Trump's run for president, Trump and thousands of others showed that this election can actually be decided on the merits and not under the threat of the left, vowing chaos if they don't get their way.

It's funny, the guy they're telling us will end elections and democracy is actually the one doing the most to preserve it. And tens of thousands joined him. They're ready to fight, fight, fight with a prez who has their backs every step of the way. So let the Dems keep telling you that Team Trump will end America as we know it. And if they're talking about the way we've known it the past four years, let's hope this is one time they're right."

Vice President Kamala Harris said political candidates should have to ""earn"" support from voters, despite previous criticism for becoming the Democratic presidential nominee without having to run in any primary election in 2024.

Harris was asked about why voters still have reservations about her during a ""60 Minutes"" interview that aired Monday night.

""A quarter of registered voters still say they don't know you, they don't know what makes you tick,"" ""60 Minutes,"" journalist Bill Whitaker asked during a sitdown interview. ""Why do you think that is? What's the disconnect?""

BILL MAHER TRASHES KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING 'FULL OF S---' ON ISRAEL, MIDDLE EAST: 'JUST SHUT UP'

""It's an election Bill, and I take it seriously that I have to earn everyone's vote,"" Harris replied. ""This is an election for President of the United States. No one should be able to take for granted that they can just declare themselves a candidate and automatically receive support.""

""You have to earn it and that's what I intend to do,"" she added.

The Democratic Party has been accused by critics of anointing Harris as the party's nominee after Biden abruptly ended his re-election bid following his first debate against former President Trump.

Many Republicans and groups like Black Lives Matter accused the Democratic Party of installing Harris as its nominee and sidestepping the voting process. The Democratic Party coalesced around her, winning enough delegate support to secure the nomination at the Democratic National Convention in August.

SEAN HANNITY: There is one huge reason, and only one reason, that Kamala is now going on and doing any interviews. Her internal poll numbers have got to be horrendous.

She is down in multiple polls in Arizona, Nevada, Wisconsin, Michigan, Pennsylvania, North Carolina and Georgia. The race is even tighter in Virginia, where Kamala holds a slight lead. A brand new Yahoo News poll shows Trump surging nationwide.

Harris is desperately trying to make up ground. That's why she's finally doing friendly interviews, but lapping it up with Trump-hater Howard Stern, those hard-hitting interviewers on ""The View"" and Stephen Colbert, who's dull as dirt, or the ""Call Me Daddy"" podcast, while millions of Americans are suffering the devastating effects of Hurricane Helene and another major hurricane on the way, is not exactly the best look for the vice president when she and Joe Biden have been completely missing in action."

Vice President Kamala Harris was pressed by CBS News' Bill Whitaker about whether it was a ""mistake"" for the Biden administration to go soft on its border policies during a tense exchange on Monday's special election episode of ""60 Minutes.""

""You recently visited the southern border and embraced President Biden's recent crackdown on asylum seekers, and that crackdown produced an almost immediate and dramatic decrease in the number of border crossings,"" Whitaker said. ""If that's the right answer now, why didn't your administration take those steps in 2021?""

""The first bill we proposed to Congress was to fix our broken immigration system, knowing that if you want to actually fix it, we need Congress to act. It was not taken up,"" Harris responded. ""Fast forward to a moment when a bipartisan group of members of the United States Senate, including one of the most conservative members of the United States Senate, got together, came up with a border security bill.

""Well, guess what happened? Donald Trump got word that this bill was afoot and could be passed, and he wants to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem. So he told his buddies in Congress, 'Kill the bill, don't let it move forward.'""

""I've been covering the border for years, and so I know this is not a problem that started with your administration,"" Whitaker said. ""But there was an historic flood of undocumented immigrants coming across the border the first three years of your administration. As a matter of fact, arrivals quadrupled from the last year of President Trump.""

""Was it a mistake to loosen the immigration policies as much as you did?"" Whitaker then asked.

""It's a long-standing problem, and solutions are at hand, and from day one, literally, we have been offering solutions,"" Harris responded.

""What I was asking was, was it a mistake to kind of allow that flood to happen in the first place?"" the veteran CBS News journalist pressed.

""I think the policies that we have been proposing are about fixing a problem, not promoting a problem, okay,"" Harris responded.

""But the numbers did quadruple under your watch,"" Whitaker interjected.

""And the numbers today because of what we have done, we have cut the flow of illegal immigration by half,"" Harris continued, as Whitaker attempted to ask the question a third time. ""We have cut the flow of fentanyl by half, but we need Congress to be able to act, to actually fix the problem."""
Political storm: Harris says DeSantis 'selfish' for reportedly not taking her hurricane-related calls,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/political-storm-harris-desantis-selfish-reportedly-not-taking-her-hurricane-related-calls,2024-10-08T01:35:15Z,"Florida Emergency Management director Kevin Guthrie discusses the harrowing wait the state faces as Hurricane Milton nears less than two weeks after Hurricane Helene.

Vice President Kamala Harris took aim at Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis of Florida on Monday for reportedly not taking her calls regarding federal storm relief efforts as a second powerful hurricane bears down on Florida.

""People are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations...is just utterly irresponsible, and it is selfish,"" Harris charged on Monday. ""It is about political gamesmanship, instead of doing the job that you took an oath to do, which is to put the people first.""

The vice president's comments came a couple of hours after reports from NBC and later ABC News that the Florida governor was not taking calls from Harris regarding storm recovery efforts, citing unnamed aides to the governor who said the calls seemed political in nature.

Asked about ther reports at a hurricane news conference, DeSantis said he wasn't aware Harris was trying to reach him.

""I didn't know that she had called. I'm not sure who they called. They didn't call me,"" he said. ""It wasn't anything that anybody in my office did, in terms of saying it was political.""

Asked again about the report, the governor reiterated ""I didn't know that she had called.""

The dispute comes as Hurricane Milton, now an extremely dangerous Category 5 storm, is on course to slam into Florida Wednesday evening.

Milton is bearing down on Florida as the death toll rises and roughly a quarter of a million people remain without power or running water a week and a half after Hurricane Helen tore a path of destruction through Florida, Georgia, South and North Carolina, Tennessee, and parts of Virginia.

President Biden made stops last week in the Carolinas, Georgia, and Florida to survey storm damage from Hurricane Helene. While Biden was in Florida, DeSantis was holding a separate press event across the state in another area damaged from the storm.

""We were in Florida, we invited the governor of Florida to come, it was his decision not to attend,"" White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said Monday. ""The president has reached out around Hurricane Helene. He reached out. It is up to the governor, it is really up to the governor.""

The White House said hours later that the president held separate calls with DeSantis and Tampa Mayor Jane Castor ""to get a firsthand report on recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene, and to discuss preparations for Hurricane Milton.""

According to the White House, Biden urged the governor and the mayor to ""call him directly if there is anything that can be done to further support the response and recovery efforts.""

Asked about the federal response, DeSantis said during his news conference that ""we have gotten what we need from the feds....the president has approved what we asked for....I'm thankful for that.""

""Everything we've asked for from President Biden, he's approved,"" DeSantis highlighted.

With four weeks to go until Election Day in November and Harris and former President Trump locked in a bitter margin-of-error showdown in the race to succeed Biden in the White House, and with two of the hardest-hit states from Helene -- North Carolina and Georgia -- among the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 election - the politics of federal disaster relief are once again front and center on the campaign trail.

Trump, for a week and a half, has been repeatedly attacking Biden and Harris over the federal response to Hurricane Helene. Harris, on Monday, clapped back, accusing Trump of pushing ""a lot of mis and disinformation.""

Fox News host Jesse Watters discusses possible concern among Democrats about Vice President Kamala Harris' lack of media interviews on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

JESSE WATTERS: It's getting spooky. Democrats haunted by the echoes of Hillary Clinton. That's from Politico. Kamala went from being the next Obama to being Hillary. They're worried she's running the same ""Play it safe"" campaign.

Up to this point, she's had about the same number of events as Hillary. And 'Crooked' had pneumonia. Since the DNC, Kamala has spent half of her time in D.C., a third of it without any public appearances. Trump is everywhere. Anxious Dems wonder why Harris isn't. Kamala has been a ghost, and even Vegas is spooked.

Trump's up by seven points in the betting markets. Look at that. And CNN is gearing up for a horror show.

Obama world doesn't find it funny. Remember, Kamala was his idea. David Axelrod says Harris needs to step it up. It's only the most difficult oral exam on the planet for the most difficult job.

CNN's Brian Stelter claims 'The View' will have 'sharp' questions for Kamala Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/cnns-brian-stelter-claims-the-view-have-sharp-questions-kamala-harris,2024-10-08T01:09:54Z,"CNN chief media analyst Brian Stelter claimed Monday that the left-wing daytime talk show ""The View"" will have tough questions for Vice President Kamala Harris this week.

Stelter, who recently returned to the network after being ousted two years ago, spoke about both former President Trump and Harris' media strategies on Monday as election day nears. Harris in particular has been criticized for avoiding interviews after she took up the nomination from President Biden, but now appears to be on what CNN referred to as a ""media blitz.""'

""Well, she's on '60 Minutes' tonight. That's the most watched news magazine in the United States. Donald Trump initially agreed to be on '60 Minutes,' then he backed out. I feel like he's getting off pretty easy,"" Stelter said. ""Imagine if Harris had agreed to be on '60 Minutes' and then backed out. I think she would have been vigorously criticized. So, Trump choosing not to do '60 Minutes,' Harris is on there. That will certainly be an example of tough questioning of the vice president.""

TRUMP CAMPAIGN DENIES IT EVER AGREED TO '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW AFTER CBS NEWS CLAIMED HE BACKED OUT

Stelter went on to note that Harris will be on ABC's ""The View"" on Tuesday, claiming he had been assured the co-hosts will have difficult questions for the Democratic candidate. ""I was talking to producers of 'The View' last night. They have some sharp questions for her as well,"" he reported.

SUNNY HOSTIN VENTS ABOUT CHARLAMAGNE THA GOD FAILING TO ENDORSE BIDEN ON 'THE VIEW': 'IT WAS IRRESPONSIBLE'

""And let's remember, sometimes it's these non-traditional formats that actually reveal a lot about candidates. Remember when Kamala Harris was sitting down with Oprah Winfrey a couple of weeks ago, and that's when Harris said, 'If somebody breaks into my house, they are getting shot.' That was a very revealing soundbite, even though it was a friendly interview for Harris,"" he said.

Stelter's claim that ""The View"" will have sharp questions for Harris seems to contradict the show's political record, as the co-hosts have been openly anti-Trump and even slam those who fail to pledge to vote for the Democratic nominee.

On Friday, co-host Joy Behar implored Republican voters to put aside their party affiliation and vote for the Democratic Party just once to get rid of Trump, saying, ""Just do it this one time. Do it this one time. Vote for the Democrat to save the country.""

Former Trump staffer and ""The View"" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin is set to join former GOP lawmaker Liz Cheney and other anti-Trump Republicans for an event in Pennsylvania this week to warn of the dangers of re-electing Trump.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS IN 'DANGER ZONE' AS AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT COUNTRY'S DIRECTION, SAYS CNN DATA GURU

Co-hosts of ""The View"" have blasted New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for refusing to pledge his support first to Biden and then his successor for the nomination, Harris.

""You cannot throw away your vote!"" co-host Sunny Hostin told Christie when Biden was still in the race in mid-July.

After facing continued pushback from co-hosts, Christie eventually responded, ""I'm sorry that I care for what people stand for. I apologize. I'm not gonna pre-commit to it! Let them perform and earn my vote! People should have their vote earned!""

In September, after Harris became the nominee, Christie stood by his position that he was still undecided.

On Monday, Stelter spoke further about Harris and Trump's parallel media strategies to court young women and men, respectively.

""That's why I thought 'Call Her Daddy' was really interesting as well. The interview actually revealed a lot about the candidate, and ultimately, that's what the Harris campaign is trying to do, in the same way that the Trump campaign is going on influencer podcasts, really trying to appeal to young men, doing YouTube shows and things like that,"" he said.

""Harris is trying to do these non-traditional formats like Stephen Colbert tomorrow night or Howard Stern tomorrow afternoon, but I just I think it's notable that sometimes we hear a lot and there are actually a lot of newsworthy comments in these interviews,"" he added.

Reporter's Notebook: All about the politics of disaster relief,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/politics-disaster-relief,2024-10-07T23:16:37Z,"Fox News' Chad Pergram reports on the politics of disaster relief as FEMA pushes back on the 'dangerous' criticism of their Hurricane Helene response.

Republicans are excoriating the Biden/Harris administration for how it responded to Hurricane Helene in North Carolina, Tennessee and other parts of the South. This is now about to be a double whammy as Hurricane Milton bears down on Florida.

It unfolds amid a tight presidential election. So the disaster response is now infused with politics in swing states like North Carolina and Georgia. There is also a competitive but not top-tier Senate race in Florida.

Storms can disrupt the typical electorate. The usual people who vote might not make it to the polls. It's hard to care about voting if you're low on food, lack electricity and can't even make it out of the holler in western North Carolina because Helene wrecked the road.

'IMMEDIATELY RECONVENE': SCOTT URGES SCHUMER TO RECALL SENATE AMID HELENE'S DEVASTATION

Pray tell, where should you vote in Tampa or Sarasota if your basement is swamped by Milton - after getting drenched when Helene spun through a few weeks ago? You were going to vote at the school down the street. But now it lacks power. You're now living at your sister's house inland. But you're not registered to vote there ...

You see what we're getting at.

Republicans are hammering the Biden/Harris administration for its response to the storm.

""It's like the DMV at industrial scale,"" said Republican vice presidential nominee and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, on Fox. ""It is incompetence of the highest order.""

""At the federal level, this has been a massive failure,"" said House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La. ""When you talk to the people who are directly affected, they will tell you that this has been an abject failure. FEMA has lost sight of its core mission. The administration has not shown that they were prepared for this eventuality in this terrible disaster.""

""Kamala Harris has left them stranded. This is the worst response to a storm or a catastrophe or a hurricane that we've ever seen. Probably worse than Katrina. And that's hard to beat, right?"" asked former President Trump.

Storm responses are challenging. Hurricane Andrew was a powerful Category 5 storm that swept through Florida in August 1992. Former President George H.W. Bush's tepid response to Andrew slashed his support in Florida. ""Bush 41"" wound up narrowly winning Florida, besting former President Clinton by less than 2%. Bush won Florida by 22 points four years earlier. Moreover, the response to Hurricane Andrew raised questions about the competence of the administration weeks before the election. It's believed that cost Bush a few points nationwide.

When Clinton took office, he immediately beefed up FEMA to prepare and respond to other natural disasters.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

So, part of this tactic is the natural extension of Republicans to undercut the Biden/Harris administration at nearly every turn. This is another component of the GOP narrative that the administration can't handle the economy. Can't handle foreign policy. Can't handle the border.

Did someone say the border?

""We give $20 billion a year to FEMA. And unfortunately, they have drained everything dry,"" said Sen. Tommy Tuberville, R-Ala., on Fox Business. ""We spent $200 billion in Ukraine. We spent $220-$500 a month on our illegal aliens.""

This is where things get tricky.

FEMA is under the aegis of the Department of Homeland Security. DHS runs a program that sends money to cities besieged by the illegal migrant crisis. Some of the money goes for food and shelter for those in the country illegally. But it also helps those towns cope by addressing strains on their medical systems and other services.

Money for disaster recovery and migrant assistance constitute two separate line items in the DHS budget. Congress approved money for both these programs. In fact, some Republicans would prefer to spend more to help their communities grapple with an infusion of illegal immigration.

SPEAKER JOHNSON ADDRESSES CLAIMS FEMA DIVERTED FUNDS TO IMMIGRATION EFFORTS: 'AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE DISGUSTED'

About $640 million currently goes to assist these towns beset by an influx of illegal migrants. But some lawmakers would like that to spike to as much as $3 billion next year.

Rep. Nancy Mace, R-S.C., introduced legislation to halt the migrant assistance program. And Johnson blurred the line between FEMA disaster aid and migrants and the border.

""FEMA should be involved and the Federal Emergency Management Association. Their mission is to help people in times like this of natural disaster. Not to be engaged in using any pool of funding from any account for resettling illegal aliens who have come across the border,"" said Johnson on Fox.

Other Republicans believe this may be an opportunity to recalibrate spending overall. Keep in mind that many Republicans look askance at foreign aid to Ukraine.

""As an elected official, it's our responsibility to put Americans first. Whether you're in Florida, in my district or you're anywhere in the union, I think that it's important for us to prioritize Americans and restore hope and let them know they're not forgotten,"" said Rep. Cory Mills, R-Fla., on Fox.

But some Republicans compared issues with FEMA's response to how the administration addresses other subjects.

KJP SLAMMED AFTER HURRICANE HELENE OVER MIXED MESSAGES ON WHETHER FEMA RESOURCES USED FOR MIGRANTS

""This administration seems to have no problem finding money when they want to spend it on their priorities. When they need hundreds of billions of dollars to pay off student loans for graduate students and gender studies programs, they somehow find it. When it's trying to get helicopters to deliver food and water and cellular service and lifesaving medicine into these mountain valleys, they somehow can't seem to find the money,"" declared Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., on NBC.

FEMA Administrator Deanne Criswell castigated Republicans for suggesting FEMA was focused on other issues rather than the storms.

""It's frankly ridiculous and just plain false. This kind of rhetoric is not helpful to people,"" said Criswell on ABC.

Before leaving Washington, Congress green-lighted $20 billion for FEMA's Disaster Relief Fund (DRF) as part of the interim spending plan to avoid a government shutdown. But Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas muddled matters when he said FEMA had enough funds to respond to Helene for ""immediate needs"" but not enough to get through ""the season.""

The ""season"" to which Mayorkas refers is the annual hurricane ""season."" It stretches through Nov. 30. Note that Mayorkas made this remark when there was the potential for another storm, but Milton hadn't yet formed in the Gulf of Mexico.

Some Republicans pounced on Mayorkas. But after considering the severity of Helene, it will likely draw down the DRF for ""immediate needs."" The key phrase here is ""immediate needs."" Milton will probably do the same. That's why Congress must likely tackle disaster relief in at least two tranches when it returns to session in November. Lawmakers will need to refill the DRF. And the price tags will start to roll in for Helene and Milton. That's to say nothing of outstanding disasters like Hurricane Beryl in Texas, tornadoes in Iowa, a typhoon on Guam and wildfires in Hawaii.

FEMA HAS FUNDS NEEDED FOR 'IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY,' DESPITE MAYORKAS' WARNING

However, Johnson is unwilling to summon lawmakers back to Washington to grapple with disasters.

""You don't just send estimates to the federal government. You send specific needs and requests based upon the actual damages. And that takes some time, especially with storms of this magnitude. So Congress will do its job,"" said Johnson on Fox.

So, lawmakers must first reload the DRF for future immediate needs, then mete out bigger chunks of change for Americans to cope with the impacts of Helene and Milton. The government funding deadline is Dec. 20. It's possible that the latter chunk of funding is folded into spending measures around Christmas.

But as for the politics? The election is fast approaching. The storms could impact voting this fall. And while Helene and Milton will certainly leave a mark meteorologically, they will probably leave a mark electorally, too."

Former Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney officially endorsed Vice President Harris for the Oval Office, breaking from the GOP to hit the campaign trail with the Democrat ticket in the key battleground state of Wisconsin last week.

Fox News Digital traveled to Casper, Wyoming, over the weekend to speak to voters about their thoughts on the upcoming election and Cheney snubbing the Republican presidential ticket in favor of endorsing Harris this cycle. Voters in the Cowboy State overwhelmingly admonished Cheney for the endorsement, with some slamming her as a ""traitor"" and ""turncoat.""

""I'm not impressed with that at all,"" Clark Johnson told Fox News Digital when asked about his thoughts on Cheney campaigning with Harris last week in Wisconsin.

""I think it's ridiculous. I think she's a traitor to the country,"" another Wyomingite, Gunner Berg, said of the campaign event.

KAMALA HARRIS TEAMS UP WITH LIZ CHENEY IN BIRTHPLACE OF REPUBLICAN PARTY

Cheney, who is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is a vocal critic of former President Trump, putting her at odds with the Republican Party and her former constituents, who overwhelmingly supported Trump in his 2016 and 2020 elections. Wyoming is again expected to vote red this election.

The vast majority of voters who spoke to Fox Digital from Casper said they are no fan of Cheney's and that she would unlikely hold another elected office in Wyoming due to her politics.

""I'm definitely not a fan, and it definitely kind of turned some tables there,"" Dillon Sigman said, adding that he does not believe Cheney could again successfully run for office in Wyoming.

""I think Liz Cheney, who originally was a Wyoming person that moved to Connecticut and then returned to Wyoming wearing cowboy blue jeans and a cowboy rodeo belt buckle and seated herself, completely flipped and became a turncoat. Liz has gone totally Democratic and appears to be down the road of the DEI inclusion and all the other dysfunctional things that are going on in her government,"" said a Wyoming resident who identified himself as ""Ralph.""

""I support her decision to campaign for whoever she chooses. However, I do not think that she is a voice for the Wyoming people. The majority of people I know do not back Kamala Harris or that campaign,"" Alicia Kellch told Fox Digital.

Kellch said it is unlikely Cheney would be re-elected in Wyoming if she were to pursue such an avenue, adding that she believes many people who initially voted for Cheney feel ""sold out once they got her in office and realized what her true intentions were.""

Chuck Kucera added in an interview that Cheney is a ""backstabber,"" quipping that a Harris campaign event is ""probably a good place for her.""

John Shelton said Cheney could ""never"" run for office again in Wyoming and that he wouldn't vote for her even ""if she's the last one to be voted for.""

One Wyoming resident told Fox Digital that Cheney teaming up with Harris didn't ""bother"" him and didn't view it as an issue, while noting that ""most folks in Wyoming don't agree with"" Cheney endorsing Harris.

TRUMP CALLS LIZ CHENEY A 'LOW IQ WAR HAWK' AFTER APPEARANCE IN SUPPORT OF HARRIS

Another woman, Randi Chepke, said she's ""thrilled that Liz Cheney is supporting Kamala Harris,"" arguing that Cheney is ""putting our country above her party.""

Chepke added that Cheney's endorsement of Harris will ""absolutely"" encourage some Republican voters to cast ballots for Harris next month.

""I think that she is a die-hard conservative and that she is stating her case about why she thinks it's important to put democracy first. And, you know, frankly, democracy is much more important than the cost of a loaf of bread or a gallon of gas at this point in our lives,"" Chepke said.

Cheney joined Harris in Ripon, Wisconsin, which bills itself as the birthplace of the GOP, on Thursday, and formally endorsed Harris for president.

""I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

LIZ CHENEY CALLS SPEAKER JOHNSON 'DANGEROUS' FOR HELPING TRUMP 'UNDERMINE OUR REPUBLIC'

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self, a true patriot.""

Cheney was the third-most powerful Republican in Congress from 2019 to 2021 but saw her rising star fade in the party as she launched repeated attacks against Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.

""What is important is to recognize we just had a violent mob assault the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to prevent us from carrying out our constitutional duty,"" Cheney said on Jan. 6 after Trump supporters stormed into the Capitol.

""There is no question that the president formed the mob. The president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob. This is what America is not.""

HOUSE JAN 6 COMMITTEE DELETED MORE THAN 100 ENCRYPTED FILES DAYS BEFORE GOP TOOK MAJORITY: SOURCES

Cheney went on to vote to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting an insurrection, sat on the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack to investigate the protest and has continued leveling attacks on Trump this year.

""I ask you to stand in truth. To reject the depraved cruelty of Donald Trump,"" Cheney told the Harris supporters in Wisconsin last week.

Trump sounds alarm on illegal immigrant murderers: 'A lot of bad genes in our country',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-sounds-alarm-illegal-immigrant-murderers-bad-genes-in-country,2024-10-07T22:26:45Z,"Former President Trump discusses new details on the assassination attempt in Butler, Pa. in an exclusive interview with The Ingraham Angle airing Monday at 7 p.m. ET.

Former President Trump on Monday described illegal immigrant murderers as having ""bad genes"" and warned that there are ""a lot of bad genes in our country"" as illegal immigrant crime remains a top issue for voters ahead of the November election.

""How about allowing people to come to an open border, 13,000 of which were murderers, many of them murdered far more than one person, and they're now happily living in the United States,"" the 2024 Republican presidential nominee told radio host Hugh Hewitt.

Trump appeared to be referring to the more than 13,000 illegal immigrants in the U.S. who are on Immigration and Customs Enforcement's non-detained docket with a conviction for homicide. The data was revealed in a letter to lawmakers last month. Some of those, although it is unclear how many, will be in federal or state prisons, and some came into the U.S. in prior administrations. The data says that, among those not in detention, there are 425,431 convicted criminals and 222,141 with pending criminal charges.

NEW POLL REVEALS TRUMP HAS SIGNIFICANT LEAD ON IMMIGRATION, BORDER SECURITY IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

The data revelation has again fired up the issue of illegal immigrant crime, which has been a top concern for many voters amid a massive border security crisis in which record numbers were seen at the border and a number of high-profile crimes committed allegedly by illegal immigrants.

""You know, now a murderer, I believe this, it's in their genes. And we got a lot of bad genes in our country right now,"" he said.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF THE BORDER SECURITY CRISIS

Trump appeared to be referring only to murderers, but some media outlets quickly pounced on Trump's words and accused him of referring to immigrants more broadly. An NBC News headline described it as the ""latest disparagement of migrants"" from the former president.

The Washington Post, Politico and other mainstream media outlets also echoed this same narrative. Mediaite described Trump's comment as ""chilling"" and White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, ""That type of language is hateful, it's disgusting, it's inappropriate. It has no place in our country.""

Trump has promised to take a tougher line on illegal immigration as well as some forms of legal immigration. He has promised to launch a massive deportation campaign if elected. He has also promised to finish the border wall that he started in his first administration and end Biden-era parole programs that have brought hundreds of thousands of migrants into the U.S.

Polls generally show that Trump is leading his Democrat opponent, Vice President Harris, on the issues of immigration and border security. Republicans have said that the Biden administration encouraged and fueled the border crisis by rolling back Trump-era policies and expanding catch-and-release.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Harris has sought to position herself as the candidate better suited to handle border security, pointing to her past as a prosecutor who went after transnational criminal organizations. She has also backed a bipartisan border security bill unveiled this year that would surge funding for the border and also limit some asylum entries.

Harris and the Biden administration have accused Trump of opposing that bill for political purposes, but conservatives have said the bill would only codify high levels of illegal immigration.

Meanwhile, border encounters are down sharply at the border, with a drop of more than 50% since the summer. The administration puts that down in part to an executive order signed by President Biden that limits asylum entries into the U.S. Harris recently supported a move to toughen up that order further."

While Olbermann doesn't want the government to work with Musk, the former MSNBC host posted the video to X, the platform formerly known as Twitter that is owned by Musk.

Olbermann accused Musk of spreading ""potentially fatal disinformation and misinformation about FEMA's recovery efforts and the impact in the effected states,"" as the Biden-Harris administration has been criticized after sending mixed messages on whether FEMA resources were used to support migrants.

""He is also now working in an in-kind donation turning Twitter X into a Trump advertising campaign. It's time to cancel all the contracts and re-assess his immigration status, and hopefully deport him the hell out of the country,"" Olbermann said.

""If we can't do that by conventional means, President Biden, you have presidential immunity,"" Olbermann continued. ""Get Elon Musk the F out of our country and do it now.""

Olbermann's rant comes on the heels of Musk joining Trump on stage at a campaign rally during his first return to Butler, Pennsylvania since facing an assassination attempt at the hands of 20-year-old gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks at the site just 12 weeks prior.

""The true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire,"" Musk said.

""We had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs and another who was fist pumping after getting shot,"" he continued. ""America is the home of the brave, and there's no truer test than courage under fire, so who do you want representing America?""

The crowd erupted, waving signs that read ""Never Surrender"" and ""Fight, Fight, Fight"" behind the stage.

Musk, who has outspokenly defended free speech, warned that next month's Nov. 5 face-off between Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris will be the ""most important election of our lifetime,"" with basic freedoms that are the bedrock of democracy at stake.

""This is a must-win situation,"" Musk told the crowd of 60,000.

Olbermann, the far-left firebrand known for his stormy exits from MSNBC and ESPN, has been among the most outspoken critics of Trump, even moving out of his luxury New York City apartment building because it was owned by him.

He once claimed that Trump and his family had done more damage to the U.S. than 9/11 mastermind Usama bin Laden. Olbermann also once tweeted at then-first daughter Ivanka Trump and called her father a ""neo-Nazi"" and a ""racist."" Olbermann frequently used profanity to criticize Trump.

Olbermann famously walked away from ESPN ahead of the 2020 election so he could speak out against Trump on YouTube and social media.

Aside from supporting Trump, Olbermann took issue with Musk, writing, ""Yup,"" to caption a video of White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre insisting last week that FEMA resources were not used on migrants despite a 2022 video of her saying otherwise. This has been a hot topic as Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said Wednesday that FEMA, which he oversees, may not have enough funds to get through the hurricane season.

The White House has said FEMA funds spent on the migrant crisis came from a different funding stream, and those expenditures did not impact the part of FEMA's budget reserved for disaster relief.

LAURA INGRAHAM: What I saw in Butler,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/laura-ingraham-what-i-saw-butler,2024-10-07T21:42:59Z,"There are four weeks left until Election Day and in many states, voting has already started. According to every analyst, the race is going to be extremely close. And over the weekend, President Trump returned to Butler, Pennsylvania - where he survived an assassination attempt in July. The event - one of the most powerful he has ever done - created a unique opportunity to assess the status of the race, and President Trump's place in American history. Here are some observations:

First, the Musk Factor. His appearance for Trump and his urgent appeal to voters is monumental. He speaks for a new bloc of highly educated voters who were not traditionally Republicans yet who recognize that President Trump must win in order to preserve our constitutional freedoms. For months now, an array of former Democrats - including Robert Kennedy, Jr., former Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and RFK's former running mate Nicole Shanahan - have been warning us that the people supporting Vice President Kamala Harris have built a political machine so powerful that it threatens our whole political system.

TRUMP REVEALS NEW DETAILS OF FIRST ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT IN EXCLUSIVE INTERVIEW: 'IT WAS THE CRAZIEST DAY'

Consider what Harris's supporters have done in recent years:

Elon Musk understands that if these people win again - if they can take a non-qualified puppet like Harris and put her in the White House - then none of us is safe.

Second, J.D. Vance continues to out-perform and impress. This should not be surprising to anyone who has followed him over the past few years (including his frequent appearances on ""The Ingraham Angle""). His rise has been one of the greatest developments of this year.

DAVID MARCUS: TRUMP'S DEFIANT SUPPORTERS FLOCK TO BUTLER RALLY WITH RENEWED CONFIDENCE

When the year began, many in Washington hoped that if they could beat President Trump one more time, then the America First movement he leads would be broken. They were openly rooting for people like former Rep. Liz Cheney to resume her seat in the GOP. They expected that after these elections, the Republican Party would go back to its role of serving as the establishment's junior partner. But now - after his crushing the vice-presidential debate - the establishment is learning that the 40-year-old Vance is a compelling politician who will likely be a national figure for the next 30 years.

Yet Vance is not an anomaly. Under President Trump's leadership, the GOP has developed a deep bench of talented leaders - such as Sens. Marco Rubio, Josh Hawley, Tom Cotton, entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy, Govs. Ron DeSantis, and Glenn Youngkin - who are ready to put their own stamp on this agenda. This crop of leaders will continue to grow the GOP into a multi-ethnic, multi-racial force for working-class people.

TRUMP HOLDS CAMPAIGN RALLY IN BUTLER, PENNSYLVANIA, MONTHS AFTER JULY ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT

Third, is Trump himself. The sheer size of the crowd in Butler spoke volumes. The atmosphere was electric. This time, the security was tight, sharpshooters on every visible roof.

President Trump's success has rested on his ability to convince tens of millions of voters that he fights for their interests. Love, gratitude, defiance and patriotism were on full display on the Butler fairgrounds. They are not a threat to democracy - they are simply smart enough to understand how the Washington D.C. Cabal has torn apart America.

Patrick Henry would recognize this type of patriot, as would Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln. Most importantly, they are not mindless drones who do what they are told - if you're looking for mindless drones, check out the Network Hacks who take whatever position the Democrats' donors tell them to take. These are good, decent patriots who are trying to save a country they love.

Finally, I saw President Trump. For anyone who has covered politics over the last 30 years, it is obvious that President Trump is really the only person we have covered who truly deserves a place in the history books. Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama were talented and clever politicians, but they were never willing to say or do anything that really challenged the rich and powerful. The only other GOP administrations, besides Trump, since 1988 - the two Bush administrations - will not be remembered as transformative.

But President Trump has changed America. He has beaten the establishment so badly on economic issues that they have mostly given up trying to talk about them. His foreign policy was so much more successful than theirs that they don't want Harris talking about those issues either.

He has been vilified, impeached, indicted by the most powerful people in the world - he has faced unlimited opposition funding from some of the richest people in the world - and he just keeps fighting.

He is in a stronger position today than he was at this same point in both 2016 and 2020. By promoting Vance and other young Republicans, he has built a movement that will survive him whatever happens in November. And he has shown incredible physical courage by pressing forward in a situation where we have troubling evidence of sheer incompetence on behalf of the Secret Service.

Fifty years from now, one hundred years from now - two hundred years from now - no one will care about Joe Biden or Kamala Harris or Tim Walz. They will be regarded as mouthpieces for a failed establishment. But historians will still be trying to understand President Trump and his movement.

What I hope they will see is what I saw in Butler: Even after two impeachments, endless lawfare, and an assassin's bullet, Trump was a man who refused to give up in his battle for the forgotten working people of America."
Karine Jean-Pierre leaves briefing after Doocy questions Lebanon funding during hurricane season,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/karine-jean-pierre-leaves-briefing-after-doocy-questions-lebanon-funding-during-hurricane-season,2024-10-07T21:14:19Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre got into a heated exchange with Fox News Channel's Peter Doocy over the White House sending aid to Lebanon during the hurricane season, which has had devastating effects on North Carolina.

Harris pledged Saturday to send $157 million of ""additional assistance"" to Lebanon while Israel attacks Hezbollah infrastructure and targets in the country. Harris argued the country was ""facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation."" Doocy asked Jean-Pierre why the Biden administration was soliciting congressional input before sending disaster loan funds to North Carolina, but not to send the slush funds to a foreign country.

""On this issue of funding, the administration has money to send to Lebanon without Congress coming back. But Congress does have to come back to approve money to send to people in North Carolina. Do I have that right?"" Doocy said.

""The president and the vice president has had a robust whole-of-government response to this... More than $200 million, ...for the disaster help,"" Jean-Pierre responded, adding that ""people want to do disinformation, misinformation, which is dangerous.""

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

Doocy asked whether the president's letter to Congress soliciting their help was misinformation.

""No. The way you're asking me the question is misinformation. There is money that we are allocating to the impacted areas, and there's money there to help people who truly need it. There are survivors who need the funding, who need the funding. And it's there,"" she said.

""You can't call a question you don't like misinformation,"" Doocy said.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

""No, what you're asking me is why Congress needs to come back and do their job. That's what you're asking me. Congress needs to come back and do their job and provide extra assistance, extra funding for the disaster relief fund. That's what Congress needs to do,"" she responded. ""You may not want that, but that's okay. That's what this president wants, and that's what the vice president wants.""

Jean-Pierre then stormed out of the briefing room.

The administration has been accused of mismanaging funds after Homeland Security's Alejandro Mayorkas said Wednesday ""FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.""

Critics on social media were quick to slam Harris for touting the foreign aid to Lebanon, arguing that many North Carolina residents are struggling to recover from Hurricane Helene.

""Kamala is touting giving money to the people of Lebanon-while stiff-arming the humanitarian crisis in North Carolina,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said on X. ""This is Kamala's Katrina.""

""Could this be any more tone deaf? We have Americans suffering and in danger right now after the hurricane and this is what Kamala has to announce. America First!"" Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., said on X.

The controversial tweet comes as the Biden administration has continued to face backlash for its handling of Helene, with former President Trump calling the federal response to the disaster the ""most incompetently managed 'storm,' at the federal level, ever seen before."""
"Kamala Harris courts disillusioned Arab Americans over Jewish groups, records show",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-courts-disillusioned-arab-americans-over-jewish-groups,2024-10-07T19:30:40Z,"Fox News' Trey Yingst reports the latest on the devastation from the Oct. 7 attack on Israel one year later. The 'Outnumbered' panel also discusses the tragedy as the Israel-Hamas war rages on.

Vice President Kamala Harris appears to prioritize winning back Arab American and Muslim voters who were dejected by President Joe Biden's handling of war in the Middle East over courting the Jewish voter.

That's according to an internal review of her calendar meetups with both groups since becoming the Democratic nominee for president.

Harris met with Arab American advocates ahead of a campaign event in Flint, Michigan, on Friday. That followed a meeting with activists with the Pro-Palestinian Uncommitted Movement, which has declined to endorse her, in Michigan in July.

Her public schedule hasn't included meetings with Jewish groups since meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu privately in July, after she declined to preside over his joint address to Congress.

In August, her campaign nominated Ilan Goldenberg as its liaison to the Jewish community, and on Aug. 15, Harris sent campaign officials to meet with Jewish leaders in Michigan. In September, she called the parents of the late Hersch Goldberg-Polin, the American hostage slain by Hamas. Fox News Digital could not find a record of any other face-to-face Jewish outreach by Harris.

Wa'el Alzayat, the CEO of Emgage Action, told CNN that Harris had told the Arab group on Friday ""that she also wants the war to end and that she will do all she can to work in this regard.""

The Arab Americans told her she needed ""to show distance between how she would govern on this matter with the current administration policies, which we don't agree with.""

HARRIS REFUSES TO CALL NETANYAHU A 'CLOSE ALLY' ONE YEAR AFTER OCTOBER 7

Michigan, which Biden narrowly won in 2020, is a crucial battleground state this election. It has the second-highest population of Arab American residents, who make up around 3% of its population.

On the anniversary of the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks, former President Donald Trump will speak to Jewish community leaders at one of his Florida resorts in Doral. Harris will briefly speak to journalists and plant a pomegranate tree on the grounds of the Vice President's Residence in honor of those killed a year ago.

One year on from the outbreak of war with Hamas in Gaza, Israel is now entrenched in war on other fronts too. The Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) recently launched a ground offensive in Lebanon to fight Hezbollah, and last week missiles rained down on Tel Aviv -- though most were intercepted -- from Iran.

Jewish Americans tend to vote Democratic -- in 2020, Biden won 69% of their vote. Trump won 30%.

Harris' focus on Arab American outreach could in part be due to shifting polling within the community and an aggressive outreach from the Trump campaign to capitalize on that.

Arab Americans also historically favor Democrats -- but new polling suggests that could change. Of likely voters in the community, Arab Americans favor Trump over Harris 46% to 42%, according to new polling by the Arab American Institute.

Trump has been airing ads aimed at Arab Americans in Michigan, and his former director of national intelligence Ric Grenell and his daughter Tiffany Trump's father-in-law Massad Boulos, a Lebanese American businessman, have been leading his outreach to the community.

HARRIS WON'T SAY WHETHER BIDEN ADMIN HAS ANY 'SWAY' OVER NETANYAHU

""His outreach now is much better, much different than it was in 2016 and 2020,"" Adel Ayoub, leader of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, told Fox News Digital of Trump.

Biden won 60% of the Arab American vote in 2020, but support from that community has cratered since the Hamas attacks of Oct. 7, 2023.

The National Uncommitted movement launched a campaign calling on voters to cast uncommitted ballots in swing state primaries to send a message to Democrats, and more than a million did so.

Harris spoke with leaders of the Uncommitted Movement in August. That same month, her campaign manager met with Arab and Muslim leaders.

Trump has blamed Harris and Biden for loosening sanctions on Iran, thus emboldening Iran's proxies to carry out the attack last year.

Trump has repeatedly said that Jewish voters who vote for Democrats ""should have their head examined"" and that if he loses the Nov. 5 election, ""the Jewish people would really have a lot to do with that."""
JD Vance hits Biden-Harris on hurricane response: 'Incompetence of the highest order',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/jd-vance-hits-biden-harris-hurricane-response-incompetence-highest-order,2024-10-07T19:09:23Z,"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, joins 'Fox & Friends' one year after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on Israel to discuss the Biden-Harris administration's leadership and the lack of funding for FEMA in the wake of Hurricane Helene.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance slammed the Biden-Harris administration's handling of the fallout of Hurricane Helene as incompetent in an interview Monday on ""Fox & Friends.""

Vance said FEMA has been ""distracted"" by illegal immigrants as a result of the Biden-Harris administration's ""incompetence.""

""I think the fundamental mistake that Kamala Harris' administration has made here, Will, is that from the get-go, you should have imposed military-style command and control,"" he said. ""You've got eight different bureaucratic organizations, you've got a lot of different bureaucratic fiefdoms that sometimes delay the provision of necessary resources, you need to empower a military commander on the ground to get helicopters to where they need to go, to get supplies ... to cut through some of the FAA bureaucracy.""

""The problem here, I really believe, it's like the DMV at industrial scale, and because of it, a lot of folks in North Carolina are suffering unnecessarily,"" he added. ""I hope to God you don't have unnecessary loss of life, but I fear that we do, and it all goes back to why do we have a president and a vice president, one of whom is on the beach, the other of whom is participating in fundraisers rather than doing their job. It is incompetence of the highest order.""

BENJAMIN NETANYAHU'S CHURCHILL MOMENT COMES AMID MULTIFRONT WAR AGAINST IRANIAN TERROR, EXPERT SAYS

Vance discussed the claim that there is a bucket of money in FEMA that has gone to illegal immigrants and another separate bucket of money that goes to American citizens.

""I think that misses the fundamental point that the Biden-Harris administration has turned FEMA effectively into an agency that helps to resettle and helps to deal with illegal immigration,"" he said. ""That is just fundamentally going to distract focus from their core job of helping American citizens in their time of need.""

Vance continued, calling the administration's response following Hurricane Helene a ""complete failure of leadership,"" demonstrated by the contrast in previous responses to natural disasters.

""In 2010, there was a terrible earthquake in Port-au-Prince, Haiti,"" he explained. ""The 82nd Airborne was on the ground two days later. There was a disastrous hurricane an hour away from the 82nd Airborne headquarters. It took more than a week for the full deployment to arrive and start helping people out.""

""It's a complete lack of leadership,"" he added. ""When things like this happen, you need somebody in charge, you need somebody saying we're going to save as many lives as possible. Red tape be damned. Unfortunately, what you've had is somebody asleep at the wheel. Nobody knows who's in charge and I think it has delayed the provision of necessary resources to the people of North Carolina.""

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

Vance said the area, the Appalachian region of the country, has been ignored by U.S. leadership for 40 years.

""They really feel ignored today,"" he said. ""The way you solve that problem is by having leaders who show up and focus on the people. Kamala Harris has failed to do that.""

FEMA has set up a fact-check page to respond to what it says are false claims about its response to the hurricane. In one, it responded to a claim that funding for its disaster response was diverted to support international efforts or border issues.

""No money is being diverted from disaster response needs,"" the site states. ""FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts.""

A White House spokesperson didn't have a direct response to Vance but referred Fox News Digital to its comment about similar criticism by Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La.

""A wide range of leaders in both parties and from every affected state have praised the bipartisan response to Hurricane Helene,"" spokesman Andrew Bates said. ""The Republican governor of South Carolina, Henry McMaster, has called the response 'superb.' Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, a Republican, said, 'They're doing a great job.' Asheville Mayor Esther Manheimer said, 'We are seeing incredible help from the Federal government to the state.' The Republican governor of Georgia, Brian Kemp, has said he 'appreciated' President's Biden's offer to 'call him directly' with any 'other things we need.' The Republican governor of Virginia, Glenn Youngkin, said he's 'incredibly appreciative of the rapid response.' Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said, ""The federal response has been nothing short of amazing. And Republican Senator Lindsey Graham said, 'This is an incredible experience for me. So, to President Biden, thank you for coming. Thank you for paying attention to our needs. We have had a good working relationship between the federal government.'"""

Sen. JD Vance blasted the Biden-Harris administration on Monday for not doing enough to bring home the hostages that Hamas took from Israel during the deadly Oct. 7 attack one year ago.

Vance, R-Ohio, spoke during the Philos Project's Memorial Rally and March on the National Mall in Washington, D.C., briefly taking aim at President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris.

""I'm going to get a little political here. It is disgraceful that we have an American president and vice president who haven't done a thing,"" Vance said. ""Vice President Harris, our message is, 'Bring them home.' Use your authority to help bring them home. We can do it. We just need real leadership.""

Iran-backed Hamas terrorists launched a massacre against Israel in the Oct. 7 attack last year, killing about 1,200 people, including 46 U.S. citizens, and taking about 250 hostages. A year later, about 100 people, including several Americans, remain in Hamas captivity, as U.S.-led efforts to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage release deal have sputtered out.

ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS SET UP ENCAMPMENT OUTSIDE JEWISH DEM REP'S HOME ON EVE OF OCT 7 HAMAS ATTACK ANNIVERSARY

The attack sparked a war in Gaza, where Israel has moved to eliminate Hamas and return those taken hostage. Israel's military campaign has killed more than 41,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, which does not distinguish between militants and civilians.

Harris came under fire Sunday for a lengthy ""word salad"" answer in which she appeared unable to fully commit to Israel during an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes.""

Meanwhile, Vance gave full-throated support for Israel, saying that former President Trump will make sure Israel has the right to protect itself and that the hostages are returned home.

""I speak for Donald Trump and saying that when he is president, America will protect our American Jewish brothers and sisters. We will stop funding anti-American and anti-Jewish radicals. And we are going to bring home American hostages wherever they're held and whoever is holding them,"" he said.

Vice President Kamala Harris plans to increase taxes on wealthy individuals and large corporations as part of her economic plan if elected in November, she said in a new interview.

Since becoming the Democratic Party's official nominee for president, Harris has said she will provide $25,000 housing subsidies for first-generation home buyers, implement $100 billion in tax credits for the manufacturing sector and increase small business tax credits by tenfold.

""My plan is about saying that when you invest in small businesses, you invest in the middle class, and you strengthen America's economy. Small businesses are part of the backbone of America's economy,"" Harris told ""60 Minutes"" in a clip released on Monday.

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

""60 Minutes"" correspondent Bill Whitaker reminded Harris that the question was ""how are you going to pay for it?""

Harris quickly said that wealthy Americans would foot the bill.

""I'm going to make sure that the richest among us, who can afford it, pay their fair share in taxes,"" Harris said.

""It is not right that teachers and nurses and firefighters are paying a higher tax rate than billionaires and the biggest corporations,"" Harris continued. ""I plan on making that fair.""

Whitaker shot back, ""But we're dealing with the real world here,"" and asked how that plan would get through Congress.

""You know, when you talk, quietly, with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I am talking about,"" Harris said.

""Cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about,"" Harris added. ""Their constituents are those firefighters and teachers and nurses.""

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

Harris' opponent, former President Trump, was invited to appear on ""60 Minutes"" as well for its election interview special, but he declined.

Last month, Harris unveiled new small-business tax proposals last week aimed at reducing the cost burden related to starting a new business. Among the proposals was a substantial increase in the standard tax deduction for small-business startup costs, from $5,000 to $50,000. ""It's essentially a tax cut for starting a small business,"" the vice president said during a stump speech announcing the new proposal. ""We're going to help more small businesses and innovators get off the ground.""

Harris has simultaneously expressed support for raising marginal tax rates for both corporations and individuals, which conservative economists argued would work to diminish the benefit received by the tenfold increase in the startup deduction.

In addition to Harris' new tax proposals for small businesses, she also laid out her plan this week for taxing capital gains. She wants to increase it to 33%, whereas Biden reportedly wants the current rate, which is at 23.8%, to be nearly doubled, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Harris has also suggested support for increasing government spending to support families' child care needs, while also expanding the child tax credit, among other proposals.

Georgia GOP chair shares 2-pronged election strategy as Trump works to win back Peach State,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-gop-chair-shares-2-pronged-election-strategy-trump-works-win-back-peach-state,2024-10-07T16:33:54Z,"ATLANTA - Georgia GOP Chairman Josh McKoon is ""cautiously optimistic"" that Republicans can win back the Peach State after it emerged as a critical battleground in the previous presidential race.

The path to victory lies in two key blocs - early voters, and those who lean Republican but are largely apathetic to the process overall - McKoon indicated in an interview with Fox News Digital.

""We feel good about things here in Georgia,"" the former state senator said. ""We've got a lot of work to do over the next month or so, but we feel like we're in position to win.""

KAMALA HARRIS' SUPPORT WITH ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN IS 'TENUOUS': DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST

He pointed to some recent surveys that show former President Trump with a slight edge over Vice President Kamala Harris, as well as early figures on absentee voting.

Early and absentee voters were key to President Biden's victory nationwide in 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic largely forced Americans to stay home.

In Georgia, parts of which were ravaged by Hurricane Helene just over a week ago, early and absentee voters may prove just as critical this year. Biden beat Trump in the Peach State by roughly 12,000 votes in 2020.

""One very important lesson is the importance of early voting. We have three weeks of in-person early voting here in Georgia. Republicans traditionally have not done a whole lot to target our voters to get them out early - to make a plan and go ahead and bank those votes,"" McKoon said.

""As a result, we had to spend an enormous amount of time and resources trying to move the vast majority of our voters to the polls on Election Day.""

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

Motivating many of those likely voters to turn out early, McKoon explained, frees up state party resources ""to focus on low-propensity voters who are likely to vote for President Trump, if we just get them to the polls.""

""But of course, those voters need to be touched multiple times. And so, early voting plays a huge role in our overall strategy,"" McKoon said.

When asked how low-propensity voters could be reached, the Republican official explained it's more a matter of outreach than identification.

""Of course, all of that requires resources. That requires money - put mail in the mailbox, ads on television, telephone calls to their home, knocking on their door. We're trying to do all of those things,"" McKoon said.

Another factor of the Trump campaign's nationwide outreach - and in Georgia, in particular - is convincing Black male voters to vote Republican.

Trump allies have said that securing roughly 20% of support from Black men across the U.S. could be critical to swaying the election in his favor.

A recent Howard University public opinion poll found that roughly one in five Black men under age 50 who are living in battleground states support Trump.

""You see the work that's being done, you know, Black Voices for Trump, a lot of the other movements, grassroots movements, around the state. Direct voter contact, again, is really king in this area. But no one's better at that than President Trump himself,"" McKoon said.

""That's really about economic anxiety and the feeling that this administration, with its open borders policies, are making it even more difficult for Black voters to get ahead in this country.""

Georgia's early voting period runs from Oct. 15 through Nov. 1."

""Joe Biden does keep popping up,"" Dovere told CNN host Kasie Hunt, referencing recent exchanges with reporters, specifically after former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney endorsed Harris and when he made a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room on Friday.

""On Friday, when Joe Biden felt like he had had a good week at the White House and wanted to go to the briefing room to talk about it, they did not coordinate that with the Harris campaign. The Harris campaign found out about that a couple of minutes before he showed up. He showed up right after Kamala Harris went onstage in Detroit. I can tell you that a lot of people on the Harris campaign did not find that helpful,"" Dovere said.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

""Biden in the next couple of days is heading to Angola and Germany. It's not like a really pressing foreign trip. A lot of people in the Harris campaign wish that he would maybe go away for longer at this point,"" he added.

He said that Harris was in a tricky situation as the incumbent vice president.

""Harris has to embody and embrace that change and speak to that change, while also being a quasi incumbent and having Donald Trump and JD Vance attack her as if she has been the one signing the executive orders,"" he said.

The Harris campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Fox News Digital.

Dovere reported on Sunday that Biden's closest advisers, citing people who have spoken with them in recent days, still believe the president ""would be in the same spot or better right now had he stayed in the race.""

With less than a month to go until Election Day in November, a new poll indicates Vice President Kamala Harris leading former President Trump among self-identified Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada, two crucial southwestern battleground states.

But Trump has made gains with younger male Hispanic voters compared to four years ago, according to a pair of Suffolk University/USA Today surveys released on Monday.

According to the poll, Harris leads Trump 57%-38% among Hispanic voters in Arizona, with Green Party candidate Jill Stein and Libertarian Chase Oliver both under 1% support. Three percent of voters remain undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 55% of those Hispanic voters said they voted for President Biden, while a third said they voted for Trump.

The vice president's lead over the former president is slightly smaller in neighboring Nevada, at 56%-40%. According to the survey, Independent American Party's Joel Skousen is just over 1%, Libertarian Chase Oliver is under 1%, and 2% are undecided. When asked how they voted in the 2020 election, 56% said they voted for Biden, while 33% said they voted for Trump.

""So far, Harris is falling short of the 24-26 point advantage that Joe Biden carried with Hispanic voters in Arizona and Nevada in 2020, according to the exit polls from those states,"" Suffolk University Political Research Center director David Paleologos highlighted. ""This Democratic shortfall is largely due to young Hispanic men.""

In both states, a majority of men under 50 years of age are choosing Trump over Harris.

Trump leads Harris 53%-40% among Hispanic men ages 18-34 in Nevada, and tops her 53%-39% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

In Arizona, the Republican presidential nominee leads the Democratic Party standard-bearer 51%-39% among Hispanic men ages 18-34, and 57%-37% among Hispanic men ages 35-49.

TIGHTEST PRESIDENTIAL RACE SINCE 2000 - WITH ONE MONTH UNTIL ELECTION DAY

The economy and immigration were the top two issues on the minds of those questioned in the survey in both states.

Arizona and Nevada have referendums to protect access to abortion on the ballot in November - and the poll indicates majority support for the measures in both states.

Arizona and Nevada - along with Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin - had razor-thin margins in the 2020 presidential election that decided Biden's victory over Trump. And all seven states are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 election in the race for the White House.

The latest surveys in Arizona and Nevada - as well as the other five swing states - indicate margin-of-error races between Harris and Trump.

The Suffolk University/USA Today surveys were conducted Sept. 27-Oct. 2, through live interviews of 500 self-identified Hispanic voters in the states of Arizona and Nevada. The overall sampling error for results from each state is plus or minus 4.4 percentage points."
"Kamala Harris should prosecute Big Pharma, not bail it out",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harris-should-prosecute-big-pharma-not-bail-out,2024-10-07T13:15:43Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

With less than six weeks before the election, Vice President Kamala Harris has been striking a populist tone, especially when it comes to taking on Big Pharma in her stump speeches. At a recent campaign rally, she touted her tie-breaking vote to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which granted Medicare the ability ""to go toe-to-toe with Big Pharma and negotiate lower drug prices.""

And to great fanfare, just before the Democratic National Convention, the White House announced that the first round of those drug price negotiations would save taxpayers a cool $6 billion - a major win for the American taxpayer.

Yet at this very moment, the Biden-Harris administration is quietly pushing for a multi-billion-dollar bailout of one of the nation's largest and wealthiest drug companies - a bailout that would be funded by those same taxpayers.

WISCONSIN POLL SHOWS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP BY 4, FORMER PRESIDENT AHEAD ON KEY ISSUES

The proposed bailout revolves around a patent infringement lawsuit. Arbutus and Genevant Sciences, two small biotech companies, allege that Moderna stole their patented lipid nanoparticle technology, which proved critical in developing Moderna's mRNA vaccine for COVID-19.

Though the case is yet to be decided, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office and Federal Circuit Court of Appeals have already determined Arbutus' patents to be valid, despite Moderna's attempt to invalidate the patents before the pandemic. Given the stakes of this case, court-ordered damages could reach $3 billion, according to some analysts.

While this may appear to many as an obscure issue of corporations battling it out over patent infringement, there are serious ramifications for taxpayers here as well.

In a rare statement of interest filing, Department of Justice officials recently argued that due to an obscure federal law dating back to World War I, Moderna is excused from any patent infringement that may have occurred during Operation Warp Speed, the historic federal campaign to support COVID-19 vaccine development. If that's the case, the lion's share of the financial penalty for Moderna's potential wrongdoing will fall on U.S. taxpayers.

The law, known as Section 1498, essentially states that the government will compensate an inventor for patent infringement if the technology in question is ""used or manufactured by or for the United States.""

In times of great national need, the government may decide they need niche technology at a scale that the original patent-holding manufacturer can't provide. The law absolves the larger manufacturer from having to worry about licensing the patent from the original patent-holder or deal with the patent-holder taking them to court for infringement.

Put more simply, Section 1498 is similar to eminent domain, but rather than letting the government seize private land, it allows the government to seize patented inventions in emergencies and retroactively compensate the patent holders.

Here's where the DOJ's argument falls short, as Moderna's infringement clearly should not be covered by Section 1498. The government never asked them to infringe on the intellectual property of anyone else and never authorized widespread production of Moderna's COVID-19 vaccine by other companies due to manufacturing capacity issues.

And critically, the vaccines in question weren't used exclusively or even primarily by the U.S. government - meaning military service members or other federal employees - but were instead distributed to regular Americans like you and me.

Yet at this very moment, the Biden-Harris administration is quietly pushing for a multi-billion-dollar bailout of one of the nation's largest and wealthiest drug companies - a bailout that would be funded by those same taxpayers.

""By or for"" government use has always been understood to mean that the U.S. government is the end user of the product in question - for instance, a patented technology that's appropriated for U.S. military use - not that it's merely a purchaser. Objectively, the U.S. government was merely one buyer among many purchasers of the vaccines - including many foreign governments and other foreign state-owned companies.

If the court overseeing the case accepts the DOJ's interpretation of Section 1498, it will set a precedent that companies that merely sell to the government, among other customers, are immune from patent infringement lawsuits. That result would be disastrous for our economy and a boon to wrongdoers.

Patents encourage innovation and risk-taking by enabling anyone with a novel idea to turn it into a real-world product - without bigger, entrenched rivals stealing it. Allowing huge corporations to essentially steal patented technology from small upstarts is the opposite of standing up for the little guy. It'd greatly disincentivize investments in research and development.

Harris has a strong history of standing up for the ""little guy"" going back to her early years as a prosecutor and San Francisco District attorney. The vice president should continue that legacy and make clear that in a Harris administration, large corporations will be held accountable if found responsible - a winning message in the final campaign stretch."
Harris' 'word salad' answer on Israel alliance confounds social media users: 'Someone please interpret',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-word-salad-answer-israel-alliance-confounds-social-media-users-someone-please-interpret,2024-10-07T13:03:40Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris did not directly answer a question about Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's relationship with the U.S. and refused to say whether the U.S had any sway over him.

Vice President Kamala Harris was roasted on social media for a comment on Israel and how she ""can't make any sense at all"" in a new viral clip.

Harris gave a rare sit-down interview on CBS' ""60 Minutes"" Sunday, where Bill Whitaker asked whether the U.S. has any ""sway"" over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the war against Hamas continues. Monday marks one year since the brutal terrorist attack on Israel that sparked the war in Gaza.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel. And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents, Iran, I think that it is without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks,"" Harris responded.

She continued, ""Now the work we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a cease-fire. And we're not going to stop in terms of putting that pressure on Israel and in the region, including Arab leaders.""

BILL MAHER TRASHES KAMALA HARRIS FOR BEING 'FULL OF S---' ON ISRAEL, MIDDLE EAST: 'JUST SHUT UP'

The lengthy ""word salad"" and her inability to commit to Israel as an ally shocked and frustrated several X users after the clip premiered.

""Kamala is asked about Israel, can't make any sense at all. Kamala is like a running team that's behind that can't throw the ball. After hiding her for months, they are now panicking and doing interviews everywhere. But that's going to get her behind more,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis, a supporter of former President Trump, wrote.

Former ESPN anchor Sage Steele asked, ""Someone please interpret what she just said here...""

""People talk this way when they have absolutely nothing substantive to say because they know next to nothing about the subject at hand,"" Federalist senior editor John Daniel Davidson said.

""Shocking,"" Fox News host Mark Levin exclaimed.

Comedian Tim Young commented, ""60 minutes asked Kamala if Netanyahu even listens to us after we give Israel weapons and money. Kamala replies with a pile of word salad. It would be easier if she just said that no world leader respects or listens to her even after we hand out money.""

""This is the real Kamala. And she's no friend of Israel,"" California Rep. Darrell Issa wrote.

New York Rep. Elise Stefanik wrote, ""Israel is taking out Iranian-backed terrorists across the Middle East, making the world safer for Israel and the United States yet Kamala Harris refuses to say that Prime Minister Netanyahu is a strong ally to America. Kamala Harris is unfit to be the President of the United States.""

NEWT GINGRICH SOUNDS OFF ON KAMALA HARRIS' 'WORD SALAD' INTERVIEWS, 'INSANE' POSITION ON ISRAEL-HAMAS

During the interview, Harris dodged repeated questions from Whitaker over her support for Israel.

Whitaker asked, ""Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?""

""I think with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people, and the answer to that question is yes,"" Harris responded.

Harris was also criticized last month for providing scant details about whether she would change her policies on Israel as president.

Hezbollah rocket attack on Israel hits Haifa for first time,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-rocket-attack-israel-hits-haifa-first-time,2024-10-07T11:32:11Z,"'The Big Weekend Show' co-hosts discuss the latest in the Israel-Hamas war and Vice President Kamala Harris' foreign policy record.

Hezbollah rockets hit Haifa, Israel's third-largest city, on Monday in the first direct attack on the city since the conflict began.

Hezbollah's ""Fadi 1"" missiles landed in Haifa early Monday morning as the country began to mark the one-year anniversary of the Oct. 7 massacre. Two rockets hit Haifa and five more hit the city of Tiberias, which lies about 40 miles away.

""This was the first real hit in the city,"" Haifa's mayor, Yona Yahav, said in a statement.

Israeli media said 10 people were injured across the two cities, and police in Haifa confirmed reports of minor injuries as well as damage to buildings.

ISRAELI MILITARY SAYS HEZBOLLAH LEADER HASSAN NASRALLAH KILLED IN BEIRUT STRIKE

In response, Israel says IDF fighter jets struck targets they said belonged to Hezbollah's intelligence headquarters in Beirut.

The exchange of fire comes as Israel continues to issue warnings about a response to Iran's massive missile attack against Israel that occurred last week. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued an ominous warning to Iranian officials during an interview with Fox News on Sunday.

During an exchange with Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst on Sunday, Gallant promised that Israeli forces are considering all options in terms of its response to Iran's attacks against Israel, including potentially striking Iranian nuclear sites.

BIDEN SAYS HE WILL TALK TO NETANYAHU AS ISRAEL PUMMELS SUNNI TERROR TARGETS IN BEIRUT

""At the moment, everything is on the table,"" the Israeli official said. ""Israel will respond to the unprecedented Iranian attack in the manner of our choosing, and at the time and place of our choosing.""

President Biden told reporters last week that he would not support a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, but said Israel had the right to act ""proportionately"" to Iran. On Saturday, Vice President Kamala Harris vowed to send $157 million of ""additional assistance"" to Lebanon, which, she claimed, is ""facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation.""

Blue Philly working class voters start leaning towards Trump ahead of election: 'People actually love him',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/blue-philly-working-class-voters-start-leaning-towards-trump-ahead-election-people-actually-love-him,2024-10-07T11:17:30Z,"Working-class Philadelphia Democrats may be planning to vote for former President Trump in November.

The Philadelphia Inquirer reported Wednesday about growing trends among poorer wards and districts in the Pennsylvania city to shift towards the Republican Party despite years of being solidly blue.

One example the report cited included 27-year-old Gabriel Lopez who registered as a Democrat and voted for Hillary Clinton for his first election in 2016. Since then, he changed his registration to Republican and voiced his support for Trump.

""Democrats keep saying [Trump] is going to bring down the economy, but he was already president for four years, and taxes were lower,"" Lopez said. ""We're tired of the same politics. We got a different type of guy, and the people actually love him.""

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

The article added, ""Lopez embodies one of Democrats' biggest problems in Pennsylvania: working-class voters in Philadelphia, a once reliable voting bloc for the party, have drifted right in recent years. And they've been disproportionately affected by rising prices over the last several years, an issue many blame Democrats for.""

Although Philadelphia, which holds 20% of the state's Democratic voters, may be crucial for Vice President Kamala Harris to win the state, the Inquirer reported the city lost the most Democratic voters out of any city in the 2020 election.

The trend was most pronounced in poorer, less-educated areas with majority-Latino neighborhoods showing the most movement, likely concerned about the economy.

Retired truck driver and registered Democrat Jim Kohn listed that as his top issue.

""When Trump was president, everything was cheaper,"" Kohn said. ""Now, everything is so sky-high.""

Other Democrats in the area remained optimistic about Harris' chances, though some understood the growing support for Trump.

""Many of us have people in our families who have gone to jail, or gone to schools that have failed us. We're not trustful of the government,"" Álvarez Febo, a Democrat who plans to vote for Harris, said. ""Then you have someone like Trump, who is a liar, and for some people, it's like, 'you know something? He's an honest representation of what we feel.'""

""They're saying Kamala is going to save our democracy,"" Febo added. ""That means very little for people who can't keep the lights on.""

Some Republicans, by contrast, were very optimistic about a potential political shift in the city.

""When I first started in politics in 1978, the managerial class was Republican -- no one votes the way their bosses vote,"" 45th Ward GOP Leader Charlie O'Connor said. ""Now, most people in the managerial class vote Democratic and no one is voting the way their boss is. So it's been a flip. Most of the bosses are Democrats and the Democratic Party has become the party of the upper middle class.""

Pennsylvania is considered one of the most competitive states for this presidential election. A Fox News survey found Harris and Trump tied at 49% among likely voters in the state. Trump previously won Pennsylvania in the 2016 election against Hillary Clinton but lost the state in 2020 to President Biden."
Harris echoes debunked claim about Georgia abortion limits causing woman's death despite pushback from doctors,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-echoes-debunked-claim-about-georgia-abortion-limits-causing-womans-death-despite-pushback-from-doctors,2024-10-07T10:33:58Z,"Two Georgia doctors, one a congressman and the other a state legislator, weigh in on the tragic case of Amber Nicole Thurman and media claims that state laws regulating abortion led to her death.

Vice President Kamala Harris repeated the left's claim Sunday that a woman in Georgia died due to delayed care as a result of the state's abortion limits, despite doctors previously denouncing the narrative as false.

During an interview on the raunchy and often-sexually explicit ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, host Alex Cooper asked Harris about the impact of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, blaming the death of Amber Nicole Thurman on the Supreme Court ruling and the state's abortion limits after she received a chemically induced abortion in 2022.

""So, Amber was a young mother of a six-year-old son. She was a medical assistant who was so excited because she was just getting on her feet to be independent. She got her own apartment in a gated community with a pool that her son could play in. She got accepted to nursing school,"" Harris told listeners.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

""She was, as described by her family, so excited and so ambitious, and she had plans. Then she found out she was pregnant, and she didn't want to go through with her pregnancy. And she was living in Georgia, and she couldn't receive care there because she was past six weeks. And so she ended up going to another state, and...she couldn't get there on time. And because the other state had been so overwhelmed by all these women coming from all these southern states who couldn't get treatment in their own state, her window for her appointment had closed and instead of having a surgical procedure, she had medication and basically went back home and then had some complications and went to the hospital because she was bleeding.""

""And they delayed 20 hours before they treated her,"" Harris continued, suggesting that Georgia's laws prevented her from receiving lifesaving care.

Her remark comes after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Harris and other members of the Democratic Party, including her running mate Tim Walz, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access after the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Here's the thing that's so messed up about this,"" Harris told Cooper. ""Some of these people will say whoa, but I do believe in exceptions, I believe that there should be an exception in terms of the life of the mother. You know what that means in practical terms? She's almost dead before you decide to give her care. What, so we're going to have public health policy that says a doctor, a medical professional, waits until you're at death's door before they gives you care. That's outrageous...where is the humanity?""

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

OB-GYNs have criticized the Amber Thurman narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop called out the ""fearmongering"" and ""lies"" of the media that are hurting women who don't understand new abortion laws.

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, alleging it was caused by complications from abortion pills because doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), made similar comments on ""Fox & Friends"" last month.

""We are seeing the direct results of spreading lies and misinformation about these laws. Women are being harmed by that because they are delaying in seeking care. And so I think it's really important, no matter where somebody stands on the issue of abortion, we should all want women to have accurate information so that they seek care immediately if they're experiencing complications from things like these high-risk abortion drugs,"" Francis said.

ProPublica previously defended their story in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying, ""We stand by our reporting. The state's committee of more than 30 experts concluded that the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller were preventable, a newsworthy finding. Our ongoing reporting is illuminating the challenges doctors face in caring for patients with pregnancy complications in states with restricted access to abortion.""

The Harris campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment."
Lake rips Biden-Harris 'double whammy' policies affecting Arizonans : 'Driven us over the cliff',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lake-rips-biden-harris-double-whammy-policies-affecting-arizonans-driven-us-over-the-cliff,2024-10-07T10:21:22Z,"PHOENIX, Ariz. - Arizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake told Fox News Digital that illegal immigration has disproportionately hammered residents of her state which she says has created a ""double whammy"" that will result in GOP wins in the state in November.

""I think most Americans think that they have driven us right over the edge, over the cliff,"" Lake told Fox News Digital about the policies of the Biden-Harris administration. ""And we're hoping that we can pull this back come November and that's what we plan to do. But our polling shows that the economy is really affecting everybody. The border is affecting everybody.""

Lake explained to Fox News Digital that the current administration's border policies have disproportionately hurt Arizona particularly when it comes to housing costs.

""It's basic supply and demand,"" Lake said. ""21 million people coming in, even if you take the estimate that Joe Biden and Kamala are giving, which is 10 million, they've got to live somewhere. They're living in homes and apartments and hotels and these are taking away housing opportunities for Americans and also jacking up the prices as well. Because right now, when you have a very limited supply of housing, which we do, we have not built enough homes and apartments in the past 20 years to keep up with the demand. So now all of a sudden, you add 21 million people, you've got a supply and demand issue. You got you don't have enough supply and you have a lot of demand.""

KARI LAKE SHREDS VP HARRIS' 'DESPICABLE' SOUTHERN BORDER VISIT: JUST TO MAKE THE 'MAINSTREAM MEDIA HAPPY'

Lake continued, ""We know that these people that are pouring across our country illegally, that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are bringing in hand-holding and saying, yes, please come in and we will supply you housing, federally subsidized housing, which means you and I are paying for it. And we will give you an ID card with thousands of dollars a month to pay for your food. They don't have living expenses like the American people do. The American people are barely getting by because living expenses have gone up so they can then afford to take these jobs making less than the going rate, which takes Americans salaries and hourly wages and depresses them or pushes them down. So it's a double whammy and it's really affecting Arizona particularly hard.""

On inflation, Lake pointed to data showing that Phoenix was at one point the hardest hit city in the country.

""I talk to more Arizonans than anybody in the whole country,"" Lake told Fox News Digital. ""I have a better relationship with the people of Arizona, I think, than anybody in the country and they're struggling. You know, it kills me to see families and people who are retiring or retirees, Arizona used to be an affordable state it's not so much anymore, who are telling me now, Kari, I've never had to go to a food bank in my life. As a matter of fact, I used to donate to food banks. Now I'm finding myself there every couple of weeks just to make ends meet. I can't even afford the basics. It breaks my heart because the people of this state are incredible, hard working people.""

FLASHBACK: ARIZONA DEM SENATE CANDIDATE CALLED TRUMP VOTERS 'DUMB': 'WORST PEOPLE IN THE WORLD'

""They don't deserve this and they don't want to be asking for a handout, but they're working as hard as they ever have. Some of them are doing two jobs and there's not enough hours in the day. They can't work any harder than they already are and they're still not making ends meet. So it's very distressing for the people and it's distressing for me because I really, truly love the people of the state.""

Lake, who is running for Senate against Dem. Rep. Ruben Gallego who she says is responsible for supporting the Harris-Biden immigration and inflation record, told Fox News Digital that she believes Republicans will have success in November as a result of those policies.

""Every main issue that we're facing as a country somehow seems to kind of come right through Arizona and this is why I feel so comfortable that we're going to win this because, well, first of all, we're registering voters left to right,"" Lake said.

""People are saying, yep, we're voting, we're going to become a Republican. People who've never been a Republican before are now registered Republicans...We're calling people who haven't voted in a number of elections, people who maybe skipped the last 4 or 5 elections. I guess they are called low propensity voters and we're asking, are you going to vote? And they're saying, 'Hell, yes, I'm going to vote. Absolutely, I'm going to vote. I'm struggling right now. This is the first election I voted in a number of elections.' But this one really matters. I think it's our last election. If we don't get this right as a free America."""

""Saturday Night Live"" creator and executive producer Lorne Michaels admitted he has not reached out and will not reach out to the presidential candidates for a potential cameo ahead of the election.

In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter Tuesday, Michaels explained it would be unlikely for former President Trump or Vice President Kamala Harris to appear for the show's milestone 50th anniversary season, citing the need for ""equal time"" to both of them.

""You can't bring the actual people who are running on because of election laws and the equal time provisions,"" Michaels said. ""You can't have the main candidates without having all the candidates, and there are lots of minor candidates that are only on the ballot in, like, three states and that becomes really complicated.""

However, he did not rule out a potential appearance from either of them after the election, when they would no longer be presidential candidates.

SCOTUS kicks off historic term under scrutiny amid ethics code debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/scotus-kicks-off-historic-term-scrutiny-ethics-code-debate,2024-10-07T10:05:55Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The Supreme Court begins its new term today amid lingering internal strife over several recent rulings, with details of its thorny internal deliberations selectively leaked to certain media outlets.

All of this as the nine justices have come under increasing public scrutiny and criticism over perceived blatant partisanship on hot-button issues, ethics controversies and its own wilting reputation as a body remaining above politics.

""The Supreme Court, in a sense, is on the ballot this election, or at least the future of the Supreme Court,"" said Thomas Dupree, an appellate attorney and former top Justice Department official. ""So any time the court wades into political waters, it's going to be upsetting people, people who are on the side that loses. And they'll say the court shouldn't have got involved in the political fray. The court recognizes that it's not something that it wants to do, but in some cases, it has no choice.""

JUSTICE KETANJI BROWN JACKSON SAYS SHE WOULD SUPPORT AN 'ENFORCEABLE CODE' OF ETHICS FOR THE SUPREME COURT

Here are five questions confronting the Supreme Court:

Directly or indirectly, the nine members of the Supreme Court could again play an outsized role in determining who will be the next president.

There is no indication yet of another Bush v. Gore, the case in which the justices in 2000 ended ongoing litigation over the Florida election results, essentially handing the presidency to George W. Bush.

But the high court four years ago summarily refused to consider a series of lawsuits from Trump and other Republicans in five states President Biden won: Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Former President Trump has again promised court challenges if he loses, and in a recent social media post, he said this election ""will be under the closest professional scrutiny"" and ""people that cheated will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the Law.""

Trump has proceeded with his campaign without the imminent cloud of legal jeopardy hanging over his head. His criminal sentencing in the New York business fraud conviction has been postponed until November at least.

And his two separate federal cases involving document mishandling and 2020 election interference have been deferred indefinitely. Those prosecutions could disappear entirely if Trump is elected and dismisses the Justice Department's special counsel.

All this after the Supreme Court in July ruled former presidents enjoy a substantial amount of immunity for ""official acts"" committed in office. Trump has used that ruling to demand both of his federal cases be dismissed.

Two justices took the unusual step of commenting publicly on its effect.

""You gave us a very hard question,"" Justice Neil Grouch exclusively told Fox News' ""America Reports"" co-anchor Sandra Smith. ""It's the first time in American history that one presidential administration was seeking to bring criminal charges against a predecessor. We had to go back and look at what sources were available to us.""

The Trump appointee said the Supreme Court ruled in Nixon v. Fitzgerald (1982) that civil claims cannot be brought against a president ""presumptively, in his official capacity, after he leaves office. Why? Because that would chill him from exercising the powers and duties of a president while he is president,"" Gorsuch said. ""He would be overwhelmed. His political enemies would simply bring suits against him forevermore.""

But Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, who was on the losing side of the 6-3 opinion, has taken another approach.

""I was concerned about a system that appeared to provide immunity for one individual under one set of circumstances, when we have a criminal justice system that had ordinarily treated everyone the same,"" she told CBS News while promoting her new book, ""Lovely One: A Memoir.""

The Supreme Court has already gotten involved in several pre-election challenges: allowing some redistricting maps for congressional seats to go into effect and blocking others.

And the justices last month allowed Arizona to temporarily enforce its law requiring proof of citizenship on state voter registration forms.

'STOP PRETENDING': CONSERVATIVE ACTIVIST WANTS DEMS BEHIND SCOTUS ETHICS RULES TO TAKE THEIR OWN MEDICINE

Five days before President Biden withdrew as a candidate for re-election, he made the Supreme Court a major political issue.

Word leaked from the White House on July 16 that Biden was seriously considering proposals to establish term limits for the justices, and an ethics code that would be enforceable under law, amid growing concerns they were not being held accountable.

The proposal was made public days later, including a congressional law limiting justices to 18-year terms despite the Constitution's guarantee of life tenure for all federal judges.

Biden framed it as an effort to address ""recent extreme opinions the Supreme Court has handed down [that] have undermined long-established civil rights principles and protections.""

Public calls for changes came after revelations of previously undisclosed free trips and gifts by the justices and lucrative book deals. Recent public polls support greater ethics reform.

Other federal judges are bound by an enforceable code of conduct, but the high court had long resisted being included.

Under Chief Justice John Roberts' leadership, he and his colleagues adopted a revised code last year, but it still lacks any enforcement mechanism, which critics say makes it feckless and ineffective.

Fox News previously reported that the court had been privately meeting for months on how to structure a new ethics code, one that would address public concerns over its behavior without abdicating what Roberts in particular had said was the court's independence on such matters from congressional oversight.

So, the justices have near-total discretion to decide whether to abide by the new code.

But growing and very public calls for more have come from some justices in recent days.

""A binding code of ethics is pretty standard for judges,"" said Jackson, ""and so I guess the question is: Is the Supreme Court any different? I guess I have not seen a persuasive reason as to why the court is different.""

""I am considering supporting it as a general matter,"" she said. ""I'm not going to get into commenting on particular policy proposals, but from my perspective, I don't have any problem with an enforceable code.""

And Justice Elena Kagan, perhaps the most vocal advocate for an enforcement provision, said this month, ""It seems like a good idea in terms of ensuring that people have confidence that we're doing exactly that. So, it seems like a salutary thing for the court.""

Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Dick Durbin, D-Ill., recently told the chief justice that the unilateral ethics code adopted by the justices falls short and needs an enforcement trigger.

In a closed-door meeting with federal judges attending a semiannual policymaking conference at the high court, Durbin was seated next to Roberts and made clear that failure by the justices to strengthen their judicial code of conduct could prompt congressional intervention.

Sources say Roberts made no commitments but thanked Durbin for the ongoing dialogue on the issue.

But Justice Neil Gorsuch urged caution, telling ""Fox News Sunday"" host Shannon Bream last month that he did not want to get into ""what is now a political issue during a presidential election year.""

He added about the role of an independent judiciary, ""It's there for the moments when the spotlight's on you, when the government's coming after you. And don't you want a ferociously independent judge and a jury of your peers to make those decisions? Isn't that your right as an American? And so I just say be careful.""

TOP DEM PLOTS TYING SCOTUS FUNDING TO 'ENFORCEABLE' ETHICS CODE AMID THOMAS, ALITO CONTROVERSIES

Following the contentious conclusion of the court's term in July, much was written about the ""Barrett Factor"" and the supposedly evolving jurisprudence of Justice Amy Coney Barrett.

She has become something of a recent lightning rod on the right and left over her occasional willingness to depart from her fellow conservatives, especially in cases involving the man who appointed her in 2020.

The 52-year-old Barrett took issue with some conclusions in the former president's historic immunity ruling and criticized parts of the majority ruling keeping him on the ballot in Colorado.

And breaking with conservatives, she separately authored pointed dissents on an obstruction case dealing with a 2021 U.S. Capitol riot suspect as well as an environmental case on federal rules to manage downwind air pollution.

Many court watchers on the left characterized her ""burgeoning"" legal reasoning as an ""independent streak,"" increasingly ready to ""skewer"" her right-leaning colleagues and a ""principled voice in the middle"" with a strong set of principles that present a ""different world view"" from other conservative justices.

But other legal observers say it is too early to dub Barrett the new deciding vote on hot-button cases who would resist walking lockstep with any ideological bloc.

""I don't think she's really trying to become the 'swing' justice or auditioning for that role. She's calling these cases as she sees them, and she's, generally speaking, a conservative justice,"" said Dupree. ""But what we've seen over the last term is Justice Barrett really coming into her own. She has the confidence to write separately and in some cases to break from the other conservatives when she sees the law a little differently. I suspect that will continue.""

And it remains clear Barrett's conservative credentials in most cases are solid: She has ruled to strike down Roe v. Wade, expand gun rights and scale back affirmative action in higher education.

SCOTUS GIVES PARTIAL VICTORY TO GOP TRYING TO ENFORCE PROOF OF CITIZENSHIP TO VOTE IN ARIZONA

We recently highlighted potential Supreme Court nominees in another Biden or Trump administration, based on what sources in both camps exclusively told Fox News.

Now the dynamic has shifted, with Vice President Harris heading the Democrat ticket.

Campaign sources say the whirlwind of taking over the nomination from her boss in recent weeks has left Harris, her legal advisers and campaign team little time to focus on the what-ifs of choosing justices or broader legal policy.

But it is a topic of particular interest to the former prosecutor, state attorney general and member of the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Administration sources say that since taking office, she has been part of the inner circle cultivating an informal White House list of high court possibles. And Harris was deeply involved in spearheading Jackson's selection and confirmation in 2022, Biden's only Supreme Court nominee.

As a senator, her 2018 questioning at the confirmation hearings for now-Justice Brett Kavanaugh were especially contentious, and she later called for his impeachment after unproven allegations of past sexual misconduct.

Harris herself was under serious consideration for a Supreme Court seat during the Obama years, but sources say her percolating ambitions at the time were directed to elected office.

As for Trump, sources close to him tell Fox News he is expected to soon release his own preemptive list of candidates, as the Republican nominee did in 2016. That evolving list of two dozen or so names became a centerpiece of his successful campaign and later presidency.

This time, the former president will rely on those he has already named to the federal bench for the top names he would choose from to fill any Supreme Court vacancy.

VP HARRIS OUTLINES 'ORDERLY AND SECURE' IMMIGRATION PLAN, RIPS TRUMP IN FIRST BORDER STOP SINCE NOMINATION

The Constitution's framers viewed the judiciary as the ""least dangerous branch,"" but to hear some politicians and pundits on both the left and right, the Supreme Court is prepared to lead the country into imminent ruin.

Such attacks on the justices are nothing new, but the tenor of the criticism, especially in a presidential year, coupled with self-inflicted missteps on ethics and docket discretion, have combined to put its nine members on the defensive.

And the public seems to have noticed.

A Gallup poll this summer found 43% approve of how the Supreme Court handles its job, with 52% disapproval. That is a drop of 15 points since 2020 (58%-38%). In 2000, 62% approved of the institution.

Especially concerning the court are continued leaks to the media of its internal, mostly secretive, operations.

A draft opinion of the 2022 ""Dobbs"" abortion case, published two months before the final ruling that struck down nationwide access to the procedure, sent shock waves in Washington in a massive breach of protocol.

That was followed by selective leaks in the past year over how the court decided hot-button issues like affirmative action and election redistricting.

And in recent weeks, the New York Times received leaked internal memos from the chief justice over his leading role in the Trump immunity opinion.

Court sources say the leakers, who have never been publicly identified, have further eroded institutional camaraderie and trust among the justices, long seen as essential to doing their jobs. It has led to outside partisan finger-pointing.

Roberts, who will gavel in his 20th term next week as chief justice, has not publicly responded to the latest controversies or calls for ethics reform, declining repeated invitations from the Senate to testify.

It reflects his ""less is best"" approach to explaining and promoting his own court's resolution of thorny legal and political issues.

In September 2022, after the abortion ruling was issued, he said, ""Simply because people disagree with opinions is not a basis for questioning the legitimacy of the court. I think just moving forward from things that were unfortunate is the best way to respond,"" he said.

And he has carefully glided over his role to force internal change and to defend his court's reputation all while being unable to stop the continuing leaks over their deliberations.

""It seems like at times they're [leakers] motivated to be able to potentially lead to mistrust in the [judicial] branch, attacks on what the branch is doing,"" said Jennifer Mascott, a former law clerk to Justice Clarence Thomas and then-Judge Kavanaugh and now a Catholic University law professor.

Added Dupree, ""You can't have a court deliberate and perform its constitutionally assigned function if it can't be ensured of the sanctity of its deliberations, if it thinks that anything that one justice says to another colleague or any memo that they write internally is going to appear on the front page of the newspapers the next day. That's a very, very worrisome trend. It may be the new normal.""

After a three-month recess, the justices met together for the first time this week to reset their docket and discuss appeals that have been filed over the summer.

Sources say the chief justice, who leads the closed-door meeting, had sent a memo to his colleagues indicating some of the controversies surrounding the court, like the leaks and ethics reform, would be privately and candidly discussed.

The Supreme Court in its new term will confront issues like gun rights and transgender care for minors, with pending appeals over the Affordable Care Act, religious freedom, immigration and abortion access.

It is a unique, fast-moving time of change and challenge at an institution used to being slow and deliberate.

""I did learn early on that when you are holding the reins of leadership, you should be careful not to tug on them too much,"" said Roberts in 2016. ""You will find out they aren't connected to anything."""
Battleground Senate candidate unloads on 'radical' Dem opponent for disparaging Trump voters,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/battleground-senate-candidate-unloads-radical-dem-opponent,2024-10-07T08:07:07Z,"PHOENIX, AZ - Arizona GOP Senate candidate Kari Lake is blasting her Democratic opponent Rep. Ruben Gallego and labeling him as ""radical as they come"" after a resurfaced interview of him disparaging Trump voters.

""Isn't that terrible?"" Lake said in response to Fox News Digital reporting of a comment made by Gallego in 2016 where he said that Trump voters were ""dumb"" and the ""worst people in the world.""

""He's been lying about who he is,"" Lake added. ""He's trying to paint himself as a moderate, which is it's laughable if it wasn't so dangerous.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Gallego ""bullied"" moderate Sen. Kyrsten Sinema out of the race ""because she wasn't liberal enough.""

""Now he is doing all these ads trying to say he's a moderate when, in fact, he's voted to spend our federal dollars, our tax dollars, our money, supporting sanctuary cities and states. He's voted against securing our border every step of the way. He's for an open border America. He's voted to defund the police. He actually co-sponsored the George Floyd legislation, which would have defunded the police nationwide.""

Lake went on to tell Fox News Digital that Gallego has ""never batted an eyelash"" when it comes to spending bills and has not been strong enough defending women's sports.

""He wants biological men to participate in women's athletics.,"" Lake said. ""That means it's an end for girls sports. Anybody out there who played sports? I did for a little bit. It's an end. I mean, if you have to compete with biological men, what's the purpose of having girls sports?""

ENIGMATIC VOTER GROUP COULD SPLIT TICKET FOR TRUMP, DEM SENATE CANDIDATE IN ARIZONA

Lake added, ""It's absolutely crazy and he's as radical as they come.""

Gallego and Lake will both be attempting to sway independent voters, especially in Maricopa County, the largest county in the state, where independents make up a third of the electorate. Lake told Fox News Digital she is optimistic she can win votes from Arizonans who aren't Republicans.

""I do believe that independents are with me, I think we're doing pretty well, our polling is showing that we're building on the independent vote,"" Lake said. ""And I think a lot of Democrats, while he [Gallego] hates Trump voters and he hates Republicans. I don't hate Democrats. I actually believe that disaffected Democrats are going to help us turn the corner.""

""They're realizing, looking at Kamala Harris and Ruben Gallego, and they're saying, wait a minute, this isn't the Democrat Party that I signed up for years ago, the old Democrat Party used to care about the working class. The old Democrat Party wanted a strong economy for everybody. This Democrat Party is a bunch of globalists, and they are for, they want to spend more money helping people coming here illegally than they do people who are American citizens.""

While the Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Gallego leading Lake by about 7 points, Lake told Fox News Digital she is confident the race is much closer and says her internal polling shows that she is within the margin of error.

""We have to go into it acting like we're ten down, but we're not ten down,"" Lake said. ""This is a very tight race. I'm proud of that, considering, as I said, he spent 75 million. He's been outspending us massively and the fact that this is such a tight race is incredible. Chuck Schumer is in a panic about Arizona. He's dumping 5 million bucks a week into Arizona.""

Lake told Fox News Digital that Democrats are in a ""tailspin"" in Arizona because their efforts to make the election about abortion have not been fruitful because most voters are focused on other issues like the economy.

Lake also criticized Gallego over his record before he entered politics, including his involvement with a bank that worked with illegal immigrants, a harassment claim against him by a 20-year-old intern while he worked at city hall, and his time working for an ambulance company that was being investigated for fraud.

""The people of Arizona know me and they trust me and I love the people of the state, Lake said. ""I want to represent all of them, including people who maybe don't even vote for me. If you choose not to vote for me, I hope I can earn your vote, but I still want to represent you and I want to do a great job for you in Washington, D.C. We need decent, honest people back to D.C. and Ruben Gallego was not honest before he got into politics.""

MSNBC anchor Andrea Mitchell said on Sunday that Vice President Kamala Harris is struggling to resonate with White and Black male voters.

Michell said on ""Meet the Press"" that Harris needs to show up more in the media because she is not being seen as a ""heavyweight.""

""She's got such a big problem with men,"" Mitchell said, adding that support for Trump among that demographic could be underestimated.

She proceeded to blame misogny as one of the reasons Harris wasn't being taken as seriously among both Republican and Democratic men.

Harris has taken heat for largely avoiding the press. Since becoming the Democratic nominee 72 days ago, she has yet to hold a single official press conference. In response to the criticism, Harris has shifted her strategy, stepping up interviews. This week, Harris will make appearances on The View, The Howard Stern Show, and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.

Speaker of the House Mike Johnson addressed claims that the Biden administration diverted Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) funds to immigration efforts, saying the pools of funds are ""different,"" but that he understands why Americans are ""frustrated.""

""The streams of funding are different, that is not an untrue statement, of course,"" Johnson, R-La., told Fox News' Shannon Bream on ""Fox News Sunday."" ""But the problem is with the American people, see, and what they're frustrated by, is that FEMA should be involved.

Not to be engaged in using any pool of funding from any account for resettling illegal aliens who have come across the border. That's what the Biden administration, Kamala Harris and Secretary Mayorkas have been engaged in.""

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre last week denied that FEMA resources were going to migrants, but cited FEMA funds for migrants in 2022.

""Former President Trump is accusing the Biden administration of using FEMA funding to support undocumented migrants. How is the White House responding to that?"" a reporter asked during a Friday press conference.

FEMA HAS FUNDS NEEDED FOR 'IMMEDIATE RESPONSE AND RECOVERY,' DESPITE MAYORKAS' WARNING

""I mean, it's just categorically false. It is not true. It is a false statement,"" Jean-Pierre responded.

Critics have since compared her statement to comments made in 2022, where she cited FEMA resources were available to illegal immigrants.

""FEMA Regional Administrators have been meeting with city officials on site to coordinate - to coordinate available federal support from FEMA and other federal agencies,"" Jean-Pierre told reporters at a Sept. 16, 2022, press conference.

""Funding is also available through FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter program to eligible local governments and not-for-profit organizations upon request to support humanitarian relief for migrants,"" she added.

FEMA has a pool of funds explicitly used for natural disasters, while Congress called on FEMA in 2022 to disseminate funds from Customs and Border Protection to assist American communities affected by the immigration crisis.

KJP SLAMMED AFTER HURRICANE HELENE OVER MIXED MESSAGES ON WHETHER FEMA RESOURCES USED FOR MIGRANTS

FEMA's website currently has a ""Hurricane Helene: Rumor Response"" page to address false claims surrounding recovery efforts, including a rebuke of the claim that FEMA diverted disaster response funds to ""border related issues.""

""This is false. No money is being diverted from disaster response needs. FEMA's disaster response efforts and individual assistance is funded through the Disaster Relief Fund, which is a dedicated fund for disaster efforts. Disaster Relief Fund money has not been diverted to other, non-disaster related efforts,"" FEMA posted in response to the claim.

Hurricane Helene has left more than 220 people dead after flooding devastated towns and cities across Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee.

Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas drew national attention last week when he indicated that FEMA does not have enough funding to make it through hurricane season, which typically wraps up in November.

LAWMAKERS OUTRAGED OVER FEMA FUNDING CONCERNS

""We are meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have. We are expecting another hurricane hitting,"" he said Wednesday, heightening concerns around funds for Americans left displaced by the hurricane. ""FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.""

The DHS, however, said the following day that FEMA has the funds needed to assist those currently affected.

""FEMA has what it needs for immediate response and recovery efforts,"" spokesperson Jaclyn Rothenberg said on X. ""As [Administrator Deanne Criswell] said, she has the full authority to spend against the President's budget, but we're not out of hurricane season yet so we need to keep a close eye on it.""

Johnson said during his interview Sunday that when citizens take public transportation and spot illegal immigrants traveling the nation, their tickets are ""gleefully"" paid for by the Biden-Harris administration via non-governmental organizations.

""When you see illegals in your local airport and you see them being transported around the country with planes, trains and automobiles to every community, everywhere, every state's a border state now, because of that. That's the NGOs, the non-governmental organizations mostly, that are transporting those people around. And then they send the receipts to the federal government,"" he continued.

Israeli official warns 'everything is on the table' as IDF prepares response to Iranian missile attack,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/israeli-official-warns-everything-table-idf-prepares-response-iranian-missile-attack,2024-10-06T20:50:17Z,"Former U.S. Ambassador to Iraq and Chair of the Middle East Program at the Wilson Center James Jeffrey reacts to escalating tensions in the Middle East on 'Fox News Live.'

Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant issued an ominous warning to Iranian officials during an interview with Fox News on Sunday, amid the rapid escalation of the Israel-Hamas war in the Middle East.

The interview came days after Israel invaded Lebanon as part of a mission to eliminate Hezbollah, on the heels of several successful strikes against the terrorist group. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) confirmed that it had killed Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah last weekend - prompting Iran to launch 181 retaliatory missiles in response.

During an exchange with Fox News chief foreign correspondent Trey Yingst on Sunday, Gallant promised that Israeli forces are considering all options in terms of its response to Iran's attacks against Israel - even potentially striking Iranian nuclear sites.

""At the moment, everything is on the table,"" the Israeli official said. ""Israel will respond to the unprecedented Iranian attack in the manner of our choosing, and at the time and place of our choosing.""

ISRAEL LAUNCHES LIMITED GROUND OPERATIONS IN LEBANON AS WAR AGAINST HEZBOLLAH, TERRORIST GROUPS CONTINUE

President Biden told reporters last week that he would not support a strike against Iran's nuclear facilities, but said Israel had the right to act ""proportionately"" to Iran. On Saturday, Vice President Kamala Harris vowed to send $157 million of ""additional assistance"" to Lebanon, which, she claimed, is ""facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation.""

""I am concerned about the security and well-being of civilians suffering in Lebanon and will continue working to help meet the needs of all civilians there,"" Harris said.

Amid the White House's response to the IDF's recent strikes, Gallant emphasized that he hopes the United States continues to cooperate with the Israeli military.

""It is important for us to hold discussions on strategic cooperation between our countries and defense cooperation in light of the threats posed by Iran and its proxies,"" Gallant said. ""We are powerful when we are aligned and I want to make sure of it.""

BIDEN SAYS HE WILL TALK TO NETANYAHU AS ISRAEL PUMMELS SUNNI TERROR TARGETS IN BEIRUT

Gallant also said the IDF's recent strikes in northern Gaza were in response to terrorists planning ""Oct. 7-style attacks"" against Israelis.

""We have conducted counterterrorism activities in northern Gaza and in Judea and Samaria, following intel indicating that terrorists were planning Oct. 7-style attacks on Israeli citizens,"" he explained. ""We will operate precisely and preemptively when necessary in order to defend our citizens.""

The military official acknowledged the IDF's ""extraordinary"" wins against Hezbollah in recent weeks and vowed to continue its mission. On Friday, the IDF announced that it had killed 250 Hezbollah terrorists since the ground strikes began, including several commanders.

""Israel has made extraordinary achievements against Hezbollah - we will do what it takes to defend our citizens and our sovereignty,"" Gallant said. ""This includes eliminating their attack capabilities, taking out leadership, and placing a weapons embargo on Hezbollah.""

Later on Sunday, Pentagon press secretary Maj. Gen. Patrick Ryder announced that Secretary of Defense Lloyd J. Austin III will host Gallant on Wednesday.

Vice President Kamala Harris wouldn't say whether she thought the Biden administration had influence over Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu as the war in the Middle East continues.

CBS' Bill Whitaker asked Harris about why Netanyahu seemed to be ""charting his own course,"" despite the billions of dollars of military aid the U.S. has provided to Israel. ""Does the U.S. have no sway over Prime Minister Netanyahu?"" he asked.

""The aid that we have given Israel allowed Israel to defend itself against 200 ballistic missiles that were just meant to attack the Israelis and the people of Israel. And when we think about the threat that Hamas, Hezbollah presents, Iran, I think that it is without any question, our imperative to do what we can to allow Israel to defend itself against those kinds of attacks. Now the work we do diplomatically with the leadership of Israel is an ongoing pursuit around making clear our principles, which include the need for humanitarian aid, the need for this war to end, the need for a deal to be done which would release the hostages and create a ceasefire.

""Well Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that region by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in region,"" Harris responded.

Whitaker asked again, ""Do we have a real close ally in Prime Minister Netanyahu?""

""I think with all due respect, the better question is do we have an important alliance between the American people and the Israeli people, and the answer to that question is yes,"" Harris responded.

Harris, who has done few major network interviews, has also sat down with CNN's Dana Bash and MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle. Ruhle made it clear prior to her interview that she would be supporting the vice president.

She also sat for an interview with the National Association of Black Journalists and was criticized following the interview for lacking policy specifics. She was asked by journalists at the event whether she would change any of President Biden's policy on Israel.

""We need to get this deal done, and we need to get it done immediately,"" she responded. ""And that is my position and that is my policy.""

Voters attending a rally for Vice President Kamala Harris in Flint, Michigan, argued that the Democratic nominee is better on immigration and that former President Trump is to blame for the current situation at the border.

""She comes with compassion and a plan,"" one voter attending the Harris rally Friday told Fox News Digital. ""We know that we have problems down there, but we have to do it specifically to make the changes... just throwing out rhetoric and building a wall is not going to do it. This is about people's lives who have come here because they're in distress and danger, and we need to help them because that's who we are.""

The comments come as both Trump and Harris made multiple appearances in Michigan last week, highlighting the critical importance of a swing state that could decide the fate of November's election.

KAMALA HARRIS' SUPPORT WITH ARAB AND MUSLIM COMMUNITIES IN MICHIGAN IS 'TENUOUS': DEMOCRATIC STRATEGIST

With the election just over four weeks away, polling shows Michigan could be decided by a razor-thin margin once again. According to the Real Clear Politics polling average as of Sunday, Harris currently holds a narrow 0.7 point edge in the state.

At the top of mind for voters in Michigan at both Trump and Harris rallies last week was immigration, with both sides agreeing that work needed to be done to secure the southern border. But while Trump supporters mostly pin the blame on the Biden administration, Harris supporters in Flint argued that it was Trump's effort to kill President Biden's bipartisan border legislation that was to blame for the current situation.

""She has worked on a bill that she said that if she's elected she's going to sign into law that directly puts more people on the front line that would actually be helping with the border, while Trump shot that down,"" a voter told Fox News Digital.

""The Biden administration tried to put through an act that would make border crossings more limited and better. It was basically a slam dunk, Trump went and told his people 'Hey, we need to shoot this down, we can't let them get a win,'"" another voter said.

Meanwhile, some voters argued that all Trump brings to the table on the issue is ""rhetoric"" that divides people, while Harris has the experience to solve the problem.

""Harris is better on immigration because she's experienced in border security, the policies and legislation that are necessary to result in a secure border,"" a voter said.

DAVID MARCUS: Pennsylvania's Gen Zers embrace Trump like Millennials never have,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-pennsylvanias-gen-zers-embrace-trump-like-millennials-never-have,2024-10-06T17:16:46Z,"Gen Z voters Jahmiel Jackson and Ranger Irwin discuss the deep divide between young male and female voters on 'The Story.'

Over the last two months, I have spent more time in Pennsylvania than any other state for the obvious reason that the outcome there will very likely determine whether our next president will be Donald Trump or Kamala Harris.

One increasingly clear phenomenon I have slowly seen, and it's backed up by some polling, is that Gen Z voters who are between the ages of 18 and 27 are far more open to supporting Trump than their Millennial elders, who are mainly in their 30s.

GROWING NUMBER OF GEN Z MEN SUPPORTING TRUMP REPRESENTS 'ONGOING CULTURE SHOCK' IN US POLITICS, VOTER SAYS

A recent poll from Harvard has Harris leading Trump 61 percent to 30 percent among Millennials, but an NBC News poll shows that with voters 18-29, that lead shrinks to 16 points at 50 to 34.

It tracks with what I have been seeing on the ground.

At a Trump rally in Harrisburg back in August, I met young, blue-collar Gen Zers who believed Trump would provide more opportunity, a JD Vance event in Hershey was overflowing with twenty somethings, and Saturday in Butler, I met dozens of first-time voters planning to pull the red lever.

It came into clear focus later on Saturday night at Jack Jolly's Holiday Bar in downtown Butler, a town which, unlike many of the hollowed out Ohio cities I've seen that are more rust than belt, is actually quite charming and seems to be thriving.

Jack Jolly's is one of those cocktail lounges where they infuse everything or put smoke in the glass, and the first people I met there were a trio in their late 30s; one married couple and their guy friend.

All were childhood buds from Butler who had moved away after college and recently returned to purchase homes in this lovely hillside hamlet. They were no fans of Trump, and they also weren't overly interested in politics.

GEN Z VOTER FLIPS FROM SANDERS TO TRUMP: HARD TO VOTE FOR THE PARTY PUTTING 'TAMPONS IN BOYS' BATHROOMS'

At one point, I asked them if the emerging well-to-do segment of the population and the longer-standing middle and lower classes mingled well. They looked at me quizzically and I said, ""I mean, your kids must go to school together, right?""

""Oh, we don't have kids,"" the single guy told me, though the woman is a teacher.

And they are a type of voter I have seen elsewhere, in San Francisco and Chicago -- good jobs, few responsibilities, and not terribly ill at ease with the state of their lives, the country, or the world.

About the time they took off, another trio took their place, this time, three dudes, younger, mid to late twenties. Two were Trump fans, and the other, a history teacher, supports Harris, but also said, ""I don't think Trump is a threat to democracy.""

What followed was a robust conversation about politics, America, and life. They were well-informed, avid social media users, and importantly, they all seemed to have a grasp on the best arguments of the other side.

Whatever is driving these young voters into the arms of the GOP, it will have profound implications not just on this election, but going forward for decades.

Earlier in the day, I had spoken to Johnny and Rocky at the Trump rally, who were also either Gen Z or close. They are buddies, but I was surprised when Johnny said, ""Rocky and I watched the VP debate together.""

When I was 27, we did a lot of things, but get together to watch a vice presidential debate was not among them. Then again, in the 1990s, we thought a bright future was inevitable. Unlike Gen X, Gen Z is very well aware that it isn't.

Part of the reason that I was slow to pick up on the reddening of Gen Z, especially, but not only, Gen Z men, is that I couldn't really explain it, and I still struggle to.

Are they less connected to and susceptible to the neoliberal pablum of the leftist media and entertainment industry? Is it because they grew up, in part, under a Trump presidency and so do not find it abhorrent or abnormal? Is it counter-cultural?

And unlike Millennials, who seem quietly resigned to a country and society that isn't going to get any better, there seems to be flickering hope among our youngest voters, as if they dare to dream.

Users on social media took aim at Vice President Kamala Harris after the Democratic nominee took to X to pledge millions of dollars in aid for Lebanon at the same time residents of North Carolina struggle to recover from Hurricane Helene.

""This has to be fake. Even Kamala Harris, the gold standard of stupid, isn't stupid enough to post this,"" actor James Woods said on X Saturday. ""Certainly not while North Carolinians are pulling the bodies of their neighbors from the wreckage. It's simply inconceivable.""

The post came in response to Harris pledging Saturday to send $157 million of ""additional assistance"" to Lebanon, which, she argued, is ""facing an increasingly dire humanitarian situation.""

Users on social media were quick to slam Harris for the post, arguing that many North Carolina residents are struggling to recover from Hurricane Helene and that the money would be better spent on those relief efforts.

""Could this be any more tone deaf? We have Americans suffering and in danger right now after the hurricane and this is what Kamala has to announce. America First!"" Rep. Nick Langworthy, R-N.Y., said on X.

Tim Walz discusses Israel's right to defend itself and Kamala Harris' economic policies on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sought to distance Vice President Kamala Harris from laws he himself signed that granted benefits to illegal immigrants in Minnesota on Sunday.

Walz made the comments during a wide-ranging interview on Fox News Sunday with host Shannon Bream. Bream pressed Walz on his military history and his record on abortion in addition to questioning him on legislation he signed in Minnesota that allows illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and receive state-funded tuition assistance, among other benefits.

""Are those not magnets to draw people here, many times on dangerous journeys for themselves? And why should your taxpayers in Minnesota or across the states pay for those programs?"" Bream asked.

""Well, that's not the vice president's position,"" Walz admitted, before going on to defend his leadership in Minnesota.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""But I will say this, Minnesota ranks as a top five business state. We rank as a top three state for children living, and we're a top state for health care access,"" he said. ""Look, the Vice President has made it clear that she has policies that make a difference. Her border policies are the most strongest, the fairest we've seen.""

Bream also challenged Walz to clarify his ticket's position on abortion access. The exchange ultimately led to Walz flatly accusing former President Trump of lying when he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

Bream began by pointing out that Minnesota's abortion law imposes no limits on abortion procedures through all nine months of pregnancy, something that goes far beyond the provisions of Roe v. Wade, which Harris and Walz said they support.

""You signed the bill that makes it legal through all nine months. Is that a position you think Democrats should advocate for nationally?"" Bream asked.

""The vice president and I have been clear the restoration of Roe versus Wade is what we're asking for,"" Walz responded.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGES MORE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AS VOTERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POLICIES

""But that law goes far beyond Roe v. Wade,"" Bream pressed. ""Let's agree, in what you signed there's not a single limit through nine months of pregnancy. Roe had a trimester framework that did have limits through the pregnancy. The Minnesota law does not have that.""

""This doesn't change anything. It puts the decision back on to the woman, to the physicians,"" Walz responded. ""And we know that this is simply something to be brought up - to be very clear Donald Trump's asking for a nationwide abortion ban.""

""[Trump] has said repeatedly that he will not sign a national abortion ban. Are you calling that a flat out lie?"" Bream asked.

""Yes, of course, and Senator Vance has in the past said so too,"" Walz said.

Bream concluded the interview by giving Walz a chance to respond to criticism of his frequent ""misstatements,"" such as his claims about military service and his assertion that he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

""Look, I speak passionately. I had an entire career, decades before I was in public office. They know, and I'm very proud of my 24 years in service and my record. I have never disparaged someone else in this, but I know that's not what Donald Trump does. They disparage everyone,"" Walz said.

Democratic strategist James Carville said Saturday that the presidential contest between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump was a ""long way from decided.""

Carville joined CNN's Michael Smerconish, who pressed the Democratic strategist on why Harris wasn't ahead if the economy was doing well, referencing Carville's famed phrase, ""it's the economy, stupid.""

""You know, she's slightly ahead, and it's not the election. These things tend to break one way or the other at the end. There are seven swing states. The least likely result is they break 4-3. But I can't stop the commentariat from saying it's going to be neck-and-neck, and it's going to come down to this. I think it will break at the end. I think someone will carry swing states 5-2 or 6-1. Whoever does that will do well in the House and do well in the Senate. But this thing is a long way from decided,"" Carville responded.

Former Trump campaign adviser David Urban also joined Carville and Smerconish and said that the race is going to be tight, specifically in Pennsylvania.

He cited the state's electorate and said that he's heard from a lot of voters who think Harris hasn't made her pitch in Pennsylvania yet.

""If she does lose, I think it's because she's kept in bubble wrap on a shelf someplace. They're playing defense, not offense. They're playing like they're 14 points up, not like they're neck-and-neck. And so I think it's going to be close just because the nature of the electorate,"" Urban said.

Carville agreed and said voters still don't know enough about the vice president.

""They know who she is and who Donald Trump is. They know what Donald Trump is. They still want to find out what Harris is,"" he said, before taking aim at criticisms of Harris' lack of media appearances.

Jim Gaffigan, who played Walz, and Bowen Yang, who played Vance, were shown having an intense moment of agreement, taking aim at the portions of the actual debate where both candidates said they agreed with one another.

A recent poll by the Pew Research Center found that former President Trump is winning the Catholic and Protestant vote.

Conducted from Aug. 26-Sept. 2, the survey found that 52% of Catholics and 61% of Protestants support Trump for president, while 47% of Catholics and 37% of Protestants back Kamala Harris.

As more Americans become aware of how radical Harris is, it's clear to see why Trump has won this support from religious voters.

Harris may have been the surprise replacement for Joe Biden, but her position on issues is far from unknown. She claims to be a future-oriented, change candidate eager to ""turn the page and chart a new way forward.""

DEMOCRATS DRIVING RELIGIOUS VOTE AWAY FROM PARTY AS TRUMP COURTS CATHOLICS: 'ANTI-CHRISTIAN' PARTY

However, Harris is a professional politician with a radical policy record that she can't defend among the religious electorate.

Consider that in 2014, in the case of Burwell v. Hobby Lobby, Attorney General Harris filed an amicus brief with the U.S. Supreme Court and was joined by 13 states and the District of Columbia.

Harris called on the court to force Hobby Lobby to violate its religious beliefs and cover the cost of contraception for its employees. (The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby, protecting the family-owned arts and crafts chain to operate its business in line with its religious beliefs and values.)

Also, as attorney general of California, Harris was a vocal advocate and ""proud"" co-sponsor of the Reproductive FACT Act, which Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law in 2015. The law required medically licensed pro-life pregnancy centers to display signs advertising low-cost or free abortions available in California.

The law ""was very clear that it was targeting pro-life viewpoints,"" said Denise Harle, who served as senior counsel at the Alliance Defending Freedom. In a 2018 decision, the Supreme Court agreed with this view and struck down the law.

Writing for the majority in National Institute of Family and Life Advocates v. Becerra (initially named NIFLA vs. Kamala Harris), Justice Clarence Thomas wrote in the majority opinion, ""the FACT Act unduly burdens protected speech.""

As a U.S. senator of California from 2017-2021, Harris introduced and was the lead sponsor of the Do No Harm Act, which would have ended religious exemptions for certain government mandates, such as rules requiring insurance coverage of specific medical procedures. As a legal expert at First Liberty wrote at the time, ""This country was founded on religious liberty. The Do No Harm Act strikes at the heart of that freedom.""

Additionally, the Do No Harm Act would have undermined the bipartisan Religious Freedom Restoration Act, a 1993 landmark law that protects the rights of people of faith to worship freely and in accordance with their conscience.

Further, Sen. Harris was also an original co-sponsor of the ""Equality Act,"" a bill that would have further unraveled the Religious Freedom Restoration Act and enabled the government to prosecute faith-based institutions for refusing to hire employees who openly oppose their religious teachings. The U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops was clear in denouncing the proposed legislation and said the Equality Act would ""run roughshod over religious liberty.""

Additionally, Sen. Harris questioned three judicial nominees on their affiliation with the Knights of Columbus, suggesting that involvement with the Catholic fraternal organization disqualifies a nominee for potential bias.

White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre is facing heavy criticism after sending mixed messages on whether the Biden-Harris administration has been using FEMA resources to support migrants last week.

Jean-Pierre flatly denied that FEMA resources were going to migrants in a press conference last week, but she stated the opposite when asked about the issue in the fall of 2022.

""Former President Trump is accusing the Biden administration of using FEMA funding to support undocumented migrants. How is the White House responding to that?"" a reporter asked during a Friday press conference.

""I mean, it's just categorically false. It is not true. It is a false statement,"" Jean-Pierre responded, going on to cite a Washington Post fact-check article on the subject.

Social media critics then compared her statement to comments made in 2022, where she appeared to explicitly state that FEMA resources were available to illegal immigrants.

FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 'FAILED TO ACT' IN HURRICANE HELENE AFTERMATH: REP. CORY MILLS

She made the statement during a Sept. 16, 2022, press conference when Jean-Pierre was asked about assisting cities in handling the busloads of migrants being sent across the country from Texas.

""FEMA Regional Administrators have been meeting with city officials on site to coordinate -- to coordinate available federal support from FEMA and other federal agencies,"" Jean-Pierre told reporters at the time.

""Funding is also available through FEMA's Emergency Food and Shelter program to eligible local governments and not-for-profit organizations upon request to support humanitarian relief for migrants,"" she added.

Scrutiny on the Biden-Harris administration's use of FEMA funds comes amid catastrophic flooding in North Carolina. Vice President Kamala Harris announced a $100 million package to support the state.

Critics pointed out, however, that the package was much smaller than the $157 million in foreign humanitarian support Harris had announced for Lebanon the same day.

A growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia say they will not back either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Donald Trump in next month's election because of both candidates' support of Israel amid the ongoing conflict in the Middle East.

Harris has said she supports Israel's right to defend itself and would not withhold weapons from the country, but has also called for a ceasefire in Gaza, while Trump said recently he is Israel's ""protector"" and reaffirmed his support for the Jewish state.

In battleground Georgia, where Trump narrowly lost in 2020 to President Joe Biden, the Peach State could help determine whether Harris or Trump wins the presidency.

The Muslim population in Georgia could also impact which candidate wins the state's 16 electoral votes. Muslim voters across the country are virtually tied between Harris and Trump, with Harris only securing a single-point advantage, according to a recent poll by the Arab American Institute.

This comes just ahead of the one-year mark of the ongoing war in Gaza between Israeli forces and Hamas terrorists. The conflict began on Oct. 7, 2023, when Hamas attacked Israel and took more than 250 hostages, which prompted retaliatory action from Israel's military.

The Hamas-run government's Gaza Health Ministry estimates that more than 41,000 people have been killed in the conflict, although it does not distinguish between civilian and terrorist deaths. More than 1,500 people have reportedly been killed in Israel since the start of the conflict, with most of them being killed on Oct. 7 and its immediate aftermath.

TRUMP SAYS ISRAEL SHOULD HIT IRAN'S NUCLEAR FACILITIES, SLAMMING BIDEN'S RESPONSE

The growing group of Muslim voters in Georgia and across the country have said they will not vote for Harris or Trump due to both sides' vocal support of Israel in its war in Gaza, and the conflict is now expanding to include Israel attacking Hezbollah terror targets in Lebanon.

""What we're trying to say is we should really do away with the logic of voting for the 'lesser of two evils,'"" Kareem Rosshandler, Georgia co-chair of the ""Abandon Harris"" campaign, told Fox 5.

The ""Abandon Harris"" campaign group is urging Muslims to vote third-party to send a message to Republicans and Democrats that they need to earn the votes of the Muslim community.

""I think the main one is to say that the Muslim community in the United States won't be taken for granted,"" Rosshandler said.

Rosshandler said the group has already secured commitments from more than 10,000 Muslim voters to support third-party candidates. Some third-party candidates, including Libertarian Chase Oliver and the Green Party's Jill Stein, have been critical of Israel's war in Gaza.

The loss of Muslim voters is expected to hurt Harris more than Trump, as the Republican candidate has previously struggled to secure Muslim votes.

""That would essentially have a greater adverse impact on the Harris-Waltz ticket than it would on Trump-Vance,"" Emory University assistant professor of law Alicia Hughes, who is also a voting expert, told Fox 5 Atlanta. ""Trump, historically, has not been able to count on those votes.""

Hughes also says that if Harris or Trump were more vocally critical of Israel, it may not help their election chances either.

""There's a great possibility that you would lose more from the change than you would actually gain,"" she said."
Here's what two undecided Wisconsin voters are holding out for in the 2024 election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/heres-what-2-undecided-wisconsin-voters-holding-out-2024-election,2024-10-06T08:21:55Z,"WISCONSIN -- With only one month until the presidential election, very few voters are still uncertain about their choice, but in a battleground state like Wisconsin that has flipped in the past two elections, those undecided voters could make the difference.

Estimates of still-undecided voters in Wisconsin are in the low single digits, with the latest Marquette Law School poll reporting that just 4% identified themselves as such.

Fox News Digital spoke with two such voters, who laid out why they are still holding out and what they need to seal the deal.

TRUMP ATTORNEYS ARGUE JACK SMITH'S OBSTRUCTION CHARGES BE DISMISSED, CITING SUPREME COURT'S 'FISCHER' DECISION

""I got to make up my mind when I fill out the paper,"" said 86-year-old Edgar Schiekiera of Waukesha, Wisconsin.

""I'm going to throw a dart,"" he laughed.

Schiekiera is an immigrant from Germany who noted that he grew up during the Second World War. For him, former President Trump's comments on foreign policy have been troubling, enough so to make him hesitate to support Trump for a third time.

""I voted for Trump the first year. I voted for him the second year. I don't -- this time, I don't know,"" he said.

""I'm from Germany, and things that he's said about [the] NATO Alliance -- he wants quit it, and he doesn't know what to do,"" he said of what's making him unsure of Trump. ""A real danger lives overseas.""

Schiekiera was also concerned about what Trump has said with relation to conflicts around the world, particularly involving Ukraine and Iran. ""He can stop the war?"" he asked, in reference to Trump's own claims about the war between Ukraine and Russia. ""He cannot stop the war.""

However, he added that ""Biden or Kamala Harris -- she doesn't know what's going to happen,"" either. According to him, he isn't confident that either of the top candidates can effectively lead on the world stage in the current geopolitical climate.

There are other issues that Schiekiera is taking into consideration as well, such as abortion. ""I got my own ideas,"" he said.

He noted that Trump has appeared to change positions on ""issues nationally [and] worldwide.""

""Trump's gone one way, and then he [goes] to another way. He's undecided what he's going to do, really.""

DEMOCRATS WORRY ABOUT HARRIS' CAUTIOUS MEDIA APPROACH IN TIGHT 2024 RACE: 'VOTERS DESERVE BETTER'

In contrast, Keon Pierce of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, isn't considering Trump at all. But he is not sold on Vice President Kamala Harris either.

""I'm leaning Kamala, but I have to see. She's got to convince me a little more,"" he told Fox News Digital.

""I'm waiting to see who has the best -- the best protection for different groups of people. You know, the best rights and best laws that can help all groups of people.""

Pierce explained that he wanted to be sure the president would ""help all people. Asian people, Indian people, Black people, everybody.""

When Fox News Digital noted that Harris is both Black and Indian, he responded, ""We had a Black president before, and it didn't necessarily translate to helping the people,"" in reference to former President Barack Obama.

TRUMP CAN WIN ON THESE THREE KEY ISSUES, MICHIGAN VOTERS TELL FOX

He said he was ""open to"" Green Party candidate Jill Stein, who will appear on the Wisconsin ballot after a court challenge to see her ousted was denied.

""It's possible that I wouldn't vote as well,"" he added.

As for the Milwaukee area, Pierce explained, ""It's bad here. It's really segregated here, and opportunities are limited.""

He said he needs to hear more about what will be done to bring more ""opportunities, jobs, education, [and] a better school system in the inner city.""

In the latest Marquette Law School poll, Harris beat Trump among Wisconsin registered voters, 49% to 44%, with third-party options included.

"Musk energizes Trump supporters at Butler rally, 3 months after assassination attempt on former president",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/musk-energizes-trump-supporters-butler-rally-3-months-after-assassination-attempt-former-president,2024-10-06T01:14:50Z,"Tesla CEO Elon Musk made a memorable appearance at former President Trump's campaign rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, on Saturday - a rare appearance for the tech entrepreneur.

Wearing a black ""Make America Great Again"" hat and a T-shirt reading ""Occupy Mars,"" Musk appeared on stage shortly after Trump made his own remarks. The rally was held at the same site where Trump was shot by gunman Thomas Matthew Crooks on July 13.

Although Musk has become a vocal Trump supporter, the speech marked the first time that the tech entrepreneur stumped at a major presidential rally. Musk confirmed that he would be at the rally on social media this week.

""I want to say what an honor it is to be here and, you know, the true test of someone's character is how they behave under fire, right?"" Musk said at the beginning of his remarks. ""And we had one president who couldn't climb a flight of stairs, and another who was fist pumping after getting shot.""

Musk, considered one of the most influential people in the world, also encouraged the audience to ""vote, vote, vote.""

""Just be a pest to everyone,"" he said to the audience. ""You know, people on the street everywhere: Vote, vote, vote!""

""Fight, fight, fight, vote, vote, vote,"" Musk added. At one point, the X owner jumped excitedly.

WALZ ROASTED AFTER DECLARING 'WE CAN'T AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF THIS' AT RALLY

Trump's speech, which he opened with a roaring start by thanking the people of Pennsylvania and making a light joke about the attempt on his life in July with the line ""And as I was saying..."", was largely positive and uplifting, a departure from his normally acrid criticisms of his opponent, Vice President Kamala Harris. During the speech, the Republican candidate did make pointed remarks about his opponents who ""maybe even tried to kill me.""

""Above all, you deserve leadership in Washington that does not answer to the lobbyists, to the bureaucrats, or to the corrupt special interests, but answers only to you, the hardworking citizens of America, of which there are a lot of them,"" Trump described.

""We have a lot of them. We have a lot of them over the past eight years, those who want to stop us from achieving this future have slandered me, impeached me, indicted me, tried to throw me off the ballot, and who knows, maybe even tried to kill me,"" the candidate continued. ""But I've never stopped fighting for you. And I never will.""

The Republican candidate then turned his attention to the immigration chart he had put up - the same one that was displayed when he was shot on July 13.

""I love that chart,"" Trump said. ""I love that graph. Isn't it a beautiful thing?""

""But also beautiful because look at the number, that's the day I left office,"" he continued. ""It was the lowest Border Patrol [apprehensions]...Today, it's out of control.""

Trump also held a moment for Corey Comperatore at 6:11 p.m., the exact time that Crooks began firing at the former president on July 13. Comperatore, a rally attendee and firefighter, was fatally wounded.

Speaking at the beginning of his speech in Butler, Pennsylvania, Trump acknowledged Comperatore's death and thanked his relatives for attending.

""It is 6:11, 12 weeks to the minute, that the shooting began,"" Trump said. ""I would like to ask everyone to join me in a moment of silence.""

Kamala Harris rallied in Flint, Michigan, Friday and brought along one of the state's most legendary figures to support her.

During the rally, NBA legend Magic Johnson made a speech.

Johnson was born and grew up in Lansing and attended Michigan State University, located in the state's capital.

Johnson has long been a supporter of the Democratic Party, previously endorsing Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama.

When he appeared in Flint, Johnson said Black men need to vote, but with a conscience.

Johnnson added that Black men need to ""understand"" that Donald Trump ""did not deliver on"" promises he made ""to the Black community.""

So, they should vote for Harris, Johnson said.

While Harris is campaigning Saturday in North Carolina, Trump is making his return to Butler, Pennsylvania,, site of a July 13 assassination attempt on his life."
DAVID MARCUS: Trump's defiant supporters flock to Butler rally with renewed confidence,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-trumps-defiant-supporters-flock-butler-rally-renewed-confidence,2024-10-05T21:30:01Z,"Thousands of supporters of former President Trump returned to Butler, Pa., Saturday, amid an increased presence of Secret Service and security details and checkpoints.

In the couple of weeks after Kamala Harris replaced Joe Biden atop the Democratic ticket, there was a decided doldrum I detected across the country from Trump supporters.

But Saturday, as Trump returned to the site of his July 13 near assassination and the tragic murder of Corey Comperatore, a new confidence was clear among his faithful.

Rob is a teacher who lives in Pennsylvania and was carrying a clipboard, registering voters who stood in the vast line to get in.

""I coach wrestling,"" Rob told me, ""and when they switched in Harris it was like a wrestler had his opponent pinned, and suddenly they swap in a new, fresh opponent. Even if that new opponent is weak, it's still deflating.""

TRUMP SUPPORTERS WEIGH IN ON SAFETY AT HISTORIC PENNSYLVANIA RALLY

But now, Rob, who had registered about a dozen new voters when I spoke to him early in the day, thinks Trump has turned a corner, and is poised to defeat Harris.

He wasn't alone.

On a park bench in the shade, I found Karen and George, both in their 60s, along with Johnny and Rocky, in their late 20s or so. The two pairs, all decked out in Trump gear, had only just met. But when I was talking to them, I honestly thought they were family members who had known each other forever.

""It's like a Grateful Dead vibe,"" Johnny told me, ""it's all about love.""

Karen agreed, at least about the love part, not sure about the Dead, and she is confident that Trump can unite our deeply divided country. ""He's already showed he can get people what they need. He was in North Carolina right away after the hurricane. Where were Harris and Biden?""

Karen, like many I spoke to, believes that Trump won the 2020 election, and expects similar shenanigans this time around. However, she is confident not just that Trump will win, but that Republican Dave McCormack will beat incumbent Bob Casey Jr., in the Keystone State's critical Senate battle.

Rocky agreed, ""Casey is just a career politician,"" he mused. ""One thing I wish Trump would talk more about is term limits, because these are the people destroying the country.""

I've been to a lot of Trump rallies, but the pure scale of this one was off the charts. It took an hour to park in a nearby field. My little Mitsubishi Lancer had never driven on grass before, but she did okay, and the atmosphere was incredibly festive notwithstanding the long, long waits.

Joe, a retired NYPD officer, had driven six hours from Staten Island with his 18-year-old nephew, Uriel.

I'll note I saw no evidence of anyone being bused in. This crowd was truly as organic as a vegan's lunch.

When I asked Joe how long he had supported Trump, he told me, ""All my life."" It was his way of saying The Donald was the politician he had been waiting for.

I've been to a lot of Trump rallies, but the pure scale of this one was off the charts.

""In Staten Island, people are excited about Trump,"" he told me, and his nephew, set to vote for the first time, agreed.

I asked Uriel, what would make an 18-year-old vote for Trump?

""He'll make it a better country,"" he said quietly, in his Yankees t-shirt. ""More opportunity?"" I pressed, ""Yes,"" he replied. It mirrored what young voters have been telling me across the Rust Belt, and beyond.

I spoke to several attendees who had been in the same place on that fateful July 13, but the one who stood out was another Joe.

""Everybody was so calm and orderly, that's what I remember,"" he said. ""But I felt so bad for the kids, I mean, they were really scared.""

Joe did admit to feeling some emotions coming back to the Butler Farm Show grounds, but he's a dude and declined to elaborate on them too much.

As for the election? Like everyone I spoke to, the confidence is growing. ""Look at this crowd,"" he said,"" how can he lose?""

I'll admit, it sounded a bit like hubris, especially given the events of the last eight years, but it absolutely reflects the attitude of Trump voters over the past month, who have moved from a sense of nervousness, to increasing belief that this election is now squarely moving in Trump's direction.

On Saturday in Butler, it felt like a reset. After all, the tragic shooting took place just two days before the Republican National Convention. Just a week later, Biden was out, Harris was in, and confusion was everywhere.

There is now a month to go until Election Day, and if the sprawling crowd at the second Butler rally is to be believed, Donald Trump, decidedly has his groove back."
"Latinos shifting to Trump because they have 'internalized racism,' journalist claims",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/latinos-shifting-trump-because-have-internalized-racism-journalist-claims,2024-10-05T21:09:19Z,"Paolo Ramos argues in her new book that Latinos are shifting toward former President Trump because of internalized racism stemming from colonization.

Journalist and MSNBC contributor Paola Ramos, daughter of Jorge Ramos, blamed ""internalized racism"" for why Latinos are leaving the Democratic Party and supporting former President Trump.

Ramos appeared on PBS' ""Amanpour & Company"" this week to address the trend covered in her new book, ""Defectors: The Rise of the Latino Far Right and What It Means.""

Trump appears to be outperforming his 2020 support among Latinos who prefer the Republican over Vice President Kamala Harris on handling the economy and immigration.

The Democratic Party's advantage with these voters is shrinking, according to NBC News, whose poll last week found the Democrats' edge is at its lowest level in the past four presidential election cycles.

MSNBC GUEST CLAIMS LATINOS 'WANT TO BE WHITE' WHILE DISCUSSING THEIR SHIFT TOWARD GOP

In discussions with Trump-supporting Latinos for her book, Ramos said she found that ""tribalism, traditionalism, and political trauma"" were the three driving forces behind this growing trend.

""Really understanding the sort of racial baggage that I believe a lot of Latinos, including myself, and a lot of us are carrying from Latin America. What it means to sort of been colonized for so many years, the weight of colonization, that, in of itself, I believe, creates a lot of internalized racism, a lot of colorism, that then manifests in American politics in so many ways,"" Ramos began.

""And that's then how you can explain the fact that even someone like Donald Trump feels so comfortable going to the Bronx, talking to a group of Black Latinos, and Latino Trump supporters, because he believes that he can sort of tap into a racial and ethnic grievance that is very familiar,"" she continued.

Ramos told USA Today that traditionalism and trauma also play into the trend.

""There's traditionalism which is just breaking down what centuries of colonization have done to us and has led us to be so fixated on certain gender norms and sexual norms and then also leads us to this slippery slope of admiring things like Christian nationalism and then the trauma of this sort of admiration and a lot of Latinos flirting with the strongman rule and where that comes from,"" she said.

Last week, MSNBC guest Maria Hinojosa claimed Latinos ""want to be White"" while discussing the political shift toward Trump among Hispanics.

""And what I said to you when we asked a question was, Latinos want to be White. They want to be with the cool kids,"" she said.

Hinojosa went on to say that those voters could cost Harris the election.

""But those numbers? They could cost Kamala Harris the election. Everything that I've been saying that Latinos could push her over the top, these are the numbers that could also take her down,"" she said.

Vice President Kamala Harris currently has a 12-point lead among registered Hispanic voters, according to the latest Fox News poll.

Former Obama senior adviser David Axelrod argued that Vice President Kamala Harris voters will be clever enough to navigate voting in the wake of the devastation from Hurricane Helene, while saying that rural Trump voters will have a harder time getting to the polls.

Axelrod made the claim during an episode of his podcast ""Hacks on Tap"" that aired Wednesday, predicting that liberal voters in Asheville, North Carolina - a predominantly blue area in the state - will ""figure out a way to vote"" more so than conservatives in the storm's aftermath.

Describing Asheville as a ""blue dot"" in the state, he continued, ""Those voters in Asheville are - they're, you know, the kind of voters that will figure out a way to vote. You know, they're upscale, kind of liberal voters, and they're probably going to figure out a way to vote,"" Axelrod said.

He continued, stating rural conservatives may not be as resourceful in finding ways to vote following the destruction of their homes and communities.

""I'm not sure a bunch of these folks who've had their homes and lives destroyed elsewhere in western North Carolina - in the mountains there - are going to be as easy to wrangle for the Trump campaign,"" the political commentator hypothesized.

""I don't know how that's all going to play out, but it's an unpredictable element in North Carolina that has made it, maybe a little more interesting,"" he mused.

Communities in North Carolina - which Axelrod noted is the second-most rural state in the country - were hit especially hard by the effects of Hurricane Helene. Catastrophic flooding has destroyed roads and bridges, cutting off communities from getting much-needed aid.

More than 70 people are now confirmed dead in North Carolina, and hundreds of people remain unaccounted for due to the lack of power and communication access.

As of Thursday, the death toll among the six states most affected by Helene - Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and Tennessee - sits at 170. Disaster response teams fear that number will climb as they regain access to communities isolated by the storm.

This is why Kamala and Biden aren't helping, they benefit from the disaster.""

The Federalist editor-in-chief Mollie Hemingway commented, ""I fear that Axelrod's point is why Harris and Biden are letting these people drown.""

Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce slammed Axelrod over his take, asking, ""Did ya know that famous Democrat operative David Axelrod figures city Democrats are smarter and more resourceful and will figure out how to vote whereas the dumb Trump deplorables up in the mountains of NC who just lost everything, won't.

A former North Carolina judge whose church is supporting relief efforts for those affected by Hurricane Helene told Fox News Digital there ""is a resounding faith"" among residents that ""God's still in control of this and that he will carry us through this.""

Judge Phil Ginn, a resident of Boone, said the Perkinsville Church in the western North Carolina town is one of several in the region stepping up in the wake of the devastating storm, which has so far left more than 230 dead and caused billions in property damage.

""We're housing people in our church. We've given up all of our Sunday school space to literally house people who are coming to work,"" said Ginn, president of the Southern Evangelical Seminary. ""And so our church had just seen fit to not only help our neighbors, but to help those who are coming here to help our neighbors by feeding them. We've got a shower trailer set up and washer and dryer to keep their clothes clean.""

Ginn described the storm as a ""generational event"" and said the recovery effort is going to be a ""marathon that's going to last for years."" However, he added that ""it's amazing to me to see God has come to us during the storm.""

""There is a resounding faith among folks that I'm talking to out there that God's still in control of this and that he will carry us through this. And so we have that faith to lean into,"" Ginn told Fox News Digital. ""And it is stronger now than it ever was. The bond between us as human beings, as brothers and sisters, has really increased.""

The help seems to be coming more from local people than the federal government, Ginn said.

President Biden, Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump have each made multiple trips to affected areas, and the Federal Emergency Management Agency has committed $110 million in federal aid to Helene victims, the White House said Saturday.

Ginn said people are coming together to help each other regardless of their circumstances or backgrounds.

""Nobody's asking what your politics are. Nobody's asking what your faith is. Nobody's asking if you just got out of prison. There's nothing of that,"" he said. ""It's just if you need help, you're getting it from local people.""

""The great problem that we have right now is that virtually all of the damage was caused by water or mud, and none of that is covered by insurance. And so we've got families who were barely edging by with inflation and everything else, and now they've lost everything,"" Ginn told Fox News Digital.

""They've lost all their personal possessions. They can't live in their home. Their property is gone ... so it's going to be a mental health issue, and it's going to be an economic issue as well.

""It's very tenuous at this point,"" Cross said of Harris' support among the Arab community on CNN Friday. ""I think that what we saw over the summer and prior to that with the campus uprisings across the country, we heard from young people who are very concerned, but also saw that certain college presidents lost their jobs and we've seen the community over and over again, specifically the uncommitted vote, call out where President Biden as well as Vice President Harris are on this issue.""

Vice President Kamala Harris recently recorded an interview with the raunchy and often-sexually explicit ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, though she continues to play coy with traditional media outlets.

The Harris campaign confirmed that Harris sat down for the interview this past Tuesday where she focused on talking to audiences about abortion and reproductive rights issues. The interview is set to air sometime next week.

Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview comes as she has been criticized for not doing enough traditional news interviews since the start of her presidential campaign in late July.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS IN 'DANGER ZONE' AS AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT COUNTRY'S DIRECTION, SAYS CNN DATA GURU

So far, Harris and her running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., have done a combined 24 interviews, a number which pales in comparison to the Trump-Vance ticket's combined 63 interviews in that same time frame.

Harris still has not held a formal press conference since replacing President Biden as the Democratic nominee, while Trump has held five since the beginning of September.

The ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, put on by SiriusXM, is hosted by Alex Cooper and reaches a massive, predominantly female audience. According to Spotify, it is ""the most-listened to podcast by women.""

The podcast is well-known for hosting explicit discussions about sex and women's health advice. Axios reported that the vice president's appearance on the podcast ""highlights her campaign's emphasis on appealing to women voters and younger audiences."" According to CNN, the podcast generally has ""a reputation for raunchy sex and relationship conversations.""

Former President Trump and his running mate JD Vance have done multiple interviews on major podcasts shows in recent months, trying to bring their messaging to younger audiences.

Trump recently sat down with podcaster and influencer Theo Von on his podcast and did a livestream with popular influencer Adin Ross that was conducted at the former president's Mar-a-Lago residence. Vance did an interview on the Full Send Podcast in August.

That Harris would opt for a sit-down with the sex-positive show generated some chatter on social media.

CHUCK DEVORE: Comparing Biden-Harris bungled Helene response to past disasters,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/chuck-devore-biden-harris-bungled-response-hurricane-helene-leaves-americans-suffer,2024-10-05T12:33:10Z,"Fox News contributor Sara Carter details the devastation she witnessed in North Carolina while talking to victims of the disaster on 'Hannity.'

For five days, the U.S. Army's helicopters stayed on the ground.

The Biden-Harris administration's response to Hurricane Helene has been slow, weak, and deadly -- but, except for Fox News, you wouldn't know it from the major media.

Hurricane Helene made landfall on Thursday, Sept. 26, at 11:10 p.m.

The following Thursday, a reporter asked President Joe Biden about the storm zone. Biden responded, ""Oh, storm zone? I don't know which storm you're talking about..."" Biden then recovered and claimed, ""They are getting what they need, and they are very happy across the board.""

WHITE HOUSE REPORTERS ASK ZERO QUESTIONS ABOUT HURRICANE HELENE IN SURPRISE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESS BIDEN

The day before, five full days after the storm dumped up to 30 inches of rain in some mountain locations, Biden ordered 1,000 active-duty troops to provide assistance with 22 helicopters as well as tactical vehicles from Fort Liberty (formerly Fort Bragg), some 250 miles east of hard-hit Asheville, N.C.

There are about 50 utility helicopters in the 82d Airborne Division's Combat Aviation Brigade at Fort Liberty. The military installation in Fayetteville, the U.S. Army's largest, has almost 100,000 active-duty and reserve soldiers available for presidential call-up -- so, Biden sent 1% of Fort Liberty's personnel and less than half of the base's much-needed helicopter inventory.

Meanwhile, the federal government's emergency management arm, FEMA, warned it's out of money because it has spent $1.4 billion on aid to ""sanctuary cities"" swamped with illegal aliens and mostly fake asylum seekers. FEMA said it sent 150 generators to the stricken region. But there are at least double that number of generators available for purchase within an hour's drive of any typical city.

Displaced citizens in the Appalachian region hit by Helene are at risk of illness due to contaminated water -- and in danger from human traffickers who prey upon the confused, weak, and vulnerable. The hundreds of military police from Fort Liberty's 503rd Military Police Battalion and the 82nd MP Company could prove a powerful deterrent in shelters -- if they were activated.

So, how does the Biden-Harris disaster response compare to other recent events? The media and Democrats heaped scorn on President George H.W. Bush's federal response to the L.A. Riots in 1992 and then again on President George W. Bush's Hurricane Katrina actions in 2005.

I was a California Army National Guard captain during the 1992 L.A. Riots. Within three days, we had 10,000 Guard soldiers on the ground, quelling looting and arson. Rioting started the evening of April 29. The following evening, a National Guard MP company was on the scene. The next day, 4,000 Guard soldiers were in the city and President Bush ordered active-duty Army and Marine forces into action as well as 1,000 federal law enforcement officers. By May 2, there were 10,000 Guard members and 3,500 active-duty soldiers and Marines keeping order in L.A.

So, the elder Bush ordered 3,500 active-duty personnel into L.A. three days into the emergency while Biden took five days to decide to send 1,000 soldiers to help.

Hurricane Katrina made landfall on Monday, Aug. 29, 2005, around 4:30 a.m. At Louisiana Gov. Kathleen Blanco's request, President George W. Bush had issued an emergency declaration on Saturday, Aug. 27, two days before landfall. Within a day of impact, U.S. Coast Guard helicopters were already working, rescuing some 350 people from rooftops. Bush viewed the devastation from the air on Aug. 31 and was roundly criticized for flying over, rather than seeing things on the ground. On Sept. 1, Bush asked Gov. Blanco to allow a federal takeover of the relief efforts, which by then included 15,256 Guard members expected to grow to more than 40,000 personnel from neighboring states.

Bush visited the scene of the disaster only two days after landfall. Two days after Helene, Biden was on the beach in Delaware, ""commanding,"" as he claimed, with two hours of phone calls. Vice President Kamala Harris was fundraising on the West Coast.

The U.S. military's chain of command for this disaster runs from Biden to Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin to the commander of the U.S. Northern Command. Biden's slow and confused response to Hurricane Helene -- taking two more days to come to grips with the crisis than did his two recent predecessors -- speaks of a president who is out of touch and not up to the job.

The Biden-Harris administration's sluggish and half-hearted disaster response has put hundreds of thousands of Americans at risk in Helene's swath of destruction. Biden's lackluster engagement in the most powerful office on the planet puts the entire nation in peril as the world spirals into chaos while Harris focuses her time and energy on running to replace Biden while hiding from the media."
NY Times advice column ponders appropriateness of fleeing the country if 'wrong candidate' gets elected,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nyt-advice-column-ponders-appropriateness-fleeing-country-wrong-candidate-gets-elected,2024-10-05T12:09:50Z,"Fox News contributor Joe Concha on Joe Biden facing criticism from the New York Times as the president avoids 'real questions' from the press.

The New York Times Magazine's Ethicist columnist on Thursday answered a reader's question about whether it is appropriate to leave the country if the ""wrong"" candidate becomes president.

Without calling out former President Donald Trump by name, the reader, along with some friends have ""no doubt that the U.S. would fall to some form of authoritarianism if the wrong candidate were elected.""

""They, and I, are white, well educated, nonimmigrants and upper middle class, with a wide range of well-connected and financially stable friends,"" the reader said of themselves and their circle of friends. ""Our demographic backgrounds are relevant to my question, which is on the ethics of leaving a country because its democratic institutions are failing.""

""As members of some of the groups who most likely will retain many tangible privileges and are least likely to be negatively affected, do we have an ethical obligation to stay and help those who will be impacted more harshly than us, or is it ethically acceptable to leave the country? -- Name Withheld"" the question reads.

The headline for the advice column read: ""Is It OK to Leave the U.S. if the Wrong Candidate Becomes President?""

Ethicist columnist Kwame Anthony Appiah compared it to the G.K. Chesterton complaint that to say ""my country, right or wrong,"" was like saying ""my mother, drunk or sober.""

HUNTER BIDEN WORRIED HE'LL HAVE TO FLEE THE COUNTRY IF TRUMP WINS IN 2024: REPORT

""By my lights, though, when genuine patriots say 'my country, right or wrong,' they mean that it's their country whether or not they agree with what is done in its name,"" he wrote. ""That's the opposite of giving the country a free pass. It expresses a commitment to trying to help your country do what it should -- which is how we should normally feel about our families too.""

But, he argued that pride and shame in your country is about a concern for national honor and a shared responsibility for its fate.

""Leaving your country because you think it has gone off the rails isn't really consistent with this sense of shared responsibility or with a commitment to trying to make things better,"" he wrote.

While the columnist admitted ""skedaddling does strike me as unpatriotic,"" it ""doesn't mean patriotic self-sacrifice is a duty. If you're convinced that life here will be unbearable for you, you are morally free to go.""

Appiah said he didn't share the reader's concern that the U.S. was on the brink of authoritarianism as he grew up under civilian and military dictatorships in Ghana, where his dad was a political prisoner.

""But if I did believe what you believe, I confess that, as a patriot, I would want to stick around and join with others to help bring us back from disaster,"" he concluded.

The New York Times this week endorsed Kamala Harris for president and has endorsed every Democrat for president since John F. Kennedy in 1960.

Liberal celebrities have, for years, threatened to flee the country if Donald Trump was elected commander-in-chief.

Comedian Bill Maher called out the Hollywood stars in February over their previous vows to flee, but pointed out that they are ""still here.""

""And is it possible for a country to lose itself so much that leaving it is justified? Yes, but we're not there yet,"" Maher said. ""Not by a long shot. And we don't need quitters. We need people who will stay and fix it.""

""Maybe the problem isn't that America isn't worth defending. Maybe the problem is that lots of people today are entitled whiners who have no perspective and no idea how good they have it,"" he continued.

Maher recalled some of the celebrities who vowed they would leave the U.S. before Trump was elected president in 2016.

STORMY DANIELS' HUSBAND SAYS THEY'LL PROBABLY LEAVE COUNTRY IF TRUMP GETS ACQUITTED

""Miley Cyrus once said 'I am moving if Trump is my president. I don't say things I don't mean,"" Maher said. ""Here she is looking miserable having to endure America at the Grammys last Sunday. I guess she flew back from Tajkisistan.""

""In 2016, Eddie Griffin said, 'If Trump wins I'm moving to Africa' - apparently very slowly because in Trump's four years, he only got as far as Van Nuys,"" he continued. ""George Lopez once said that if Trump won, he 'won't have to worry about immigration. We'll all go back.' George Lopez, still here. And it doesn't look like the migrant traffic is going back.""

Last month, Trump's former attorney Michael Cohen, said he would leave the U.S. in the event of a second Trump term for fear of political retaliation after he cooperated with investigations into his former boss, publicly testifying against him during Alvin Bragg's hush money trial and becoming a vocal critic.

Cohen was asked, ""What do you think happens to you if he wins?"""
Speaker Johnson rips 'lack of leadership' in Biden admin's Helene response: 'alarmed and disappointed',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/speaker-johnson-rips-lack-leadership-biden-helene-response-alarmed-disappointed,2024-10-05T12:04:09Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., is criticizing the Biden administration's response to Hurricane Helene while warning the price tag for its recovery could be ""one of the most expensive"" the U.S. has seen.

""There were some pretty ominous projections, and so Congress acted appropriately,"" Johnson told Fox News Digital Friday evening, noting lawmakers freed up roughly $20 billion in immediate funding for FEMA in last month's short-term federal funding bill. ""But, so far, [President Biden, Vice President Harris and Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas] have failed in that response.""

Johnson said he was ""alarmed and disappointed"" by Biden officials' comments immediately after the storm suggesting FEMA was too low on funds to deal with Helene's wrath.

Mayorkas said ""we are meeting the immediate needs"" of the hurricane earlier this week but said ""FEMA does not have the funds to make it through the season.""

NORTH CAROLINA REELING FROM DEVASTATING HELENE AS DEATH TOLL CLIMBS: 'NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS'

Biden suggested earlier this week he may want Congress to return for an emergency session to pass a supplemental disaster aid bill.

""They are scrambling to cover their egregious errors and mistakes. And there's an effort to blame others or blame circumstances when this is just purely a lack of leadership and response,"" the speaker said. He noted Mayorkas said in July that FEMA was ""tremendously prepared"" for weather crises this year. Fox News Digital reached out to the White House and DHS for comment.

Johnson also argued lawmakers could not act until an assessment by state and local authorities produced projections of how much needs to be allocated.

""I don't think those estimates could conceivably be completed until at least 30 days -- until after the election, and that's when Congress will be back in session again,"" he said.

HURRICANE HELENE: NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS FIGHT FOR THEIR SURVIVAL AS BASIC GOODS BECOME SCARCE

The Republican leader is no stranger to hurricanes. He noted his native Louisiana is still dealing with the damage from Hurricane Katrina today, but his prediction was dire when asked about the cost of recovery after Helene ravaged the Southeast, killing more than 200 people.

He said it could be ""one of the most expensive storms that the country has ever encountered.""

""It affects at least six states -- a broad swath of destruction across many, many areas -- and I think that's why it's going to take a while to assess,"" Johnson said.

""As soon as those numbers are ready, Congress will be prepared to act,"" Johnson vowed at another point.

""I certainly hope the administration is working overtime right now to ... help get them prepared.""

As part of immediate response efforts, Johnson has toured areas in Georgia and Florida pummeled by the storm and is poised to visit hard-hit North Carolina in the coming days, he said.

Criticism over FEMA's response has prompted some conservatives to accuse the Biden administration of diverting disaster aid funds toward supporting illegal immigrants at the border through the Shelter and Services Program (SSP), which was allocated roughly $650 million in the last fiscal year.

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

Both the White House and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) have vigorously denied any link between disaster aid and SSP beyond both being administered by FEMA and have said claims of any disaster relief dollars being used to support migrant housing services are false.

""No disaster relief funding at all was used to support migrants' housing and services. None. At. All,"" White House Deputy Press Secretary Andrew Bates said in a memo on Friday. ""In fact, the funding for communities to support migrants is directly appropriated by Congress to CBP, and is merely administered by FEMA. The funding is in no way related to FEMA's response and recovery efforts.""

Johnson did not give a definitive answer when asked about the concerns echoed on the right, but he accused Mayorkas of mismanaging DHS.

""There is a lot of controversy about the nonsense that the Mayorkas Department of Homeland Security has engaged in. With their ... dangerous open-borders policy and then the relocation efforts of taking illegal aliens and transporting them around the country,"" Johnson said. ""We have been working every day, House Republicans, to stop the madness.

""And, so, what happened is that FEMA, because it's a division of DHS, it's very clear that they should be focused on helping Americans recover from disasters and not straining resources that go to other programs that are catering to illegals.""

When pressed on whether DHS was able to divert congressionally appropriated funding for disaster aid into SSP, Johnson said, ""There are different programs that have different funding.""

He pointed out that House Republicans are seeking to defund the SSP program in the current federal funding discussions for fiscal year 2025.

""We are doing everything within our power to prevent these abuses of the law and abuses of taxpayer dollars from the White House and the Democratic Party,"" Johnson said."
Why the slow collapse of Harris-Walz won't stop before Election Day,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/why-slow-collapse-harris-walz-wont-stop-before-election-day,2024-10-05T11:27:12Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Ohio Sen. JD Vance, as anticipated, easily won the vice-presidential debate Tuesday, October 1, on demeanor, facts, and analysis. But in fairness to a sometimes herky-jerky and nervous Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, he had the harder task of defending the temporary pseudo-conservative make-over of Democratic presidential nominee Vice President Kamala Harris.

His additional burdens were her co-culpability for the last three-and-a-half-years of the Biden disaster, and her unwillingness to implement her supposedly ""change"" agenda in the last months of her vice-presidential tenure.

The CBS News moderators, Nora O'Donnell, and, especially, Margaret Brennan, also as expected, ganged up on Vance. They had learned nothing, and forgotten nothing from the last disastrous, and biased debate moderators.

EMHOFF DENIES REPORT HE SLAPPED EX-GIRLFRIEND OUTSIDE RITZY OVERSEAS MOVIE EVENT

The two moderators shamelessly broke their own rules by fact-checking (wrongly and solely) Vance. They ignored questions of the administration's tardy responses to Hurricane Helene, the Ukraine war, the recent Trump assassination attempts, or crime, while only briefly touching on Iran and a Middle East on the brink of total war. Instead, they concentrated, as also expected, on climate change, abortion, healthcare and childcare.

All were issues they thought might more easily embarrass Vance. And, of course, as also expected, the two ended the debate pressing Vance on January 6. And yet Vance again parried easily and won decisively. In doing so, he dispelled the smear that he was somehow ""mean,"" when, in fact, he proved calm and magnanimous as he methodically dissected Walz.

The nation perhaps learned that a confident Trump selected him to articulate his MAGA positions, and perhaps in a manner superior to Trump's own.

In contrast, an insecure Harris picked Walz. The vice president was assuming that he would not upstage her and perhaps, by his limitations, would make her look competent in comparison.

The debate will give some momentum to Trump-Vance in the last month of the campaign.

It follows the lethargic Biden-Harris reaction to Hurricane Helene, whose toll in human life and property had been initially and vastly ignored by the media.

It follows the growing specter of a theater-wide Middle East war, as a solitary Israel faces off against Iran and its appendages (all empowered after 2020 by Biden-Harris).

It follows the chaos of a longshoremen's strike intended to shut down the entire country. And it follows Harris's continued inability to survive even serial soft-ball interviews without her memorized and banal answers.

As a result, the slow, steady hemorrhaging of support for Harris-Walz will likely still continue in the last month of the election."

Many conservative commentators said Friday that President Biden tying Vice President Kamala Harris so closely to his administration's record is a boon to former President Trump's campaign.

For the first time, Biden made an appearance during a White House press briefing where he spoke briefly about the averted port workers strike, Friday's positive jobs numbers and announced that he may request additional money from Congress to fund Hurricane Helene relief efforts.

Biden was asked what role Harris has played amid numerous crises at home and abroad.

""Well, she's, I'm in constant contact with her. She's aware we all, we're singing from the same song sheet. We, she helped pass all the laws that are being employed,"" said Biden.

""Now, she was a major player in everything we've done, including passage of legislation which we were told we could never pass. And so she's been, and her, her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we're doing,"" Biden continued.

Fox News Digital spoke with residents just south of Houston, Texas this week about the economy and who they trust more between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump to boost the economy as president.

After shopping at Costco, local residents expressed frustration with current overall costs and the economy as a whole, both on and off camera.

""All the prices have gone up,"" Melissa told Fox News Digital.

""No, it's not doing well at all,"" said another resident, originally from Egypt.

Ralph said the economy has resulted in increased costs for his family, stating, ""I think inflation is out of control. Housing and interest rates are out of control. Grocery trips have doubled. And a good grocery trip used to be like 150-125. Now an average grocery trip is now 250-300.""

Locals also shared who they feel will best handle the economy as president.

""When Trump was in office, you know, things were doing well,"" said Mark.

Ralph said he ""definitely"" trusts Trump more to tackle the economy.

""I don't think Kamala even knows what's going on. I think she's a puppet,"" he said. ""He's got a proven track record, hoping he gets back in and rescuing this Harris economy.""

Another resident also said she trusts the former president more: ""Trump, because he's the only businessman that's capable of running our country.""

Mark cited Trump's time in office compared to the current Biden-Harris administration as a reason for trusting the former president.

""Trump because of what he did the last time, who was in office and what the current administration, what's happened with the current administration over the past four years,"" he said. ""If it's not broke, don't fix it. You know, they tried to fix it. So here we are today.""

No Republican presidential candidate has lost Texas since 1976, but the state has become increasingly competitive in recent elections. Trump won it by less than six points in 2020, a sharp contrast from just 12 years ago when Mitt Romney carried the state by nearly 16.

The economy remains the top issue on the minds of American voters as they prepare to cast their ballot in the presidential election.

A September Fox News national poll also in the field entirely post-debate spotlighted that 39% of voters surveyed said the economy was their most pressing issue, far ahead of immigration (16%) and abortion (15%). All other issues tested were in single digits.

While the nation's economic recovery from the pandemic continues, inflation remains a leading concern among Americans.

The former president's up 13 points over the vice president in a post-debate survey from the New York Times and Siena College, and favored by 7 points in an ABC News Ipsos survey also conducted after the showdown.

But Trump's advantage over Harris on the economy stands at only 5 points in the Fox News poll, and just 2 points in the AP/NORC survey.

Harris has touted what she calls the ""opportunity economy"" and said her administration will crack down on price gouging and also lower taxes for middle-class Americans. Trump has pointed to economic performance under his administration as successful and that a return to office would bring back those days.

The Harris ticket was buoyed on Friday by a strong September jobs report. Also, striking U.S. dockworkers returned to work Friday after reaching a tentative agreement with employers on an improved wage offer."
Soros-linked dark money group props up Nebraska independent candidate in key Senate race,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/soros-linked-dark-money-group-props-up-nebraska-independent-candidate-key-senate-race,2024-10-05T08:18:45Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A Nebraska Senate race has emerged as one to watch with only weeks until the election, as an independent candidate with controversial backing vies to unseat Sen. Debbie Fischer, R-Neb.

Dan Osborn, a mechanic and union leader, is running as an independent against Fischer, and has prompted two prominent political handicappers to change their ratings of the race, indicating heightened competition.

Both the Cook Political Report and Sabato's Crystal Ball at the University of Virginia Center for Politics recently shifted the race from ""Solid"" or ""Safe"" Republican to ""Likely Republican."" The race is now alongside that of Sen. Rick Scott, R-Fla., in each rating system. Sabato's Crystal Ball also ranks the Nebraska Senate race in the same category as Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, but Cook has moved the Texas match-up to a more competitive placement.

TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM ONLY VP DEBATE BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ BEFORE ELECTION

Osborn is being backed by two outside PACs called Retire Career Politicians and the Nebraska Railroaders for Public Safety. The former has spent $3,004,274 on behalf of Osborn and the latter has doled out more than $400,000 in support of his candidacy so far, as well as over $20,000 explicitly against Fischer, according to OpenSecrets.

Both PACs have recently come under scrutiny for their controversial monetary backers. Democrat megadonor and Vice President Kamala Harris supporter Reid Hoffman, who co-founded LinkedIn, gave $50,000 to Nebraska Railroaders for Public Safety last year.

AS LEADER RACE LOOMS, JOHN THUNE TAKES SENATE MAP BY STORM TO BOOST GOP CANDIDATES

Retire Career Politicians received $800,000 from the controversial dark money group the Sixteen Thirty Fund in a matter of months. The group is operated by left-wing Washington, D.C., political consulting firm, Arabella Advisers.

While the Sixteen Thirty Fund does not reveal its donors' identities, billionaire George Soros' group, the Open Society Foundations, has granted the fund more than $75 million between 2016 and 2022, according to Open Society Foundations' website.

The Sixteen Thirty Fund also gave $50,000 to the Nebraska Railroaders for Public Safety.

KAMALA HARRIS ISN'T ALONE: VULNERABLE DEMS WANT CURRENT FILIBUSTER GONE

Mike Helmink, the co-founder and treasurer of Nebraska Railroaders for Public Safety told Fox News Digital they ""reached out to everybody, anybody and everybody to come in on railroad safety issues and independent politics. And what we found is a lot of people on the progressive side and the Democrat side want to participate. And what we've found is the Republicans have really circled the wagons around Deb and all of the money and all the commits have gone to Deb.""

He pointed out that without a Democrat candidate in the race, ""a lot of consultants and firms don't have commits if they're more of a Democrat leaning firm.""

""We really tried to get everybody and get a cross section and really build an organization going forward. You know, we would like to build this for the future, not just a one time and we're done. You know, we would like to get this and be successful and get a win, get Dan elected and then continue moving forward on the independents and also on railroad safety,"" he explained.

Fischer told Fox News Digital, ""I think Nebraskans are going to be really, really interested in learning more about the dark money that is spending millions of dollars his way.""

""Democrat dark money groups are spending millions of dollars backing Bernie Sanders acolyte Dan Osborn because he is a true radical. Osborn supports amnesty for illegal immigrants, has called for illegal immigrants to fill open jobs in Nebraska instead of Americans, and even wants to give Social Security benefits to illegals. Those aren't Nebraska values,"" National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSC) Communications Director Mike Berg said in a statement.

One of Osborn's ads notably takes shots at Fischer for donations to her campaign from lobbyists and special interest groups, comparing her to a race car driver with patches on her jacket. ""The only thing on the back of my jacket is Nebraska,"" he said in the spot.

The independent candidate has made his non-affiliation with a political party central to his campaign. However, this has been dashed by reporting from two outlets suggesting that Osborn was once a Democrat and that he did not consider himself an independent until 2016.

""I became an independent in 2016, really, after the Trump-Hillary debates. I just kind of became disenfranchised with the two parties, and it all seemed a little fake to me,"" he previously told Semafor.

Since replacing President Biden atop the Democrats' 2024 ticket in mid-July, Harris has enjoyed a wave of momentum and enjoyed a surge in fundraising. In the all-important cash dash, Harris and the DNC appear to hold a large advantage over Trump and the RNC.

And that's helped bolster what was already a very impressive ground game organizational advantage the Democrats held over the Republicans.

""We started laying the foundation well before 2024 by investing in our ground game,"" Harrison highlighted. ""We have been on the ground since the earliest days of this campaign getting our message out.""

The DNC chair touted that there are ""more than 312 coordinated offices across the battleground states,"" with ""over 2,000 coordinated staff...doing the hard work on the ground.""

The RNC chair emphasized that ""we have the resources we need to get our message out to our voters and to every voter. I feel very, very comfortable about the campaign plan.""

And while the Harris campaign and allied groups have outspent Trump and his aligned groups in the ad wars, Whatley pointed to the former president's ability to capture free media.

""Donald Trump is out there talking every single day to the voters in a way that only he can. He can generate news. He can go out there and generate social media hits. He can communicate directly with the American voters like no other politician of our generation, so it's a huge advantage for us,"" he said.

Veteran Democratic pollster Chris Anderson, who conducted the Fox News Poll along with longtime Republican pollster Daron Shaw, said with four weeks to go, ""my expectations of plausible outcomes range from a narrow Electoral College victory for Trump to a modestly more comfortable victory for Harris.""

TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS

But while Harris holds a slight two-point edge in an average of the national surveys, Shaw noted that ""the issue profile of this election continues to favor Trump.""

Veteran political scientist and New England College president Wayne Lesperance said that ""this presidential contest is shaping up to be one of the closest in history, with the results likely to be slow-coming.""

And longtime Republican consultant Matt Gorman, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, highlighted that ""we're slated for the tightest race since 2000.""

""There are no more debates. There's going to be a vacuum of news,"" he said. ""It's integral the Trump campaign fill that vacuum with a message that puts Harris on the defensive.""

Trump, like Biden, is a well-known commodity.

But Harris, even after being in the spotlight for nearly two months, is still less well-defined.

""The more voters get to know Vice President Harris, the more they like her,"" Democratic strategist and communicator Chris Moyer argued.

""It's imperative that she continues to get in front of swing state voters, and she could afford to do more in the final weeks,"" he offered. ""She should barnstorm the key states, filling up her schedule with rallies and local interviews and off-the-record stops that produce shareable clips that bounce around social media. They've run a nearly perfect race to this point, but many voters still want to know more about who she is, what she believes, and what she will do as president.""

With one month to go, there's always the possibility of an October surprise that could rock the White House race.

The dockworkers strike earlier this week - which closed major ports - could have wreaked havoc on the nation's supply chain. It could have turned into an October surprise, but the strike was suspended after just two days.

Hurricane Helene, which tore a path of destruction through the southeast, also made an impact on the presidential contest - and there were memories of how Superstorm Sandy rocked the 2012 White House race between then-President Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney.

And the strife in the Middle East - between Israel, Iran, and Hezbollah, also threatens to upend the election.

It's important to note that while Election Day is a month away, in over two-dozen states, early in-person voting, absentee balloting, and voting by mail, are already underway."
76 days: Kamala Harris has yet to do formal press conference since emerging as Democratic nominee,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/76-days-kamala-harris-has-yet-do-formal-press-conference-since-emerging-democratic-nominee,2024-10-05T04:16:53Z,"'The Five' co-hosts discuss Vice President Kamala Harris' media strategy heading into November.

Vice President Kamala Harris has gone 76 days as the presumptive, and now, official Democratic nominee for president without holding an official press conference.

Trump has held six news conferences where he took questions from the media since the beginning of August, including another on Friday after meeting with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp about hurricane relief efforts.

President Biden also held a news conference in the White House press briefing room on Friday, where he joked about getting back into the 2024 race.

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey last month at a star-studded campaign event. This week she taped an interview on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

HARRIS DODGES QUESTION ON LOWERING PRICES BY DESCRIBING 'MIDDLE-CLASS' ROOTS: NEIGHBORS 'PROUD OF THEIR LAWN'

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

""You know, I grew up in a neighborhood of folks who were very proud of their lawn,"" she said. ""And I was raised to believe and to know that all people deserve dignity, and that we as Americans have a beautiful character. You know, we have ambitions and aspirations and dreams, but not everyone necessarily has access to the resources that can help them fuel those dreams and ambitions.

""So when I talk about building an opportunity economy, it is very much with the mind of investing in the ambitions and aspirations and the incredible work ethic of the American people and creating opportunity for people, for example, to start a small business.""

BIDEN SAYS HE AND KAMALA HARRIS ARE 'SINGING FROM THE SAME SONG SHEET'- AS SHE TRIES DISTANCING HERSELF

JESSE WATTERS: It was the first time Biden ever set foot in the briefing room as president. The press was stunned. Peter Doocy's wig fell off, and every channel in America cut straight to it.

And Kamala Harris was about to go on TV and take credit for ending the port strike. And Biden looked and said, oh no, you don't and big footed her. Biden wanted full credit. He's a lame duck, but even lame ducks care about their legacy.

If you're the Harris campaign, it's like Biden is haunting you from the grave. Since the coup, Biden hasn't left his room for 43 days. He's gone 43 days without anybody laying eyes on him. There's a ghost in the White House. And in 15 minutes, that ghost spooked the Harris campaign.

'It all added up': Daily Mail reporter details allegations against second gentleman,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/it-all-added-up-daily-mail-reporter-details-allegations-against-second-gentleman,2024-10-05T02:12:00Z,"The Daily Mail senior reporter Josh Boswell outlines his process of investigation on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

Second gentleman Doug Emhoff's representative called a Daily Mail report detailing three unnamed sources who accused him of having slapped a former girlfriend during a 2012 trip to the Cannes Film Festival ""untrue.""

Fox News Digital has not been able to independently confirm the allegations.

""This report is untrue,"" an unnamed representative for Vice President Kamala Harris' husband told news outlet Semafor. ""Any suggestion that he would or has ever hit a woman is false.""

Daily Mail reporter Josh Boswell appeared on ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" and outlined the claims that Emhoff slapped his then-girlfriend in 2012.

""The process that I went through was extremely thorough and careful about this, because you're right, we're on the eve of an election, but the thing that made these sources come forward is not because there's an election, but because the Kamala Harris campaign was using Doug Emhoff, showing him as this feminist ally, baking up his credentials as an ally to women and that just enraged them,"" Boswell said.

""I quoted one of them in the piece saying this, that she thought that it was disgusting, that they were portraying him this way, when in fact, these friends knew what had really happened.""

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

The woman who was allegedly slapped is described by the Daily Mail as a successful New York attorney and is identified only by the pseudonym ""Jane.""

The incident was alleged to have occurred in 2012 while Emhoff and Jane were in a valet line at a Cannes Film Festival in Nice, France.

""Jane got into a cab. The valet, either with €100 that she slipped him or the fact that there was this domestic dispute going on apparently, ushered her into a car, but then Doug forced his way in too,"" Boswell recalled the alleged story. ""That's what the friends told me. That's when she got really scared. Jane called her male friend who was in New York at the time. So, it was kind of bedtime for him, but he took this call, and she told him what had happened. The next day she questioned Doug about it, and he seemed to be completely nonchalant about it. He used some tennis metaphor because he's into tennis. So, Jane slapped him back when he slapped her, and she slapped him back twice like this, one with each hand. Doug said, 'You got one down the line and across the court. So, it's no big deal.' That's all he had to say about it, and so Jane, of course, immediately broke up with him and never saw him again. They left. They went home separately. ""

The allegation was made to the Daily Mail by three people who described themselves as Jane's friends and who shared their recollections of the incident, along with travel itineraries and correspondence between Jane and Emhoff to corroborate the story. All three requested anonymity out of fear of potential retaliation from Emhoff.

""Those sources were each independently talking to us and their accounts closely corroborated each other,"" Boswell said. ""So, that's part of what gave me the confidence in this story. ""

One friend said Jane told her about the alleged incident at the time.

""He hauled up and slapped her so hard she spun around,"" the source is quoted as saying. ""She said she was in utter shock. She was so furious, she slapped him on one side, and then on the other cheek with the other hand.""

Another friend -- described by the Daily Mail as a New York businessman -- also gave his recollection of the alleged slap.

""It was very clear what she was telling me,"" that source said, according to the Daily Mail. ""She said she was with a guy, her date, she was at the Cannes Film Festival, and he hit her. She was in the car with the guy at the time.""

A third friend, described as a female executive, told the Daily Mail that she learned of the alleged incident in 2014, and purportedly found out new details from Jane in 2018, when Harris, then a senator from California, made headlines with her questioning of a Supreme Court nominee who had been accused of sexual assault.

The third source said that she had asked Jane if Emhoff had ever apologized and was told that he had not, but that ""he commented about the hit she gave him. It was a tennis metaphor. But no apology at all.""

According to the Daily Mail's sources, Jane and Emhoff had been dating for about three months before the reported trip to France. Emhoff allegedly cut the trip off early and returned to LA for his daughter's 13th birthday.

""Documents were very important,"" Boswell said. ""They helped prove that firstly, the relationship, you know, we've got this photograph of them together. We had other material like that. Then, the email actually references the fact that Doug had to leave early because he had to get back to L.A. in time for his daughter's birthday. Her birthday is May 29th. Their flight was scheduled to leave on May 29th. So, you can see that matched up. We got the flight details, and you can see they took a layover flight to take them to Nice. It all added up with what each of the sources were saying. Those sources were each independently talking to us and their accounts closely corroborated each other. So, that's part of what gave me the confidence in this story.""

Emhoff was married to his first wife from 1992 to 2009. The marriage ended following his affair with their children's nanny, who he got pregnant. Emhoff met now-Vice President Kamala Harris in 2013 when she was serving as California attorney general, and they were married in 2014.

The Harris campaign, the Office of the Vice President and a representative for Emhoff's ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, did not comment despite repeated requests from Fox News."

MSNBC analyst Michael Steele lashed out at Democrats and the press for putting pressure on Vice President Kamala Harris to engage more with the media, arguing Harris was being unfairly treated compared to her 2024 opponent, former President Trump.

""I don't see Donald Trump doing sit-downs and press conferences with the mainstream media every week,"" Steele said during a Friday interview on MSNBC.

""So let's stop -- let's hold her to the same standard we're holding Donald Trump. Because Donald Trump is not giving you anything except a rally in which he dribbles and -- and nods off and just goes off on -- on tangents. And the press accepts that. And yet they look at her and say, 'Well, how come you're not, you know, giving us more of what we want?' Well, as soon as you get it from Donald Trump, she'll give it to you,"" the former RNC chairman continued.

Trump and his running mate, Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, have sat down for at least 63 interviews since the Harris-Walz ticket was formed, compared to only 23 non-scripted interviews for the Democratic presidential ticket thus far.

DEMOCRATS WORRY ABOUT HARRIS' CAUTIOUS MEDIA APPROACH IN TIGHT 2024 RACE: 'VOTERS DESERVE BETTER'

Harris still has not held a formal press conference since replacing President Biden as the Democratic nominee, while Trump has held five since the beginning of September.

With just over a month to go until Election Day, some Democrats and media critics are warning the Harris-Walz campaign that their strategy could backfire with voters who are still uncertain about the Democratic candidate.

After the vice presidential debate last week, several media commentators argued Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, appeared unprepared because of his overall lack of media exposure on the national stage.

On MSNBC on Friday, host Chris Jansing asked Steele if Harris was being ""smart"" with her limited media approach this close to the election.

""Yes, yes, yes, a thousand times yes,"" Steele said, before dismissing these concerns.

""It's Democrats being Democrats and it's the mainstream media being the mainstream media. They want to be coddled. They want to show that they got the connection, they got the in,"" he said.

HARRIS LEADS TRUMP BY 2 IN NATIONAL POLL, BUT SHOWS VULNERABILITIES WITH NON-WHITE VOTERS

Steele argued that the vice president's campaign should not be compared to past presidential campaigns, because Harris emerged as the presidential nominee so late in the election cycle. He said she was being selective in her media appearances with the limited time left until election day.

""At the end of the day, you're talking 140 days to run a national presidential campaign. She's got to be particular with the targets. If she had an extra 400 days, everybody would get touched in the mainstream media and in the Democratic Party. This is not the Hillary campaign of 2016, this is not Joe Biden's campaign of 2020,"" he said.

""I think she's focused where she needs to be, and the Democrats need to stop acting like Democrats, get your behind on the ground, organize, turn out your vote. You need to overwhelm the ballot box on November 5, because that's the end game. And don't worry about a press conference today. You need to worry about how many voters you got turning out on November 5,"" he continued.

Harris campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz defended the campaign's media strategy in a statement to NBC News Friday.

""Our task for the final stretch of this campaign is ensuring that [Harris'] winning vision reaches the undecided voters who will decide this election in places and ways that will actually reach them. That may look different in today's evolving media environment than prior campaigns, but coupled with campaign events, aggressive organizing and a historic paid media campaign, it's a winning approach,"" Munoz said.

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits, a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station and an interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle."

President Joe Biden held the floor for an impromptu Q&A session Friday afternoon during the White House press briefing, where he claimed Vice President Kamala Harris is ""in constant contact."" His comments may not come across as music to the Harris campaign's ears.

In the president's surprise appearance, he remarked on the port strike, the latest jobs numbers, and briefly on Hurricane Helene. No reporters asked about the administration's response to the storm, but one asked Biden to assess whether Harris has been deeply involved in policy.

""Well, she's, I'm in constant contact with her. She's aware we all, we're singing from the same song sheet. We, she helped pass all the laws that are being employed,"" said Biden.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS TOPS TRUMP BY TWO POINTS

""Now, she was a major player in everything we've done, including passage of legislation which we were told we could never pass. And so she's been, and her, her staff is interlocked with mine in terms of all the things we're doing,"" Biden continued.

The president strongly linked Vice President Harris to the Biden administration's record over the past 3 ½ years, despite the Harris campaign's attempts to distance her from everything from ""Bidenomics"" to inflation to the border crisis, since Biden announced he was ending his reelection campaign, and Harris assumed the mantle of nominee.

Harris recently changed the Biden fiscal year 2025 plan from a capital gains tax rate of 39.6% on a salary of $1M or more to her own 28%, for example. As illegal migration across the border surged to historic levels, Harris has also insisted she was never in charge of Biden's border policy, despite Biden personally handing her the reins at the White House in March 2021.

Axios reported that Harris would begin creating some daylight between herself and Biden in August in order to defeat Trump, as inflation raged, wars in Ukraine and the Middle East heated up, the border crisis continued, crime lingered as a concern, and other factors, including Harris' own weak approval rating, weighed her campaign down. Other outlets and pundits on the left soon followed suit.

But Biden has reportedly bristled about his vice president distancing herself from him behind the scenes. He has also hinted that he believes he could have won the election had he not dropped out.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS IN 'DANGER ZONE' AS AMERICANS WORRY ABOUT COUNTRY'S DIRECTION, SAYS CNN DATA GURU

During an appearance on The View last week, Biden said, ""I never fully believed the assertions that somehow there was this overwhelming reluctance to my running again. The fact of the matter is, my polling was always in range of beating [Trump]."" Biden even joked about jumping back into the race during Friday's surprise appearance at the White House.

He also began his first White House briefing appearance of his presidency at the same Harris was taking the stage at a campaign event, raising questions over whether it was a communications issue between him and the campaign, or he was trying to upstage her.

Biden sparked questions on the topic before, on the anniversary of September 11, by wearing a Trump hat momentarily. The White House referred it to as a ""unity gesture"" - after Biden spent years casting Trump as a ""threat to democracy.""

The Harris campaign has further distanced itself from the Biden administration by mentioning him less and less often as the election nears. During Tuesday's Vice Presidential Debate, Harris' running mate, Gov. Tim Walz, only referred to the sitting president by referencing the ""Biden-Harris administration.""

A Rolling Stone reporter argued Friday that former President Trump wishes he could have ""death squads"" of police to shoot criminals and pile their bodies in the streets.

MSNBC host Jonathan Lemire interviewed Asawin Suebsaeng about a piece he wrote with fellow Rolling Stone senior politics reporter Tim Dickinson headlined, ""'American Death Squads': Inside Trump's Push to Make Police More Violent.""

Trump spoke about crime at a rally in Erie, Pennsylvania, this past Sunday, suggesting that a brief, decisive period of law enforcement could drastically reduce crime in America.

""One rough hour -- and I mean real rough -- the word will get out and it will end immediately, you know? It will end immediately,"" Trump said.

""So it wasn't just that Trump saw the film 'The Purge' on his flight there heading to that rally, there's some teeth to this proposal,"" Lemire said as he spoke to Suebsaeng about his piece. ""Tell us what you found.""

The Rolling Stone reporter said that this statement from Trump was ""definitely not a rhetorical one-off thing,"" and that ""he and his chief ideological lieutenants have shown over the years, including during his administration, including during this current campaign, that they want to back up with the full force of the Department of Justice, the executive branch, and the federal government.""

Suebsaeng claimed that according to insiders from the Trump White House, the former president had outbursts demanding crackdowns on criminals.

""During his presidency, there would be multiple times where, according to our sources, he would be doing things like banging his fist on the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office and demanding that, 'Why aren't the police going around shooting all kinds of street criminals and drug dealers and piling up their bodies on American streets, so it can send a very grim message to gangs and all kinds of other suspected criminals in America?'"" the reporter claimed.

""He did this so often and so garrulously that there were some administration officials who referred to it to us as his 'American death squads' idea, which was something highly influenced by his admiration of what Rodrigo Duterte did in the Philippines,"" he added.

""Is it possible that a second term, re-elected Trump could get exactly that? No, maybe not. But the point is, he wants to get to as close to that as humanly possible, which is a remarkable thing for a modern American presidency,"" he said.

Suebsaeng then claimed that in late 2020, Trump ""toyed with the idea of pulling federal funding from different states and cities that were not sufficiently 'pro-cop' enough for his liking, or didn't let the police get away with enough degrees of abusive behavior or even alleged racial bias. He'd threaten to pull federal funding if they didn't do those things to his liking.""

He claimed further that Trump ""has talked to people recently about using pardon powers to excuse different officers, where people have been federally charged with things.""

CNN senior data reporter Harry Enten noted on Friday that it would be unprecedented for Vice President Kamala Harris, representing the incumbent Democratic Party, to win the presidency considering so few Americans believe the country is on the ""right track,"" according to recent polling.

Enten pointed to polling showing that only 28% of Americans currently think America is on the right track and noted that this is close to the average rating when the party in power loses major elections.

""You're very much in the danger zone when we're looking at that right track, wrong direction number, that's where Democrats are right now,"" the data reporter declared.

CNN DATA GURU SAYS HARRIS STRUGGLING WITH 'UNDERPERFORMANCE' FROM YOUNG VOTERS AMID TAYLOR SWIFT ENDORSEMENT

Enten explained the predicament, noting both the historical average percentage of Americans who believe the country is on the right track when the incumbent party loses an election - 25% - and the average percentage in the same category when that party retains power via an election, which he revealed was 42%.

He spelled out to viewers that the current 28% right track number is much closer to the rate that is present when the incumbent loses.

Pointing to the numbers on screen, Enten said, ""Look at that. It's just 25%. That looks a heck of a lot like that 28%, right, that currently think the country's on the right track.""

He continued, ""When the White House party wins - i.e. Kamala Harris' party, the Democrats - 42% on average think that the country is on the right track. This 25% looks a lot more like this 28%. It doesn't look anything like this 42%.""

Summarizing the data, he declared, ""This to me is a bad sign for Kamala Harris' campaign. The bottom line is it looks a lot more like a loser than it does like a winner when it comes to the country being on the right track.""

CNN anchor John Berman asked if it was possible that the Democratic Party could win with these numbers, to which Enten cited the average ""right track"" rate during every election since 1980 in which the incumbent won.

His chart revealed that the lowest rate of Americans thinking the country was on the right track when an incumbent won in the modern era was in 1996, when 39% of voters thought the nation was moving in the right direction.

The other rates were at 41% or higher when incumbents won since 1980, the highest being 47% of the country thought it was on the right track when former President Ronald Reagan won re-election in 1984 by a landslide.

""There is no historical precedent for the White House party winning another term in the White House when just 28% of the country thinks that we're on the right track,"" he said, adding, ""John, simply put, it would be historically unprecedented.""

At Berman's urging, Enten mentioned a small hope for Democrats that the latest midterm elections could represent the country is in a new era in this regard, showing numbers revealing that the Democratic Party had a successful 2022 midterms even though only 26% thought the country was on the right track at the time.

""Maybe we've entered a new political environment where Donald Trump is so unpopular that these historical norms, these historical measures that we look at don't actually mean what we think anymore,"" he stated.

""I'll tell you this much, Kamala Harris better hope that's the case, because otherwise this right track, wrong direction situation will not work out in their favor."""

Reporters had a unique opportunity to question President Biden when he made a surprise appearance at the White House press briefing on Friday, but didn't ask about the historic disaster unfolding in the Southeast in the wake of Hurricane Helene.

It was the first time that Biden appeared at a White House press briefing since taking office. The president spoke briefly about the suspended port workers strike and Friday's positive jobs numbers, and he announced that he may request additional money from Congress to fund Hurricane Helene relief efforts. But there was no follow-up from the press on hurricane relief.

After thanking the president for his presence, the first reporter asked about Republicans casting doubt on his economic numbers, saying, ""Florida Sen. Marco Rubio described today's jobs report as having fake numbers. What do you make of that? And how worried are you that many Americans are hearing that the jobs numbers aren't real?""

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

The crisis in the Middle East was the biggest topic, with questions about Biden's comments about strikes on Iranian oil facilities, Israeli plans to retaliate, possible U.S. sanctions, and worries about Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu trying to influence the U.S. election.

Election security and the peaceful transfer of power were also top of mind for reporters.

""The election is a month away. One, I'd like to know how you're feeling about how this election is going. And then also, do you have confidence that it will be a free and fair election and that it will be peaceful?"" one reporter asked. ""Are you making any preparations, getting security briefings related to domestic security?""

The only mention of Hurricane Helene, with a death toll topping 230, was in a question about Vice President Kamala Harris' role in the administration.

""There have obviously been a number of crises that the country has been facing over the past several days with the hurricane, with the port strike, with the situation in the Middle East. Can you talk about how your vice president, who is running for the presidency, has worked on these crises and what role she has played over the past several days?"" a reporter asked.

BIDEN GETS DEFENSIVE WHEN PUSHED ON WHO'S 'COMMANDING' HURRICANE HELENE RESPONSE

The Biden-Harris administration has come under fire from former President Trump for the federal response to the devastation left by Helene, already one of the deadliest hurricanes this century.

The White House has pushed back hard against these criticisms, emphasizing that Biden has coordinated the federal response, including approving emergency declarations and deploying 1,000 active-duty soldiers to support search-and-rescue efforts. More than 4,800 personnel from FEMA and other agencies have been deployed to North Carolina and neighboring states impacted by Helene. Additionally, FEMA has shipped over 8.5 million meals, more than 7 million liters of water, 150 generators and over 220,000 tarps to aid response efforts, according to the White House.

As of Friday, the federal government has provided more than $45 million in Individual assistance to survivors affected by the storm, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said, including in the form of one-time $750 payments from FEMA to qualified applicants in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia.

Fox News Politics Newsletter: Harris' Heavy Hitter,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-politics-newsletter-harris-heavy-hitter,2024-10-04T21:01:11Z,"Welcome to the Fox News Politics newsletter, featuring the latest political news from Washington, D.C. and updates from the 2024 campaign trail.

Former President Obama is preparing to hit the campaign trail next week for Vice President Harris, focusing on key battleground states in the lead up to Election Day, according to a senior campaign official with anonymity to discuss the matter.

Obama, who served back-to-back terms as president from 2009 through 2017, will kick off his drive in the Pittsburgh area of Pennsylvania on Thursday, a state which remains one of the tightest contests in the nation and which could tip the scales for either candidate.

A Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters last week found Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by 2 points (50-48%) among registered voters, while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters. President Biden won the state by more than 80,000 votes in 2020.

President Obama's Senior Advisor Eric Schultz tells Fox News that the 44th president is determined to help Harris and other Democrats get elected.

""President Obama believes the stakes of this election could not be more consequential and that is why he is doing everything he can to help elect Vice President Harris, Governor Walz and Democrats across the country,"" Schultz said. ...Read More

San Jose State volleyball coach with transgender player says politics plays into opponents forfeiting,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/san-jose-state-volleyball-coach-transgender-player-politics-plays-into-opponents-forfeiting,2024-10-04T20:52:33Z,"'Fox News @ Night' panelists Peachy Keenan and Elizabeth Barcohana discuss Vice President Kamala Harris' changing position on transgender surgery for inmates.

The San Jose State women's volleyball team lost to Colorado State on Thursday night in one of their rare non-cancelled games in recent weeks. Head coach Todd Kress said he even considered thanking Colorado State coach Emily Kohan just for agreeing to play his team, as the program is currently at the center of a national controversy.

Four of San Jose State's scheduled opponents - Boise State, Southern Utah, Wyoming and Utah State - all forfeited their games to the Spartans amid an ongoing lawsuit by one of its players over the presence of a transgender player on the team.

""I walked up to Emily tonight, and I was like, 'Should I say thank you for playing us?' I seriously meant that because, of course, we're disappointed that we're losing opportunities to play, but it's not just us that are losing opportunities to play. It's the people choosing not to play us, and that's very unfortunate when it comes to these young women that have earned the right to step on the court and play,"" Kress said in a postgame press conference, as seen in documents obtained by Fox News Digital.

San Jose Redshirt junior Blaire Fleming, who had 14 kills but with 10 errors on Thursday night, is a transgender athlete who has played for San Jose State since 2022 after transferring from Coastal Carolina. Meanwhile, junior Brooke Slusser, who joined the team in 2023 after transferring from Alabama, joined in a lawsuit against the NCAA, headed by former college swimmer and OutKick contributor Riley Gaines, over the governing body's current policies on gender identity. Slusser cited her experience with Fleming when she joined the lawsuit.

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL TEAM WITH TRANSGENDER PLAYER GETTING POLICE PROTECTION AMID INTENSE BACKLASH

Slusser claimed that she had not been aware that Fleming was transgender, despite sharing rooms together on team trips, per the court documents. Slusser also expressed safety concerns for opponents playing against Fleming. Slusser's complaint said that she and the other players on the team ""could not fully protect themselves"" from Fleming's volleyball spikes.

Idaho governor Brad Little, Utah governor Spencer Cox and Wyoming governor Mark Gordon commended the four universities in their respective states over the decisions to forfeit their games against San Jose State amid the controversy.

Kress said he believes that the role of government has impeded his team's ability to play the matches on its schedule.

""We're in a position where it appears that government and politics has kind of intertwined itself with college sports. And the one thing that I love about college sports, it's always been a safe haven for me, that's one area that government I don't think should be involved. And it seems that some of those decisions are being made at levels to where they're denying their student athletes as well, which is then denying our student athletes,"" Kress said.

Many states have taken legislative action over the past year aimed to keep transgenders out of women's sports, including the Defending Women's Sports Act, which Little issued an executive order for his states to carry out in August.

However, most of these actions are in response to attempted Title IX changes by the Biden-Harris administration. In April, the Biden administration issued a sweeping rule that clarified that Title IX's ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions.""

GOP GOVERNOR REVEALS WHY HE ORDERED SCHOOLS TO BAR TRANSGENDERS FROM GIRLS SPORTS

The rule took effect Aug. 1, and, for the first time, the law stated that discrimination based on sex includes conduct related to a person's gender identity. The Biden administration insisted that the regulation does not address athletic eligibility. However, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that Biden's claims that it would not result in biological men participating in women's sports weren't true and that the proposal would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.

The Supreme Court voted 5-4 to reject a Biden emergency request to enforce portions of that new rule that includes protection from discrimination for transgender students under Title IX, after more than two dozen Republican attorneys general sued to block the Title IX changes in their own states.

Now, with states like Idaho taking countermeasures against these amendments, Little may have to prepare for even further countermeasures at the federal level in the event of a Harris victory this November.

""We'll cross that bridge when we come to it,"" Little told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview when asked whether he expects a Harris victory to result in his schools losing federal funding due to the order he just passed. ""From a national standpoint, there are radical little groups that want to implement changes in the rules that we have already.""

Meanwhile, Kress will look to navigate his team's season in a landscape of different state laws impacting his team's schedule. Kress added that the situation involving the game cancelations, the lawsuit and national controversy have impacted the mental well-being not only of Fleming, but the team as a whole.

""I talked to all of our students. You know, I am a father first, right? I had two boys of my own, and I know that mental health is a real thing, and I know that my kids get through it, and so I think that's the first thing I look out for, is protecting physical and mental health. Do I talk with Blaire? She is taking the majority of the heat, but all of our athletes are taking some of this. So, you know, I'm really trying to talk to all of our student athletes and see how they're doing,"" Kress said.

Things have gotten to the point where university police have been assigned to provide added security to the team in response to negative attention it has received recently, a San Jose State spokesperson told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

Still, San Jose State was technically undefeated going into Thursday night, as the forfeits by the other programs counted as wins for the Spartans by default. They are now 9-1 with a 3-1 conference record. The forfeits don't count toward the team's NCAA resume, but Fleming's skills and spiking ability may be just one advantage that could help the team reach the tournament, as Kress believes the tension in the locker room might not be ""a bad thing"" from a competitive standpoint.

""Sometimes tension is not necessarily a bad thing, and I'm not saying that there is. But you know, when you do have tension or you do have confrontations, I mean, I'm a person that believes that from confrontation, good things usually happen. We settle our differences, and we work through it,"" Kress said.

""The last thing that I would want is there's the white elephant in the room, and there is no tension, we don't address it, and we never move past it, right? So I think there may be tension, but it dies. If we're in a meeting room and there's tension, it dies there. If there's tension on the court, it dies there. We really don't let the boundaries cross over, and that's how I think we've been so successful thus far."""
'The View' co-host Joy Behar begs Republicans to vote for Democratic Party: 'Just do it this one time',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/view-co-host-joy-behar-begs-republicans-vote-democratic-party-just-one-time,2024-10-04T20:09:27Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

""The View"" co-host Joy Behar urged Republican voters to put aside their party affiliation and vote for the Democratic Party just this one time to get rid of former President Trump.

Behar made the appeal during a conversation about former GOP Rep. Liz Cheney recently endorsing Vice President Kamala Harris' candidacy, asking other Republicans to join her in voting against Trump this election cycle.

""Just do it this one time. Do it this one time. Vote for the Democrat to save the country,"" she said.

WORKING CLASS WILL COME HOME TO HARRIS, RALLYGOERS IN POSTINDUSTRIAL PENNSYLVANIA SAY

Prior to Behar's appeal, ""The View"" panel discussed the individual Republicans, including co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin and Cheney, who are working to stop Trump's second term. Griffin, a former Trump aide, brought up her upcoming ""fireside chat"" she's doing in Pennsylvania alongside Cheney and former Trump staffers Cassidy Hutchinson and Sarah Matthews next week.

""I've never voted for a Democrat in my life,"" Griffin said. ""This man is so wholly unfit for office. And so, next week I'm traveling to battleground Pennsylvania with Liz Cheney and my friend Sarah Matthews and Cassidy Hutchison. And we're there with a nonpartisan group to talk about the threat that Donald Trump poses and why he should not be back in the White House.""

Griffin's comments prompted cheers from the audience and a wider conversation about how it's significant that conservatives like Cheney are aligning themselves with the Democratic Party this election cycle.

Co-host Sunny Hostin said, ""I certainly have been a Liz Cheney critic because, you know, she voted with Trump 93% of the time. But I have had a change of heart when it came to this, when I saw this, because I think it's brilliant that Kamala Harris is willing to have other voices in the room. I think it says a lot about the type of president that she would be.""

She then brought up how Harris pledged to have a Republican in her cabinet as president, which prompted the panel to wonder if that cabinet member could be Cheney.

Later, the topic of bipartisanship led to co-host Ana Navarro reminiscing about her own switch to voting Democrat after voting Republican her whole life. ""So I voted for Hillary Clinton in 2016. It was the first time I voted for a Democrat and it was a very difficult thing to do, because when politics has been such a part of your profession, of your social circle, of your family life, it really is a very hard thing to do.""

""So I want us to recognize just how hard what she did is and Liz Cheney has been paying a price for standing on principle since January 6,"" Navarro declared."

President Biden entered the White House briefing room on Friday to audible gasps from reporters as he unexpectedly took the podium and fielded questions.

It was the first time that Biden, 81, made an appearance during a White House press briefing since he assumed office in 2021. The president spoke briefly about the averted port workers strike, Friday's positive jobs numbers and announced that he may request additional money from Congress to fund Hurricane Helene relief efforts.

""We're going to have to deal with unforeseen cost what this hurricane is going to cost. It's going to cost a lot of money and I'm probably going to have to ask the Congress before we leave for more money to deal with some of those problems,"" Biden said.

The Biden-Harris administration has come under fire from former President Trump for a purportedly inadequate response to the devastation left by Helene. The death toll in southeastern states hit hardest by the storm has risen past 215, with more than 100 dead in western North Carolina alone.

Biden's surprise in-person appearance in the White House briefing room comes after an Axios report highlighted his absence from public view in the final months of his presidency.

Axios reported Thursday that Biden had not scheduled a public event in 43 of the 75 days since he dropped out of the 2024 presidential election. He has participated in just one campaign event with Vice President Kamala Harris, who succeeded him as the Democratic nominee.

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

Critics, including many Republicans, have questioned whether Biden is able to handle the pressures of the presidency at his advanced age, noting that most of his public appearances are scheduled between 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. The president has also only given two interviews since July 21.

White House spokesman Andrew Bates waved off criticism of Biden's public schedule as part of the White House's media strategy in a statement to Axios.

""Being commander-in-chief is about far more than public events, which are scheduled at strategic times to reach the most Americans possible, like before 20 million Americans watch the national evening news,"" Bates told the outlet.

Biden admin won't extend parole for Venezuelan migrants in US via controversial flight program: report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-admin-wont-extend-parole-venezuelan-migrants-us-via-controversial-flight-program-report,2024-10-04T19:12:32Z,"Economist Steve Moore comments on the border crisis and illegal immigration on 'Fox Report.'

The Biden administration has reportedly decided against extending parole for tens of thousands of Venezuelan migrants who came to the U.S. through a controversial Biden-era travel program that was temporarily halted due to discoveries of fraud in the program earlier this year.

Officials have decided not to extend parole for Venezuelan nationals who came into the U.S. via the parole processes for Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans and Venezuelans (CHNV), according to a CBS News report.

The program was first implemented for Venezuelans in October 2022 and extended to the other nationalities in January 2023. It allows migrants to use the CBP One app to enter the U.S. on temporary parole and receive a work permit if they pass background checks and have a sponsor.

NEW POLL REVEALS TRUMP HAS SIGNIFICANT LEAD ON IMMIGRATION, BORDER SECURITY IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE

Through the end of August 2024, nearly 530,000 Cubans, Haitians, Nicaraguans, and Venezuelans arrived lawfully on commercial flights and were granted parole under these processes, nearly 117,000 Venezuelans.

The program has received furious opposition from Republicans, some of whom have described the administration as running migrant flights, but under this program, migrants must organize their own travel.

However, the program was paused briefly in August when an internal report unearthed large amounts of fraud in applications of those sponsoring the program. It later unfroze the program after installing what it said were additional vetting and protections against fraud.

BIDEN ADMIN FREEZES CONTROVERSIAL MIGRANT FLIGHT PROGRAM AFTER FRAUD REVELATIONS

It was expected that the administration would extend the parole status, as it has done with other parole populations, but CBS reported that DHS has decided against it, and Venezuelans would be told to either apply for another immigration status or leave the country -- although Venezuela is currently not accepting deportations from the U.S. It is also unclear if the administration intends to stop bringing in new migrants via the program. DHS did not respond to a request for comment.

If they arrived before July 2023, they may be eligible for Temporary Protected Status, which the Biden administration redesignated and extended for Venezuelans last year.

The status of the other three nationalities will begin to expire in January next year if the administration makes a similar decision not to extend their parole status.

The move will likely infuriate immigration activists, who have cried foul as the administration has moved away from more liberal policies as the election approaches. The administration threw its weight behind a bipartisan border security bill this year that would have allowed for a limit to be placed on asylum entries and given additional funding to border agencies.

DHS DOCS REVEAL WHERE PAROLED MIGRANTS UNDER CONTROVERSIAL BIDEN FLIGHT PROGRAM ARE LANDING

When that bill failed to pass, President Biden signed an order limiting asylum entries in June, which was followed by a sharp drop in arrivals at the border by more than 50%, leading to numbers lower than anything during the current administration.

The administration has also touted an increase in removals. Biden followed that up with a ""parole in place"" scheme for illegal immigrant spouses of U.S. citizens. But in the last week, he announced new measures to prevent that limit on arrivals at the border from being lifted.

It comes as Vice President Harris battles with former President Donald Trump over who is the tougher candidate on border security. Harris has accused Trump of failing to back the border security bill for political reasons, while Trump has accused Harris of being responsible for the crisis at the border.

Democrats are warning Vice President Kamala Harris that she needs to ramp up her engagement with voters and the media or it could cost her the election.

Harris is neck-and-neck with former President Trump in the 2024 race, according to national polls. While Harris and her running mate, Tim Walz, have stepped up their interviews in recent weeks, she has also faced criticism from media critics for being evasive, even in interviews with friendly liberal outlets like MSNBC.

""Ms. Harris responded to the fairly basic and predictable questions with roundabout responses that did not provide a substantive answer,"" The New York Times reported after Harris' interview with MSNBC host Stephanie Ruhle last month.

According to a Friday report from NBC News, some Democrats are worried the Harris campaign's media strategy won't help win over undecided voters who have yet to warm up to the Democratic presidential candidate.

75 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO FORMAL PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

""They're trying to keep her away,"" Steve Shurtleff, former Democratic speaker of the New Hampshire House of Representatives, told NBC News of the Harris campaign. ""It's like seeing your favorite Hollywood actor, and then they're on a talk show and they can't even speak.""

""The President of the United States has to be able to be on their toes all the time and answer questions,"" he continued. ""It's so obvious she's been avoiding the one-on-one interviews, and the voters deserve better.""

Other Democrats in the report said that the Harris campaign's approach of avoiding the media was a risky strategy in such a tight race.

""The campaign is taking a chance that they can run out the clock and Trump's weaknesses will be enough to win,"" Chris Kofinis, a Democratic strategist told NBC. ""But the danger in that is if you don't define your own candidacy well enough, people will start defining it themselves.""

HARRIS LEADS TRUMP BY 2 IN NATIONAL POLL, BUT SHOWS VULNERABILITIES WITH NON-WHITE VOTERS

""It's been a mistake to shield Walz and Harris from interviews,"" a Democratic lawmaker also told NBC. ""It's like playing basketball -- if you don't play for weeks, you're not going to get it into a game and do well. You've got to be on the court...I would have them out there very extensively.""

Harris campaign spokesperson Kevin Munoz said in a statement to NBC, ""Our task for the final stretch of this campaign is ensuring that [Harris'] winning vision reaches the undecided voters who will decide this election in places and ways that will actually reach them. That may look different in today's evolving media environment than prior campaigns, but coupled with campaign events, aggressive organizing and a historic paid media campaign, it's a winning approach.""

It's uncertain if this strategy will convince undecided voters to support Harris.

According to the latest Fox News poll of voters in Pennsylvania, Harris retains a narrow edge over Trump among registered voters and the race is tied among likely voters in the battleground state.

"Trump can win on these 3 key issues, Michigan voters tell Fox",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-can-win-three-key-issues-michigan-voters-tell-fox,2024-10-04T17:40:00Z,"Trump supporters in Saginaw, Michigan, told Fox News Digital the top issues Trump should hit as he seeks to win the critical swing state.

Michigan voters attending former President Donald Trump's Saginaw rally Thursday told Fox News Digital that the former president needs to focus on the economy to win the critical swing state, particularly job creation and curbing inflation.

""Opening up the pipelines to get the jobs back,"" one voter who attended Trump's rally on the campus of Saginaw Valley State University said when asked which issue the former president needs to focus on to win Michigan.

The comments come as Trump made yet another visit to the crucial swing state of Michigan, a state that could play a decisive role in determining who wins November's election. It also marked the second time the former president visited mid-Michigan in just a few weeks, a blue collar area of the state where the campaign believes it can make inroads with voters in what promises to be a close race.

TRUMP'S 2ND TERM FOREIGN POLICY LIKELY TO FOCUS ON 'STRENGTH' AND 'DETERRENCE': EXPERT

Vice President Kamala Harris is set to visit the same area of the state Friday, signifying the importance of Michigan as the clock nears the end of a dramatic election season.

Polls show Michigan as a toss up as of Wednesday, with the Real Clear Politics Polling average giving Harris a thin lead of just 0.7 points in the state. However, polls also showed Trump trailing former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and President Biden in Michigan by 5.3 and 5.7 points respectively, numbers that turned out much more favorable to Trump on election day.

Trump narrowly won Michigan in 2016 before dropping it to Biden in another close race in 2020, but voters in mid-Michigan believe Trump's focus on the economy should help put him over the top in 2024.

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

""Bring inflation down and safety and security in the state of Michigan,"" one voter told Fox News Digital.

""Illegal border crossings and the economy,"" another voter said. ""Keeping jobs in America, lowering inflation.""

However, other voters signaled that Trump could win on a range of issues, including national security and reducing crime in inner cities.

""Our national security does come first. But if the people at home, if they can't make ends meet, they're living in misery, that's just as important,"" a voter told Fox News Digital. ""Being truthful to the American people, which he has been.""

""Focusing on the inner cities. Putting together ways to decrease the violence,"" another voter said.

Meanwhile, one voter who said she was at the rally to support Trump said that the former president could lead the charge in helping Michigan residents see the issue of abortion differently.

During the interview, Yui also suggested that Taiwan's government was in touch with both Vice President Harris and former President Trump's circles to be prepared for whatever comes next in U.S. relations.

""The whole world is watching, and I'm sure the diplomatic community here in Washington, D.C., is also watching closely and [trying] to reach out to both candidates or to the people around the candidates,"" Yui said.

Blinken penned an op-ed in Foreign Affairs Magazine on Oct. 1 that said world powers were in competition to set the stage for a ""new age"" of international relations.

Jonathan and Jennifer Soros have also donated to Gillen's campaign directly, each contributing $3,300 this year. Another Soros son, Robert Soros, donated $2,900 to Gillen's unsuccessful 2022 campaign to unseat Republican Rep. Anthony D'Esposito.

""It is incredibly problematic that George Soros is paying candidates to run for office through a program disguised as a 'fellowship,'"" said Caitlin Sutherland, executive director of the nonprofit watchdog group Americans for Public Trust, in a statement to Fox News Digital.

WALZ BLASTED FOR HUDDLING WITH GEORGE SOROS' SON AT NYC LUXURY APARTMENT: 'BILLIONAIRE NEPO BABY'

""Voters should be seriously alarmed that Laura Gillen, who is claiming to run on ethics and transparency, is being personally propped up by a Soros group that is advocating for open borders, anti-police measures, and radical energy policies,"" Sutherland continued. ""This raises crucial questions about who Gillen will answer to if elected to Congress: the voters...or George Soros?""

Gillen has claimed that pointing out Soros funding for her campaign is responsible for ""antisemitic violence.""

Rep. Dan Goldman, a fellow New York Democrat, has also accused D'Esposito, whom Gillen is challenging again this cycle, of ""using a disgusting antisemitic trope"" by pointing out Soros' backing.

Soros' groups have heavily funded organizations behind antisemitic protests since last year aimed at delegitimizing Israel and stopping U.S. support for its military campaign against the terrorist groups Hamas and Hezbollah.

The Open Society Action Fund's $18,055,000 in funding for Our American Future Action began in 2023 and was slated to finance activities stretching for 19 months, according to a grants database on the Open Society Foundations website. Tax filings indicate the Jonathan and Jennifer Alan Soros Foundation's donation also came in 2023, the same year Gillen drew her fellowship salary.

The fellowship program is designed to provide aspiring political candidates, overwhelmingly Democrats, with money to cover basic living expenses while they focus on future political campaigns.

Several Democratic candidates in competitive 2024 contests have received funding from the group, including California's Will Rollins, Nebraska's Tony Vargas, Arizona's Kirsten Engel and New York's Josh Riley, according to the Washington Examiner.

In March, the Examiner first reported that the nonprofit watchdog group Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) was filing a complaint with the Federal Election Commission alleging OAFF's payments to future House candidates violated federal law. As a 501(c)3 nonprofit, OAFF is prohibited from spending money on political activity. However, FACT alleged its payments to eventual candidates for office were explicitly designed to advance their political prospects.

""The fellowship's true purpose was explicitly described by its founder as a way to give money to failed candidates (or prospective candidates) for personal expenses in the brief downtime before they are able to file again to run for another office,"" FACT wrote in its complaint. ""Thus, the fellowship is directly tied to a federal candidacy and not for bona fide independent employment. Any claim otherwise would strain credulity.""

Soros has also poured millions into several other groups and committees backing Democrats throughout the 2024 cycle. His two super PACs - Democracy PAC and Democracy PAC II - have so far combined to shower left-wing groups with $53 million, Federal Election Commission records show.

Gillen recently benefited from one of the groups financed by the left-wing billionaire. On Aug. 2, Soros' Democracy PAC sent $500,000 to the League of Conservation Voters Victory Fund, which weeks later spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on independent expenditures backing her candidacy in the form of digital production, ad buys, and other items. During that time, the group also backed Kamala Harris and a handful of other Democrats.

Gillen's campaign, Our American Future Foundation, and the Open Society Foundation did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's requests for comment."

A Florida restaurant owner struggling to keep doors open in the years since the COVID-19 pandemic received a surprise message of support from former President Trump.

""I'd like to ask everybody to pitch in and help save Harry and the Natives. It's a special restaurant, a very special place. People love it. It's been around a long time. Like a really long time. But it's fallen prey to Kamala Harris and Joe Biden's economy,"" Trump told owner Harry MacArthur in a pre-recorded message Friday on ""Fox & Friends.""

""We have to keep the good ones open, especially when it comes to Florida. Florida is a very, very special place, and that's a very, very great restaurant. So Harry and the Natives, keep it going. We love it. And you're going to be around for a long time.""

'ECONOMY WAY BETTER UNDER TRUMP': BLACK VOTERS SHARE IF THEY WERE BETTER OFF 4 YEARS AGO

Co-host Steve Doocy hosted Friday's show from the packed restaurant in Hobe Sound after MacArthur wrote on Facebook he would have to shut down unless something changed by October 12.

The community, however, rallied behind MacArthur by supporting a GoFundMe set up by his son, Wyatt.

MacArthur called the response from Trump and the community ""overwhelming.""

""Turns out everybody cares,"" he said.

The restaurant has been in MacArthur's family for 72 years. Although the business was originally run by his parents, MacArthur reopened the business as Harry and the Natives after his father died in the 1980s.

MacArthur's business was close to bankruptcy in 2021, but after a ""Breakfast with Friends"" segment, the business was able to hold on. But the financial struggle was not over.

INSIDE DAVE RAMSEY'S CHAT WITH TRUMP ON THE US ECONOMY: 'VERY DIRECT AND VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE'

""Fox saved us then. Fox and Steve Doocy saved us, and we rolled for the next six months on that and then everything else. And then the economy kept going south and everything else,"" Macarthur told co-host Steve Doocy.

""It's like a nationwide thing. Family restaurants aren't going to be there.""

Trump teams up with former GOP nemesis to survey storm damage in key battleground state,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-teams-up-former-gop-nemesis-survey-storm-damage-key-battleground-state,2024-10-04T15:58:43Z,"Army veteran Sara Snide joins 'America's Newsroom' to highlight the problems facing Americans in areas battered by Hurricane Helene as grocery prices skyrocket.

Former President Trump and Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp will appear together on Friday for the first time in four years as they receive a briefing on recovery and relief efforts one week after Hurricane Helene tore a path of destruction after slamming into the southeast United States.

The former president and the popular two-term conservative Georgia governor are scheduled to be briefed on storm damage and to ""deliver remarks to the press"" as they team up during a visit to Evans, a town in the northeast portion of the state.

The event is not being described as a campaign stop.

For Trump, it's his second trip this week to Georgia, following a visit on Monday in Valdosta. The state, along with North and South Carolina, and Tennessee, took direct hits from the powerful storm. The death toll from Hurricane Helene now stands at over 220, with hundreds still missing, more than 800,000 people in seven states still without power or running water, and damage estimated in the billions.

TRUMP CLAIMS BIDEN, HARRIS, STORM RESPONSE IS INCOMPETENT

With Trump locked in a margin-of-error presidential race with Vice President Kamala Harris, and Georgia and North Carolina crucial battleground states, Trump has repeatedly slammed President Biden and Harris over their handing of the federal response to the storm.

""It is going down as the WORST & MOST INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED 'STORM,' AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, EVER SEEN BEFORE,"" Trump claimed in a social media post on Thursday, as Biden spent a second straight day in the southeast surveying storm damage.

And Harris stopped in Georgia on Wednesday for storm briefings and to meet with local officials and victims of the storm, as she canceled a campaign swing in another key electoral state, Pennsylvania.

The vice president heads to North Carolina on Saturday to survey damage and get briefed on federal, state and local efforts.

When Trump visited Valdosta on Monday, he wasn't joined by Kemp, who was surveying storm damage in other parts of Georgia.

For two years after his 2020 election defeat to President Biden, which included a razor-thin loss in Georgia, Trump attacked Kemp for failing to overturn the election results in his state.

Trump urged, and then supported, a 2022 GOP gubernatorial primary challenge against Kemp by former Sen. David Perdue.

The former president toned down his criticism of the governor after Kemp crushed Perdue to easily win renomination on his way to re-election.

KEMP SAYS THERE'S NO PATH TO 270 FOR TRUMP WITHOUT GEORGIA

But in August, Trump went on a 10-minute tirade against Kemp at a rally in Atlanta just blocks from the Georgia State Capitol. He blamed the governor not only for failing to overturn the 2020 vote count but also for not stopping a county prosecutor from indicting the former president for his attempts to reverse the results.

""He's a bad guy. He's a disloyal guy. And he's a very average governor,"" Trump said. ""Little Brian. Little Brian Kemp. Bad guy.""

But just a couple of weeks later, in a major about face for Trump, the former president praised Kemp in a social media post ""for all of your help and support in Georgia, where a win is so important to the success of our Party and, most importantly, our Country.""

""I look forward to working with you, your team, and all of my friends in Georgia to help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!"" the Republican presidential nominee added.

Trump's change of heart came amid a margin-of-error presidential race in Georgia.

The Peach State is one of seven key battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and are likely to determine whether Harris or Trump succeeds the president in the White House.

Republican strategists agree that to recapture Georgia, Trump will need assistance from Kemp's well-oiled and funded political machine to turn out GOP voters.

Kemp emphasized in an exclusive national interview with Fox News Digital in August that ""there's no path for former President Trump to win or any Republican . . . to get to 270 [electoral votes] without Georgia.""

The governor said his state ""should be one that we win if we have all the mechanics that we need. And I'm working hard to help provide those in a lot of ways and turn the Republican vote out.""

""It's my belief that we cannot afford four more years of [President] Joe Biden and Kamala Harris or Kamala Harris and [Minnesota Gov.] Tim Walz, which I think would probably be worse than even Biden and Harris were,"" Kemp said.

Kemp also told Fox News at the time that Trump's tirade from early August ""was a small distraction that's in the past"" and emphasized that Republicans ""need to stay focused on the future. . . . We need to be telling people why they should vote for us, what we're going to do to make things better than they are right now. And there's a host of issues that I think you could contrast Kamala Harris and her record."""
"'Lies throughout': Trump-backed challenger, longtime Dem senator face off in heated battleground debate",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lies-throughout-trump-backed-challenger-longtime-dem-senator-face-off-heated-battleground-debate,2024-10-04T14:14:11Z,"Lackawanna County, Pa., has emerged as a key battleground county this election cycle, with voters on the streets of Scranton speaking with Fox News Digital about their top issues.

Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick squared off in their first debate Thursday evening, less than five weeks ahead of what is expected to be one of the most closely watched races this election cycle.

Casey and McCormick took the debate stage Thursday at 8 p.m. in Harrisburg, where the two traded barbs over issues such as the economy and inflation, immigration, abortion. The race, which is rated as ""leans Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report, is expected to be one of the tightest Senate races across the country, with Casey himself acknowledging earlier this year that it will be a ""close, tough race.""

Casey has long been a Pennsylvania Democratic stalwart, first winning his election to the U.S. Senate in 2007. The Casey name also has deep roots in the state, with Bob Casey Sr., the senator's father, serving as the Keystone State's governor from 1987 to 1995, following years of serving in various other elected roles.

McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, who served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security as well as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under former President George W. Bush's administration. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McCormick in April, lauding him as a ""a good man"" who ""wants to run a good ship.""

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

The Senate race comes as the federal election spotlights Pennsylvania once again as a key battleground state that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

As the pair squared off for the first of two debates ahead of Nov. 5, Fox News Digital compiled the top five moments of Thursday's event.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

Casey and McCormick both weighed in on the federal election, including Casey lauding Harris following his staunch support of Biden before the president ultimately dropped out of the 2024 race as concerns about his mental acuity and age mounted over the summer.

""From your perspective, who is the better candidate for Pennsylvania? Biden or Harris?"" moderator and ABC27 anchor Dennis Owens asked Casey.

""I think Vice President Harris, who's running a strong campaign, I think she'll carry Pennsylvania. It's going to be very close, just like the Senate race will be close. But she's running a strong campaign. But the people of our state have to make two basic decisions - in addition to other statewide races. They have decided in the presidential race, and they have to decide our race, and this race is very clear,"" Casey responded.

When asked whether he believes Biden or Harris would be a better president for Pennsylvania voters, Casey brushed off delivering a direct answer.

""Oh, I don't know, Dennis. I mean, we'll never know the answer to that, but the voters are gonna make a decision,"" he said.

McCormick, on the other hand, was asked if he could offer one example where he does not agree with Trump after slamming Casey during the debate for overwhelmingly voting with Biden over the last three and a half years.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

""[Trump] recently said that he wanted to get rid of the ban on SALT taxes, which Sen. Casey supported, too"" McCormick responded. ""Listen, that's a that's a tax break for millionaires in New York and California at the expense of PA taxpayers. So I wouldn't support that.""

""But listen, Senator Casey stood next to Joe Biden when he could hardly finish a sentence. We saw this on the debate stage, he said 'he's ready to go,'"" McCormick continued, referring to Casey's support of Biden remaining in the presidential race until Biden ultimately dropped out. ""Then Sen. Casey said, 'Kamala Harris is great. You're going to love her when you get to know her.' This is a woman who, in the last few years, says she wanted to ban fracking, legalize illegal immigration, give them federal benefits, take away our guns, defund the police. This is her position, so she's flip-flopped on everything, and Bob Casey standing there by her.""

Both candidates accused the other of ""lies"" throughout the debate, including McCormick touting a new website called CaseyLies.com, and Casey accusing McCormick of misrepresenting himself as a Pennsylvanian.

""For your viewers tonight, I have a website that's been established today, it's just been launched, CaseyLies.com. You can go and see the actual facts by third-party sources of all the things he's saying. There will be lies throughout. But you should ask yourself, 'Why is a senator with an 18-year track record, who should be able to run on his record, running his entire campaign with a negative set of attacks on me, most of them lies?'"" McCormick said towards the start of the debate.

McCormick claimed that Casey often launched ""lies"" at him during the debate because he ""doesn't have a track record"" in the Senate to run on.

Casey shot back during the debate that McCormick has misrepresented himself as a full-fledged Pennsylvanian.

""We've heard a couple of times tonight about telling lies, but probably the biggest lie told in this whole election, that probably most Pennsylvanians have never heard a bigger lie, was the lie when my opponent said he lived in Pennsylvania, when he was living in Connecticut. The Associated Press on August the 14th, 2023, did a story that proved that he was living in Connecticut,"" Casey said.

McCormick defended that he was born in Pennsylvania and has spent ""the majority of my life"" there, but also lived in Connecticut for years when he served as CEO of Bridgewater Associates.

PENNSYLVANIA SURVEY FINDS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP NARROWLY, IDENTIFIES HER 'BIGGEST WEAKNESS,' POLLSTER SAYS

The economy is among the top concerns for voters in Pennsylvania, as well as the nation at large, with both candidates outlining how they would tackle spiraling inflation if re-elected or elected to the Senate, and what they believe is behind the rise in consumers' costs.

""Prices are too high, especially when you go to the grocery store to buy food or household items, items that people need every week, or at least every other week. And these big conglomerates, these big corporations, rig those prices and jack them up to levels we've never seen, all while they're getting record profits,"" Casey said, while defending his efforts targeting corporations he has accused of ""greedflation.""

So-called greedflation is understood as corporations allegedly exploiting inflation woes by increasing prices on consumers to produce greater profits.

""We can take it on by passing a price gouging bill to go after those companies, hold them accountable,"" Casey said.

The Democratic senator also addressed his campaign against ""shrinkflation,"" which he explained as corporations shrinking products for consumers while not lowering prices.

""We did a report on shrinkflation, which covered a lot of companies around the country. And if that's happening with regard to a Pennsylvania company or any other company around the country, they should be held accountable. When they take a product, shrink the contents of the product, or what's in a bag, and don't shrink the price, that's deceptive. That's ripping people off,"" he said, adding that such companies should be held legally accountable.

McCormick shot back that higher costs on Americans in recent years is due to ""out of control spending"" at the hands of Casey and other Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Biden.

""When you've spent your entire life in public service, elected office, 30 years, you're like a hammer looking for a nail. The cause of inflation is the policies, the out-of-control spending of Biden, Harris and Casey. Bob Casey voted 100% of the time for that $5 trillion of new spending. The experts at the time, Larry Summers, the San Francisco Fed, said this would create inflation,"" McCormick said.

""Bob Casey doesn't understand how the economy works. That's why he's trying to do all this economic voodoo stuff with price controls,"" he later charged.

Casey and McCormick were both grilled about their current abortion stances during the debate, as abortion once again sits atop many voters' list of election concerns following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Casey positioned himself as a pro-life Democrat earlier in his career, but he voted to codify abortion protections nationwide following the overturning of Roe.

""In 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned a 49-year right, it overturned Roe v. Wade, I think everyone had to make a decision, including senators. I made a decision to support the Women's Health Protection Act. I don't support Republican efforts to ban abortion across the country,"" Casey said.

BATTLEGROUND STATE DEM DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM DEFUND MOVEMENT, BUT POLITICAL RECORD SHOWS DIFFERENT STORY

McCormick was questioned about his remarks in 2022 that he supports rare exceptions for abortion, such as when the health of the mother is at risk, and has since said that he supports additional exceptions for abortion.

""This is an extremely polarizing issue. As you know, I have six daughters, so this is something we spend time talking about. I believe this should be a state's right. I believe states should decide. Pennsylvania has had a law. It's been supported by Democrats and Republicans, like was signed into law by the Senator's father, Governor Casey. I support the three exceptions. I would not favor an abortion ban of any kind,"" McCormick responded.

Casey recently came under fire from a Pennsylvania sheriff who slammed the Democratic senator's border policies for the influx of fentanyl into the U.S., which the dad said had led to his son's death.

""We can't bring back the people we've lost. But we can get rid of the weak politicians like Bob Casey who let it happen,"" Blair County Sheriff Jim Ott said in a recent McCormick campaign ad.

Casey was asked about the sheriff's remarks during his debate Thursday.

""Mr. Casey, the Blair County Sheriff, blames you for the fentanyl death of his son, saying you have not done enough to secure the border. What is your response to that,"" Owens asked.

""I met so many families across the state, and whether it's a sheriff in Blair County or a mom in Allegheny County, Janet that I met, who talked about her daughter, Brianna, this is an awful, awful tragedy for those families. That's why we need to invest in the strategies that we know work. [McCormick] won't do that, because he's weak in the face of the political pressure from his own party. . . . We can solve this problem by investing in the technology, hiring thousands more Border Patrol, so we can inspect every single vehicle coming across the border,"" he said.

Amid the immigration debate, McCormick blamed the Biden-Harris administration and Casey for the immigration crisis at the southern border.

""The border crisis is the direct result of the weakness of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Bob Casey supported them every second. What chutzpah to run an ad on how tough he is on the border, when he voted against funding for the Border Patrol. He ran an ad in front of the wall that he voted against. He voted for sanctuary cities, he voted for federal benefits for illegal immigrants. And the fentanyl crisis that's come across our border is the direct result of the weakness of Bob Casey not standing up to these terrible cartels,"" McCormick argued.

The pair have agreed to another debate, next taking the same stage in Philadelphia on Oct. 15."

Former President Donald Trump let loose on former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney following her endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris.

Citing her historic defeat by a 2-to-1 margin in 2022 -- and the controversial leadership of her father, Vice President Dick Cheney, during the U.S. invasion of the Middle East -- Trump called the former Wyoming Republican a ""low IQ war hawk.""

""Liz Cheney lost her Congressional Seat by the largest margin in the history of Congress for a sitting Representative. The people of Wyoming are really smart!"" Trump wrote on Truth Social.

He continued, ""She is a low IQ War Hawk that, as a member of the J6 Unselect Committee of Political Hacks and Thugs, ILLEGALLY DESTROYED & DELETED all documents, information, and evidence.""

Cheney, a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 riot on the U.S. Capitol vowed to do everything she can to prevent Trump from returning to power.

The former representative campaigned for Harris in battleground Wisconsin on Thursday -- pushing a message of unity against their mutual enemy's campaign to return to the Oval Office.

The campaign event took place in Ripon, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

""I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the Wisconsin audience as she formally endorsed the Democrat presidential nominee. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.

Trump's social media remarks lumped together Liz Cheney and her former vice president father -- who has also endorsed Harris -- writing them off as ""two fools"" who are ""suffering gravely from Trump Derangement Syndrome.""

""Her father, Dick, was a leader of our ridiculous journey into the Middle East, where Trillions of Dollars were spent, millions of people were killed - and for what? NOTHING!

""Well, today, these two fools, because the Republican Party no longer wants them, endorsed the most Liberal Senator in the U.S. Senate, further Left than even Pocahontas or Crazy Bernie Sanders - Lyin' Kamala Harris. What a pathetic couple that is, both suffering gravely from Trump Derangement Syndrome. Good Luck to them both!!!""

Cheney on Thursday warned that ""our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before: a former president who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our republic.""

She argued that Trump ""can never be trusted with power again"" and emphasized that ""in this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration, it is our duty.""

""What January 6 shows us is there is not an ounce, not an ounce, of compassion in Donald Trump. He is petty. He is vindictive. He is cruel. And Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation,"" Cheney said.

Former Trump staffer and ""The View"" co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin will join former GOP lawmaker Liz Cheney and other anti-Trump Republicans for an event in Pennsylvania next week warning of the dangers of re-electing former President Donald Trump.

Former Trump administration staffer Cassidy Hutchison - who testified against her former boss in the Jan. 6 Committee hearings - as well as Trump's former deputy press secretary Sarah Matthews will be part of the event that is meant to help deliver the swing state to Vice President Kamala Harris in November.

The panel will ""offer a warning about the threat Donald Trump poses to democracy and the rule of law,"" a source connected to the event recently told CNN.

The aim of the chat is to convince voters of ""the need for independents, moderates, and Republicans to stop him from getting back in office,"" the source added.

The women-led program will be hosted by liberal super-PAC Democracy First in Montgomery County, Pennsylvania on Oct. 9, and is reportedly the first of many that will feature the four women speaking to voters in multiple battleground states.

Cheney, Hutchison, and Matthews have endorsed Harris for president. Griffin has not, though the media personality is a staunch critic of Trump on ""The View"" and in her role as a CNN political commentator.

The event comes as Trump and Harris are neck and neck in battleground states, with the race being especially close in Pennsylvania.

Recent Fox News polling in Pennsylvania finds Harris only two points ahead of Trump among registered voters in the state, while they are tied at 49% among likely voters.

""Both candidates have a little way to go to consolidate their bases and whoever does a better job there could determine who wins the state.""

Former President Obama is preparing to hit the campaign trail next week for Vice President Harris, focusing on key battleground states in the lead up to Election Day, according to a senior campaign official with anonymity to discuss the matter.

Obama, who served back-to-back terms as president from 2009 through 2017, will kick off his drive in the Pittsburgh area of Pennsylvania on Thursday, a state which remains one of the tightest contests in the nation and which could tip the scales for either candidate.

A Fox News survey of Pennsylvania voters last week found Harris narrowly ahead of Trump by 2 points (50-48%) among registered voters, while the race is tied at 49% each among likely voters. President Biden won the state by more than 80,000 votes in 2020.

'GOING TO BE A CLOSE ONE:' DETROITERS REVEAL IF THE CITY IS LEANING TOWARDS HARRIS OR TRUMP

Obama and former first lady Michelle Obama officially endorsed Harris for president in July, five days after President Biden ended his 2024 re-election in a blockbuster announcement.

The 44th president then stumped for Harris at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in August, saying she ""is ready for the job.""

""It's up to all of us to fight for the America we believe in,"" Obama said. ""And make no mistake: It will be a fight.""

""This is a person who has spent her life fighting on behalf of people who need a voice and a champion. Kamala wasn't born into privilege. She had to work for what she's got, and she actually cares about what other people are going through.""

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP IS MAKING GAINS WITH YOUNGER VOTERS

Harris and Obama's friendship goes back 20 years to when they met on the campaign trail while he was running for Senate in Illinois, the senior campaign official says. Harris was an early supporter of his 2008 presidential campaign and even knocked doors for him in Iowa ahead of the caucus, per the official.

Last month, Former President Obama headlined a fundraiser for Harris that raised $4 million, per The Washington Post. His fundraising efforts so far on her behalf -- fundraising content and events that feature him -- have raised $76 million, per the outlet.

Harris' campaign is headed by Jen O'Malley Dillon Harris, a veteran of Obama's two campaigns who also managed President Biden's 2020 campaign and built his 2024 operation from the White House.

Other former Obama advisers on the Harris team, include David Plouffe, who was manager of Obama's presidential campaign in 2008 and a senior aide during his 2012 re-election victory.

Iran's Ayatollah Khamenei defends missile barrage against Israel in rare sermon,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/irans-ayatollah-khamenei-defends-missile-barrage-against-israel-rare-sermon,2024-10-04T12:34:54Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei declared in a rare sermon Friday that his country's ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier this week was ""legal and legitimate"" and that the ""resistance in the region will not back down even with the killing of its leaders.""

The public address from Khamenei was his first during Friday prayers in Tehran in nearly five years, according to the AFP.

Khamenei said Iran will not ""procrastinate nor act hastily to carry out its duty"" in going after Israel, Reuters reports.

The news agency cited him as saying that Tuesday's barrage of nearly 200 missiles fired by Iran at Israel was ""legal and legitimate"" and the minimum punishment for Israel's ""crimes.""

IRAN WARNS OF 'DECISIVE RESPONSE' IF ISRAEL CROSSES 'RED LINES'

""The resistance in the region will not back down even with the killing of its leaders,"" Khamenei reportedly added, mentioning recently slain Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah during the speech.

The remarks came as the Israel Defense Forces announced Friday that Mohammad Rashid Sakafi, the commander of Hezbollah's Communications Unit, was killed in an airstrike in Beirut, Lebanon.

""Sakafi was a senior Hezbollah terrorist, who was responsible for the communications unit since 2000,"" the IDF wrote on X. ""Sakafi invested significant efforts to develop communication capabilities between all of Hezbollah's units.""

ISRAEL BANS UN SECRETARY-GENERAL OVER ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIONS

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said earlier this week that the Iranian missile attack on Israel was ""defeated and ineffective"" and that the U.S. military coordinated with the IDF to repel the strikes.

""U.S. naval destroyers joined Israeli Air Defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles. President Biden and Vice President Harris monitored the attack and the response from the White House Situation Room, joined in person and remotely by their national security team,"" Sullivan said during a briefing.

""This is a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event, and it is equally significant that we were able to step up with Israel and create a situation in which no one was killed in this attack in Israel... We are now going to look at what the appropriate next steps are to secure, first and foremost, American interests and then to promote stability to the maximum extent possible as we go forward,"" he added.

Fox News' ""Antisemitism Exposed"" newsletter brings you stories on the rising anti-Jewish prejudice across the U.S. and the world.

TOP 3:

- As Oct. 7 anniversary approaches, Jewish students vow to 'walk proudly'

- CNN's Amanpour says Iran does not want to 'escalate' conflict even as Iranian rockets strike Israel

- Harvard went easy on students for antisemitic conduct, House committee finds

- Hugh Hewitt: How Kamala Harris' snub of Netanyahu only seemed to embolden Israeli leader

TOP STORY: With the first anniversary of October 7 fast approaching, universities and college students are bracing for renewed anti-Israel demonstrations on campuses across the United States. In particular, the National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) is orchestrating a nationwide ""Week of Rage"" on campuses beginning Monday.

VIDEO: Comedian and pro-Israel influencer Zach Sage Fox believes an interview he filmed in the West Bank could show Americans how Palestinian civilians truly feel about Jewish people - but it took him months to recover the footage after he was threatened to delete it. Watch it here:

COME AGAIN, CHRISTINE?: CNN chief international anchor Christiane Amanpour insisted Tuesday that Iran does not want conflict to escalate with Israel or the United States, and that Tehran felt it had ""no choice"" but to strike the Jewish state after Israel took out Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Lebanon last week. U.S. National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan disagreed, calling the attack ""a significant escalation by Iran, a significant event.""

GRADING ON A CURVE: Harvard University went easy on students whose antisemitic conduct violated its own policies, according to the House Education and the Workforce Committee, which probed anti-Israel college protests in the wake of the Oct. 7 Hamas terrorist attacks in Israel. Of 68 students disciplined, none are currently suspended, 52 remain in ""good standing,"" 15 are not, and one is on leave. The committee said it believes Harvard is in violation of Title VI, which forbids ""a hostile environment based on race, color, or national origin.""

HUGH HEWITT: Vice President Kamala Harris sent a very public message to her anti-Israel supporters when she skipped Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit this summer. And ever since, Netanyahu has embraced a different strategy, from his fiery address the United Nations General Assembly last week, to taking the war to Hamas and Hezbollah.

QUOTE OF THE WEEK: ""This October 7, as I mourn the innocent lives lost and pray for the brave men and women of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who continue to fight, I will walk proudly and be a tribute, a public voice of remembrance, for all those beautiful souls who were stolen from us too soon.""

Tim Walz in November for ""one of the most consequential elections in our nation's history.""

""Perhaps not since the Civil War has this great country felt as politically, spiritually, and emotionally divided as it does then at this moment. It doesn't have to be this way,"" Springsteen said in an Instagram video Thursday. ""The common values, the shared stories that make us a great and united nation are waiting to be rediscovered and retold once again. Now that will take time, hard work, intelligence, faith and women and men with the national good, guiding their hearts.""

The ""Born in the USA"" singer attacked former President Trump as ""the most dangerous candidate for President in my lifetime"" with a ""disdain for the sanctity of our constitution, the sanctity of democracy, the sanctity of the rule of law, and the sanctity of the peaceful transfer of power.""

""On the other hand, Kamala Harris and Tim Walz are committed to a vision of this country that respects and includes everyone regardless of class, religion, race, your political point of view or sexual identity, and they want to grow our economy in a way that benefits all, not just the few like me on top. That's the vision of America I've been consistently writing about for 55 years now,"" Springsteen said.

Springsteen acknowledged ""everybody sees things different"" and that he respects other choices but stood by his.

""That's why come November 5th, I'll be casting my vote for Kamala Harris and Tim Walz,"" he closed.

He joined several other singers such as Taylor Swift who have publicly supported Harris ahead of the November election.

Springsteen has been openly supportive of Democratic candidates in the past and frequently attacked Trump.

In 2020, he said, ""I believe that our current president is a threat to our democracy. He simply makes any kind of reform that much harder. I don't know if our democracy could stand another four years of his custodianship.""

Springsteen later provided a voiceover as well as his song ""My Hometown"" for a pro-Joe Biden ad.

""We are rudderless and joyless. We have lost the cultural aspects of society that make America great. We have lost our mojo, our fun, our happiness, our cheering on of others,"" Springsteen said in the 2020 ad. ""The shared experience of humanity that makes it all worth it. The challenges and the triumph that we shared and celebrated. The unique can-do spirit that America has always been known for. We are lost. We've lost so much in so short a time.

Former President Trump will headline the National Rifle Association's (NRA) Defend the 2nd event in Savannah, Georgia, Oct. 22, the organization announced Friday morning.

""This election is a pivotal one for America's gun owners. Kamala Harris and her far-left allies have big plans to erode Second Amendment protections,"" NRA Vice President and CEO Doug Hamlin said in a statement.

""Donald J. Trump has proven himself a fighter for Americans' right to keep and bear arms. We are excited to have him speak at our Defend the 2nd event and to support his return to the White House in January.""

Earlier this year, the NRA endorsed Trump in his presidential campaign. Trump also spoke at the NRA's convention in May.

The NRA has been ramping up its attacks on certain Democratic candidates who are softer on gun owners' rights. Ohio is the second state the NRA Political Victory Fund has targeted this election cycle. Last month, the gun group launched a major radio campaign against vulnerable Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana.

The International Association of Fire Fighters' (IAFF) decision not to endorse a candidate this year was seen as ""another blow"" to the Harris campaign's bid to retain working class voters.

""Today, the IAFF Executive Board, by a margin of 1.2%, voted to not endorse a candidate in the 2024 presidential election,"" a statement from the IAFF read Thursday.

The IAFF added, ""The IAFF Executive Board determined that we are better able to advocate for our members and make progress on the issues that matter to them if we, as a union, are standing shoulder-to-shoulder. This decision, which we took seriously, is the best way to preserve and strengthen our unity.""

Because the union had endorsed President Biden in 2020, this was seen by many as a win for Trump and a failure for Harris.

KAMALA HARRIS CONFRONTED ON NOT EARNING TEAMSTERS ENDORSEMENT: 'WHAT WAS THEIR REASONING?'

""Translation... The IAFF firefighters endorse Trump!"" New Hampshire state Rep. Fred Doucette exclaimed.

GRV Strategies founder Garrett Ventry wrote, ""Another blow to Harris. She failed to get the Teamsters endorsement as well. The Biden 2020 [coalition] is falling apart for her.""

""Kamala loses the unions, gains the Cheneys. It's like she's trying to hemorrhage working and middle class voters,"" Trump senior adviser Stephen Miller joked.

Politico senior political columnist Jonathan Martin wrote, ""Building trades adjacent...Just adds pressure on Kamala to build on Biden's college+ support.""

""Similar to the Teamsters non-endorsement. This is another huge win for Trump!"" Townhall.com columnist Dustin Grage commented.

The IAFF has primarily supported Democratic presidential candidates in the past and was the first major union to endorse Biden in 2019. Prior to this year, the IAFF had only withheld their endorsement in 2016, when it did not commit to supporting either Hillary Clinton or Trump.

This announcement came weeks after the Teamsters, another major union, declined to support a 2024 presidential candidate. It was the first time the union had not endorsed a candidate since 1996 after largely supporting Democrats.

Despite not backing a candidate, a Teamsters poll found that nearly 60% of union members supported Trump."
Western Pennsylvania paying the high price of Biden-Harris border crisis,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/western-pennsylvania-paying-high-price-biden-harris-border-crisis,2024-10-04T09:18:11Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

My mother immigrated to Pittsburgh from Guatemala in the early 1980s under President Reagan, and I spent my first 20 years of life in South Hills. Unfortunately, today my hometown is nearly unrecognizable to me.

The reason why is simple: The system that existed when my mom came to the United States has been completely overwhelmed by the sheer number of migrants crossing our southern border today.

In the last two years, the migrant population in Pittsburgh has soared by 2,000%, and now it's reaching crisis levels.

According to a Sept. 15 segment aired by CBS Pittsburgh, Charleroi - a borough nested along the Monongahela River - has been especially impacted by this influx. Schools are overstrained. Local stores are seeing less business because of crime concerns. And residents are watching their culture vanish before their eyes.

KAMALA HARRIS MAKES A DESPERATE MOVE ON A CRITICAL ISSUE TO SAVE A SINKING CAMPAIGN

This isn't an accident. Since 2021, the Biden-Harris administration's immigration policies have allowed the entry of millions of inadmissible aliens at a completely unsustainable rate.

I can attest that the situation unfolding in Western Pennsylvania is unprecedented and unrecognizable. Pennsylvanians deserve an ordered and sustainable immigration system that does not impact their quality of life.

Overburdened public systems resulting from mass immigration are one of the main concerns identified by Charleroi residents and cost Pennsylvanians $1.2 billion annually to cover medical, welfare and education expenses.

Schools in Charleroi are especially suffering with the number of migrants needing to learn English. The district has already spent $400,000 on English Language Learner (ELL) teachers and interpreters, but it is nowhere near enough to meet the demand.

DEMOCRATS LIE BIG ABOUT OUR BORDER CRISIS. COMPARE SENATE AND HOUSE BILLS FOR PROOF

In Cornell School District - near Coraopolis - ELL class sizes have doubled from just last year. Further south in Ringgold, the school board just approved $142,000 or roughly $7,000 per student for English as a Second Language (ESL) services between 2024-2045.

Not only is this a financial burden on taxpayers, but it makes the overall learning experience more difficult for existing students. Classrooms already face teacher shortages. Now more students are being added to them - with many not able to fully participate in the classroom due to language barriers.

These challenges may explain why standardized test scores in public schools around Pittsburgh have drastically fallen since 2019. And, of course, almost no parents or students had a say in any of this.

Aside from over-filled schools and financial strains, the influx of migrants resettled by the Biden-Harris administration in Western Pennsylvania has also created crime concerns.

KAMALA HARRIS IS THE ARCHITECT OF 'AMERICA LAST' BORDER POLICIES

Things are so bad that one Charleroi resident mentioned she was ""afraid to go into"" downtown stores because of crime.

It's not hard to share the resident's concerns as the Biden-Harris administration has facilitated the entry of at least 12 million illegal immigrants into the country - many of whom have already committed additional crimes, if they're backgrounds aren't completely unknown.

Since the Biden-Harris administration took office, Pennsylvania has seen a number of high-profile illegal immigrant crimes - including murders of ex-partners, friends and even children.

While these heinous incidents do not represent the entire immigrant population, they represent something that should be widely noted: These crimes should have never happened in the first place. The culprit should have never been in the country as they were here unlawfully.

SELFISH KAMALA HARRIS POURS GASOLINE ON PITTSBURGH SANDWICH SHOP'S VANCE GAFFE

Pittsburgh is in peril. It is on the verge of becoming another New York or Chicago or Boston - cities completely taken over by mass immigration to the point where residents are fleeing.

But it doesn't have to be this way. Western Pennsylvania has a choice. We can continue the status quo of chaos or return to an immigration system that puts Pennsylvanians first.

Immigration can even be good for Pittsburgh, the state of Pennsylvania, and the rest of the United States. But it can only be good within reasonable limits.

Our immigration system today must better prioritize skills, education, English literacy and a commitment to assimilate into American society. It must promote order and selectiveness to ensure Pennsylvanians aren't suffering at the cost of foreign nationals.

The Trump administration's immigration policies reflected principles of a merit-based and ordered immigration system. This helps explain why Pennsylvanians were much happier with their quality of life between 2016-2020.

Immigration can have a high price. But it can also be a net benefit if managed correctly."
'Going to be a close one:' Detroiters reveal if the city is leaning towards Harris or Trump,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/going-close-one-detroiters-reveal-city-leaning-towards-harris-trump,2024-10-04T09:11:19Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Fox News Digital spoke with Detroit, Michigan, residents about the political pulse in the city as Election Day nears in the crucial swing state.

""It got to be Trump for the whole city,"" Keandre, an east-side Detroit resident, told Fox News Digital. ""They are all voting Trump.""

One resident of St. Clair Shores in Macomb County said that he thinks the support for former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris is split.

""People on both sides. It's going to be a close one,"" Tom said.

Two other Detroit natives who spoke to Fox News Digital supported Harris.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP IS MAKING GAINS WITH YOUNGER VOTERS

""All my friends that are Trumpers only think about themselves and we have to think about the world,"" Ron said.

""I really like Kamala Harris because she's got a lot more compassion. It's not about yourself. It's about everybody,"" he explained further.

""I think it's time for history to be made,"" Mandela said.

""I just think that it's going to be a woman president,"" he added.

A new poll released by the New York Times and Siena College found Harris had 48% support in Michigan and Trump had 47%.

Hillary Clinton narrowly lost Michigan to Trump in 2016 despite consistently leading in the polls there, making her the first Democrat to lose the state since Michael Dukakis in 1988. Joe Biden won the state in 2020.

The Trump and Harris campaigns have prioritized Blue Wall states in campaign stops throughout the summer. Trump's 2016 victory was powered by his surprise wins in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which all had lengthy Democratic winning streaks until then. The winners of the past four elections have won the three states.

Michigan residents also weighed in on which presidential candidate they think would be a stronger leader.

Mandela admitted he thought it was Trump despite his support for Harris.

""I think Trump is [stronger] because I think that Trump is not going to let anybody run over us,"" he said.

When asked who was the stronger leader, Keandre said it was Harris.

""They're going to lean toward Trump because he's already been president,"" he predicted of other Detroiters.

""Not even a question. Donald J. Trump is the best leader we have to lead this nation forward,"" Jeff, a Detroit native, said.

"New poll reveals Trump has significant lead on immigration, border security in key battleground state",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-poll-reveals-trump-significant-lead-immigration-border-security-key-battleground-state,2024-10-04T08:09:41Z,"Economist Steve Moore comments on the border crisis and illegal immigration on 'Fox Report.'

Former President Donald Trump holds a firm lead in a key state over Vice President Kamala Harris on the question of how to handle immigration -- as the border crisis remains a top issue for voters.

A new poll released this week from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump overall in Wisconsin by 52-48%.

But when it comes to immigration and border security, Trump dominates. Of voters, 49% favor Trump while just 37% favor Harris, with 8% saying they'd be about the same, and 6% saying neither are good on the issue.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

Trump holds a similar 12 point lead on handling the war between Israel-Hamas, while Harris has an 11 point gap on handling Medicare & Social Security and a 17 point lead on abortion.

Of the issues polled, immigration was near the top of the issues, with 15% of voters saying it was their most important issue, the same number who said abortion, and only behind the economy -- which was top issue for 37% of voters.

The poll is the latest indicator that Harris still has a fair way to go in convincing some voters that she is the better candidate on a topic that has dominated the headlines and remains a top issue for voters. Wisconsin, along with states like Pennsylvania, Michigan and Arizona could be election deciders in the election on Nov 5.

Harris was put in charge of handling root causes of migration to the southern border in early 2021 as border numbers began to skyrocket. She was eventually dubbed the ""border czar"" by media outlets and critics -- although the White House rejected that title.

HARRIS SHIFTS KEY POSITIONS ON BORDER, ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AS CAMPAIGN PROMISES 'PRAGMATIC' APPROACH

Republicans have hammered Harris on the border, saying it was the rolling back of Trump-era policies that led to the record numbers at the border. They have also pointed to her embrace of left-wing positions in her 2019 presidential bid. Since then, her campaign says her views have been shaped by the current administration, including on decriminalizing illegal crossings and closing immigration detention centers.

""Harris can never be forgiven for her erasing our border, and she must never be allowed to become president of the United States,"" Trump said in Wisconsin on Sunday.

Harris has sought to present herself as better situated to handle the border. Her campaign has noted a recent drop in border encounters since President Biden signed a presidential proclamation in June limiting asylum entries. She has also thrown her support behind a bipartisan border security bill that would place similar limits on asylum and provide additional funding and detention beds.

Conservatives said that the bill would enshrine high border numbers, but Harris accused Trump of blocking the bill for political purposes. She did so again on a trip to the southern border in Arizona last week.

""He picked up the phone and calls some friends in Congress and said, stop the bill. Because, you see, he prefers to run on a problem instead of fixing a problem,"" she said. ""And the American people deserve a president who cares more about border security than playing political games."""

Officers spoke that morning with the store manager who told them that a ""thief"" entered the store around 7:40 a.m. and began ""removing soaps, cosmetics and toilet paper and placing the items into a backpack. The defendant then walked out of the store without paying for the merchandise.""

The complaint states that the stolen items were approximately $178 in retail value.

Officers were called to the same Walgreens location just two days later after another complaint of theft, this time with the defendant ""removing razors, lotions and other cosmetic items and placing them into two bags,"" the complaint says. The stolen merchandise this time was valued at $435.

Kamala Harris teams up with Liz Cheney in the birthplace of the Republican Party,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-liz-cheney-birthplace-republican-party,2024-10-04T01:40:14Z,"RIPON, WI - As she turns up the volume on her efforts to court disgruntled Republicans in her battle with former President Trump for the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris on Thursday teamed up with the most visible anti-Trump Republican in the town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP.

Harris campaigned in battleground Wisconsin with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who, in the wake of the Jan. 6, 2021 attack on the U.S. Capitol, has vowed to do everything she can to prevent Trump from returning to power.

""I have never voted for a Democrat but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience, as she formally endorsed the Democratic presidential nominee. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self - a true patriot.""

WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS WHO ADVISED REAGAN AND BUSH BACK HARRIS OVER TRUMP

The campaign event took place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

The younger Cheney was once rising in the ranks of House Republican leadership.

But she was the most high-profile of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-president Trump in early 2021 on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol, which was waged by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters who aimed to disrupt congressional certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory in the 2020 election.

TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS

The conservative lawmaker and defense hawk immediately came under verbal attack from Trump and his allies, and was eventually ousted from her number-three House GOP leadership position.

Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.

In 2022, she was ousted in the GOP congressional primary in Wyoming by a candidate that was backed by Trump.

At a speaking event in early September at Duke University in swing state North Carolina, Cheney announced that she would be voting for Harris in the presidential election. Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, also endorsed Harris.

Cheney on Thursday warned that ""our republic faces a threat unlike any we have faced before. A former president who attempted to stay in power by unraveling the foundations of our republic.

She argued that Trump ""can never be trusted with power again"" and emphasized that ""in this election, putting patriotism ahead of partisanship is not an aspiration, it is our duty.""

""What Jan. 6 shows us is there is not an ounce, not an ounce, of compassion in Donald Trump. He is petty. He is vindictive. He is cruel. And Donald Trump is not fit to lead this good and great nation,"" Cheney claimed.

WHAT THE LATEST POLL IN BATTLEGROUND WISCONSIN SHOWS

Harris, speaking after Cheney, highlighted that ""anyone who recklessly tramples on our democratic values as Donald Trump has, anyone who has actively and violently obstructed the will of the people and the peaceful transfer of power, as Donald Trump has....must never again stand behind the seal of the President of the United States.""

And Harris emphasized that ""I take seriously my pledge to be a president for all Americans.

Cheney was not always a fan of Harris.

The Trump campaign on Thursday repeatedly pointed to a social media post by Cheney during the 2000 election where she argued that ""@KamalaHarris has a more liberal voting record than Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. Her radical leftist views-raising taxes, banning gun sales, taxpayer $ for abortion & illegal immigrant health care, eliminating private health insurance-would be devastating for America.""

Trump, speaking with Fox News' Bill Melugin during a rally in Michigan on Thursday, said that Cheney was ""terrible"" and ""a stupid warhawk. All she wants to do is shoot missiles at people.""

On Cheney's backing of Harris, Trump argued ""I think they hurt each other. I think they're so bad, both of them.""

The Cheneys are part of a growing list of prominent Republicans who are supporting Harris.

Two other high-profile anti-Trump Republicans -- former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan - had speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention, which was held six weeks ago in Chicago.

And Harris is backed by more than 200 alumni who served in both Bush administrations or worked for the late Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2008 and 2012 GOP presidential nominee. She's also supported by more than 100 Republican former national security officials and other prominent Republicans.

Ripon is not the only town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP. Exeter, New Hampshire also has some bragging rites, as it was the site of meetings in 1853 - a year ahead of the Ripon gatherings - by disenchanted political leaders who discussed the formation of a new party of Republicans.

But officials in Ripon said the group in Exeter never actually formed a political organization, or chose officials, as they did in Wisconsin.

Wisconsin is one of seven crucial battleground states with razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 White House victory and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.

With less than five weeks until Election Day in November, Harris and Trump are locked in a margin-of-error race in the key swing states.

While Trump retains vast sway over the GOP, even a small sliver of Republicans supporting Harris could make an important impact in what will likely be a race within the margins in the battleground states."
James Carville unloads on Harris-Walz campaign for ineffective response to Vance's Obamacare comments: 'Move!',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/james-carville-unloads-harris-walz-campaign-ineffective-response-vances-obamacare-comments-move,2024-10-04T01:01:12Z,"Democratic strategist James Carville predicted there would be an election ""plot twist"" in the next 40 days leading up to November.

James Carville harshly criticized the Harris-Walz campaign for not doing more to combat the claim by vice presidential hopeful JD Vance that former President Donald Trump ""saved Obamacare"" during Tuesday night's debate.

The Democratic strategist unloaded on the Harris/Walz campaign for what he believes to be an ineffective response to Vance's comments that Trump ""salvaged"" the Affordable Care Act (ACA) while he was president.

""Why isn't Harris herself out today talking about that,"" Carville seethed on the Politics War Room podcast. ""Get off your a--. Move, move, move!""

Carville noted that health care is a huge issue and the ACA is ""a law that is important to people.""

JAMES CARVILLE PREDICTS ELECTION 'PLOT TWIST' AHEAD OF NOVEMBER: 'SPRINT TO THE FINISH'

He also called Vance's claim ""an out and out lie,"" repeatedly asking why Harris herself wasn't out in the media talking about it.

""What the f--- are y'all doing in the Harris campaign, get her out there now, now!"" he said. ""They ought to have Obama and Nancy Pelosi and they ought to do a Zoom call with the national media. I mean kick the crap out of this now, use everything.""

""[Trump] did everything in his power to destroy it and this is not an issue that people don't care about,"" Carville said. ""It's not a nitpicking thing and I got to tell you, the White House response and I think by and large, to a large extent, the press response is not at all measured to the gravity of this lie, of the importance of this. You're lying about people's g--damn lives.""

JAMES CARVILLE TAKES ON ABORTION, TIM WALZ'S TAMPON LEGISLATION AND THE TERM 'ILLEGAL ALIEN'

""What the f--- are you people doing,"" he lambasted. ""Get off your a--. Move, move, move!""

Carville made similar comments during an appearance on CNN where he said Democrats should go ""crazy"" over Vance's ""pants-on-fire"" claim, Mediate first reported.

""Why haven't they just gone crazy over Vance saying that Donald Trump saved Obamacare?"" Carville said. ""That's pants-on-fire, 5-star 20 Pinocchio B.S. and it's a great issue for us.""

""I don't know why they did not kick in that thing -- why they don't have [Vice President Kamala] Harris out there, President [Barack] Obama, former Speaker [Nancy] Pelosi, everybody,"" he added. ""Like, what are you talking about?""

Firefighters union will not endorse Harris or Trump for president,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/firefighters-union-not-endorse-harris-trump-president,2024-10-04T00:02:13Z,"Residents of Detroit revealed to Fox News Digital their choice for the November election and who they believe is the better leader.

The International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF) on Thursday said it would remain neutral in this year's presidential race, electing not to endorse a candidate, becoming the second major union to do so in recent weeks.

The union's executive board backed President Biden's 2020 White House bid. In a statement, IAFF President Edward Kelly said the union membership voted by a margin of 1.2 percentage points not to endorse either Vice President Kamala Harris or former President Trump.

""Over the past year, the IAFF took unprecedented steps to hear our members' views on the candidates and the policy issues that matter most to them,"" Kelly said of the decision.

""As we have over our 106-year history, the IAFF will continue its work to improve the lives of firefighters and their families,"" he added. ""The IAFF Executive Board determined that we are better able to advocate for our members and make progress on the issues that matter to them if we, as a union, are standing shoulder-to-shoulder. This decision, which we took very seriously, is the best way to preserve and strengthen our unity.""

2024 SHOCKER: WHY THE TEAMSTERS STAYED NEUTRAL IN THE HARRIS-TRUMP SHOWDOWN

Fox News Digital has reached out to the Harris and Trump campaigns.

The decision by the IAFF came weeks after the International Brotherhood of Teamsters announced it would not endorse a candidate either.

WHY HARRIS CHARGED TRUMP'S 'ONE OF THE BIGGEST LOSERS'

The Teamsters posted the results of internal polling on the 2024 candidates, showing that the union's members favored Trump by 59.6% over Harris, who received 34% in an online survey. In a phone survey, Teamsters favored Trump over Harris, 58% to 31%.

""The union's extensive member polling showed no majority support for Vice President Harris and no universal support among the membership for President Trump,"" the union said at the time."
Harris claims ad quoting her 2019 vow to ban fracking is 'mischaracterization' to make people 'afraid' of her,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-claims-ad-quoting-her-2019-vow-ban-fracking-mischaracterization-make-people-afraid-her,2024-10-03T23:33:00Z,"The 'Fox & Friends Weekend' hosts react to a resurfaced video of Kamala Harris saying she would 'put an end to fracking once and for all.'

Vice President Kamala Harris argued this week that an ad showing a clip of her past rhetoric about fracking is misleading and ""intended to make people afraid of my presidency.""

CBS Pittsburgh's Jon Delano spoke with Harris in an interview on Tuesday, challenging her to clarify her evolving stance on fracking, one of many key issues where she has been accused of flip-flopping for political gain.

""I wanted to ask you, there's a political ad on TV from a 2019 climate hall town meeting that you had, in which you basically said, quote, 'There's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,' unquote,"" the interviewer said. ""The ad claims that if you are elected president you will ban fracking and you will cost Pennsylvania over 300,000 jobs. Have you changed your view on fracking, and if so, why?""

HARRIS DODGING FLIP-FLOP ATTACKS AS FACELESS SURROGATES FLIP KEY POSITIONS: 'PLAYING POLITICS'

""So let me start by saying that that ad, as you described it, is absolutely a mischaracterization, that I think is intended to make people afraid of my presidency,"" Harris said.

""Let me be absolutely clear, as I've been when I said it back in 2020, I will not ban fracking. I did not as vice president. In fact, I cast the tie-breaking vote to open up more fracking leases,"" she added, referencing her role as vice president in getting the so-called Inflation Reduction Act through the deadlocked Senate.

In 2020, Harris was asked about fracking during her vice presidential debate against then-Vice President Mike Pence, but did not reveal a reversal of her stated 2019 opposition to fracking, instead simply saying that Biden would not ban fracking as president.

""Joe Biden will not end fracking. He has been very clear about that,"" Harris said.

""I will repeat and the American people know that Joe Biden will not ban fracking. That is a fact. That is a fact,"" she added during another portion of the debate.

CNN FACT CHECKER HITS KAMALA HARRIS FOR CLAIMING SHE 'MADE CLEAR' IN 2020 SHE WOULDN'T BAN FRACKING

On Tuesday, Harris said, ""My perspective on this is grounded in a number of things, including that we don't have to ban fracking to do the work that we can do to also invest in a clean energy economy.""

She then made multiple promises to American voters.

""I'm going to bring jobs back to rural communities. I'm going to make sure that we invest in those communities that have done the kind of work that you have in mind when you talk about Pittsburgh, when you talk about the greater aspect of Pennsylvania,"" she pledged.

Tom Cotton, R-Ark., tells ""One Nation"" that security failures regarding former President Trump are a ""scandal of the highest order.""

More than 400 national security and foreign policy officials, ex-Cabinet members, retired military officers and Gold Star families endorsed former President Trump on Thursday.

In an open letter organized by former National Security Adviser Robert O'Brien and former NSC Chief of Staff Alex Gray, the signatories condemn the ""repeated failures"" of the Biden-Harris administration's foreign policy and urged Americans to re-elect Trump.

""From a world at peace under President Trump, we are closer to a third world war than ever before under the Biden-Harris Administration,"" the letter states. ""With multiple escalating wars around the world, an open border that allows terrorists to flood into the American homeland, and malign actors like China operating unabated, U.S. national security has been profoundly damaged by the failed policies of Kamala Harris and Joe Biden.""

The endorsement was signed by several prominent officials from the Trump administration, including former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, former Attorney General Bill Barr, former U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations and former 2024 Republican presidential candidate Nikki Haley, and many more.

Eleven family members of the 13 American troops killed at Abbey Gate at Kabul's airport during the 2021 U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan also signed the letter, which praised Trump's foreign policy record in contrast to Biden's controversial actions.

""When President Trump took office, the war in Afghanistan had dragged on for almost 16 years. By February 2020, a peace agreement was reached, ensuring no American soldier was killed in combat until the end of the Trump Administration. This agreement held strong because the Taliban understood President Trump's resolve and U.S. forces were prepared to ensure their compliance,"" the letter reads.

VOTERS IN CRITICAL MICHIGAN COUNTY FOCUSED ON ECONOMY, CANDIDATE CHARACTER AS 2024 RACE TIGHTENS

""The botched withdrawal from Afghanistan under the Biden-Harris Administration in 2021, led to the unnecessary deaths of thirteen brave American troops at Abbey Gate and left untold billions of dollars of high grade military equipment to the Taliban, making it the most well-armed terror organization in the world.""

Additionally, 40 retired U.S. ambassadors, 75 retired senior military officers and several hundred officials from previous Republican administrations signed the letter, praising Trump's diplomatic efforts on cease-fire agreements between Turkey and Kurdish fighters in Syria and the Abraham Accords. The letter refers to Trump as a ""peacemaker.""

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

""Securing peace is in the greatest tradition of American foreign policy and the Judeo-Christian principles upon which our nation was founded,"" the letter continues before quoting from Jesus' Sermon on the Mount in the Gospel of Matthew.

Writing on X, O'Brien said he was ""honored"" to join his colleagues from the Trump administration in ""supporting a return to a 'peace through strength' foreign policy under President Trump.""

Another signatory, Dr. Jerry Hendrix, former director of the Secretary of the Navy's Advisory Panel, said it ""wasn't a hard decision"" to attach his name to the letter.

"Buttigieg's message on restricting civilian drones near Hurricane Helene damage prompts outcry, clarification",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/buttigieg-message-about-restricting-civilian-drones-near-hurricane-helene-damage-prompts-outcry-clarification,2024-10-03T22:59:00Z,"Fox News contributor Marc Thiessen joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss why President Biden and Vice President Harris are facing scrutiny for their response to Hurricane Helene.

The U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) clarified a message that warned civilian drone pilots not to fly near Hurricane Helene recovery and rescue efforts -- or risk penalty, fines or ""criminal prosecution"" -- after facing intense backlash online.

Reached by Fox News Digital, a DOT spokesperson said civilian drone pilots are permitted and are assisting in rescue and recovery efforts, and previous ""temporary flight restrictions"" have since been lifted.

Some X users -- collectively with millions of followers -- reacted adversely to a message addressed to drone pilots and with accompanying video from Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg shared by the department earlier this week. The message and video argued the restrictions would prohibit civilian volunteers from legally searching for victims or survivors when response time matters most or capturing their own footage of the disaster.

""The USDOT tweet from yesterday was referring to temporary flight restrictions that were in place but were lifted late last night,"" a DOT spokesperson told Fox News Digital Thursday, citing the FAA.

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

The spokesperson explained the FAA ""is not banning drones from providing Hurricane Helene disaster relief and recovery assistance.""

""At times, local authorities and law enforcement request the Federal Aviation Administration issue a Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) in order to ensure safety for aircraft or drones operating in certain areas,"" the spokesperson said in a statement. ""These restrictions occur at the request of local authorities or law enforcement. FAA does not put these into place without requests.""

The spokesperson said such restrictions apply to both manned and unmanned aircraft, or drones.

""With proper authorization, drones (and other aircraft) are permitted to operate within a Temporary Flight Restriction,"" the statement continued. ""These are only for limited areas identified by law enforcement and local authorities.

""Relief operations, including civilian operations and volunteers, that are coordinated with emergency responders can still access the airspace during these restrictions. Anyone looking to use a drone or other aircraft to assist in Hurricane Helene disaster relief and recovery efforts should coordinate with first responders and law enforcement on scene to ensure they do not disrupt life-saving operations.""

The clarification comes after the DOT posted to X Wednesday, writing: ""Drone pilots: Do not fly your drone near or around rescue and recovery efforts for Hurricane Helene. Interfering with emergency response operations impacts search and rescue operations on the ground.""

In an attached video message, Buttigieg said, ""Our goal is to make sure that funding is no obstacle to very quickly getting people the relief that they need and deserve.

""There's also some safety issues that come up. For example, temporary flight restrictions to make sure that the airspace is clear for any flights or drone activity that might be involved in helping to allow those emergency responders to do their jobs.""

The post pointed to the account for FAADroneZone, the Federal Aviation Administration's site for drone activity.

""Interfering with emergency response efforts may result in fines or criminal prosecution,"" FAADroneZone wrote, reposting Buttigieg's remarks. ""Always check Temporary Flight Restrictions before you fly.""

The posts quickly received heavy criticism on social media.

""The statement from Buttigieg comes as the federal government continues to shuffle its feet to help people in need,"" Trending Politics co-owner Collin Rugg wrote to his 1.5 million followers on X.

NORTH CAROLINA COMMUNITY 'HUNTING' FOR MISSING TEACHERS IN 'DEVASTATING' AFTERMATH OF HURRICANE HELENE

""Kamala Harris announced that survivors could potentially get $750 in federal assistance,"" Rugg added. ""Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas says FEMA doesn't have enough money to make it through hurricane season after spending hundreds of millions of dollars on illegals.""

""U.S. Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg tells Americans to stop using drones to help victims of Hurricane Helene. They're using drones to FIND SURVIVORS,"" podcaster Chad Prather wrote to his 496,800 followers.

""Pete Buttigieg has declared that private drones are BANNED from flying over areas affected by Hurricane Helene. They're deliberately impeding the ability of volunteers to assist in search and rescue and documenting the extent of the disaster,"" conservative journalist Ian Miles Cheong, who has 1.1 million followers on X, added.

The death toll from Hurricane Helene surpassed 200 people across affected states as of Thursday. Hundreds remain unaccounted for in the aftermath.

Buttigieg visited FEMA headquarters and joined Cabinet members Tuesday to brief President Biden at the White House on the destruction of Hurricane Helene.

The FAA, meanwhile, deployed teams ""to restore communications to impacted towers and airports, including delivering satellite communications kits to the Asheville Regional Airport in North Carolina and ongoing work at Valdosta Regional Airport in Georgia,"" the DOT said Tuesday.

""FAA supported FEMA with two aircraft to conduct flyover assessments and transport emergency personnel and gear, such as satellite communications kits.

"Politico says Walz's false statements may 'haunt' campaign, undermine 'upstanding, everyday Midwest' appeal",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/politico-says-walzs-false-statements-may-haunt-campaign-undermine-upstanding-everyday-midwest-appeal,2024-10-03T22:11:31Z,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz attempts to clarify remarks he made about being in Tiananmen Square during the 1989 pro-democracy protests during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Vice presidential candidate Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., has been called out so many times for false claims, one news outlet warned it may unravel his public image.

CBS debate moderators confronted the governor during his vice presidential debate with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, Tuesday regarding Walz's claim that he had been in Hong Kong in May 1989 during the Tiananmen Square protests, when he actually traveled to Asia in August, a few months later.

Politico observed this is part of a history of factual inaccuracies Walz has told about his past, in an article headlined, ""Tim Walz has a tendency to misspeak. It may haunt the campaign.""

""Since being tapped as Kamala Harris' running mate, the folksy, plain-speaking Minnesota governor has had to explain a growing number of inaccurate statements -- and at times embellishments -- about his past,"" Politico's Meredith Lee Hill and Mia McCarthy wrote. ""They range from comments about his military service to his visit to Hong Kong more than three decades ago to clarifying that his family didn't specifically use in vitro fertilization.""

BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT TELLS DR. PHIL HE SAW 'PANIC' ON WALZ'S FACE DURING KEY DEBATE MOMENT

""It's unclear whether Walz's verbal errors will undercut his credibility with voters. But the need to continually clean up those claims could politically hurt Walz and Harris, who are locked in a tight race with Donald Trump and JD Vance,"" the reporters added.

""And in some cases, key members of Harris' circle weren't aware of some of the inaccurate statements until they became public despite the vetting process, according to four people familiar with the conversations who were granted anonymity to discuss the matter.""

The writers said, ""Walz's misstatements could contradict the image that the campaign has painted of him as an upstanding, everyday Midwest guy.""

During the debate, Walz responded to a question about his Tiananmen Square claim by speaking about how he ""grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies 'til the streetlights come on,"" then described joining the National Guard and becoming a teacher. He glossed over his trips to China but acknowledged, ""I've not been perfect, I'm a knucklehead at times.""

When confronted again by one of the moderators for not answering the question, he conceded he ""misspoke"" about the Tiananmen timeline.

The day after the debate, Walz told reporters during a campaign stop in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, ""Yeah, look, I have my dates wrong. I was in Hong Kong in China in 1989... I speak like everybody else speaks. I need to be clearer.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

A spokesperson for the campaign defended Walz's record to Politico, noting he ""cares deeply about democracy.""

""As the governor has said, he sometimes misspeaks. He speaks like a normal person and speaks passionately about issues he cares deeply about, including democracy and stopping gun violence in our school,"" the Harris-Walz campaign said, adding former President Trump and Vance ""repeatedly lie and mislead about their plan to ban abortion nationwide"" and other topics."

A federal judge on Wednesday unsealed a key filing from special counsel Jack Smith's updated election interference case against former President Donald Trump.

U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia Tanya Chutkan unsealed Smith's 165-page filing, in which Smith argues that Trump is not immune from prosecution for his alleged criminal scheme to overturn the 2020 election results. Smith submitted the document after the U.S. Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts.

""Although the defendant was the incumbent President during the charged conspiracies, his scheme was fundamentally a private one,"" Smith wrote. ""Working with a team of private co-conspirators, the defendant acted as a candidate when he pursued multiple criminal means to disrupt, through fraud and deceit, the government function by which votes are collected and counted -- a function in which the defendant, as President, had no official role."" ...Read more

Melania Trump's abortion views in new memoir spur outrage from pro-lifers: 'She is wrong',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trumps-abortion-views-new-memoir-spur-outrage-from-pro-lifers-she-wrong,2024-10-03T20:43:32Z,"Former first lady Melania Trump opens up about her life before, during and after the White House in a sit-down interview on 'Fox & Friends.'

Former first lady Melania Trump is drawing heat from pro-life advocates over an excerpt in her memoir where she suggests a woman's right to choose an abortion is a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report Wednesday.

Melania Trump wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, Melania expresses a viewpoint that has historically been at odds with the Republican Party's platform.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Melania reportedly wrote.

TRUMP RISKS LOSING SOME PRO-LIFE VOTERS UNLESS HE CHANGES 'HIS TUNE' ON ABORTION, ACTIVIST WARNS

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The excerpts quickly drew the ire of pro-life advocates who have already been disgruntled by some of Trump's seemingly ambiguous comments regarding abortion.

""Melania Trump's support of abortion is anti-feminist and clearly outside the teaching of our Catholic faith. She is wrong,"" wrote Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group.

PRO-LIFERS BLAST TRUMP 'BETRAYAL' WITH SHIFTING ABORTION STANCE, ANSWER ON FLORIDA AMENDMENT 4

Lila Rose, founder of leading pro-life advocacy group Live Action, also responded to a promotional video Melania posted for her memoir in which she states, ""Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard... what does my body my choice really mean?""

""Who is this Melania Trump, or Kamala Harris? Functionally the same exact position on abortion,"" Rose wrote on X.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

President of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, wrote on X: ""The women of America are capable of great strength and creativity. They are naturally inclined to speak for those who are powerless. Abortion is not the source of their freedom and liberation.""

In August, Trump sparked confusion among pro-life supporters about where he stood on an amendment that would upend Florida's ban on abortions after six weeks' gestation. Trump, after saying ""I think the six-week is too short, there has to be more time,"" to an NBC reporter when asked how he would vote, later walked it back and said he would vote against the amendment.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

Tuesday night's vice-presidential debate offered a refreshing change from the combative tone that has plagued our political discourse over the past eight years.

For many viewers, it was a relief to witness a civil exchange between two candidates who, surprisingly, seemed to respect one another. Sen. JD Vance showcased his skills as both an orator and debater, garnering a more favorable opinion from many voters.

On the other hand, Gov. Tim Walz, while appearing somewhat nervous and lackluster, managed to connect with viewers through his likability and relatability. The unfortunate reality, however, is that neither candidate did enough to change any votes.

VANCE VS. WALZ DEBATE LEAVES AMERICANS WITH THIS BIG TAKEAWAY

So, what can we take away from this debate?

Despite various pundits highlighting the strengths of the two vice presidential candidates, Tuesday night's debate ultimately had little impact on undecided voters. While Walz's performance had its successes, his nervous start and notable gaffes left much to be desired. In the end, both candidates offered a little something for everyone -- but for those still weighing their options, there were no compelling reasons to change their minds.

As we approach the final stretch of the presidential election, the challenge for both candidates and their running mates is clear: how can they win over undecided voters in just 33 days? The answer lies in two crucial areas:

Given the current economic climate, this task may be easier for former President Donald Trump, especially in light of the anticipated repercussions from the port strike and escalating energy prices due to turmoil in the Middle East.

That there is a leader in office who has their backs. Voters are understandably anxious about the future, and both candidates have already tapped into this concern -- Vice President Kamala Harris and Walz highlighting the threats to democracy and Trump and Vance focused on the difficulties we face with the economy and immigration.

Yet, what Americans urgently need now is assurance: a promise that if they cast their vote for the right candidate, life will improve once again. In turbulent times marked by international conflicts, rising prices, and the aftermath of natural disasters, that message of hope and stability is not just important; it is essential.

As the clock ticks down to Election Day, the ability to inspire confidence and reassure voters will determine the next leader of this nation."
Emhoff denies report he slapped ex-girlfriend outside ritzy overseas movie event,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/emhoff-denies-report-he-slapped-ex-girlfriend-outside-ritzy-overseas-movie-event,2024-10-03T19:27:11Z,"MSNBC host Jen Psaki asked Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff about redefining the view of masculinity by openly supporting his wife Vice President Kamala Harris.

Second gentleman Doug Emhoff denied the veracity of a Daily Mail report in which three unnamed sources accused him of having slapped a former girlfriend during a 2012 trip to the Cannes Film Festival.

Fox News Digital has not been able to independently confirm the allegations.

""This report is untrue,"" an unnamed representative for Vice President Kamala Harris' husband told news outlet Semafor. ""Any suggestion that he would or has ever hit a woman is false.""

The Daily Mail's exclusive story on Tuesday quoted a trio of unidentified sources who claim Emhoff slapped his then-girlfriend while the couple waited in a valet line following an event in Nice, France, in 2012. The alleged altercation was purportedly sparked when the woman - identified only by the pseudonym ""Jane"" and described as a successful New York attorney - flirted with a valet, according to the article.

The Harris campaign, the Office of the Vice President and a representative for Emhoff's ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, did not comment despite repeated requests from Fox News.

Several media outlets, including Semafor, noted they had been unable to match the Daily Mail's reporting and legacy media companies such as the New York Times have yet to report on the claims.

The Daily Mail's article hinged on the recollections of three people described as being Jane's friends. The outlet said its sources requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation from Emhoff. The three friends reportedly provided the outlet with a photo of the pair when they were still a couple, as well as itineraries and correspondence between Emhoff and Jane to substantiate that they made the trip to France in May 2012.

'HE IMPREGNATED HIS KID'S NANNY': PSAKI RIPPED AFTER CLAIMING EMHOFF 'RESHAPED' MASCULINITY

One of the sources is described by the Daily Mail as a female New York attorney who learned about the alleged incident from Jane.

""He hauled up and slapped her so hard she spun around,"" the source is quoted as saying. ""She said she was in utter shock. She was so furious, she slapped him on one side, and then on the other cheek with the other hand.""

Another friend, described by the Daily Mail as a New York businessman, told the outlet Jane called him sobbing following the alleged incident.

PROGRESSIVE WOMEN'S GROUPS SILENT ON SECOND GENTLEMAN DOUG EMHOFF'S AFFAIR

""It was very clear what she was telling me,"" that source said, according to the Daily Mail. ""She said she was with a guy, her date, she was at the Cannes Film Festival, and he hit her. She was in the car with the guy at the time.""

The male friend said he learned more details about the alleged episode after the initial phone call.

""It was something like 3 a.m. They were trying to get out of there and they both had been drinking. There was a gigantic line for taxis,"" he told the outlet. ""She went up to one of the valet guys, offered him 100 euros or whatever, to get to the head of the line. She told me she put her hand on his shoulder. Doug apparently thought that she was flirting, and came over and slapped her in the face.""

A third friend, described as a female executive, told the Daily Mail that she learned of the alleged incident in 2014, and purportedly found out new details from Jane in 2018, when Harris, then a senator from California, made headlines with her questioning of a Supreme Court nominee who had been accused of sexual assault.

""[She] is a gorgeous, strong woman and you would never expect somebody to hit her,"" the third friend told the Daily Mail. ""When he hit her she hit him back, like, 'Don't you ever do that again,'""

The third Daily Mail source added: ""I asked her if he ever apologized. She said 'no,' but he commented about the hit she gave him. It was a tennis metaphor. But no apology at all.""

All three friends told the outlet that Jane hit Emhoff back after the alleged initial slap. They also claimed that Jane tried to leave the valet area after the alleged slap, but that Emhoff got into a cab with Jane.

Jane and Emhoff had been dating for about three months before the reported trip to France, according to the friends. Emhoff allegedly cut the trip short and returned to the U.S. for his daughter's birthday at the end of May, and never saw Jane again, the friends told the outlet.

Emhoff's alleged relationship with Jane unfolded after his 2008 divorce from his first wife and before his 2014 marriage to Harris.

The New York Post on Wednesday slammed Emhoff as ""Worst Gentleman"" in its cover story detailing the Daily Mail's article.

Emhoff is fresh off of a Sunday sit-down interview on MSNBC during which Jen Psaki celebrated him as having reshaped ""the perception of masculinity.""

""There is also an important, interesting part about how people have talked about your role is how your role has reshaped the perception of masculinity,"" Psaki said. ""I'm not sure you planned on that, but you are an incredibly supportive spouse. Has that been an evolution for you? Do you think that's part of the role you might play as first gentleman?""

Emhoff responded: ""It's funny. I've started to think a lot about this. I've always been like this. My dad's always been like this. To me, it's the right thing to do, support women. It is mutual with Kamala and I. We support each other, we have each other's back.""

DOUG EMHOFF'S EX-WIFE RESPONDS AFTER SECOND GENTLEMAN ADMITTED TO AFFAIR WITH NANNY

He added: ""I've said many times when we lift up women, we support women, whether it's pay equity, child care, family leave, and all of these issues in this post-Dobbs hellscape. Women should not be less than. Women should not have less rights and be treated differently. That's not the American way.""

Clips of the exchange spread like wildfire on social media as critics noted that, in August, Emhoff admitted to having an affair with his family's nanny during his first marriage years ago.

Emhoff's admission came shortly after the Daily Mail published a separate report in August claiming that he got his daughter's nanny pregnant.

The affair occurred before Emhoff's relationship with and eventual marriage to Harris.

""During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,"" Emhoff said over the summer, acknowledging the affair, but not naming the nanny.

Emhoff and his first wife were married from 1992 to 2008 and share two adult children. Harris married Emhoff in 2014, and helped co-parent his children, who call their stepmom ""mommala.""

"Voters in critical Michigan county focused on economy, candidate character as 2024 race tightens",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/voters-critical-michigan-county-focused-economy-candidate-character-2024-race-tightens,2024-10-03T18:04:18Z,"Voters in Kent County, Michigan, a swing county in one of the most critical swing states, told Fox News Digital about the issues weighing on their mind and whom they support in the upcoming election.

Voters in Kent County, Michigan, could play a large role in determining who wins November's presidential election, but many voters in the area are still undecided about their choice.

""I think there is too much division in his country. I think people on the left and people on the right hate each other a lot and I don't think that's right,"" said one Kent County voter, who told Fox News Digital he is still undecided.

The comments come as Kent County, which includes Michigan's second-largest city of Grand Rapids and much of the surrounding area, figures to play an outsized role in November.

While Michigan is well-known as one of the seven key swing states in the upcoming election, Kent County figures to be one of the key counties. Holding over 6% of the state's population, the county has traditionally been known as a conservative haven.

TRUMP TAKES NFL, NBA TO TASK ABOUT KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

However, that trend has started to reverse itself in recent years, starting when former President Barack Obama was able to capture the county in 2008. Sen. Mitt Romney, R-Utah, won the county during his presidential bid in 2012, while former President Donald Trump took Kent County in 2016. It went back to Democrats in 2020, when President Biden was able to capture this important part of Michigan.

This year's race promises to feature Kent County again, though some voters there remain unconvinced by the candidates.

""Something which stood out to me about Trump is that he didn't bring us into any wars,"" one undecided voter said before noting that he believed Vice President Kamala Harris' ""stance is a lot clearer on LGBTQ rights.""

Immigration stood out as an issue to some Kent County voters, with one telling Fox News Digital the issue was a matter of human rights.

""People having the rights to be in our country and the rights to health care,"" said0 the voter, who indicated he was voting for Harris.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

""Hopefully she can bring down housing costs and pretty much just inflation for young people like myself,"" he added. ""Trying to buy a house, trying to get loans and cars and things like that is very important for people of my age.""

However, another voter disagreed on the economy, arguing Trump is the right candidate to lead the country forward.

""I believe that a person who has run a company, that's been in business, can do a better job than a lifelong politician in terms of making decisions,"" the voter said.

That voter also indicated support for Trump on foreign policy, arguing he garnered the respect of world leaders.

""I think he was not afraid to stand up for what he felt is right,"" he said. ""I think other world leaders took note of that.""

Another voter, who indicated foreign policy was a key issue, disagreed.

""One candidate gets it and the other doesn't,"" the voter, who indicated support for Harris, told Fox News Digital of the reason he is voting for Harris.

""She understands the importance of our standing on the global stage, international politics, and our national security. I don't think Trump understands that,"" the voter continued.

Yet others had more trouble picking a candidate, most notably because of the divisive nature of modern politics.

""One day I'll go one way and another day I'll go another way,"" one undecided voter told Fox News Digital.

""It's hard to take her seriously, nothing sticks out about her,"" she said on Harris, while also noting that he finds it ""very hard to believe"" that someone as rich as Trump "" could care about people that don't have any money.""

The voter also deducted points from Trump because of the ""tone of his voice.""

""The name calling, I don't particularly care for that,"" the voter said."
Over 1.7M migrants who could pose national security risk arrived in US during Biden admin: report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/over-1-7-million-migrants-who-could-pose-national-security-risk-arrived-us-biden-admin-report,2024-10-03T17:49:57Z,"FIRST ON FOX: More than 1.7 million migrants have been encountered at the U.S. border and have come from countries that officials believe pose a national security threat to the United States, according to a new House report.

The report by the House Judiciary Committee says the number of ""special interest aliens"" (SIAs) came from a congressional staff briefing by Department of Homeland Security (DHS) officials. SIAs are those who have come from countries identified by the U.S. government as having conditions that promote or protect terrorism or potentially pose some sort of national security threat to the U.S.

In 2019, the DHS defined an SIA as ""a non-U.S. person who, based on an analysis of travel patterns, potentially poses a national security risk to the United States or its interests. Often such individuals or groups are employing travel patterns known or evaluated to possibly have a nexus to terrorism.""

HARRIS VISITS CRUCIAL BORDER STATE AS IMMIGRATION RECORD SPARKS SCRUTINY: A TIMELINE

""DHS analysis includes an examination of travel patterns, points of origin, and/or travel segments that are tied to current assessments of national and international threat environments,"" it said.

The House report says that there are currently 26 special interest countries, including Afghanistan, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Nigeria, Syria and Turkey. The agency recently removed 11 countries from the list and added 12 others, including North Korea, China and Venezuela.

The U.S. has seen numerous Chinese and Venezuelan nationals in particular, with nearly 300,000 Venezuelans encountered at the border this fiscal year so far and more than 73,000 Chinese nationals.

Border Patrol sources have previously told Fox News they have extreme concerns about people coming across from special interest countries, given they have little to no way to vet them. Unless they have committed a crime in the U.S. or are on a federal watch list, agents have no way of knowing their criminal history because their countries do not share data with the U.S., so there is nothing to match their name against when authorities run their fingerprints.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WITH 'TERRORISM TIES' WILL CONTINUE TO EXPLOIT BORDER, HOMELAND SECURITY REPORT WARNS

The committee said that DHS told the committee that being a national from a special interest country does not affect a migrant's admissibility into the U.S., although officials have previously stressed that all migrants are vetted using a multi-layered process that includes biographic and biometric information.

As an example of the risks that can be posed by the release of SIA migrants, the committee pointed to the case of Mohammad Kharwin, who was released into the U.S. and later on bond by an immigration judge despite potential terror ties. The DHS located and rearrested him two weeks later. DHS has since agreed to a voluntary departure of Kharwin from the U.S., and he is currently in ICE custody.

""Congress must take seriously its efforts to secure the border and stop the weakening of U.S. national security,"" the report said.

""As the case of Mohammad Kharwin exemplifies, the Biden-Harris Administration has sown chaos at America's borders and allowed potential national security and counterintelligence threats to enter the United States -- and, at least in Kharwin's case, be released into the country multiple times,"" it said.

The report found that there were around 98,000 SIA encounters in FY 21, which went up to 482,705 in FY 22, then 597,058 in FY 23 and 531,768 in FY 24 so far. Of those, most were encountered at the southern border, with 95,705 southwest border encounters of special interest aliens in fiscal year 2021; 465,664 in 2022; 566,079 in 2023; and 504,215 in 2024 so far.

The increase in SIAs has come amid an ongoing debate about the southern border and how to tackle it. The Biden administration has pointed to a sharp drop in encounters since June, which it attributes to a June presidential proclamation which limited the number of asylum entries into the U.S.

According to those numbers, encounters between ports of entry have decreased by more than 50%, and DHS has removed or returned more than 131,000 individuals to more than 140 countries, including operating more than 400 international repatriation flights.

""In that period, DHS has almost tripled the percentage of noncitizens processed for Expedited Removal, and the percentage of releases pending immigration court proceedings is down nearly half. Total removals and returns over the past year exceed removals and returns in any fiscal year since 2010 and a majority of all southwest border encounters during the past three fiscal years resulted in a removal, return, or expulsion,"" Customs and Border Protection said in a release last month.

It has also called for the passage of a bipartisan Senate bill that would increase funding to border agencies, including for detention beds, and would also place limits on migrant entries into the U.S. Conservatives have said it would codify high levels of illegal immigration.

Vice President Kamala Harris visited the border in Arizona last week and hammered former President Donald Trump for his lack of support for the bipartisan bill. However, Republicans have noted that the House passed a sweeping border security bill last year, but the Senate has yet to pass that either.

Ohio GOP Senate candidate Moreno hits Brown on Inflation Reduction Act vote in ad that's part of $25M buy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ohio-gop-senate-candidate-moreno-hits-brown-inflation-reduction-act-vote-ad-thats-part-25m-buy,2024-10-03T16:19:51Z,"FIRST ON FOX - Ohio Republican Bernie Moreno is hitting incumbent Democrat Sen. Sherrod Brown on his Inflation Reduction Act vote in a new ad that's part of a $25 million new buy ahead of Election Day.

The 30-second ad spot, which will run on television and digitally, opens with a single mother from Versailles, Ohio, saying she can't believe the current prices for groceries.

""It's a lot tougher to provide for my kids with the Democrats' inflation,"" the woman, Carla, says. ""Sherrod Brown's only made things worse. Brown supported Kamala, not us, and voted for her radical Inflation Act, and now prices are at a 40-year-high. Bernie Moreno will fight to lower prices and stop inflation. That's why I trust Bernie Moreno to help Ohio families.""

The ad, first obtained by Fox News Digital in advance of its planned roll out, also includes the message on screen: ""Sherrod Brown voted for Kamala's Inflation Act.""

It was paid for by Bernie Moreno for Senate and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

""Hardworking Ohioans are suffering under the record-high inflation created by Kamala Harris and Sherrod Brown,"" Moreno said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""While he claims to fight for Ohio, families are unable to afford basic necessities. In November, we will send him packing and get our economy back on track.""

Moreno's campaign told Fox News Digital that the ad is part of an additional $25 million in spending. It comes just 33 days before the Nov. 5 election. Early voting in Ohio starts Oct. 8.

The contest is on track to be the most expensive Senate race this cycle, with $310.4 million in spending from both campaigns as of August, according to Axios.

As of August, Moreno shelled out $158.4 million and Brown spent $152 million, Axios reported.

Brown's campaign announced Wednesday it will report raising nearly $31 million in the third quarter.

Fox News has labeled the race between Moreno and Brown as a toss-up.

Fox News Digital reached out to Brown's campaign and congressional office for comment about the new ad but did not immediately hear back.

Ohio is center stage on the presidential ticket this cycle with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, as former President Trump's vice presidential running mate. Moreno ran against Vance in the 2022 GOP Republican primary for Senate, which Vance won, and has supported the Trump-Vance bid for the White House.

In August 2023, on the one-year anniversary of President Biden signing his Inflation Reduction Act into law, Brown's campaign issued a statement championing the legislation as having included ""key priorities Brown fought for to save Ohioans money, crack down on Wall Street stock buybacks, and attract investment and good-paying jobs to Ohio.""

""The Inflation Reduction Act is already saving Ohioans money at the pharmacy counter and spurring Ohio to lead the country in manufacturing the technology of the future - and those cost savings and Ohio jobs will only grow in the coming years,"" Brown said in a statement at the time.

As of August 2024, the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that the Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U) in the Midwest - which includes Ohio - rose by 2.6% over the last 12 months.

As President Biden spends a second straight day surveying damage and getting briefed on recovery and relief efforts in the storm-damaged Southeast, he's once again coming under political attack from former President Trump.

As the death toll from Hurricane Helene climbs to close to 200 people, with hundreds still missing, millions still without power or running water, and damage estimated in the billions, Trump took to social media on Thursday morning to paint Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as incompetent.

""Kamala and Sleepy Joe are universally being given POOR GRADES for the way that they are handling the Hurricane, especially in North Carolina,"" Trump charged in a social media post. ""It is going down as the WORST & MOST INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED 'STORM,' AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL, EVER SEEN BEFORE.""

Trump, who's locked in a margin-of-error race with Harris with less than five weeks to go until Election Day in November, has been attacking the vice president and her boss over the federal response to the powerful storm for nearly a week.

BIDEN, HARRIS, INSPECT STORM DAMAGE WITH TRIPS TO SOUTHEAST

And with two of the hardest hit states - North Carolina and Georgia - two of the seven key battlegrounds that will likely determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election, the hurricane has become front-and-center in the White House race.

Trump this past weekend accused the president of ""sleeping"" at his beach house in Delaware as the storm blasted the Southeast.

NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS FIGHT FOR THEIR SURVIVAL

And speaking with reporters as he arrived in Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday to survey storm damage and bring relief aid, the former president charged that ""the federal government is not being responsive.""

And he falsely claimed that Biden had not spoken with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a conservative Republican.

Pushing back against the political attacks, Biden has noted that he was on the phone with federal, state and local officials throughout the weekend and returned to the nation's capital on Sunday afternoon to monitor storm rescue and relief efforts.

""We had over 1,000 federal personnel, including search and rescue teams, at the ready on the ground before it hit,"" the president said on Tuesday. ""Over the past several days, I've been in regular contact with the governors, the mayors, the county officials, and all the affected areas. That includes Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Virginia.

And Biden emphasized that his administration has sent ""every available resource that we have at our disposal to the affected region"" and pledged ""we'll be there until this work is done.""

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON HELENE'S HAVOC

More than half of the deaths from the storm are in North Carolina, where entire communities in the western part of the state were demolished by fast-moving waters.

As the floodwaters from the storm receded, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper lamented that, in the western part of his state, ""communities were wiped off the map.""

The president on Wednesday was in North Carolina, where he surveyed damage from a helicopter flight over the city of Ashville, one of the hardest hit areas. Biden also visited a rescue command center in the state before also stopping in neighboring South Carolina.

""My top priority is to ensure the communities devastated by this hurricane get the help and support they need as quickly as possible,"" Biden told reporters Tuesday as he spoke during a Cabinet meeting focusing on the federal response.

And the president ahead of his trip to the region green-lighted the use of up to 1,000 active duty troops to support relief efforts.

And huddled with Democratic and Republican politicians from the region on Wednesday, Biden emphasized that ""in a moment like this, we put politics aside, at least we should put it all aside. We have here - there are no Democrats or Republicans, only Americans - our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can.""

Trump on Sunday attacked Harris for attending ""fundraising events with her radical left lunatic donors"" in California over the weekend. And he argued that Harris ""ought to be down in the area"" where the storm caused destruction.

On Monday during his stop in Georgia, Trump repeated the dig, saying, ""The vice president, she's out someplace campaigning looking for money.""

The White House has highlighted that the vice president over the weekend was on the phone with federal, state and local officials.

Harris said on Saturday that she and the president ""remain committed to ensuring that no community or state has to respond to this disaster alone.""

On Monday, Harris visited FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she received a briefing on relief and rescue efforts.

""We will do everything in our power to help communities respond and recover,"" Harris vowed.

Harris on Wednesday traveled to Georgia to survey the impacts of the storm and receive an on-the-ground briefing and provide updates on the federal response.

""We are here for the long haul,"" Harris told residents in Augusta, Georgia. ""There's a lot of work that's going to need to happen over the coming days, weeks, and months, and the coordination that we have dedicated ourselves to will be long-lasting to get families, to get residents, to get neighborhoods back up and running.""

Harris was originally scheduled to take part Wednesday in a campaign bus swing through central Pennsylvania, another key battleground state, with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

With the vice president headed to Georgia, Walz headlined the bus tour, which came the day after he faced off in the running mates debate against Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the GOP vice presidential nominee.

During his Monday stop in Georgia, Trump highlighted that ""I've come to Valdosta with large semi-trucks, many of them filled with relief aid. A tanker truck filled up with gasoline, a couple of big tanker trucks filled up with gasoline, which they can't get now. And we'll be working to distribute it throughout the day.""

And a GoFundMe page set up by the Trump campaign earlier this week has raised over $4 million so far for storm victims.

""I'm committed to traveling to the impacted areas as soon as possible, but I've been told that it would be disruptive if I did it right now. We will not do that at the risk of diverting or delaying any of the response assets needed to deal with this crisis,"" Biden told reporters on Monday.

And Harris said on Tuesday, ""I plan to be on the ground as soon as possible - but as soon as possible without disrupting any emergency response operations, because that must be the highest priority and the first order of business.""

But the optics of Trump's Monday stop in Georgia may have put some political pressure on Biden and Harris.

Longtime Republican strategist David Kochel said Trump had been ""very aggressive"" with his quick trip to the storm-damaged region.

""I think he put a lot of pressure on them to try to do something,"" Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News. ""He's out there pushing a line that they don't care - they're not doing anything and I think they're reacting to it.""

The response by elected officials to natural disasters can impact their political standing.

President George W. Bush was heavily criticized in the summer of 2005 for his initial response to Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans.

And Trump faced criticism early in his White House tenure as Puerto Rico struggled to recover from a powerful storm. The president was pilloried for throwing paper towels to the crowd as he stopped by a relief center during a storm-related visit to the island."

""We heard a whole lot of Trump support,"" the CBS host said, referring to conversations he had in Forsyth County, Georgia, which he described as a ""Republican stronghold"" the Trump campaign was counting on.

Dokoupil visited three Georgia towns for the ""CBS Mornings"" segment, and noted that President Biden won the state in 2020 by a small margin, after Donald Trump won in 2016. The host added, ""There are warning lights for Kamala Harris.""

""I feel like he aligns more with America and American values than she does,"" an Atlanta voter told Dokoupil.

CBS News cited a poll that showed Trump ahead of the vice president in Georgia by two percentage points. A recent Fox News poll found that Harris leads Trump in the state by three points.

""To me, he's more for the people, the hard-working people,"" one voter said.

Another told CBS that she did like her life more when Trump was in office.

Other voters Dokoupil spoke to in Georgia felt that Harris was the clear choice in the presidential contest.

""Democrats are focused on actual issues that are of concern to Americans, and solving the systemic problems that we all face,"" a voter in Atlanta said.

""I wouldn't vote for him even if it -- if it meant another $100,000 in my pocket,"" another voter, who just moved to Georgia from California, told CBS.

While some said they were undecided, one man expressed that he planned to vote for Harris and explained that he drove his neighbors, who are Republican, to the polls.

""I believe I would be a good president, but I know I'm not nearly smart enough!

"Biden will 'wreck' US economy by failing to intervene in dockworkers' port strike, GOP leader warns",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-wreck-u-s-economy-failing-intervene-dockworkers-port-strike-gop-leader-warns,2024-10-03T15:26:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

House Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., slammed President Biden for failing to intervene in the dockworkers' port strike, expressing concern over the impact it will have on American families who are already struggling with crippling inflation.

Scalise accused Biden of potentially allowing the strike to ""wreck"" the U.S. economy during ""Fox & Friends,"" arguing that consumers will struggle even more with rising costs as the International Longshoremen's Association's (ILA) strike drags on.

PORT STRIKE WILL BRING ANOTHER HIT TO FARMERS, SAYS FORMER TRUMP OFFICIAL

""The president said we're just going to let it go on and wreck the economy,"" Scalise told Lawrence Jones. ""We're losing over $5 billion a day and costs are going to start going up even higher on families who are already struggling under the Biden-Harris inflation economy. Food on the shelves is going to become more scarce.""

Although Biden could invoke the 1947 Taft-Hartley Act to intervene in the strike, he has insisted against taking action. Under that law, Biden could enact an 80-day ""cooling off"" period for negotiations to resume while workers are back at work.

The ILA, which represents 45,000 dockworkers, began its first strike since 1977 after its six-year contract with the U.S. Maritime Alliance (USMX), which represents port employers, expired Monday night.

The 36 ports impacted by the strike on the Gulf and East coasts handle 55% of all U.S. container traffic and large volumes of exports, including about half of U.S. pork and almost three-quarters of U.S. poultry. About half of all imported fruits and vegetables come through these ports as well. In pharmaceuticals, nine out of 10 imports and seven out of 10 exports are being disrupted.

Negotiations between the ILA and USMX have been deadlocked thus far over the union's demands related to wage hikes and compensation, as well as protection from automation at ports.

Scalise argued that Congress would not support a ban on automation despite demands from the ILA.

""When we're competing globally, we're not just competing one city against another,"" he said. ""You've got ports all around the world that are heavily automated, and they still have humans, by the way, who actually run the devices. These automated devices aren't running themselves, but they're already making with overtime over $200,000 a year, in some cases, and they want to shut the economy down to get more.""

THE TAFT-HARTLEY ACT: WHY BIDEN COULD USE THIS LABOR TO PREEMPT A PORT STRIKE

""Who pays for this? And this will add even more to inflation,"" he continued. ""There are a lot of families making 50,000 a year that are saying please stop adding to the costs, and Biden and Harris won't do anything because they want to see those prices keep going.""

Meanwhile, the president has faced fierce scrutiny for spending numerous days at the beach while the nation faces implications of the strike along with various other crises - the aftermath of Hurricane Helene and surging violence in the Middle East.

""We see Joe Biden on the beach. He comes to the White House whenever he wants to,"" Jones said. ""Kamala Harris is on the campaign trail. The Cabinet members are just on the Sunday shows as allies of Kamala Harris. You're in leadership of our government, but who's running the country right now?""

""It's a really scary thought,"" Scalise responded. ""When you look at some of the bills we passed, we passed bills to secure the southern border. Joe Biden came out, said he's against it. Kamala Harris said she's against it. We have bills to produce our own American energy, so we don't need to give Iran and Russia billions of dollars a month. President Biden and Kamala Harris oppose that, so... you see a clear divide. The country is going to speak really loudly on this.""

""I think JD Vance said it best at the debate the other night,"" he continued. ""Kamala Harris talks about what you do on the first day. Kamala Harris's first day was 1,400 days ago, and look at the results. The world's on fire. Americans can't drive to go to the grocery store, let alone put food on the table."""
Nervous Democrats in Michigan suffering 'PTSD' and 'paranoia' over 2016 as election day nears: Report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nervous-democrats-michigan-suffering-ptsd-paranoia-over-2016-election-day-nears-report,2024-10-03T13:27:18Z,"Senate Minority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss his reaction to Kamala Harris reportedly losing support in Michigan and his take on key Senate races ahead of November.

Some Michigan Democrats are worried about a repeat of Hillary Clinton's loss in the state as election day nears and Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump remain neck-and-neck in the polls, according to reports.

""Smart Democrats have a healthy sense of paranoia,"" Michigan Democratic strategist Adrian Hemond told the Associated Press (AP). ""If polling is as far off as it was in 2016, we're cooked.""

A new poll released by the New York Times and Siena College found Harris had 48% support in Michigan and Trump had 47%. Clinton narrowly lost Michigan to Trump in 2016, making her the first Democrat to lose the state since Michael Dukakis in 1988.

Hemond noted that in 2016, some polls did not show how much support Trump had in Michigan.

""Anyone who's from Michigan knows that, if you believe the polling, like, I got a bridge I'm going to sell you somewhere,"" Rep. Elissa Slotkin, D-Mich., and a candidate for Senate, told the AP.

""Democrats' financial resources absolutely dwarf anything that the Republicans have,"" former GOP Michigan Gov. John Engler told the outlet. ""But Trump is making stops in locations that have never had presidential visits before, and those are impactful with margins this close.""

Slotkin reportedly said during a recent virtual fundraiser that Harris was ""underwater"" in Michigan, although it's typical for candidates to stoke fears of losing among their base to drive up fundraising.

""I'm not feeling my best right now about where we are on Kamala Harris in a place like Michigan,"" Slotkin said, according to Axios. ""We have her underwater in our polling.""

""What did we see? Money coming in like crazy. Everybody was excited. There was such a bump,"" said Lori Goldman, a Democratic activist and founder of Fems for Dems, a voter outreach group in the state. ""And now, you know, it's neck and neck.""

""It is PTSD,"" Goldman added.

Patrick Schuh, another Democratic Michigan strategist, said voters his group has spoken to want to ""hear more about what Harris stands for as a candidate.""

Gordon Sondland, who served as then-President Trump's ambassador to the EU and who became a star witness against him in his first impeachment, shocked an MSNBC host by saying Trump won his support once again.

MSNBC host Ari Melber spoke with three former Trump officials, including White House advisor Peter Navarro, White House spokeswoman Sarah Matthews, and Sondland about topics such as how working for the Trump administration has impacted their lives or what the most important thing was that they learned about the former president. Sondland in particular was asked whether he stands by a previous disavowal of the president after the events of January 6, 2021.

""No, I don't stand by it, and I'll tell you why,"" Sondland began. ""I've now lived four years under the Biden-Harris policies and I have to say that those policies are not only becoming an existential threat to our country's way of life, but to our allies as well.""

The host loudly interrupted him and began shouting, ""I'm going to let you finish, but this is so striking. You said it was a 'no for me' after that, after January 6. And here we are right now, And you're saying it's a yes for you?""

""It is a yes, for me. It is an absolute yes for me,"" Sondland said. ""That is how badly the Biden-Harris team have prosecuted their job.""

""I am seeing so many attacks on democracy that eclipse January 6th,"" Sondland replied, encouraging Melber to ask him what those are.

Vice President Kamala Harris is maintaining her lead over former President Trump in Wisconsin despite Trump leading on the key issues, according to a Wednesday poll.

The new poll from Marquette Law School finds Harris leading Trump in a 52%-48% match-up. The poll also found that voters are deeply invested in the election, with 46% of respondents saying they have stopped talking to someone about politics due to the presidential race.

Marquette conducted the survey from Sept. 18-26, polling 882 Wisconsin registered voters and 798 likely voters. The poll advertises a margin of error of 4.4%.

Despite trailing in the polls, Trump leads Harris in the top issues in the race, including border security, the economy, and handling the Israel-Hamas war.

Trump enjoys a sizable 49-37% lead over Harris on immigration. Meanwhile, 50% of Wisconsinites say he will handle the economy better than Harris, with the vice president getting just 42% support. Trump also enjoys a 45%-33% lead when it comes to Israel's conflict in the Middle East. He also has a narrow lead over Harris when it comes to foreign relations more generally.

Another 49% said Harris would be better for ensuring a fair and accurate election, compared to Trump's 39%.

Wisconsin is among a handful of swing states that are likely to determine the outcome of the 2024 presidential election. Other states like Ohio and Pennsylvania are also critical to either a Trump or Harris victory.

This is who gets the blame for the port strike. Hint: It's not labor or management,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/who-gets-blame-port-strike-hint-its-not-labor-management,2024-10-03T11:12:39Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The failed policies of the Biden-Harris administration gave America 40-year-high inflation, labor unrest, and now potentially the costliest strike in American history. By directing its 45,000 members to walk off the job, the International Longshoremen's Association (ILA) union is crippling eastern seaboard ports and costing $5 billion per day.

In October 2021, I warned that the tax-and-spend agenda of the Biden-Harris administration would set an inflationary fire and torch Americans' finances, resulting in labor unrest. By the fall of 2023, we had the largest auto strike in history as the United Auto Workers (UAW) demanded higher wages to counter their losses from inflation.

While the UAW strike was disruptive to the auto industry, it didn't cause severe economic harm or noticeably impact the consumer. The ILA walk-off is an order of magnitude worse, with the potential for severe disruptions to the economy if it lasts more than just a few days.

BALTIMORE RESTAURANT OWNER SAYS PORT STRIKE IS ALREADY IMPACTING BUSINESS: 'IT REALLY HURTS'

The 36 ports on the Gulf and East coasts handle 55% of all U.S. container traffic and large volumes of exports, including about half of U.S. pork and almost three-quarters of U.S. poultry. About half of all imported fruits and vegetables come through these ports as well. In pharmaceuticals, nine out of 10 imports and seven out of 10 exports are being disrupted.

In short, America's international trade has been severely hamstrung, with consumers and businesses alike about to get hit hard if this labor dispute isn't resolved quickly.

The primary reason for this and other labor unrest over the last three years has been the stratospheric rise in the cost of living, which stems directly from mismanagement by the Biden-Harris administration.

Biden and Harris pushed for runaway federal deficits, fueled with newly created money from the Federal Reserve, destroyed one-fifth of the dollar's value in less than four years. It also caused violent fluctuations in interest rates for everything from mortgages to credit cards.

The result has been a cost-of-living crisis with homeownership affordability plunging to some of the lowest levels on record, while families pay over $300 billion annually just in interest on their outstanding credit card balances. Despite the average American's weekly paycheck being larger than ever before, it buys less than it did just four years ago.

But the plunge in the dollar's purchasing power has hit businesses every bit as hard as consumers, and the Biden-Harris administration's own data proves it. Prices paid by firms and by customers have both increased 20% since January 2021, meaning businesses have merely passed on their cost increases to consumers.

Inflation has massively increased both the cost of living and the cost of doing business, leaving no winners but government. So, while workers are demanding higher wages to combat today's sky-high cost of living, management is desperate to control increases in the cost of doing business -- and that includes labor costs. With such tight margins, any pay increases to workers will result in higher prices for customers.

But that didn't stop the Biden-Harris administration from weighing in and siding with the strikers, citing growth in corporate profits as somehow indicative of management's misbehavior. Corporate profits have increased in the same sense that families' paychecks have increased, but both buy less, on average, than they did four years ago because of the hidden tax of inflation.

Of all the politicians in Washington, D.C., Vice President Kamala Harris owns a disproportionate amount of the blame for inflation over the last four years. Not only was she the biggest cheerleader of the president's big-government agenda, but she also cast the tie-breaking vote on trillions of dollars in inflationary federal deficit spending.

What's particularly worrisome is that Harris hasn't learned from her mistakes. She's doubling down instead, proposing more of the same economic malfeasance that got America into this mess. If public policy continues down the path of the last three-and-a-half years, it will mean more inflation, more labor unrest, and evermore disruptive strikes."

Stop the insanity. Our national debt now tops $35 trillion...,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/stop-insanity-national-debt-now-tops-35-trillion,2024-10-03T10:06:48Z,"They know entitlement programs feature benefit promises far exceeding their tax base, but have done nothing to make them sound. Meanwhile, both parties demand more spending increases -- despite the national debt soaring to $35 trillion, or more than $100,000 for each American, rich and poor alike. Under rosy assumptions, over $20 trillion in debt is projected to be added over the next decade.

Yet despite the foreboding outlook, the major presidential campaigns have no plan to deal with current structural deficits and are outbidding each other to make them worse. For them, the buck stops elsewhere. That may be good short-run politics, but it will only make the inevitable bill bigger and even harder for everyday Americans to pay.

TRUMP, HARRIS BLASTED FOR IGNORING EXPLODING BUDGET DEFICIT, AS ECONOMISTS PLEAD WITH BOTH TO 'GET REAL'

Some argue tax cuts are to blame for the soaring debt. But as data from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office shows, revenue has remained largely stable while spending has grown significantly above prior levels.

Much of the growing debt is baked into the budgetary cake, and experts have long warned about rising costs when the Baby Boom generation retires. But growing Social Security payouts -- long ago engineered to rise faster than prices -- are only part of the problem. Soaring health spending, driven by the same demographic factors and compounded by exploding medical costs, is an even bigger challenge.

America's mountain of debt has been exacerbated by massive so-called emergency spending enacted by both parties. During the pandemic, legislation added over $5 trillion to the debt. Now the nearly $1 trillion in annual interest on the debt exceeds all federal spending on children, and defense spending, too.

Efforts to balance the budget are repeatedly dismissed. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, one of us regularly proposed and passed balanced budgets, only to see hope for such discipline overcome by a desire for ever-greater spending. Important-sounding commissions (including one dubbed the ""supercommittee"") issued detailed recommendations that were mostly ignored.

Experts produced reams of data showing nations deep in debt inevitably reach a financial crisis, even as proponents of modern monetary theory (MMT) argued no amount of spending is too great. According to MMT advocates, the federal government can always print more money.

Americans have already experienced where inaction and that illogic lead. During the pandemic, former Obama Treasury Secretary Larry Summers warned that massive new federal spending would lead to significant inflation, which is exactly what happened, with prices growing 20% since the start of the Biden-Harris administration.

The Federal Reserve's response led to the highest interest rates in two decades, helping drive the monthly mortgage payment for a median-priced home up by over $1,000. Lower-income Americans spend a greater share of their income on housing, so such rising costs are just one example of why they tend to suffer most from inflation and higher interest rates.

Yet despite expressing concerns about inflation, both presidential tickets propose even bigger deficits. In fact, they seem to be in a bidding war to make them worse. Former President Donald Trump proposed exempting tip income from federal taxes, and Vice President Kamala Harris quickly followed suit. Both ignored the 10-year costs of this proposal, which stretch into hundreds of billions of dollars.

Republican vice-presidential nominee JD Vance suggested more than doubling today's $2,000 child tax credit to $5,000, which Harris one-upped by proposing $6,000 payments in a child's first year. Senator Vance hasn't spelled out important details of his plan, but we know most of Harris's plan comprises bigger benefit spending instead of tax relief. Both proposals would cost over $1 trillion during the next decade.

Yet despite the foreboding outlook, the major presidential campaigns have no plan to deal with current structural deficits and are outbidding each other to make them worse. For them, the buck stops elsewhere. That may be good short-run politics, but it will only make the inevitable bill bigger and even harder for everyday Americans to pay.

Neither campaign has a plan to cover the new costs. According to the Penn Wharton Budget Model, counting their economic effects, Trump's plans would increase deficits by $4 trillion versus Harris's $2 trillion. But that assumes Harris doesn't revive the massive spending plans she promoted as one of the most liberal members of the Senate. Her plans included a ruinously expensive Medicare-for-all proposal, along with $2,000-per-month stimulus checks for most Americans costing $21 trillion. If you believe a Harris administration wouldn't revive such proposals during the next economic crisis, you haven't paid attention to recent Washington policymaking.

While both campaigns suggest we can have higher spending and debt alongside lower prices and interest rates, recent experience suggests otherwise. So where does the buck really stop? That is, who will ultimately pay for all this?

The reality is every American will pay, especially those with modest incomes and younger Americans who will suffer the longest from higher taxes, inflation and interest rates. We should demand more from our leaders than promises of bigger giveaways, followed by empty handwringing about the soaring debt and financial pain that inevitably result.

Radio show host Charlamagne Tha God on Monday applauded GOP presidential nominee former President Trump's political ad that highlighted Vice President Kamala Harris' support for taxpayer-funded surgeries for trans prisoners and illegal immigrants.

""That ad [Trump] was running during the football games this weekend claiming the vice president supports funding gender transition surgeries for all prison inmates and migrants in the U.S."" Charlamagne Tha God said on Monday during the radio show he co-hosts called ""The Breakfast Club.""

""That was nuts,"" he added.

YOUNG SWING STATE VOTERS DELIVER ADVICE FOR KAMALA HARRIS

The Trump campaign aired an advertisement over the weekend attacking Harris' past support for government-funded transgender surgeries for prison inmates and migrants held in detention facilities.

The narrator in the campaign ad began by saying, ""Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners.""

""Surgery for prisoners. Every transgender inmate in the prison system will have access,"" Harris said in the ad. The ad shows Harris making those comments during an interview with the National Center for Transgender Equality (NCTE).

The New York Post reported her comments during the NCTE interview were made during the 2020 election cycle as the vice president was doubling down on her position on supporting transgender prisoners.

""It's hard to believe, but it's true. Even the liberal media was shocked Kamala supports tax-payer funded sex changes for prisoners and illegal aliens,"" the narrator in the ad said.

""Kamala's for they/them. President Trump is for you,"" the narrator in the ad said.

The ad concluded with a CNBC headline reading, ""Trump: Lower taxes, bigger paychecks for workers.""

Reacting to the Trump campaign's attack ad, Charlamagne Tha God said that ""that ad was impactful"" and ""effective.""

HARRIS FINALLY ADDS POLICY PAGE TO CAMPAIGN WEBSITE, DEVOTES SEVERAL SECTIONS TO TRUMP

""I don't know if it was the backdrop of football, but when you hear the narrator say Kamala supports taxpayer-funded sex changes for prisoners. That one line ..."" he said. ""I was like, 'Hell no. I don't want my taxpayer dollars going to that.'""

He suggested Harris counter with her own ads during football games.

The vice president's position was recently resurfaced by CNN, which reported on the presidential candidates' responses in a questionnaire.

When asked by the ACLU if ""as President will you use your executive authority to ensure that transgender and nonbinary people who rely on the state for medical care -- including those in prison and immigration detention -- will have access to comprehensive treatment associated with gender transition, including all necessary surgical care?,"" Harris responded in the affirmative.

""I support policies ensuring that federal prisoners and detainees are able to obtain medically necessary care for gender transition, including surgical care, while incarcerated or detained. Transition treatment is a medical necessity, and I will direct all federal agencies responsible for providing essential medical care to deliver transition treatment,"" she wrote in the questionnaire.

The Harris campaign thas said in the past the ACLU questionnaire is ""not what she is proposing or running on.""

Many of Harris' past positions have been put in the spotlight since she ascended to the top of the ticket after President Biden withdrew from the presidential race."

Several political commentators and critics linked Gov. Tim Walz's debate performance to an overall lack of media exposure following his vice presidential debate performance against Sen. JD Vance.

""I think the lack of interviews he has done with national media, with local media, it showed,"" CNN host Dana Bash, who interviewed Walz in August alongside Vice President Kamala Harris for their first interview since Harris became the nominee, said.

Former President Trump and Vance have done at least 61 interviews since the Harris-Walz ticket was formed, compared to 23 non-scripted interviews for the Democratic presidential ticket thus far.

""I think that Walz did seem unsteady,"" ABC News correspondent Jonathan Karl said after the debate. ""And frankly, what I saw is somebody who has not faced questions on a national stage since he became the Democratic nominee. He was simply out of practice. I mean, I don't know why they've done it, but they've kept him out of the limelight. They've kept him away from reporters. They haven't had him do any interviews. And he was clearly unsteady through much of that debate. In contrast, JD Vance was very smooth.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

""Hate to say it but Walz would have benefitted from doing a few Sunday morning shows, as Vance has been,"" Financial Times associate editor Edward Luce said.

Vance has done several appearances on Sunday morning news programs since joining the Trump ticket, including with CNN's Bash, NBC's Kristen Welker, ABC's Jonathan Karl, CBS' Margaret Brennan - one of the debate's moderators - and Fox News' Shannon Bream.

MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell said Wednesday that Walz was ""notably rusty"" due to his lack of media exposure, although she incorrectly said he hadn't done ""any solo interviews"" since he joined the ticket. Walz has done several local TV and radio hits and did interviews on MSNBC and ABC after the Trump-Harris debate last month, but he has done far fewer formal media sit-downs as a running mate than Vance.

Abby Phillip, a host on CNN, said the Minnesota governor was unprepared for Tuesday night's showdown.

""He didn't respond to a lot of the criticisms and attacks that Vance put on the table. He allowed some clear falsehoods to just go completely unanswered,"" Phillip added.

""It took him several sentences to get to the part of his answer, Walz's answer, where he actually responded to that,"" she said. ""I mean, I think there was a clear lack of preparation and execution here on Walz's part.""

GOP flack Matt Gorman said during an appearance on CNN on Wednesday that Vance's prep and interview experience showed through the debate.

""And when you saw with Walz, who hasn't done really many interviews, only really outside of it with Dana Bash, obviously, not having that interview prep, not having the tough questions and the ability to refine your arguments made him a little tougher to kind of pivot out of those trickier subjects,"" Gorman said.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Politico Magazine's analysis of the debate also said Vance and Walz had different preparation strategies.

""The Democrats' campaign chose a different path for Walz, as well as his running mate -- essentially avoiding tough environments. And it showed. At times, Walz seemed unprepared either to defend himself (such as his whereabouts during the Tiananmen Square protests) or to summon the most effective lines of attack against Vance and Trump,"" the analysis read.

Walz joined MSNBC and ABC for brief appearances after his running mate's debate against Donald Trump. He's also done some interviews with smaller, local news outlets.

Former Obama adviser David Axelrod said he was surprised by the lack of media exposure Harris and Walz have had.

""I've been bewildered a little bit by the absence of both the presidential candidate and the vice presidential candidate on television since they became the nominees, because that's how people get to know you. And they haven't really spent a lot of time with either of them before now,"" Axelrod said. ""He was all over before he became the nominee when he was campaigning for vice president.""

Axelrod concluded that Walz put himself at a disadvantage.

""So I also think that it may be a little bit of a problem for Walz having not done this. Sitting with [the media] is good prep for debates. It's good batting practice for these events. Walz has not been doing it. So I do question that,"" he said, ""It's bewildering.""

The Harris-Walz campaign did not respond to a request for comment."
MORNING GLORY: The VP debate is an example of Kamala Harris's horrible judgment when it comes to picking staff,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-vp-debate-example-kamala-harriss-horrible-judgment-when-comes-picking-staff,2024-10-03T09:09:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The debate between the candidates for vice president -- GOP nominee Ohio Senator JD Vance and Minnesota Governor Tim Walz -- was dominated by Vance, and all but a handful of hardened partisan pundits agree on that conclusion.

Walz wobbled and panicked from the first question -- which everyone in the world knew would be about Iran's ballistic missile attack on Israel earlier in the day. Yet Walz still fumbled his response, and it got worse from there until the CBS moderators invoked the unwritten mercy rule for left-wing moderators watching the Democrat melt and tossed Walz some softballs on J6 at the debate's close, by which time the internet was howling and laughing at the Minnesota governor.

There were three important takeaways:

NEW YORK POST CALLS OUT CBS FOR 'RIDICULOUS' FACT-CHECK OF JD VANCE: 'SHAMEFUL MOMENT'

First, Vance is a superb and calm debater and a reassuring figure on the national stage.

Second, Walz is not, and he represents the one big decision Vice President Kamala Harris has had to make since President Joe Biden dropped out. It was a terrible decision. Imagine her Cabinet and White House staff if somehow, she wins.

Third, legacy media is irretrievably broken and cannot be reclaimed from its lurch into rote leftism and extreme partisanship, or even pulled back to a minimum level of seriousness on big occasions.

Do executives at these networks -- ABC, CBS, CNN and NBC -- not see what has happened? Americans don't trust the news divisions at the legacy networks. It's as if those divisions are run by a combination of fresh-from-campus-demonstration interns and hardened partisans from the Obama years.

The CBS debate was not, however, as overtly biased against Vance as ABC's earlier debate was against Trump, but it was still very, very biased against the center-right and conservative audience. Viewers saw the question set veer quickly from a world crisis and the border crisis to get to the left's favorite issue of abortion.

With the world tuning in only hours after Iran launched 180 ballistic missiles at Israel, the moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan did open with an obligatory round of questions on that crisis. But, after 10 minutes, they plowed on to a quick exchange on immigration and the Biden-Harris massive fail on the relief efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene's savaging of North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Virginia in order to get to ... abortion, which had been discussed at length in the ABC debate and about which there are zero mysteries.

Three rounds of questions on abortion, really? And three rounds marked by the rote framing favored by the hard left? Predictable but still shocking.

The debate ended in a morass of childcare questions and then the obligatory ""Wasn't January 6th terrible?"" questions.

What a farce. Not one question on China's vast military build-up and its threat against Taiwan and the Philippines. Not one question on the Chinese Communist Party spies shot through our country, including the office of New York's current and past governor. Not one question on the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Yes, there was a quick dash through the consequences of more than 10 million illegal immigrants flowing across the southern border under the Biden-Harris regime, but also a quick cut-off when Vance began what was an obviously embarrassing factcheck of the CBS factcheck on the ""legal status"" of the Haitians in Springfield, Ohio. ""We have a lot to get to,"" was the trigger for cutting off anything uncomfortable.

Walz was asked about his lying about his trips to China -- sort of. It was left hanging. A knuckleheaded answer for a knuckleheaded team of debate organizers. Chinese President Xi Jinping is a sort of Voldemort for the networks -- never to be named -- perhaps because ABC and CBS all have corporate ties to companies that must do business there?

Look, whatever votes were moved by the debate moved toward the GOP because Vance hammered that the costs of everything from food to gas skyrocketed under Biden-Harris, gave a quick tutorial on why construction costs have soared and thus the price of houses, and repeatedly reminded the audience of Harris's failure in her job as ""border czar,"" while also stressing the need for more domestic energy production. Tim Walz provided comic relief.

The loser wasn't just Walz though. It was also CBS, which joined ABC in a legacy media hall of shame. When we get back to debates in four years, the good news is the ""debate commission"" is already dead and that, by 2028, the idea of the big networks hosting debates unchecked by center-right moderators will be as well. The candidates will call on C-SPAN and find some fair moderators. Siri could have done a better job in our past two debates this year.

What has to be dawning in the C Suites of networks -- if they are at all self-aware -- is that their product and their talent are awful, and their audiences have already left or will soon leave. Tuesday night was just the most recent example of why."
"Kamala Harris, Liz Cheney to stump at birthplace of Republican Party",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/kamala-harris-liz-cheney-stump-birthplace-republican-party,2024-10-03T09:09:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In an effort to win the vote of disgruntled Republicans as she battles former President Trump in the race for the White House, Vice President Kamala Harris is heading to the town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP.

A senior Harris campaign official says that the vice president on Thursday will team up in battleground Wisconsin with former Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, a one-time rising conservative star in the GOP who became her party's most visible anti-Trump leader.

The campaign event will take place in Ripon, Wisconsin, where a one-room schoolhouse was designated a national historic landmark due to its role in holding a series of meetings in 1854 that led to the formation of the Republican Party.

According to her campaign, Harris plans to spotlight the significance of that moment and that place - as she makes another direct appeal to Republican voters frustrated that Trump is their party's presidential nominee - and as she reiterates her pledge to be a president for all Americans.

LIZ CHENEY WEIGHS IN ON WHOM SHE'LL BACK IN THE 2024 ELECTION

Harris is also expected to praise Cheney for her courage and patriotism in putting country over party.

Cheney, at a speaking event in early September at Duke University in swing state North Carolina, announced that she would be voting for Harris in the presidential election.

TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE IN THE 2024 FUNDRAISING FIGHT WITH HARRIS

""As a conservative, as someone who believes in and cares about the Constitution, I have thought deeply about this, and because of the danger that Donald Trump poses, not only am I not voting for Donald Trump, but I will be voting for Kamala Harris.""

Cheney's father, former Vice President Dick Cheney, also endorsed Harris.

The younger Cheney was once rising in the ranks of House Republican leadership

But she was the most high-profile of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach then-president Trump in early 2021 on a charge of inciting the deadly Jan. 6th attack on the Capitol, which was waged by right-wing extremists and other Trump supporters who aimed to disrupt congressional certification of President Biden's Electoral College victory in the 2020 election.

The conservative lawmaker and defense hawk immediately came under verbal attack from Trump and his allies, and was eventually ousted from her number-three House GOP leadership position.

WHITE HOUSE LAWYERS WHO ADVISED REAGAN AND BUSH BACK HARRIS OVER TRUMP

Cheney, who has been vocal in emphasizing the importance of defending the nation's democratic process and of putting country before party, was one of only two Republicans who served on a special select committee organized by House Democrats that investigated the riot at the Capitol.

In 2022, she was ousted in the GOP congressional primary in Wyoming to a candidate that was backed by Trump.

Cheney -- who has argued that the former president is a ""liar,"" a ""con man"" and a potential ""tyrant"" who, if elected again, would ""torch the Constitution"" -- vowed after leaving Congress that ""I will do everything I can to make sure [Trump] is never anywhere near the Oval Office again.""

The Harris campaign says that the vice president, at her event with Cheney, plans to note that while Republicans may not agree with her on every issue, she promises to uphold the Constitution, America's fundamental principles, and the rule of law.

The Cheneys are part of a growing list of prominent Republicans who are supporting Harris.

Two other high-profile anti-Trump Republicans -- former Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and former Georgia Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan - had speaking roles at the Democratic National Convention, which was held six weeks ago in Chicago.

And Harris is backed by more than 200 alumni who served in both Bush administrations or worked for the late Sen. John McCain and Sen. Mitt Romney, the 2008 and 2012 GOP presidential nominee. She's also supported by more than 100 Republican former national security officials and other prominent Republicans.

Ripon is not the only town that claims to be the birthplace of the GOP. Exeter, New Hampshire also has some bragging rites, as it was the site of meetings in 1853 - a year ahead of the Ripon gatherings - by disenchanted political leaders who discussed the formation of a new party of Republicans.

But officials in Ripon said the group in Exeter never actually formed a political organization, or chose officials, as they did in Wisconsin.

Wisconsin is one of seven crucial battleground states with razor-thin margins that decided Biden's 2020 White House victory and are likely to determine if Harris or Trump wins the 2024 presidential election.

With less than five weeks until Election Day in November, Harris and Trump are locked in a margin-of-error race in the key swing states."
Here's how Biden-Harris inflation will make returning to the office wildly more expensive,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/heres-how-biden-harris-inflation-make-returning-office-wildly-more-expensive,2024-10-03T09:09:04Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Amazon just left a package on everyone's doorstep. Its CEO, Andy Jassy, is instructing corporate staffers to spend five days a week in the office beginning Jan. 2. And, it's not a request.

The decision marks a significant shift from Amazon's earlier return-to-work stance, which required corporate workers to be in the office at least three days a week.

Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan are two other large companies that are requiring five days a week in the office. In 2023 alone, 66% of workers say they're in the office five days a week and you can expect more employers across the country to follow suit.

The bad news is that it's going to be wildly more expensive to return to the office post pandemic and here's what you need to plan for in your family budget.

COMPANY PLANS TO TRACK WORKERS' LOCATIONS IN RETURN-TO-OFFICE CRACKDOWN

With 50% of people having not made a repayment to their student loans, credit card debt north of $1.1 trillion, and inflation taking a toll on the budgets of families across America, what can you expect for increased costs when your employer makes you return to work full time?

Workers spend on average $51 per day when they go to the office, which includes:

This doesn't include the crippling cost of child care. Overall, the difference for the average family will be an increase of $612 a month to be back in that cubicle because the boss says it's better for the company culture.

Prices are up substantially over the past four years under President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris, and if you can no longer work from home, here are some of the additional costs you might encounter and ways to offset them.

FORMER AMAZON ENGINEER SAYS COMPANY'S 5-DAY RETURN-TO-WORK POLICY CAUSES EMPLOYEES TO RETHINK JOBS

Fuel or Public Transportation: Daily travel to and from work will add costs for gas, parking, bus or train fares. Make sure to check your company benefit manual to see what deals or reimbursed expenses they have for employees.

Car Maintenance: More driving leads to wear and tear, increasing maintenance costs like oil changes, tires and repairs. This is the perfect time to get your car a complete checkup to make sure you don't run into unforeseen auto expenses.

Lunch: You may need to buy lunch more often, so it's best to meal plan at home as the cost for eating out is rarely less than $10 to $15 a pop.

Snacks/Coffee: Skip the Starbucks line and use as much as you can for free with coffee and snacks at the workplace.

BOSSES ADMIT THAT RETURN-TO-OFFICE MANDATES WERE MEANT TO MAKE STAFF QUIT

Clothing: Depending on the dress code, you might need to invest in new business or professional attire, including shoes. It's a great time to check your company policy.

Dry Cleaning/Laundry: Professional clothes may require special cleaning, which adds an extra cost. Many people haven't had to hit the dry cleaner at all over the past several years.

If your home office setup has been more convenient, you might miss the comforts or setup at home, prompting you to buy extra supplies for your work environment.

Longer Hours: Commuting adds time to your day, which reduces your availability for personal activities, self-care or family time. This is important if you must pick your kids up for day care or even the unexpected number of times you'll have to pick up food on the way home because there isn't time to make dinner.

Gym Memberships or Fitness Programs: If you used to work out at home, returning to an office could lead you to rejoin a gym or fitness class. It's possible your employer will have an on-campus gym or a discounted gym membership for you.

Gadgets and Subscriptions: You might need additional items like portable chargers or subscriptions to music or audio books for commuting entertainment.

"Vance-Walz debate: Parkland parent, school safety expert says one candidate closer to the answer",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/vance-walz-clash-crime-america-school-safety-drawing-strong-reaction,2024-10-03T08:08:30Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A school safety expert told Fox News Digital JD Vance and Tim Walz presented two different visions on how to tackle gun violence in America during this week's vice presidential debate, but only one candidate appears to be ""much closer to the answer"" when it comes to protecting children in classrooms.

Vance argued during the debate that ""we have to increase security in our schools"" by adding more school resource officers and making doors and windows tougher to breach. Trump's running mate added that the U.S. also needs to get to the root causes of a ""mental health crisis"" that isn't the ""whole reason why we have such a bad gun violence problem, but I do think it's a big piece of it.""

Walz responded by saying, ""This idea of stigmatizing mental health -- just because you have a mental health issue doesn't mean you're violent. And I think what we end up doing is we start looking for a scapegoat. Sometimes, it just is the guns. It's just the guns. And there are things that you can do about it.""

Ryan Petty, whose daughter Alaina was one of the 17 killed during the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, in 2018, told Fox News Digital after Tuesday's debate that ""in the 6½ years that I have been working on school safety, what I've learned about how we protect our nation's schools tracks much more closely with the response JD Vance gave than anything Tim Walz said.""

TOP 5 CLASHES BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ DURING DEBATE SHOWDOWN

""I don't even know what he means when he says, 'Sometimes it's the guns,'"" Petty said when asked about Walz's remarks. ""It has nothing to do with guns. The causes of school violence are not the freedoms that we enjoy and the rights that we have under the Second Amendment.

""The problem is much deeper and requires a more comprehensive solution, and JD Vance was much closer to the answer. We got to protect our schools. we got to increase the security there. Having more school resource officers on campus as both a deterrent and a last measure to stop an attack once it starts is exactly the blueprint we followed here to protect Florida schools after Parkland,"" he added.

During the debate, Vance said, ""We have to make the doors lock better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger. And, of course, we've got to increase school resource officers because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience. So, we've got to make our schools safer. And I think we've got to have some commonsense, bipartisan solutions for how to do that.

""Another driver of the gun violence epidemic, especially that affecting our kids -- it doesn't earn as many headlines -- is the terrible gun violence problem in a lot of our big cities. And this is why we have to empower law enforcement to arrest the bad guys, put them away, and take gun offenders off the streets.""

VANCE OOZED CONFIDENCE COMPARED TO JITTERY WALZ DURING DEBATE, BODY LANGUAGE EXPERT SAYS

""We understand that the Second Amendment is there, but our first responsibility is to our kids to figure this out,"" Walz said during the debate.

""In Minnesota, we've enacted enhanced red flag laws, enhanced background checks, and we can start to get data. But here's the problem. If we really want to solve this, we've got folks that won't allow research to be even done on gun violence.

""There are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment and the idea to have some of these weapons out there, it just doesn't make any sense.""

WATCH: WALZ ASKS, DO YOU WANT SCHOOLS HARDENED TO LOOK LIKE A FORT?

""No one's trying to scaremonger and say, 'We're taking your guns.' But I ask all of you out there, do you want your schools hardened to look like a fort?"" Walz added.

Gun control group Everytown for Gun Safety said in a statement after the debate that ""voters heard two starkly different approaches to America's gun violence crisis: JD Vance, who recently called school shootings a 'fact of life' and thinks the solution to the problem is more guns, or Tim Walz, who will work alongside Vice President Harris to make sure our kids come home safe every night.""

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

However, Gun Owners of America, a Second Amendment advocacy group, told Fox News Digital, ""Knives and hammers kill far more often than the guns Kamala and Tim want to ban.""

""Tragedy is never just the fault of an inanimate object. There is always an evil person responsible -- a criminal who would never abide by any gun laws in the first place,"" said its director of federal affairs, Aidan Johnston. ""That's why Gun Owners of America fights to protect our Second Amendment, which empowers law-abiding citizens to fight back and to protect themselves and their loved ones from becoming the next victim.""

Second Amendment Foundation Executive Director Adam Kraut added, ""The Harris-Walz campaign has made clear over and over again their intent to demonize peaceable gun owners and ban and confiscate the most popular guns in America.""

Randy Kozuch, the executive director of the NRA Institute for Legislative Action, also told Fox News Digital in a statement that ""Kamala Harris and Tim Walz make up the most anti-gun presidential ticket in modern history.""

""They hide behind the political prop that they are gun owners in an attempt to promote a radical agenda that will disarm law-abiding Americans,"" he added. ""President Trump and Sen.

"Why Vance easily beat Walz in debate, softening his image in the process",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/why-vance-easily-beat-walz-debate-softening-his-image-process,2024-10-03T07:12:39Z,"A panel of Republicans, Independents, and Democrats react in real-time to claims made by Trump running mate JD Vance in reference to 2020's election results during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Credit: CBS)

And there's no question that JD Vance easily won the vice presidential debate. Tim Walz did better than anticipated - perhaps those expectations were deliberately set low - but despite some strong counterpunching, he frequently stumbled.

Each man had a mission: to defend his running mate and rough up the opposing presidential candidate.

But Vance had a second goal beyond talking up Donald Trump, and that was softening his own image. He made a concerted effort to project empathy, to appear reasonable, to be open to opposing viewpoints.

VOTERS REACT TO GOV TIM WALZ DODGING TIANANMEN SQUARE QUESTION: 'I'M A KNUCKLEHEAD AT TIMES'

There is a caricature of the Ohio senator as a hard-right ideologue with little sympathy for women, as reflected by the famous childless cat ladies comment. But when the subject of abortion came up, he went out of his way to sound sympathetic to the pro-choice side:

""I know a lot of Americans don't agree with everything that I've ever said on this topic. And, you know, I grew up in a working-class family in a neighborhood where I knew a lot of young women who had unplanned pregnancies and decided to terminate those pregnancies because they feel like they didn't have any other options. And, you know, one of them is actually very dear to me. And I know she's watching tonight and I love you.

""And she told me something a couple of years ago that she felt like if she hadn't had that abortion, that it would have destroyed her life because she was in an abusive relationship. And I think that what I take from that as a Republican who proudly wants to protect innocent life in this country, who proudly wants to protect the vulnerable, is that my party? We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us.""

(Vance's website describes him as ""100 percent pro-life."")

Walz countered with specific stories of women who died or whose health was damaged because they lived in states that tightly restrict abortion.

The Minnesota governor hit his talking points, but regularly took a long time to get to his main argument. A question about Kamala Harris' plan to build 3 million housing units produced a detour about how Walz has only bought one home.

WATCH: VOTERS REACT IN REAL TIME TO KEY VANCE-WALZ DEBATE MOMENTS ON IMMIGRATION, DEMOCRACY, ABORTION

Walz often spoke in a clipped shorthand - the ACA, Springfield, Vance creating stories - without explaining, for instance, that he meant the false tale of Haitian migrants eating pets.

The CBS moderators, Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, edged into ABC territory by fact-checking only Vance, despite saying they would try to avoid that. After the senator referred to illegal immigrants in the Ohio town, Brennan said Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected."" That's a point Walz should have made, but didn't.

Many questions were framed from the left. ""Senator Vance,"" said Brennan, ""you oppose most gun legislation that Democrats claim would curb gun violence. You oppose red flag gun laws and legislation to ban certain semi-automatic rifles, including AR-15s.""

Walz's worst moment was one he should have anticipated, a story in the New York Times and elsewhere saying he was not in China for the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests as he had claimed, but got to Hong Kong months later. The governor began with a word-salad answer about growing up in Nebraska before retreating to ""I've not been perfect. And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Pressed again, he said he had misspoken.

Vance's worst moment was about Jan. 6. O'Donnell began, ""You have said you would not have certified the last presidential election and would have asked the states to submit alternative electors that has been called unconstitutional and illegal.""

POLITICS HIJACKS HURRICANE DEVASTATION IN THE SOUTH, BIDEN CALLS TRUMP A LIAR

The senator countered that Trump ""said that on January the 6th, the protesters ought to protest peacefully. And on January the 20th, what happened? Joe Biden became the president. Donald Trump left the White House.""

This time Walz was ready. Trump ""lost this election and he said he did. 140 police officers were beaten at the Capitol that day, some with the American flag. Several later died.""

He turned to Vance and said: ""Did he lose the 2020 election?""

When Vance tried the ""focused on the future"" line again, Walz called that ""a damning non-answer.""

But Vance largely came off as a Bush-style compassionate conservative. He must figure that win or lose, he'll be running for president in 2028 and needed to combat all the negative coverage.

Walz looked like a man who was happy to survive his turn on the national stage. The debate would have looked very different if Harris had picked Josh Shapiro, given that she's tied with Trump in Pennsylvania.

The Harris campaign has bubble-wrapped Tim Walz, not allowing him to do a single solo interview. JD Vance is constantly doing interviews, podcasts and press conferences, the best kind of preparation for a big debate. And that, in the end, may have been the difference."

Meanwhile, Kamala likely regrets picking fellow radical leftist Governor Tim Walz as a running mate. The joy seems most definitely gone after last night's debate. Now we know why the Harris campaign keeps Walz very far away from the media. He doesn't do interviews. We know why -- because he can't.

Walz looked like a deer in headlights, so visibly nervous, he did not have command of the facts. He seemed ill-prepared. He said some pretty weird, bizarre things.

... What? Kamala's right-hand man told 40 million people he has become friends with school shooters, but he wasn't finished. ...

The Democrats wanted an attack dog, and they got a bald basset hound nodding along to everything Vance said. Walz kept agreeing that American workers needed to be protected against cartels and Big Pharma. Good. And instead of appreciating American unity, the media said, ""C'mon, coach, just play the race card.""

Civility was a mistake. That's what the Democrats are saying. Walz was Minnesota nice instead of Minnesota nasty. He must not have gotten the memo. You can't be civil to a dictator.

Biden says he would not back Israeli strike on Iran's nuclear sites,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-says-he-would-not-back-israeli-strike-irans-nuclear-sites,2024-10-03T01:06:58Z,"President Biden said Wednesday that he would not support an attack by Israel on Iranian nuclear sites in retaliation for Iran's firing of 181 missiles at Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

On Wednesday, a day after the massive attack and after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu vowed that Iran would pay for the attack, Biden briefly spoke with reporters before boarding Air Force One.

He said all the leaders on a recent call - France, Canada, Japan, Britain, Italy and Germany - agreed that Israel had the right to ""proportionally"" respond to Iran's military strike.

""We'll be discussing with the Israelis what they're going to do, but all seven of us [G7 nations] agree that they have a right to respond, but they should respond proportionally,"" he said.

ISRAEL URGES UN TO CONDEMN IRAN AFTER LATEST ATTACKS

But when asked whether he would back Israel striking Iranian nuclear sites as it has long threatened, Biden told reporters, ""The answer is no.""

Biden said more sanctions would be imposed on Iran and that he would speak with Netanyahu soon.

""Obviously, Iran is way off course,"" he said.

Iran's missile attack escalated tensions in the region, where the Biden administration has for months led negotiations on a cease-fire in the nearly year-old Israel-Hamas war.

ISRAEL'S 'SWORN ENEMY' HEZBOLLAH TELLS IRAN IT WOULD FIGHT ALONE IF CONFLICT ESCALATES

The recent assault on Israel follows the Biden administration souring on the prospects of an end to the war between Israel and Hamas.

""We aren't any closer to that now than we were even a week ago,"" National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby previously told reporters. He called the prospects of a completed deal ""daunting.""

""No deal is imminent,"" one U.S. official told the Wall Street Journal. ""I'm not sure it ever gets done.""

During Tuesday's vice presidential debate with Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz said Democrat nominee Vice President Harris' ""steady leadership"" in the region is necessary.

""What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership. We've seen a calmness that is able to be able to draw on the coalitions, to bring them together, understanding that our allies matter. When our allies see Donald Trump turn towards Vladimir Putin, turn towards North Korea, when we start to see that type of fickleness around holding the coalitions together, we will stay committed,"" he said.

""And as the vice president said today, we will protect our forces and our allied forces, and there will be consequences,"" he said.

Vance voiced support for GOP nominee former President Trump's ""peace through strength"" policy toward Israel.

""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you need peace through strength,"" Vance said. ""They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

Vance said it is ""up to Israel"" how they choose to respond.

""Now, you asked about a preemptive strike, Margaret, and I want to answer the question,"" he said during the debate. ""Look, it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe,"" he said. ""And we should support our allies wherever they are when they're fighting the bad guys. I think that's the right approach to take with the Israel question.""

Former President Trump blasted the Justice Department Wednesday for having ""disobeyed their own rule in favor of complete and total election interference"" after a key filing from Special Counsel Jack Smith's election case against him was unsealed with just weeks before Americans cast their ballots.

U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia Judge Tanya Chutkan unsealed Smith's 165-page filing Wednesday afternoon. The filing lays out his case and the alleged evidence he intends to use in an eventual trial against Trump.

Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges brought by Smith.

JUDGE UNSEALS KEY FILING IN SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH'S ELECTION CASE

But Trump blasted the Justice Department Wednesday evening.

""For 60 days prior to an election, the Department of Injustice is supposed to do absolutely nothing that would taint or interfere with a case,"" Trump posted in all capital letters to his Truth Social. ""They disobeyed their own rule in favor of complete and total election interference.""

""I did nothing wrong, they did!"" he continued.

DOJ practice during an election year has often been to hold off on major actions in cases that could impact elections during the 60 days leading up to Election Day, an unwritten policy commonly referred to as the ""60-day rule."" The ""rule,"" which is really more of a tradition because it is not an actual rule, has been cited many times in recent years.

""The case is a scam, just like all of the others, including the documents case, which was dismissed!""

Trump was pointing to the other case Smith brought against him related to classified records. The case was tossed out by a federal judge in Florida who ruled that Smith was unlawfully appointed as special counsel.

The former president further blasted Democrats, saying they are ""weaponizing the Justice Department against me because they I know I am WINNING, and they are desperate to prop up their failing candidate, Kamala Harris.""

Trump said the unsealing of the Smith filing, which he called the ""latest 'hit job,'"" happened because his running mate, Sen. JD Vance ""humiliated"" Harris' running mate Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate.

Trump said the Justice Department ""has become nothing more than an extension of Joe's, and now Kamala's, campaign.""

TRUMP TRIAL STEMMING FROM JACK SMITH'S PROBE DELAYED PAST ELECTION DAY

""This is egregious PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT, and should not have been released right before the Election,"" Trump said. ""The Democrat Party is turning America into a Third World Country that tries to censor, harass, and intimidate their Political Opponents. What they have done to our Justice System is one of the Great, All Time, Tragedies.""

The former president added that the Democrat Party ""is guilty of the Worst Election Interference in American History.""

""They are trying to DESTROY OUR DEMOCRACY, allowing millions of people to enter our Country illegally. They are determined to stop us from winning back the White House, sealing the Border, and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN. BUT THEY WILL FAIL, AND WE WILL SAVE OUR NATION!"" Trump posted.

Trump also blasted Smith as ""deranged,"" and said that he, the ""Harris-Biden DOJ, and Washington, D.C. based Radical Left Democrats, are ""HELL BENT on continuing to Weaponize the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power.""

""'TRUMP' is dominating the Election cycle, leading in the Polls, and the Radical Democrats throughout the Deep State are totally 'freaking out.' This entire case is a Partisan, Unconstitutional, Witch Hunt, that should be dismissed, entirely, just like the Florida case was dismissed!"" Trump said.

Trump's comments came in response to Smith's newly-unsealed filing, in which he alleges Trump ""resorted to crimes to try to stay in office"" after losing the 2020 presidential election.

""With private co-conspirators, the defendant launched a series of increasingly desperate plans to overturn the legitimate election results in seven states that he had lost -- Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Nevada, New Mexico, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin,"" Smith wrote.

""His efforts included lying to state officials in order to induce them to ignore true vote counts; manufacturing fraudulent electoral votes in the targeted states; attempting to enlist Vice President Michael R. Pence, in his role as President of the Senate, to obstruct Congress's certification of the election by using the defendant's fraudulent electoral votes; and when all else had failed, on January 6, 2021, directing an angry crowd of supporters to the United States Capitol to obstruct the congressional certification.""

Smith claims that the ""throughline of these efforts was deceit,"" claiming Trump and co-conspirators engaged in a conspiracy to interfere with the federal government function by which the nation collects and counts election results, which is set forth in the Constitution and the Electoral Count Act (ECA); a conspiracy to obstruct the official proceeding in which Congress certifies the legitimate results of the presidential election; and a conspiracy against the rights of millions of Americans to vote and have their votes counted.""

The Supreme Court earlier this year ruled that a president is immune from prosecution for official acts.

TRUMP INDICTED A SECOND TIME IN ELECTION SUBVERSION CASE BROUGHT BY SPECIAL COUNSEL JACK SMITH

Smith was then required to file another indictment against Trump, revising the charges in an effort to navigate the Supreme Court ruling. The new indictment kept the prior criminal charges but narrowed and reframed allegations against Trump after the high court's ruling that gave broad immunity to former presidents.

Trump pleaded not guilty to all charges in the new indictment as well.

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital the release of the ""falsehood-ridden, unconstitutional J6 brief immediately following Tim Walz's disastrous debate performance is another obvious attempt by the Harris-Biden regime to undermine American Democracy and interfere in this election.""

""Deranged Jack Smith and Washington DC Radical Democrats are hell-bent on weaponizing the Justice Department in an attempt to cling to power,"" Cheung said. ""President Trump is dominating, and the Radical Democrats throughout the Deep State are freaking out.

""This entire case is a partisan, Unconstitutional Witch Hunt that should be dismissed entirely, together with ALL of the remaining Democrat hoaxes.""

Last month, Chutkan said she would not hold the trial for Trump on charges stemming from Smith's Jan. 6 investigation until after the 2024 presidential election. She set deadlines for replies and paperwork from federal prosecutors and Trump's legal team for Nov. 7 -- after Election Day."

During fiscal year 2024, which ran from Oct. 1, 2023 through Monday, agents at the U.S. Border Patrol's Swanton Sector along the U.S.-Canadian border caught illegal immigrants from 97 countries, sector Chief Patrol Agent Robert Garcia said.

The 19,222 migrants caught in the Swanton Sector amounted to more than the past 17 years combined, authorities said. In FY 2020, the agents assigned to the sector apprehended 574 illegal immigrants, followed by 365 the next year.

Walz explains 'friends with shooters' gaffe from the VP debate with Vance,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/vance-walz-hit-campaign-trail-battleground-states-hours-after-vp-debate,2024-10-02T22:58:57Z,"YORK, Pa. -- The day after their vice presidential debate in New York City, Republican Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democratic Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota jumped back on the campaign trail with stops in two crucial battleground states.

As he arrived at the airport near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, Wednesday, Walz pointed toward his debate hours earlier with Vance and told reporters, ""New York City was a little crazy last night.""

Most pundits said Vance was the more polished of the two candidates on the vice presidential debate stage Tuesday night, although flash polls indicated debate watchers were mostly divided on which running mate was victorious.

An accidental response by Walz during the debate quickly went viral, as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate mistakenly said he had ""become friends with school shooters.""

2024 CASH DASH: TRUMP UPS HIS ANTE AS HE TRIES TO CLOSE GAP WITH HARRIS

The mishap occurred when Walz was asked about changing positions on banning assault weapons, which he previously opposed but now supports.

""I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it,"" Walz said.

Asked to clarify his debate gaffe, Walz said Wednesday, ""I'm super passionate about this. The question came up about the school shooting. We're talking about everything except school shootings. And I sat as a member of Congress with the Sandy Hook parents, and it was a profound movement.

""David Hogg [a leading gun control activist and school shooting survivor] is a good friend of mine.""

VANCE, WALZ, SPAR OVER ISSUES AT VP DEBATE SHOWDOWN

Walz acknowledged ""I need to be more specific on that. But I am passionate about this.""

Vance, speaking at a rally in Auburn Hills, Michigan, said he didn't hear Walz's comment until he was told about it during a conversation with his running mate, former President Trump, after the debate.

""He said that Tim Walz said that he was friends with school shooters twice,"" Vance said, referencing his conversation with Trump. ""And that's something I actually didn't notice that Tim Walz had said that on the debate stage.

""I said, 'Did he really say that, sir?' And he [Trump] said, 'I'm telling you, man, go and watch the clips.'

HARRIS, BIDEN, HEAD TO STORM-RAVAGED SOUTHEAST IN WAKE OF TRUMP TRIP

""And I said that was probably only the third or fourth-dumbest comment Tim Walz made that night.""

The debate moderators also confronted Walz on his claim to have been in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in Beijing, China.

Walz admitted he traveled to Asia in August 1989, several months after the April 15 massacre, adding he can be ""a knucklehead at times.""

The governor on Wednesday reiterated that he had his ""dates wrong.""

Trump, in an interview Wednesday with Fox News' Brooke Singman, called his running mate's performance ""fantastic"" and that it had ""reconfirmed my choice.""

The former president also argued that Walz had ""embarrassed himself"" during the debate.

Another major moment in the debate came near the end, when Vance wouldn't say that President Biden won the 2020 election over Trump. The former president for four years has repeatedly made unproven claims that the election was rigged and rampant with voter fraud.

Walz, on Wednesday, once again emphasized that ""it is disqualifying to not acknowledge that the 2020 election was won by Joe Biden. It's as simple as that.""

An hour later, speaking to a large crowd at a rally at the York Fairgrounds, Walz charged that ""you can't rewrite history. And trying to mislead us about Donald Trump's record. That's gaslighting.""

Vance, asked about his avoidance of answering the 2020 election question during the debate, reiterated his charge on Wednesday that ""the simple reason"" is that ""the media is obsessed with talking about the election of four years ago. I'm focused on the election of 33 days from now because I want to throw Kamala Harris out of office and get back to commonsense, economic policies.""

Walz arrived at his rally in York to cheers as he pulled into the York Exposition Center riding his campaign bus.

But York is Trump country. The former president won York County by roughly 25 points over Biden in 2020.

Walz's Pennsylvania swing through Harrisburg, York and Reading kicked off what the Harris campaign described as a more aggressive post-debate travel and voter engagement blitz by the governor, with stops in two other battleground states -- Arizona and Nevada -- and a fundraising blitz in Ohio, California and Washington

And the campaign noted that Walz would participate in more media interviews. Vance has done dozens of interviews and repeatedly fielded questions from reporters on the campaign trail since Trump named the senator as his running mate 2½ months ago.

Vance made the first of his two stops in Michigan in Auburn Hills, at Visioneering, an automotive industry tool supplier.

Auburn Hills is in Oakland County, which has swung heavily toward the Democrats in recent election cycles. Biden carried the county by roughly 14 points over Trump four years ago.

Michigan and Pennsylvania are two of seven key battleground states whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 victory over Trump and will likely determine whether Trump or Harris win the 2024 presidential election.

It was ""striking"" to ABC News chief Washington correspondent Jonathan Karl that it took 90 minutes into the vice presidential debate before there was a question on Jan. 6.

Karl, along with ABC News White House correspondent Mary Bruce, discussed the aftermath of the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate between Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on ""Good Morning America"" on Wednesday. Bruce reported the Harris campaign was already attempting to capitalize on the candidates' comments regarding the Jan. 6 Capitol protests and the 2020 election.

""Yeah, 90 minutes in, they feel that that was the moment that defined this debate. That exchange on January 6, defending the Constitution, In fact, this morning they are rushing to get out an ad on that exchange what Walz called Vance's 'damning non-answer,'"" Bruce said.

Karl expressed his frustration that it took so long to get to the question, considering ""this is not a normal election.""

""What was striking to me is that you had 90 minutes into this debate before you hit the fact that this is not a normal election, that Donald Trump tried to overturn the last election. And in that last answer, what you saw is JD Vance saying he wouldn't do what Mike Pence did. He wouldn't stand up to Donald Trump if he tried to do it again. He would help him, and he would have helped him last time overturn an American democratic election,"" Karl said.

He added, ""You finally got to that at the end. But, for the first 90 minutes or so, this looked like it is simply a campaign about policy differences. And it's really not, George. It is more than that.""

""It is. It is absolutely stunning, the only time in American history it has ever happened,"" host George Stephanopoulos responded.

During the debate, Walz confronted Vance over his stance on the results of the 2020 election.

""This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen, and it manifested itself because of Donald Trump's inability to say - he is still saying he didn't lose the election,"" Walz said. ""Did he lose the 2020 election?""

""Tim, I'm focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation?"" Vance responded.

Walz called it a ""damning non-answer.""

According to the Fox News Debate Dial, the dials for independents and Democratic voters dropped significantly at Vance's answer on whether former President Trump lost the 2020 election, with independents seeing the sharpest decline.

However, many viewers and even New York Times columnists have said they believed Vance ultimately won the debate Tuesday night."

Tim Walz and Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio failed to demonstrate differences to the American electorate.

MSNBC host Symone Sanders-Townsend criticized Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., for being too agreeable with his opponent Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday.

The showdown between Walz and Vance was noticeably cordial throughout the evening, despite their ideological differeances. Sanders-Townsend, who served as chief spokesperson and senior adviser for Vice President Kamala Harris before joining MSNBC in 2022, suggested that if Walz and Vance have so much in common, it's a mystery why voters wouldn't support the Republican ticket.

""Debates are about performance, and they are about policy. And why this debate was very important is that there are many Americans out there, not just moderate Republicans, there are base Democratic voters that are saying they want to and need to hear more. Now, I think it is very fair for people to want to criticize those base Democratic voters who say, 'Well, what more do you need?' You can do that. But that is their lived reality, and so if you are trying to win their votes, you have to meet them where they are,"" she said. ""There were so many niceties on that debate stage tonight, I am just kind of like, well, if you agree so much with J.D. Vance, why should they vote for you?""

She went on to argue that both candidates were strategically putting on a dishonest performance.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""I fully believe that Gov. Walz went out there tonight and did what was practiced in debate prep, did what the strategy was that the team put together. That was not the Gov.

I mean, goodness! J.D. Vance was on that stage, he was sorry about Amber Thurman, he was -- he was sorry about -- he was sorry about a lot of stuff. He -- 'We get things wrong.' But do you agree with the policy?""

Sanders-Townsend, who also hosts a weekend show on MSNBC, also took aim at the CBS moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margret Brennan.

""That's not the Margaret and Norah that I know! Margaret don't do that on Sunday morning,"" she said.

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate.

Former President Trump's campaign said on Wednesday that they hauled in over $160 million in fundraising in September, in figures shared with Fox News.

The haul by the former president's campaign is up from the roughly $130 million that Trump's various fundraising committees brought in during the month of August.

Trump faces a large fundraising deficit to Vice President Kamala Harris, with just under five weeks to go until Election Day in November.

FORMER PRESIDENT TRUMP AIMS TO FLIP THE SCRIPT ON THE CASH DASH

The Harris campaign announced last month that it raked in a staggering $361 million in August, nearly triple Trump's fundraising.

The Harris campaign has yet to report its September fundraising figures.

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS SHOW IN THE 2024 ELECTION

The Trump campaign, in revealing its fundraising numbers, said that it had $283.1 million cash-on-hand as of the end of September. That's down slightly from the $295 million it had in its coffers a month earlier.

The Harris campaign, in its announcement last month, reported $404 million cash-on-hand.

Trump's team, in releasing their latest figures, showcased their small-dollar grassroots fundraising, saying the average donation they received was $60 and that 96% of their contributions were less than $200.

The Biden campaign and the Democratic National Committee enjoyed a fundraising lead over Trump and the Republican National Committee earlier this year. But Trump and the RNC topped Biden and the DNC by $331 million to $264 million during the second quarter of 2024 fundraising.

Biden enjoyed a brief fundraising surge after his disastrous performance in his late June debate with Trump as donors briefly shelled out big bucks in a sign of support for the 81-year-old president.

But Biden's halting and shaky debate delivery also instantly fueled questions about his physical and mental ability to serve another four years in the White House and spurred a rising chorus of calls from within his own party for the president to end his bid for a second term. The brief surge in fundraising didn't last and, by early July, began to significantly slow down.

Biden bowed out of the 2024 race July 21, and the party quickly consolidated around Harris, who instantly saw her fundraising soar, spurred by small-dollar donations.

When asked about the fundraising deficit, Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley told Fox News Digital last month that ""the Democrats have a ton of money. The Democrats always have a ton of money.""

However, he emphasized that ""we absolutely have the resources that we need to get our message out to all the voters that we're talking to and feel very comfortable that we're going to be able to see this campaign through, and we're going to win on November 5.""

Fundraising, along with polling, is a key metric in campaign politics and a measure of a candidate's popularity and their campaign's strength. The money raised can be used - among other things - to hire staff, expand grassroots outreach and get-out-the-vote efforts, pay to produce and run ads on TV, radio, digital and mailers, and for candidate travel."
NEWT GINGRICH: At VP debate a star is born and Trump is vindicated,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/newt-gingrich-vp-debate-star-born-trump-vindicated,2024-10-02T18:42:02Z,"'Fox News @ Night' panelists Michael LaRosa, Erin Perrine, Lauren Wright, Jennifer Sey, Julie Hamill and Elisha Krauss share their takeaways from the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

The vice presidential debate on Tuesday night was staggeringly one-sided.

Sen. JD Vance was poised, calm, friendly, likable, and in control of the facts and himself.

By contrast, Gov. Tim Walz began the debate so nervous it was painful to watch. Then he made a series of mistakes which were cumulatively disqualifying. It was hard to believe he is on a national ticket.

VANCE VS. WALZ DEBATE: TOP TAKEAWAYS FROM VP CANDIDATES' FACE-OFF

Callista and I went to bed on Tuesday night convinced that Sen. Vance had won a substantial triumph. In that victory, he also vindicated President Donald J. Trump's gamble in selecting a running mate so early in his career. At 40, with only two years in the U.S. Senate, Vance is only a few months older than Richard Nixon when President Dwight Eisenhower picked him to be the Republican vice presidential nominee in 1952. Nixon would remain a major part of the political scene for 42 years. That would give Sen. Vance a potential role in American government and politics until 2066.

When I got up on Wednesday morning, virtually all the commentaries validated the sense that the debate was something extraordinary.

This new reality was best summarized by Mark Halperin in the Wide World of News newsletter:

""1. One can pretend, as most of the Dominant Media does, that Tim Walz was not 'clobbered' by JD Vance, but, as honest Joe Klein (fully credentialed as second-to-none in contempt for Donald Trump and Vance) told the world, Walz was indeed clobbered, so badly that it 'wasn't as bad as Biden's debilitated performance in June, but it was close.' Remember: Biden's perf[romance] was so bad it ended his candidacy and career.""

Pollster Frank Luntz tweeted that his focus group voted 12 to 2 that Vance had won.

Glenn Greenwald posted on X: ""The most bizarre part of that debate was how Tim Walz repeatedly and flagrantly undercut Dems' core attack on Trump/Vance: that they're ""weird,"" freakish dangers wildly out of the mainstream.

""Everything Walz said treated Vance as a totally normal, reasonable, likable colleague.""

New York Times columnist Ross Douthat posted: ""I would rate that the most successful Republican debate performance of this century, eclipsing Romney in the first debate with Obama in 2012.""

Fox News senior political analyst Brit Hume had no regard for the performances of moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, saying they were ""obnoxious"" and made the debate a three-on-one proposition against Vance.

These were just a few. The Trump-Vance campaign collected no fewer than 22 journalists and public figures who agreed that Vance trounced Walz.

Donald Trump Jr. was the third big winner in this debate. He had strongly backed Sen. Vance as a running mate and worked to get his father to pick him. That choice certainly seemed to work out brilliantly.

As Caitlin Doornbos in the NY Post wrote, Gov. Walz's problems started at the beginning.

""Tim Walz got one chance to make a first impression at Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, and blew it before his opponent, JD Vance, even got the chance to speak.""

His nerves clearly kept him from meeting the challenge.

Finally, Gov. Walz said a couple of things that were just weird.

In a clear moment of confusion, he said he'd become ""friends with school shooters."" When asked why he had lied about being at Tiananmen Square during the 1989 suppression and killing of students demonstrating for democracy, Walz ultimately called himself a ""knucklehead"" for simply saying something that was false.

Being the ""knucklehead candidate"" is not a good way to campaign for the last five weeks before the election.

After last night, Sen. Vance is a huge national figure among Republicans and conservatives. He will have much more impact campaigning than he did before the debate.

After Tuesday night, Gov. Walz will be seen by most Americans as someone who is clearly not ready to be president or vice president.

Vice President Kamala Harris's comment that she was exhausted and sleepless when she picked him will now look like a first step toward minimizing his role - and her ability to make decisions under pressure.

Harris dodges answering whether athletes should stand during national anthem in unearthed interview,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/harris-dodges-answering-whether-athletes-should-stand-during-national-anthem-unearthed-interview,2024-10-02T18:10:54Z,"FOX News contributor Joe Concha responds to a Harvard board's unanimous vote to keep President Claudine Gay following her antisemitism testimony and controversy over LeBron James sitting during the national anthem to avoid being a 'distraction.'

Vice President Kamala Harris sidestepped answering directly whether she believes athletes should stand for the national anthem during an unearthed 2016 interview, instead delivering a rambling response that is currently receiving backlash on social media ahead of the general election.

While serving as attorney general of California, Harris joined PBS reporter David Nazar to discuss her Senate run and campaign platforms on issues such as criminal justice reform, the Black Lives Matter movement and the economy in California. During the discussion, Nazar pressed Harris if she believes athletes should stand for the national anthem.

""Should folks stand for the national anthem?"" Nazar asked in the interview, which was published in October 2016.

Harris' response focused on Americans' rights protected in the Constitution, and did not include a direct answer on whether athletes should stand for ""The Star-Spangled Banner.""

""We are all, and should be, treated as equals. We articulated those principles in our Constitution. And part of what we decided is what makes a fair and just and noble society in a democracy, a true democracy, is freedom of religion, freedom, right, of association, freedom to organize, First Amendment,"" she responded.

""So, that is part of who we are as a country, and I will defend it to the core, which is that we give people, certain choices in this country.""

PRO ATHLETES WHO STOOD FOR NATIONAL ANTHEM AMID FEVER PITCH TO SUPPORT SOCIAL JUSTICE INITIATIVES

In 2016, San Francisco 49ers quarterback Colin Kaepernick became the first NFL player to kneel during the national anthem to protest police brutality and racism. The form of protest, which began in Harris' backyard of San Francisco, soon spread to other sports leagues and athletes.

Athletes such as Megan Rapinoe knelt for the anthem ahead of soccer games in 2016, while Bruce Maxwell became the first Major League Baseball athlete to kneel during the national anthem in 2017.

TRUMP TAKES NFL, NBA TO TASK ABOUT KNEELING DURING NATIONAL ANTHEM

The form of protest hit a fever pitch in 2020 following the death of George Floyd in Minneapolis during an interaction with police. Scores of athletes knelt ahead of games that year during the anthem, while the NBA unveiled a court painted with ""Black Lives Matter"" amid social justice protests that year, and some Olympians took a knee during the Tokyo Games.

The protests were slammed by conservatives in the U.S., including former President Trump, who ripped the athletes for politicizing games.

TRUMP GIVES TWO-WORD RESPONSE IN REACTION TO NFL PLAYERS KNEELING BEFORE THANKSGIVING DAY GAME

""I think it's been horrible for basketball. Look at the basketball ratings. They're down to very low numbers. People are angry about it. They don't realize.... They have enough politics with guys like me. They don't need more as they're driving down... going up for the shot. They don't need it. There's a nastiness about the NBA about the way it was done too. So I think the NBA is in trouble. It's in big trouble. Bigger trouble than they understand,"" Trump said in 2020.

Trump also posted to X, then Twitter, that kneeling for the national anthem is ""a sign of great disrespect for our Country and our Flag,"" saying the ""game is over"" for him when he spots an athlete kneeling.

Harris' unearthed interview was criticized on social media this week, with OutKick founder Clay Travis saying Harris delivered a ""long jumble of nothingness.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on the 2016 interview, but did not immediately receive a response.

Harris defended athletes who knelt during the anthem in 2017, after she was elected senator, saying they should not be ""threatened or bullied"" for the protest.

""Let's speak the truth that when Americans demand recognition that their lives matter, or kneel to call attention to injustice, that that is an expression of free speech, protected by our Constitution, and they should not be threatened or bullied,"" Harris said during an event in Atlanta, the Hill reported at the time.

Voters in swing state Michigan praised Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance for his debate performance against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

""I thought it went really well. I thought [Vance] did really well. He held his own. He told the truth,"" a voter wearing a MAGA hat told ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Lawrence Jones, Wednesday.

TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM ONLY VP DEBATE BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ BEFORE ELECTION

Jones visited Steak 'N Egger restaurant in Muskegon after Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, where many watchers gave Vance the advantage over Walz.

""[Walz] did terrible in many respects, but he is just honest and truthful also. He doesn't know what he's talking about and he kind of admitted it,"" one voter said.

Another voter said Walz appeared ""too nervous.""

""[Walz is] phony. He's too plastic. He doesn't know the topics like Vance.""

A few voters at the diner, however, defended Walz's performance and argued the Democrat won the pair's only debate showdown.

""[Walz is] very articulate. He knows his facts,"" one woman said. ""JD Vance totally switched the script last night. He told untruths. He flipped the switch. He lied throughout the whole entire debate last night. What he said was untrue - his stance on abortion, his stance on housing, his stance on the finance - everything was was not true.""

The woman conceded that Vance's ""experience on public stages"" may have impacted the number of voters and pundits giving the senator the win.

TOP 5 CLASHES BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ DURING DEBATE SHOWDOWN: 'YOUR MICS ARE CUT'

Tuesday's debate covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before Election Day.

One Michigan voter said she is voting for Vice President Kamala Harris because she likes the idea that ""we get to vote every four years instead of, 'if you vote me in, you won't ever have to vote again.'""

Another woman voiced her support for Trump ""because he's for America, and he's for me. And he's for the unborn child.""

""If you are for the person who cannot defend themselves, then you are for the rest of us,"" she said. ""And if you don't care about those that are not able to defend themselves, you certainly aren't going to be in charge of us or care for us.""

Where is Joe Biden?",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-southeast-underwater-middle-east-fire-ports-closed-where-joe-biden,2024-10-02T16:31:08Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

""It's raining, it's pouring, the old man is snoring,"" used to just be a nursery rhyme. Today it is the frightening reality of our lack of leadership in the White House, as President Joe Biden old-man shuffles his way to the end of his misbegotten and only term as president.

On Wednesday, October 2, Biden is finally set to visit the site of devastation in North Carolina wrought by Hurricane Helene, even if he has to skip a nap or two. This comes amid real concerns that the federal response is lackluster and insufficient.

Then there is the ongoing war in the Middle East, which on Tuesday, October 1, saw Iran launch the largest ballistic missile attack in human history against Israel. This, despite the fact that, on several occasions when Biden seemed half cogent, he warned the mullahs by sternly saying, ""Don't""

BIDEN HAS 'PRIVATELY COMPLAINED' ABOUT HOW QUICKLY DEMOCRATS HAVE MOVED ON FROM HIM: REPORT

Well, they did anyway. And while, thankfully, owing to the military might of Israel and America, the Iranian onslaught carried all the devastation of a Nerf gun fight, it was still a slap in the face of our feckless president.

As if those two disasters weren't enough, this same week has also seen the International Longshoremen's Association go on strike from Maine to Texas, shutting down the supply line for everything from batteries to bananas, despite Biden's claim that a deal would be worked out.

Of all these crises, these latter may be the most devastating to Scranton Joe because it is something that, in his prime, Biden would have been able to clean up faster than a Swiffer.

There are only a handful of people alive who have the deep, long-lasting relationship and trust with organized labor that Biden has developed over the last 50 years. At one time, he was absolutely the man for this job. Today, he is simply absent.

This is why president by committee doesn't work. Longshoremen might have trusted Biden; they do not trust the faceless deep state blob that rules us today.

Americans know they currently have no functioning president, and have for some time. In August, Sam, a restaurateur in San Francisco told me, ""I don't know who's running the country, but it's not him."" In Virginia, Sarah, a Democrat, simply said, ""It's sad, but he's just gone.""

To be blunt, this situation is incredibly dangerous. We heard almost nothing from our president as Iran attempted to start World War III. Instead, we saw National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan at the White House podium, the very man whose incompetence helped light the match of this conflagration.

You remember Sullivan, he was the guy who said days before the barbaric Hamas attack on Israel on October 7, 2023, that the Middle East was quieter than it had been in two decades.

Amazingly, Sullivan, who shouldn't even be managing a Dairy Queen, much less American foreign policy, still has his job. And why? Because he doesn't have a boss. Nobody in the administration does. I'm not convinced Biden can recognize Jake Sullivan, much less fire him.

It really is a fine mess the Democrats have gotten us into. The president is incapable of fulfilling his duties, and his vice president is now running for president. And by running, I mean as far away from Grandpa Joe as she can get.

In a sane world, our senile commander in chief would step down, and Vice President Kamala Harris would take the reins. But that can't happen because, if it did, she would suddenly be responsible for the haywire state of world and domestic affairs and might actually have to do a serious interview or two.

For all intents and purposes, the United States of America has no president. But what we do have is a host of crisis-level situations at home and abroad that are not being competently addressed.

There are only a handful of people alive who have the deep, long-lasting relationship and trust with organized labor that Biden has developed over the last 50 years. At one time, he was absolutely the man for this job. Today, he is simply absent.

For four more months, until either former President Donald Trump or Kamala Harris is sworn in as president next year, our ship of state has no captain. And rudderless, it is at significant risk of capsizing.

Joe Biden has gone to bed, he's wrong in the head, and he doesn't start work until 10 in the morning. Our allies know it. Far worse, our foes know it, and as usual, it is the American people who are suffering.

"WATCH: Voters react in real time to key Vance-Walz debate moments on immigration, democracy, abortion",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/watch-voters-react-real-time-key-vance-walz-debate-moments-immigration-democracy-abortion,2024-10-02T16:27:52Z,"Fox News Digital ranks the top five memorable moments from the 2024 Vice Presidential Debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz.

A Fox News Digital focus group of Republicans, Democrats and independents reacted to key moments from the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate between Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night, offering real-time responses to the candidates' statements.

In a focus group hosted by Lee Carter, participants across the political spectrum used dials showing their favorable, unfavorable or neutral responses to Vance and Walz. Their reactions gave insights into how the voters who will help decide the election felt about the demeanor, character and policies of the two men, one of whom will be the next vice president.

Here are some of the most significant voter reactions from Tuesday night's focus group.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters.

Vance received mixed responses when he said, ""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding... we have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around a neutral response to Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

Democrats and independents reacted moderately-to-highly favorable to Walz's rejoinder on the migrant crisis and his criticism of the Trump administration.

Walz touted the bipartisan immigration bill that Trump pushed to kill earlier this year and defended Kamala Harris' record in California on the issue. Republicans were unfavorable to Walz but independents and Democrats gave him high marks throughout his answer.

""Pass the bill, she'll sign it,"" Walz said.

Republican, Democrat and independent voters reacted differently when Vance stated that he and Trump support ""clean air, clean water"" when climate change was brought up at the debate.

""Look, a lot of people are justifiably worried about all these crazy weather patterns. I think it's important for us, first of all, to say, Donald Trump and I support clean air, clean water. We want the environment to be cleaner and safer,"" Vance said.

The Fox News Debate Dial showed support among independents and Democrats dipping downward when Vance made that statement. Support among Republicans remained fairly consistent.

But support among independent viewers began to rise again when Vance referenced how Democrats bring up carbon emissions when discussing climate change.

""This idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,"" Vance said. ""Well, if you believe that, what would you -- would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to restore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.""

One of Walz's most difficult moments at the debate received poor to middling reviews across the board from the focus group.

Moderators confronted Walz on his prior claim that he was present at the Tiananmen Square protests in Hong Kong in 1989, when he didn't travel to Asia until later that year. Walz gave a meandering answer that showed sub-par responses from Democrats, Republicans and independents almost throughout his entire comment, which didn't directly address the discrepancy.

At one point, he admitted he could be a ""knucklehead."" He eventually admitted he'd misspoke.

Walz's support among Republicans dipped to its lowest point - under 10% - when he said former President Donald Trump would have benefited from participating in one of his China trips, arguing Trump would never have befriended Chinese President Xi Jinping.

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming public resources in Springfield, Ohio.

Independent and Republican voters disapproved of the interjection, but independent voters dipped significantly when Vance began explaining his stance.

Independents were mixed, while Republicans were highly favorable of Vance saying he was ""wrong"" about Trump in the past when confronted about his past criticism of his running mate.

""Sometimes, of course, I've disagreed with the president, but I've also been extremely open about the fact that I was wrong about Donald Trump. I was wrong, first of all, because I believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record,"" Vance said.

When Walz was asked whether he supports abortion up until the ninth month as Minnesota is one of the least restrictive states for abortion, he responded, ""That's not what the bill says.""

While Republican voters dipped significantly as Walz spoke, independent and Democratic voters stayed mostly in the approval zone.

""What we did is restore Roe v. Wade, we made sure that we put women in charge of their health care,"" Walz said.

Independents dipped slightly in approval while Democratic voters shot up during his statement. The two eventually evened out and stayed in the approval zone.

""This is a basic human right,"" he later said.

The independent voters stayed slightly under the Democratic approval line, as Republicans significantly disapproved.

Vance received a positive reaction across the board from Democrats, Republicans and Independents when he told Walz he was sorry his son was once a witness to a shooting.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

Independents gave Vance an immediate low rating when he said he was focused on the future after Walz asked him if Trump lost the 2020 election.

Republicans on the Fox News Debate Dial had been unimpressed with Walz's line of questioning and the dial went down, with the approval staying generally the same with Vance's answers, but the dials for independents and Democrats took a sharp dive as Vance brushed off the question. It dove the sharpest among independents.

Liberal media pundits repeatedly played and discussed the clip in the debate's aftermath, saying it was one of Walz's strongest moments in a night that Vance otherwise controlled.

MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace claimed on Tuesday that the ""worst moment"" for Sen. JD Vance in the vice presidential debate was when he attempted to ""mansplain"" over muted mics, and argued the moment was specifically bad for female voters.

""I actually think if you're a woman, that might be the worst moment JD Vance had, because he was going to mansplain right over that mute button.

Vance called out the debate moderators, CBS' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, during the debate for fact-checking him during the debate after he brought up migrants in Springfield, Ohio. The moderators eventually muted his microphone as he was trying to talk.

She compared the moment to the debate Vice President Kamala Harris had with former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020, when Harris said, ""I'm speaking.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""There was this real belief that what he had to say was more important than the debate rules and the moderators,"" she said.

Wallace also praised the debate moderators for using ""their mic muting power.""

The Trump campaign ripped Wallace in a statement to Fox News Digital, calling her an ""unhinged idiot who beclowned herself by acting like a crazy person."" ""She's a joke and nobody takes her seriously,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said to Fox Digital.

Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance pushed back. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Walz attempted to argue with him.

The media criticized Walz following the debate for what they deemed was a lack of preparation.

Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance on Tuesday said he wanted to focus on the future when asked about former President Trump's denials that he lost the 2020 election - an answer that drew negative reactions from some voters, according to the Fox News Debate Dial.

Vance was asked by Democratic candidate Gov. Tim Walz whether Trump lost the 2020 election, something that Trump has repeatedly denied, and which led to the protests on Jan 6, 2021.

""This was a threat to our democracy in a way that we had not seen, and it manifested itself because of Donald Trump's inability to say - he is still saying he didn't lose the election,"" Walz said. ""Did he lose the 2020 election?""

VOTERS REACT TO JD VANCE CLAIMING HE AND DONALD TRUMP SUPPORT 'CLEAR AIR, CLEAN WATER'

Vance attempted to put the ball back in Walz's court.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future. Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 COVID situation?"" he responded.

Walz called it a ""damning non-answer.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance said, going on to say that there were ""problems"" in 2020.

Republicans on the Fox News Debate Dial had been unimpressed with Walz's line of questioning and the dial went down, with the approval staying generally the same with Vance's answers, but the dials for independents and Democrats took a sharp dive as Vance brushed off the question.

""But you guys attack us for not believing in democracy,"" Vance then said. ""The most sacred right under the United States democracy is the First Amendment. You yourself have said there's no First Amendment right to misinformation. Kamala Harris wants to use the power of government and Big Tech to silence people from speaking their minds.

""I would like Democrats and Republicans to both reject censorship. Let's persuade one another. Let's argue about ideas, and then let's come together.""

Tim Walz ""embarrassed himself"" during Tuesday night's vice presidential debate, while Sen. JD Vance's steady presentation ""reconfirmed"" his choice to make the senator from Ohio his running mate.

Trump spoke exclusively with Fox News Digital on Wednesday morning, hours after Vance, R-Ohio, and Walz faced off in the CBS News vice presidential debate in New York City. The two sparred on issues like foreign policy, border security, abortion and climate change, while introducing themselves and their records to the American people.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

""JD was fantastic last night -- it just reconfirmed my choice,"" Trump told Fox News Digital. ""There was a brilliance to what he did.""

""On the other hand, Tim Walz proved to be a man that doesn't have it in any way shape or form for the office that he is seeking, though I would put him a large number of steps above Kamala,"" Trump said.

The former president and Republican presidential nominee said Walz ""embarrassed himself and the Democrat Party last night but was made to look even worse by JD's brilliant performance.""

""This is what the country needs; smart people, not people that can't put two sentences together,"" Trump said. ""We have to take our country back.""

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs. Tuesday began with nearly 50,000 unionized dockworkers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a rough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago. A nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States' global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said, ""It is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe. And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys.""

Walz fired back. He slammed the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" adding Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last 3½ years? And the answer is, your running mate, not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, saying he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves, ""When was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border, a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no, told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking. Some of them, hopefully, are at homes with their families.

""Some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules. The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris' wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, 'You know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies.' I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue, where they, frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us, as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family.

Tim Walz's remarks on the immigration and fentanyl crisis during the vice presidential debate.

Gov. Tim Walz received steady support from independent and Democratic debate watchers during his remarks on immigration, except when he bashed former President Trump on the issue.

A focus group reacted live to the vice presidential debate on Tuesday, pitting Democratic nominee Walz against Republican Sen. JD Vance.

""We all want to solve this, most of us want to solve this,"" Walz said as he spoke of the immigration crisis during the debate.

Democratic and independent support for Walz was high as he talked about the issue of the fentanyl and opioid crisis.

Support from both Democrats and independents spiked when Walz said Vice President Kamala Harris was ""the only person in this race who prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drug interventions.""

Support from independent and Democratic respondents remained steady for the majority of his remarks on the issue of immigration.

However, independent support for Walz dropped when he suggested that ""Donald Trump said no"" to border legislation, ""because it gives him a campaign issue.""

""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?"" Walz said, prompting a significant decline in support from independent viewers.

""Donald Trump had four years. He had four years to do this. And he promised you, America, how easy it would be. I'll build you a big beautiful wall, and Mexico will pay for it. Less than 2% of that wall got built and Mexico didn't pay a dime,"" Walz said, to which Democratic viewer support began to rise.

Will Netanyahu 'take the fight directly to Iran' after massive missile strike across Israel?,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/netanyahu-weighs-israeli-response-irans-massive-missile-attack-amid-fears-all-out-war,2024-10-02T15:11:46Z,"JERUSALEM -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met with the heads of the country's security establishment on Wednesday following Iran's firing of 181 missiles into Israel amid fears that a lethal regional war is around the corner.

Fox News Digital spoke to military and Iran experts about the growing chance of a wider confrontation between the Jewish state and the clerical regime in Tehran breaking out.

""After the Iranian missile attack against Israel there is no questioning anymore the basic understanding that Iran is the greatest generator of terror and death in the Middle East. Until now, Israel has been playing a whack-a-mole game with Iran's proxies - fighting Hamas, Hezbollah, the Houthis and others,"" Yaakov Katz, the author of ""Shadow Strike: Inside Israel's Secret Mission to Eliminate Syrian Nuclear Power,"" told Fox News Digital.

ISRAELI DEFENSE MINISTER TELLS US ONLY 'MILITARY ACTION' CAN RETURN PEOPLE TO HOMES AMID HEZBOLLAH THREAT

Katz, who is a senior fellow at the global think tank Jewish People Policy Institute (JPPI), added, ""With Iran again attacking Israel directly, the time has come to take the fight directly to Iran. The ayatollahs there need to be made to pay a price.""

The headline by military analyst Amos Harel in the left-wing Haaretz paper read on Wednesday: ""After an unprecedented Iranian attack, we are in a regional war.""

The Islamic republic has been recognized as the center of Mideast volatility, terrorism and jingoism for decades. In 2010, Saudi Arabian King Abdullah told the United States to ""cut off the head of the snake"" by launching military strikes to eradicate Iran's reported nuclear weapons facilities.

Iran's strikes on Israel forced nearly 10 million people to find safety in bomb shelters on Tuesday. The barrage of aerial warfare was the first time in Israeli history that the country's densely populated cities - Tel Aviv and Jerusalem - in the center of the biblical nation, faced such devastating attacks. The Israelis did not panic and stayed relatively calm under the pressure of the largely surprise attack.

The only fatality from the Iranian barrage was the murder of a Palestinian man in the West Bank (known in Israel by its biblical regional name of Judea and Samaria).

""Tonight Iran attempted to kill thousands of Israeli men, women and children but thanks to our miraculous defense system Iran failed miserably. Tehran is hurting after seeing its proxies in Gaza, Lebanon and Yemen get crushed by Israel. Tehran made a huge mistake tonight and will pay a heavy price at the time and place of our choosing,"" Lt. Col. Yoni Chetboun, former deputy speaker of the Knesset and an IDF special forces operator in reserves, told Fox News Digital.

IRAN'S 'NUCLEAR ENERGY MOUNTAIN' IS 'FULLY SAFE' AFTER ISRAELI STRIKE: STATE MEDIA

Chetboun was a decorated special forces operator from the second Lebanon war, when Israel fought the Iran-backed terrorist movement Hezbollah in 2006.

Prior to Iran's military strike on Israel in April, Fox News Digital reported that the Biden-Harris administration released billions in sanctions relief to Iran that will flow into its proxies' war machines, according to experts.

The topic of funneling billions to Iran's regime surfaced during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday. Republican Sen. JD Vance said, ""Iran, which launched this attack, has received over $100 billion in unfrozen assets thanks to the Kamala Harris administration.

""What do they use that money for? They use it to buy weapons that they're now launching against our allies. And God forbid, launching against the United States as well.""

BIDEN ADMIN UNDER PRESSURE TO STOP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SANCTIONS RELIEF TO IRAN

Lisa Daftari, an expert on Iran, said, ""The conflict between the Iran regime and Israel did not commence today, in April, or on Oct. 7 of the previous year. Its origins trace back to 1979, when the mullahs ascended to power, promulgating a doctrine that demonized the 'Great Satan,' a term for the United States, and the 'Little Satan,' referring to Israel.

""Over the past 45 years, the Iran regime has persistently targeted American and Israeli interests, orchestrating terror proxies to execute its strategic objectives against both nations. More recently, U.S. policies that have enriched the mullahs have facilitated billions of dollars on establishing a formidable encirclement around Israel, via the regime's various proxies in Syria, Lebanon, Yemen, Gaza and the West Bank.""

In April, Iran's regime launched a sprawling aerial attack, with over 300 suicide drones and missiles, on Israel. Jerusalem countered the Iranian swarm of missiles with a targeted strike against military installations in the Iranian province of Isfahan.

Daftari, editor-in-chief of the Foreign Desk news website, added, ""Israel's recent military actions signal a departure from the more restrained posture observed in April, when the nation's defense capabilities against missile threats were deemed a victory. The recent strategic strikes in Lebanon underscore Israel's heightened efforts to neutralize enduring existential threats.""

She noted that it historically has engaged in tit-for-tat-like responses but noted, ""Israel is now poised to take decisive measures aimed at neutralizing this looming risk, with its focus now entirely on the regime in Tehran.""

NETANYAHU CALLS MIDEAST CONFLICTS CHOICE BETWEEN 'BLESSING OR A CURSE,' WARNS ABOUT ISRAEL'S 'LONG ARM'

David Wurmser, a former senior adviser for nonproliferation and Middle East strategy for former Vice President Dick Cheney, told Fox News Digital, ""This is a war between Israel and Iran which began as a direct war on April 14. The war is a twilight struggle between a nation run by a tyranny that seeks to extinguish the other. Either Iran or Israel, but not both, will emerge from this war not only as victor but survivor.""

He said the so-called ""ring of fire that Iran built around Israel not only had an aggressive aim - to choke Israel to death by initiating a violent war of attrition and isolation, including closing ports and ending international airlines' flying to Israel - but also acted as a defensive deterrent against Israel, shielding Iran from any potential Israeli proactive action against Iran. With the destruction of Hezbollah, the strategic linchpin of the proxy network at the center of that ring of fire, as the greatest threat Israel faces, Iran was left fully exposed to the full weight of Israeli power.""

He echoed the strong language of Israel's military and political leadership, which ""promised to inflict severe pain on the regime of the Iran's supreme leader of the Islamic Republic, Ali Khamenei... Iran will surely now feel the vulnerability as the Israelis without fear any more of Hezbollah or Iran will take the war from the defensive to the offensive against Iran's regime, "" said Wurmser.

He added ""The mistake Iran made, as do its proxies and its minions in the West protesting on campuses, is not that they underestimate Israel's capabilities and its unity, but that they internalized their own ideology that Israel is a fake, fragile colonial entity rather than a deeply rooted civilization. Israel has shown that despite its mistakes and setbacks, its internal strength transcend that of any of their neighbors."""

(Credit: CBS)

A majority of the 13 columnists and contributors polled by The New York Times agreed that JD Vance won the debate against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz on Tuesday night.

Multiple New York Times columnists, including Binyamin Appelbaum, said that Vance was overall effective in his presentation on the debate stage. Seven of the columnists and contributors said that Vance defeated Walz in the debate, with two saying that the face-off was a draw and three writers concluding that Walz won.

""He made Trumpism sound polite, calm and coherent,"" Appelbaum said of Vance.

GOP LAWMAKERS, LEADERS REACT TO VANCE, WALZ DEBATE: 'SPITTING COLD, HARD TRUTH'

""Vance was far nimbler than the nervous Tim Walz, especially in the first half of the debate. But as the debate went on, Vance stumbled on two issues -- abortion and the 2020 election -- where his rhetorical skill could not salvage the very unappealing material he was working with,"" Josh Barro, author of the newsletter Very Serious, wrote.

""Walz won,"" Times columnist Charles M. Blow wrote. ""You could tell that he was a teacher, because he clearly did his homework. Anyone afraid that Vance would roll over him could breathe easily.""

Newsletter writer Matt Labash said that ""Nobody truly dominated.""

""But I'm giving the slight edge to Walz, since Vance embarrassingly soft-pedaled Jan. 6 and Trump posted this to Truth Social during the debate: 'More Notes! Why Can't Walz just remember what he has to say? Low IQ!' Reminding us that Vance's boss should watch more Hallmark Channel, less Newsmax.""

VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF ON BORDER, CLIMATE CHANGE AND ABORTION DURING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Other writers said that the debate outcome was more even.

Contributing Times Opinion writer Jane Coaston wrote that ""Vance seemed smoother and more practiced, but 'won' is a very strong term here.""

Times columnist Gail Collins said that the debate was a ""draw"" because ""Walz was so bad in much of his delivery. Vance was a much more forceful speaker while spewing lies on everything from abortion to Biden's foreign policy.""

Contributing Times opinion writer Peter Wehner said that Vance proved he was ""sharp and in command and ... an excellent debater.""

""At times he tried too hard to appear likable; I came away more convinced that he's a hollow man, radioactive and incendiary one day, conciliatory and agreeable the next,"" Wehner said. ""But the 'good Vance' did a lot to repair his tattered image.""

Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung told Fox News Digital, ""Senator JD Vance completely dominated the debate and showed why we need to return President Trump to the White House."" He added that Trump's vice presidential nominee ""gave clear answers how the Trump-Vance ticket will turn around our economy, secure our southern border, make our streets safe once again, and restore peace in the Middle East.""

Cheung continued by saying that Vance ""exposed Kamala Harris and Tim Walz for being failed, radical leftists who are all slogans with zero substance.""

""He called out Kamala Harris for destroying our southern border. He called out Harris for creating the record inflation making life unaffordable for millions of Americans. And he called out Harris for enabling Iran, leading to the current attacks on Israel,"" the spokesman added.

"Biden, Harris head to hurricane-ravaged Southeast in wake of Trump visit",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-harris-head-hurricane-ravaged-southeast-wake-trump-visit,2024-10-02T14:05:52Z,"Former President Trump makes a stop in Valdosta, Georgia to get a briefing on Hurricane Helene recovery efforts and help distribute relief supplies.

President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris each travel to the storm-ravaged Southeast on Wednesday, as the death toll and devastation from Hurricane Helene soars and a couple of million people remain without power and running water.

Over 160 people have been killed by Helene since the hurricane made landfall in Florida late Thursday before tearing a path of destruction through the interior Southeast. The storm sparked millions of power outages and billions of dollars in property damage as it smashed through the southern Appalachian Mountains and into the Tennessee Valley.

As the floodwaters from the storm receded, North Carolina Gov. Roy Cooper lamented that in the western part of his state ""communities were wiped off the map.""

NORTH CAROLINA RESIDENTS FIGHT FOR THEIR SURVIVAL

North Carolina and Georgia, which was also hard hit by the storm, are two of the seven key battlegrounds whose razor-thin margins decided Biden's 2020 election victory over former President Trump and are expected to determine the outcome of the 2024 showdown between Harris and Trump.

And with a margin-of-error race between the vice president and Trump with less than five weeks to go until Election Day on Nov. 5, and with the former president during a trip to the storm-damaged region earlier this week blasting both Biden and Harris over the federal response, the hurricane has become front-and-center in the White House race.

RESCUE MISSIONS UNDERWAY IN NORTH CAROLINA AFTER HURRICANE HELENE BRINGS 'HISTORIC' FLOODING, LANDSLIDES

The president on Wednesday heads to North Carolina, where he'll survey damage from a helicopter flight over the city of Ashville, one of the hardest hit areas. Biden will also visit a rescue command center in the state before also stopping in neighboring South Carolina.

""My top priority is to ensure the communities devastated by this hurricane get the help and support they need as quickly as possible,"" Biden told reporters Tuesday as he spoke during a Cabinet meeting focusing on the federal response.

Trump this past weekend accused the president of ""sleeping"" at his beach house in Delaware as the storm blasted the Southeast.

And speaking with reporters as he arrived in Valdosta, Georgia, on Monday, the former president charged that ""the federal government is not being responsive.""

And he falsely claimed that Biden had not spoken with Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a conservative Republican.

Pushing back against the political attacks, Biden has noted that he was on the phone with federal, state and local officials throughout the weekend and returned to the nation's capital on Sunday afternoon to monitor storm rescue and relief efforts.

HEAD HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS REPORTING ON HELENE'S HAVOC

""We had over 1,000 federal personnel, including search and rescue teams, at the ready on the ground before it hit,"" the president said on Tuesday. ""Over the past several days, I've been in regular contact with the governors, the mayors, the county officials, and all the affected areas. That includes Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama and Virginia.""

And Biden emphasized that his administration has sent ""every available resource that we have at our disposal to the affected region"" and pledged ""we'll be there until this work is done.""

Trump on Sunday attacked Harris for attending ""fundraising events with her radical left lunatic donors"" in California over the weekend. And he argued that Harris ""ought to be down in the area"" where the storm caused destruction.

On Monday during his stop in Georgia, Trump repeated the dig, saying, ""The vice president, she's out someplace campaigning looking for money.""

The White House has highlighted that the vice president over the weekend was on the phone with federal, state and local officials.

Harris said on Saturday that she and the president ""remain committed to ensuring that no community or state has to respond to this disaster alone.""

On Monday, Harris visited FEMA [Federal Emergency Management Agency] headquarters in Washington, D.C., where she received a briefing on relief and rescue efforts.

""We will do everything in our power to help communities respond and recover,"" Harris vowed.

Harris on Wednesday travels to Georgia to survey the impacts of the storm and receive an on-the-ground briefing and provide updates on the federal response.

Harris was originally scheduled to take part Wednesday in a campaign bus swing through central Pennsylvania, another key battleground state, with her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

With the vice president headed to Georgia, Walz will headline the bus tour, which comes the day after he faced off in the running mates debate against Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, the GOP vice presidential nominee.

During his Monday stop in Georgia, Trump highlighted that ""I've come to Valdosta with large semi-trucks, many of them, filled with relief aid. A tanker truck filled up with gasoline, a couple of big tanker trucks filled up with gasoline, which they can't get now. And we'll be working to distribute it throughout the day.""

And a GoFundMe page set up by the Trump campaign earlier this week has raised nearly $4 million so far for storm victims.

Presidents and vice presidents often don't travel immediately to storm-damaged areas, to prevent their trips from hampering badly needed rescue and relief efforts.

""I'm committed to traveling to the impacted areas as soon as possible, but I've been told that it would be disruptive if I did it right now. We will not do that at the risk of diverting or delaying any of the response assets needed to deal with this crisis,"" Biden told reporters on Monday.

And Harris said on Tuesday, ""I plan to be on the ground as soon as possible - but as soon as possible without disrupting any emergency response operations, because that must be the highest priority and the first order of business.""

But the optics of Trump's Monday stop in Georgia may have put some political pressure on Biden and Harris.

Longtime Republican strategist David Kochel said Trump had been ""very aggressive"" with his quick trip to the storm-damaged region.

""I think he put a lot of pressure on them to try to do something,"" Kochel, a veteran of numerous GOP presidential campaigns, told Fox News. ""He's out there pushing a line that they don't care - they're not doing anything and I think they're reacting to it.""

The response by elected officials to natural disasters can impact their political standing.

President George W. Bush was heavily criticized in the summer of 2005 for his initial response to Hurricane Katrina, which devastated New Orleans.

And Trump faced criticism early in his White House tenure as Puerto Rico struggled to recover from a powerful storm. The president was pilloried for throwing paper towels to the crowd as he stopped by a relief center during a storm-related visit to the island."

ABC DEBATE MODERATORS SPARK FURY FOR AGGRESSIVE FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP, EASY TREATMENT ON HARRIS

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

When Vance tried to push back on the fact-check, Brennan and her co-moderator Norah O'Donnell attempted to speak over Vance, insisting that they had to move on to the next question.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance reminded them. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""Senator, we have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Brennan said before urging O'Donnell again to move on to the next question.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" she added when Vance continued to respond.

Johnson commended Vance for his performance as he went head-to-head against the Minnesota governor, praising him for shedding light on the Biden-Harris administration's ""open"" border policies.

""The immigration policy is basically nonexistent,"" Johnson said. ""They opened the border. They're allowing everyone in. They put out the welcome mat, and the catastrophe that this has been to our country in every metric of public policy, with the fentanyl poisonings of it being the leading cause of death for Americans aged 18 to 49. The trafficking, the fact that JD pointed out so well, they have lost all of these children who came across the border.""

""If a Republican administration had done that, it's all you would see every day, but they try to bury it,"" he continued.

""JD was so good last night because he brought answers, solutions. He talked about policies. He showed us his depth and he came across as just being very reasonable and likable. I just thought he was at his best. He did a great job.""

CBS News announced last week that it would not allow its moderators to partake in any fact checking or correcting live in an effort to avoid the fury sparked by ABC News for its partisan handling of the first presidential debate between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

The Fox News Debate Dial showed support among independents and Democrats dipping downward when Vance made that statement. Support among Republicans remained fairly consistent.

But support among independent viewers began to rise again when Vance referenced how Democrats bring up carbon emissions when discussing climate change.

""This idea that carbon emissions drives all of the climate change. Well, let's just say that's true just for the sake of argument. So we're not arguing about weird science. Let's just say that's true,"" Vance said. ""Well, if you believe that, what would you -- would you want to do? The answer is that you'd want to reshore as much American manufacturing as possible, and you'd want to produce as much energy as possible in the United States of America, because we're the cleanest economy in the entire world.""

TIM WALZ: THE SOLUTION IS TO 'MOVE FORWARD' WITH IDEA THAT 'CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL'

The dial for independents remained flat as Vance moved into criticizing Kamala Harris on energy policy. Support among Democrats took a dive by contrast.

""What have Kamala Harris policies actually lead to more energy production in China, more manufacturing overseas, more doing business in some of the dirtiest parts of the entire world,"" Vance said. ""When I say that, I mean the amount of carbon emissions they're doing per unit of economic output. So, if we actually care about getting cleaner air and cleaner water, the best thing to do is to double down and invest in American workers and the American people. And unfortunately, Kamala Harris has done exactly the opposite.""

CBS News host Nora O'Donnell began her question by noting how more than 160 were dead and hundreds more were missing in the aftermath of Hurricane Helene.

Vance began his response by recognizing the hurricane as ""an unbelievable, unspeakable human tragedy"" and recalling a photograph of grandparents and a six-year-old child on a roof that later collapsed, causing those people to lose their lives. ""I'm sure Governor Waltz joins me and saying, our hearts go out to those innocent people, our prayers go out to them,"" Vance said.

""The way the moderators think it's their job to have the last word on how to frame an issue is amazing,"" Wall Street Journal film critic Kyle Smith quipped.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Fox News' Bill Melugin, who has extensively covered the migrant crisis during the Biden-Harris administration, provided his own fact-check of the debate exchange.

""CBS cuts Vance's mic while he's explaining how the Biden/Harris admin has allowed over 800,000 migrants to enter the U.S. via the CBP One App 'lawfully'. It then sounded like Walz claimed the CBP One app has been used since the 90s, which is completely false,"" Melugin wrote on X. ""The Biden/Harris admin started using it in winter 2023 to begin mass paroling migrants into the country by the hundreds of thousands, typically between 1,300-1,500 every single day.""

Notably, O'Donnell and Brennan cooled off on the fact-checking after they returned from the commercial break.

The backlash the CBS News moderators received resembles the uproar sparked by ABC News' David Muir and Linsey Davis for their partisan moderating during the first presidential debate between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was not asked about several highly talked about news stories in the first and only vice presidential debate on Tuesday, including his military service, which Walz did not strongly invoke either.

The CBS Vice Presidential Debate in New York City showcased the Republican and Democrat candidates answering questions on a variety of issues, but Walz's military service, which he has faced sharp criticism from Republicans and some veterans for allegedly embellishing, was not asked about.

Walz only briefly mentioned his military service during the debate when he was forced to correct the record on whether he was in China for the Tiananmen Square protests.

At another point in the debate, Walz referred to himself as a ""good soldier.""

Walz was also not asked during the debate about how many times he has visited China.

In the past, Walz has claimed he went ""dozens of times"" and once claimed he went ""about 30 times."" This week, the Harris-Walz campaign walked that back and said the actual number is ""closer to 15 times.""

Other questions Walz was not asked during the debate include his disputed claims about his wife's IVF treatment and his claim that he carried weapons ""in war.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Walz attempted to argue with him.

The senior political commentator was asked by CNN host Jake Tapper about how Walz suddenly disappeared from television over the course of the campaign.

""I've been bewildered a little bit by the absence of both the presidential candidate and the vice presidential candidate on television since they became the nominees, because that's how people get to know you. And they haven't really spent a lot of time with either of them before now,"" Axelrod said.

""He was all over before he became the nominee when he was campaigning for vice president,"" he added.

Axelrod concluded that Walz put himself at a disadvantage.

As Israeli forces prepare for what officials characterize as a limited ground incursion into Lebanon, the world is bracing for the possibility that the conflict will expand into a larger regional war, a greater likelihood in the wake of Israel's killing of Hezbollah's leader, Hassan Nasrallah.

The two sides have clashed for close to a year, dating back to Hamas' terrorist attack on Israel on Oct. 7, 2023. The skirmishes have led to hundreds of deaths along the border and the displacement of thousands more.

The violence reflects the damage that Iranian-backed militant groups, like Hamas and Hezbollah, have done in the Middle East for four decades. The roots of their capacity to inflict harm lie in the October 1983 suicide bombing of the U.S. Marine headquarters in Beirut, which was the largest non-nuclear blast the FBI ever investigated.

Though the attack, which killed 241 soldiers, sailors, and Marines, horrified President Ronald Reagan, he never retaliated against the then-fledgling Hezbollah.

ISRAEL UNBOUND

This decision to forego a military response, coupled with America's withdrawal from Lebanon, sent a message that terrorism worked. Small and relatively inexpensive acts of extraordinary violence could effectively defeat major militaries and superpowers. This emboldened these groups, as well as their Iranian sponsors. The results have been catastrophic for the region and the cause of peace.

By the early 1980s, Lebanon had been torn apart by years of civil war and sectarian violence that had resulted from a political tug-of-war between the nation's Christians, Sunnis and Shiites. Adding to the bloodshed was the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO), which had moved into Beirut after being driven out of Jordan in 1971.

The PLO, upset over the loss of land during Israel's 1967 war against its Arab neighbors, fought a guerrilla campaign against Israel in an effort to obtain a homeland for the Palestinian people.

END US FUNDING FOR UN AGENCY GIVING IMMUNITY TO ITS MURDEROUS HAMAS MEMBERS

In June 1982, Israel invaded, pummeling Beirut with artillery in an attempt to eradicate the PLO, which had been attacking it from Lebanese territory. The rain of Israeli fire devastated entire city blocks. ""Even in Lebanon,"" wrote columnist Jack Anderson, ""a land inured to catastrophe, the bombardment of West Beirut was a horror beyond endurance.""

Israel's bloody war in Lebanon alarmed many, including Reagan, who worked to broker a deal to end the violence, remove the PLO, and send in U.S. Marines as peacekeepers to stabilize the region.

But American troops were not the only foreign military force to arrive in Lebanon that year. Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the Shiite religious leader who rose to power in Iran in 1979, saw an opportunity to capitalize on the chaos, to export and propagate his revolution.

UN ABDICATES ROLE OF MIDDLE EAST PEACEMAKER BY BACKING TERRORISTS

With that goal in mind, Khomeini sent an army of 800 elite Revolutionary Guards into Lebanon's Bekaa Valley, a lawless region near Syria. The Iranian soldiers fanned out through the impoverished Shiite communities in southern Lebanon, attending mosque, giving speeches, and recruiting disenfranchised young men to fight against American and Israeli forces.

These efforts helped produce two homegrown Shiite terror organizations: Islamic Amal and the Islamic Jihad Organization. These two Iranian-backed groups would soon merge, however, and become known simply as Hezbollah or the Party of God, aided by Iranian money, training and weapons.

Hezbollah's first strike against the U.S. came on April 18, 1983, when a suicide car bomber crashed into the front of the American Embassy in Beirut. The blast collapsed the entire front of the building, killing 63 people including 17 Americans.

IRAN'S OPTIONS DWINDLE AS IT PREPARES RETALIATION FOR DEATH OF NASRALLAH

But that attack paled in comparison to the one that would follow 188 days later.

At dawn on a Sunday morning in October 1983, a bomber in a Mercedes truck crashed through security and penetrated the lobby of the four-story Battalion Landing Team headquarters in Beirut, where some 350 American soldiers, sailors and Marines were asleep.

The blast, which investigators later determined exceeded 12,000 pounds of TNT, collapsed the building into a pile of broken concrete and twisted rebar. ""It was,"" as one survivor later recounted, ""like every atom in the universe blew apart.""

The screams from buried victims prompted one of the greatest rescue efforts in modern memory, as troops attacked the rubble pile with shovels, Ka-Bar knives and their bare hands.

IRAN SUPPORTS KAMALA HARRIS, BUT AMERICANS WHO WANT A SAFER WORLD HAVE A BETTER CHOICE

For those Marines trapped underground, it was hell. Among them was Chaplain Danny Wheeler, who spent five hours buried in a concrete crypt before rescuers finally found him. ""The next thing I knew, I felt a hand on my hand,"" Wheeler recalled. ""I held it.""

Wheeler was the last survivor rescued, and one of the lucky few. All told, the bombing killed 220 Marines, 18 sailors and three soldiers, wounding another 112.

The attack shocked Reagan, who initially resisted pressure from many in Congress and the public to pull American forces out of Lebanon. In a nationally televised speech on Oct. 27, the president instead recommitted America to stabilizing the area.

""Brave young men have been taken away from us. Many others have been grievously wounded. Are we to tell them their sacrifice was wasted?"" Reagan said. ""We're a nation with global responsibilities.""

WHY BIDEN'S SPEECH AT UNGA SHOULD SET OFF ALARM BELLS ACROSS THE GLOBE

But that resolve faded in early 1984, when the Lebanese national government and military ultimately collapsed. On Feb. 7, Reagan announced that he planned to send American troops back to their ships.

In an effort to avoid drawing attention to America's sudden reversal and withdrawal, he skipped the televised speech, instead releasing a written statement to reporters. On March 30, Reagan notified Congress that he planned to officially terminate America's peacekeeping mission.

This withdrawal created a vacuum that Hezbollah capitalized on to gain power and influence, eventually becoming the dominant political party in Lebanon.

WHAT IF ISRAELIS COULD VOTE IN US ELECTIONS?

Additionally, America's abrupt departure coincided with the administration's refusal to retaliate for the bombing of the U.S. Embassy or the Marine headquarters. In the wake of the October bombing, members of the National Security Council drew up a plan to target Iran's terror camp in the Bekaa Valley.

Reagan initially supported it, but Defense Secretary Caspar Weinberger convinced the president to backtrack, arguing that retaliatory action demanded the type of conclusive proof of the identity of the attackers that is often elusive in terror attacks. ""I'm not,"" Weinberger later said, ""an eye for an eye man.""

Whatever the merits of Weinberger's thinking, the results of Reagan's decision were calamitous. For the small cost of a truck, some explosives and the single life of a terrorist, Iran successfully drove the U.S. from Lebanon and suffered no consequences.

That was the critical lesson our enemies learned from this tragedy, a fact the CIA zeroed in on in a 1987 report. ""Many Iranian leaders use this precedent as proof that terrorism can break U.S. resolve.""

The agency also concluded that Iranian leaders exploited the uncertainty that had troubled Weinberger. ""Compared with overt military attacks, terrorism and sabotage also offer a degree of plausible deniability and present the United States with a less clear-cut justification for retaliation.""

America's failure to respond to the killing and wounding of hundreds of our diplomats and service members in Beirut served as a green light for Iran to continue and even escalate its proxy war of terrorism that menaces the region.

And it is a price America, Israel and our allies continue to pay four decades later.

Col. Timothy Geraghty, who was the commander of the Marines in Lebanon in October 1983 and later worked for the CIA, understands that better than anyone. ""Our timidity,"" he concluded, ""whetted the jihadists' appetite.""

Walz faces backlash after defending Obama-era mandate repealed by Trump: 'Massive tax penalty',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-faces-backlash-after-defending-obama-era-mandate-repealed-trump-tax-penalty,2024-10-02T10:07:22Z,"When now-governor and Dem VP nominee Tim Walz was running for governor in 2018 he admitted during a debate that he supported government-run health care.

Democratic vice presidential nominee Tim Walz faced backlash on social media after he defended an individual healthcare mandate during a back and forth with his counterpart, Republican Sen. JD Vance, in their first and only debate on Tuesday night.

""The question about this of young people, whatever, that's the individual mandate,"" Walz said during a conversation on healthcare and the Affordable Care Act at the CBS News debate in New York City. ""And Republicans fought tooth and nail saying Americans should be free to do this.""

Vance then interjected, asking, ""Tim do you think the individual mandate is a good idea?""

""I think the idea of making sure the risk pool is broad enough to cover everyone -- that's the only way insurance works. When it doesn't, it collapses. You are asking pre- ACA where we get people out. Look, people know that they need to be on health care. People expect it to be there.""

BIDEN-HARRIS ADMIN HAS 'FAILED' REPEATEDLY ON HEALTH CARE: ANALYSIS

Walz went on to say that the ACA ""works"" but we can ""continue to do better.""

Walz's comments defending the individual mandate drew criticism on social media, with people pointing out that it was repealed during the Trump administration.

""We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year -- forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans,"" Trump told an audience during the 2018 State of the Union Address.

""We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare -- the individual mandate is now gone,"" he added.

7 REASONS TO FEAR KAMALA HARRIS' RADICAL 'MEDICARE-FOR-ALL' SCHEMES

""Tim Walz just endorsed reinstating the Obamacare mandate which was a massive tax penalty for Americans who can't afford to buy insurance,"" GOP Sen. Tom Cotton posted on X.

""Oh my god, Walz defending the individual mandate,"" journalist Josh Barro posted on X. ""Does he know there isn't one anymore?""

""Tim Walz doubles down on his support for Obamacare's individual mandate tax, by far the least popular part of Obamacare,"" Americans for Tax Reform Director Mike Palicz posted on X.

""This would violate Kamala's pledge not to raise taxes on anyone earning less than $400K. Trump Tax Cuts repealed the hated individual mandate tax.""

During the debate, Vance argued, ""Donald Trump has said that if we allow states to experiment a little bit on how to cover both the chronically ill, but the non-chronically ill, it's not just a plan. He actually implemented some of these regulations when he was President of the United States. And I think you can make a really good argument that it salvaged Obamacare, which was doing disastrously until Donald Trump came along.""

Fox News Digital reported Monday that Walz has previously voiced his support for single-payer government-run healthcare.

""I think that's probably the path where we end up,"" Walz said in a 2018 debate while running for governor when asked, ""Are you for single-payer?""

""And I say that because, be very clear about this, there were no protections for preexisting conditions before the ACA,"" Walz continued. ""A vote for the ACA was the first time in this nation's history we had those protections and making sure people have that protection, making sure they were covered, and then making sure we were focused on preventative care, people were finally getting that under the ACA, we started to see health outcomes improve and that's the real key to driving down insurance premium prices."""
Tim Walz says he kept a shotgun in his car to hunt pheasants after football practices,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/tim-walz-says-he-kept-shotgun-his-car-hunt-pheasants-after-football-practices,2024-10-02T10:02:19Z,"Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., responds to gun violence across the nation during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz has made it a point multiple times to remind Americans that he was once an assistant high school football coach since being selected as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate.

However, during the vice presidential debate Tuesday night, he let everyone in on the details of another sport he engaged in after practice when he worked at Mankato West High School.

During a segment on gun control policies, Walz claimed that when he worked as a football coach at Mankato West, he kept a shotgun in his car so he could hunt pheasants after practice.

""I'm of an age where my shotgun was in my car so I could pheasant hunt after football practice,"" Walz said.

The statement came when Walz was asked if he would support an assault weapons ban after previously opposing such a measure. Walz, who was previously an NRA ally, said his stance on gun control changed after meeting the parents of Sandy Hook victims and befriending school shooters.

""Yeah, I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it. Look, the NRA, I was NRA guy for a long time. They used to teach gun safety,"" Walz said.

Walz's hobby of hunting pheasants is something he has spoken and bragged about in the past. In July, Walz bragged that his pheasant-shooting skills were superior to Vance during an interview on ""Anderson Cooper 360.""

""That's what JD Vance's stick is, talking about guns. I guarantee you he can't shoot pheasants like I can,"" Walz said.

Walz is also one of the main organizers of his state's Governor's Pheasant Hunting Opener. He celebrated the 2023 event last October, when he declared himself a life-long pheasant hunter.

""As a lifelong hunter and Pheasants Forever member, the pheasant opener is one of my favorite times of year,"" he said in a statement.

Pheasant hunting is one of the most popular bird-hunting sports and is particularly popular in South Central South Dakota, which borders Walz's state of Minnesota and is known as ""The Pheasant Capitol of the World.""

However, pheasant hunting has also led to a harsh reduction in the bird's population in the U.S. over the last 50 years. While pheasants are not considered an endangered species, they are considered at-risk in many regions across the country.

The species' population in New York state has declined nearly 90% since 1970, according to the NYS Department of Environmental Conservation. In Minnesota, the population has seen steadier and less drastic decline, however.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Walz's habit of hunting the birds after football practice means he contributed to this decline during his tenure as an assistant coach at Mankato West in the 1990s.

During Walz's tenure as an assistant on the staff, the team won the state championship in 1999. Walz's first job after college was as a teacher in China, before being hired by Mankato West in 1996, where he was a geography teacher.

He was also the first faculty advisor of Mankato West High School's first gay-straight alliance, and he worked to organize summer educational trips to China for high school students.

Walz's short tenure as an assistant football coach has been a talking point for the Harris campaign since he was announced as the running mate for Harris on Aug. 7.

Walz, despite never having coached past the high school level or even as a head coach in high school, compared his background as a football coach to that of Alabama Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville, who served as the head coach at four different NCAA Power-5 football programs from 1995 to 2016. Tuberville led Ole Miss, Auburn, Texas Tech and Cincinnati as head coach, and even won an SEC Championship with Auburn in 2004.

""I feel like one of my roles in this now is to be the anti-Tommy Tuberville, to show that football coaches are not the dumbest people,"" Walz said during a fundraiser event in Boston in early August.

Walz even asserted that his experience as an assistant high school football coach meant he ""took football back"" from Republicans, during a campaign speech in Wisconsin on Sept. 17.

However, football fans did not show much favoritism to Walz during the governor's visit to the game between Michigan and Wisconsin on Saturday. Several in attendance booed him, with another fan even yelling ""Get out of here."""
It took me 3 minutes to get a taxpayer-funded meth pipe. Kamala Harris wants more of this,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/took-3-minutes-get-taxpayer-funded-meth-pipe-kamala-harris-wants-more,2024-10-02T09:14:16Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

It's never been easier to get taxpayer-funded meth pipes and fentanyl freebasing kits in cities across the country. And if you want to know what drug policy would be under a Kamala Harris presidency, look no farther than the very cities operating under the Biden-Harris administration's embrace of so-called ""harm reduction"" strategies that, rather than address a drug crisis, make it worse.

Harm reduction strategies were initially designed to mitigate the negative effects of drug use by providing clean needles, pipes and other paraphernalia to prevent the spread of diseases like HIV and hepatitis. The idea is that people will use drugs whether we like it or not, so why not make it ""safer""?

As I explain extensively in my book ""What's Killing America: Inside the Radical Left's Tragic Destruction of Our Cities,"" what these strategies have done is normalize drug use, creating more addicts and leaving cities grappling with rising overdose deaths, open-air drug markets and the complete collapse of public safety.

NEW YORK TIMES REPORT RIPS VICE PRESIDENT HARRIS' 'FRIENDLY' MSNBC INTERVIEW: 'ROUNDABOUT RESPONSES'

I've seen this firsthand in Seattle, where I live. It took me about three minutes to get my hands on taxpayer-funded drug kits from Public Health Seattle-King County. I walked into a needle exchange office in downtown Seattle and walked out with enough gear to start my own drug den. No questions asked. All I had to do was ask for a ""party kit.""

I got to choose which meth pipe I wanted and chose a ""hammer,"" though I could have gone with a straight glass pipe or what's known colloquially as a ""bubble."" They had cookers, tin foil and even instructions on how to turn tin foil into a pipe to freebase fentanyl. The drug paraphernalia was casually handed to me, courtesy of your hard-earned tax dollars, by an agency meant to help save me from addiction, not enable it.

Most shockingly, there wasn't even a hint of concern about whether I was an addict, a dealer or just someone trying to get a freebie. There wasn't even a comment, in passing, about how they could connect me with detox services when I was ready.

This is what harm reduction looks like in practice -- facilitating drug use, with taxpayers footing the bill.

And if Vice President Kamala Harris gets anywhere near the White House, these policies will not only continue but spread in your community. Harris's history of supporting drug legalization, as evidenced in her 2019 response to an ACLU questionnaire, shows she is all in on these so-called ""harm reduction"" measures. And it should be a terrifying thought for anyone paying attention to how these programs are destroying cities like New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles and Dallas.

New York City opened the nation's first ""supervised consumption site"" in 2021. They're little more than a magnet for addicts -- and the nearby dealers are ready to sell addicts their next fix. The surrounding neighborhoods have become war zones, with residents living in fear as drug-related crime skyrockets.

Then there's San Francisco, a city that's become the poster child for failed progressive policies. Harm reduction efforts there include distributing fentanyl test strips, aluminum foil and clean needles en masse. The result? The city saw an all-time high number of fatal overdoses, the majority coming from fentanyl. Open-air drug use is rampant because there's no incentive for addicts to get clean when the city provides everything they need to stay hooked.

Los Angeles and its county aren't far behind. As pipes are handed out to addicts, the morgue gets filled with dead homeless people at alarming rates. Meanwhile, Dallas activists have jumped on the harm reduction bandwagon, too, though its efforts are less publicized because they're handing out drug paraphernalia against state law, though they're not paying any legal price for it. Though advocates claim harm reduction helps prevent overdose deaths, drug fatalities in Texas have seen a steady rise, with Dallas County at the center of the crisis.

Let's not pretend for a second that a President Harris would put public health first, especially since harm reduction is already in play. A key element of the administration's multi-billion-dollar National Drug Control Strategy is to increase harm reduction interventions to curb overdose deaths and promote treatment for substance use disorders. It's failed to reach meaningful results on either goal.

Harm reduction is enabling addiction, not fighting it. And with Harris in the White House, it'll only get worse with cities across the country seeing an even greater influx of taxpayer-funded drug kits, more supervised consumption sites, and higher overdose deaths.

What we need are policies that emphasize treatment, recovery and accountability -- not ones that hand out pipes and syringes to addicts, keeping them locked in the very cycle we should be helping them escape. This isn't compassion; it's negligence.

We've already seen the damage done in Democrat-run cities. Do we really want to let it spread farther?"
Beware Kamala's 'fair share' lie on taxes,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/beware-kamalas-fair-share-lie-taxes,2024-10-02T09:14:13Z,"As Vice President Kamala Harris tries to articulate her economic plans, it is clear that she intends to continue to spend more money, and in doing so, also wants to raise taxes, at least for some Americans.

Her attempt at an explanation includes one tired refrain, a carry-over from the Biden-Harris agenda: the wealthy aren't paying their fair share and we need to get them to pay more.

What the wealthy pay in taxes cannot be characterized as fair, but not in the way that Harris explains.

According to Treasury data, federal income taxes account for about half of government revenue. Of those federal income taxes, per the Tax Foundation, about half of taxpayers paid around 98% of that total.

IRS MIGHT TAKE MORE OF YOUR MONEY UNDER KAMALA HARRIS

As you dig into the numbers, they become even more ""unfair.""

The National Taxpayers Union Foundation's data from 2021 showed that the top 1% of earners made 26.3% of Adjusted Gross Income (AGI), yet they paid 45.8% of federal income taxes. One percent of the people paying almost 46% of taxes is definitely not fair, but Harris wants more.

When the data is expanded, the top 10% of earners had 52.6% of AGI, but paid 75.8% of federal income taxes.

The bottom 50% of earners had 10.4% of AGI, but only paid just more than 2.3% of federal income taxes.

HERE'S WHAT KAMALA HARRIS' TAX ARMAGEDDON WILL COST YOU AND THE US ECONOMY

And, somewhere in the neighborhood of 40% of U.S. households pay no federal income taxes at all.

Those who pay abundantly for the federal government and its ""services"" are berated by Harris and friends that they aren't paying enough, which is then voted into being by the people who carry little to none of the federal income tax burden. That sounds... unfair.

What is also unfair is the creep of tax collections and overspending.

For FY 2024, the U.S. government is expected to take in, primarily from taxes, almost $5.1 trillion. That's an increase of around 47% from five years ago. It's a staggering amount, larger than the GDP of every country in the world, other than the U.S. and China. Yet, it's still not enough and the government plans to run a more than $2 trillion deficit on top of that. That's... unfair.

And, while we are talking about unfair taxes, let's not forget that the massive inflation that the Biden-Harris agenda unleashed upon all Americans, stealing their purchasing power, making the cost of everyday living a struggle, and putting the ability to invest and get ahead out of reach. As famed economist Milton Friedman once said, ""Inflation is the one form of taxation that can be imposed without legislation."" That sounds... unfair.

The government spends too much, and it takes too much, particularly from those who have been successful, painting achievement and success as a punishable offense and government dependence as a virtue. That doesn't sound American, that sounds socialist at best.

Yet, Harris will say that those who have done well need to be further penalized, while continuing to overspend and devalue the earnings of all Americans. And that's before layering on any of her ultra-destructive proposals on top of raising income taxes, which include higher capital gains taxes, unrealized gains taxes, and other economically illiterate and ruinous policies.

When it comes to the government, what is unfair is how much they are taxing productive Americans, how many Americans have no skin in the game, and how much government spending is creating a fiscal train wreck.

And he was clearly unsteady through much of that debate. In contrast, J.D. Vance was very smooth.""

""Hate to say it but Walz would have benefitted from doing a few Sunday morning shows, as Vance has been,"" Financial Times associate editor Edward Luce said.

MSNBC's Rachel Maddow perhaps offered a more charitable take on the debate.

""I wouldn't describe them as evenly matched because they are so different, so different in style and so different on substance,"" Maddow told her MSNBC colleagues. ""I think the big picture takeaway in this is that one of these candidates is much slicker than the other, much more practiced, kind of professional debate style speaker, and the other candidate won."""
Top 5 moments from only VP debate between Vance and Walz before election,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-5-moments-from-only-vp-debate-between-vance-walz-before-election,2024-10-02T08:11:29Z,"Fox News Digital ranks the top five memorable moments from the 2024 Vice Presidential Debate between Senator JD Vance and Governor Tim Walz.

Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Gov. Tim Walz, D-Minn., met face to face on Tuesday night in New York City for the only vice presidential debate before the election.

The event covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before election day.

Here are the top moments from the debate:

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

After CBS News' Margaret Brennan offered an impromptu fact-check in response to Vance describing cities being overwhelmed by illegal immigration, noting that many Haitians in Springfield, Ohio have been granted a legal status, Vance hit back at her for violating the terms of the debate.

""Margaret, the rules were that you are not going to fact-check. And since you're fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" he said. ""So there's an application called the CBP one app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand.""

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

Vance told Walz that he was sorry to hear that his son had been witness to a shooting, in a moment of civility that was particularly frequent during the vice presidential debate. This civility has also been less and less common during presidential debates, which have proven contentious in recent election cycles.

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting, and I'm sorry about that,"" the senator told Walz.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

""The American citizens have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace, Tim,"" Vance said during the debate.

""And I actually think I agree with you,"" the Ohio senator said, adding, ""I think you want to solve this problem.""

""But I don't think that Kamala Harris does.""

Walz claimed there would be ""a registry of pregnancies"" under what he said was Trump and Vance's Project 2025. The Project 2025 is an endeavor of conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation.

""It's going to make it more difficult, if not impossible, to get contraception and limit access, if not eliminate access, to infertility treatments,"" he said.

But Vance denied this claim. ""No, certainly we won't,"" he pushed back at the statement.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Walz referred back to his notes in one answer on Tuesday night, after frequently scribbling down observations during the debate.

""Economists can't be trusted. Science can't be trusted. National security folks can't be trusted,"" he listed, referencing Vance's skepticism of those heralded as experts. ""Look, if you're going to be president, you don't have all the answers. Donald Trump believes he does.""

Even Trump poked fun at the noticeable amount of notes that the Minnesota governor was taking, writing on Truth Social, ""Walz is taking so many notes - Never seen a Candidate take more! He needs the notes to keep his brain intact."""
Top 5 clashes between Vance and Walz during debate showdown: 'Your mics are cut',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-5-clashes-between-vance-walz-during-debate-showdown-your-mics-cut,2024-10-02T08:11:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance took the same stage for their first and only vice presidential debate this election cycle on Tuesday evening, when the pair had a handful of fiery clashes over top voter concerns.

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two vice presidential candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. Amid the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The CBS debate's rules included leaving microphones on for both candidates no matter who was speaking, breaking from the two presidential debates this cycle that muted microphones when a candidate was not speaking. The outlet, however, reserved the right to turn the microphones off if they felt it was warranted.

Moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell did mute the pair Tuesday when Vance spoke up to complain that the moderators were trying to fact-check him on his remarks regarding illegal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace,"" Vance said referring to about immigration issues in a city in his home state.

After Vance and Walz both delivered responses regarding immigration, Brennan told viewers that Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

Vance took issues with the on-air ""fact-check"" before he was muted.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

""The rules were that you were not going to fact-check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said. ""So there's an application called the CBP. One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in. Applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.""

Moderators tried to quiet Vance before cutting his and Walz's mics.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Margaret Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get to.""

Walz was forced to answer questions regarding his travel to China during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets, however, are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams. We would take baseball teams. We would take dancers. And we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So, I will just -- that's what I've said. So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, went in and, from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz claimed during the debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws after Roe v. Wade was overturned, sparking a clash with Vance.

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Vance shot back that a Minnesota abortion law does not require doctors to save a baby who survives an abortion.

""First of all, governor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive, and there are a lot of people who should still be alive. And I certainly wish that she was. And maybe you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me. But as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion,"" he said.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""That's not true,"" Walz said.

""Choice or not option that is fundamentally barbaric,"" Vance continued.

The pair also sparred over immigration a handful of times throughout the debate, including Vance slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of immigration.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield, Ohio, and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

Walz repeatedly argued Trump shut down a Senate immigration bill earlier this year that he believes would have made strengthened border security.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.""

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

The pair of vice presidential candidates also sparred over the threat of censorship on Tuesday, as Walz pressed Vance on the 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021.

""It's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election,"" Vance said after Walz cited Jan. 6, when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.

""We have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor,"" Vance continued.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Walz countered that ""Jan. 6 was not Facebook ads.""

""This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up,"" he continued.

Walz continued that Trump has repeatedly claimed he won the 2020 presidential election.

""Did he lose the 2020 election?"" Walz asked Vance of Trump during the last election cycle.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future,"" Vance replied. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?""

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz said. ""I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate, it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance shot back.

Conservative social media reactions pour in declaring winner of VP debate: 'This was a massacre',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/conservative-social-media-reactions-pour-in-declaring-winner-vp-debate-massacre,2024-10-02T08:11:16Z,"A panel of Republicans, Democrats, and Independents give a show of hands in support of either JD Vance or Tim Walz after Tuesday nights Vice Presidential Debate.

Reactions from conservatives on social media poured in during and following the first and only vice presidential debate on Tuesday night with the majority praising JD Vance for his performance.

""This was a massacre,"" Outkick founder Clay Travis posted on X. ""JD Vance absolutely destroyed Tim Walz.""

""JD Vance just won big,"" conservative commentator Charlie Kirk posted on X along with a video montage of facial reactions by the two candidates. ""And it wasn't even close.""

""Tonight's debate underscored that the Harris-Walz ticket is the most radical in our nation's history,"" Jessica Anderson, President of Sentinel Action Fund, said in a statement.

WALZ STUNS INTERNET WITH VP DEBATE GAFFE: 'I'VE BECOME FRIENDS WITH SCHOOL SHOOTERS'

""As Governor, Walz implemented his far-left agenda in Minnesota, with soft-on-crime policies, authoritarian COVID lockdowns, and support for limitless abortion. As Vice President, he will expand his extremism beyond Minnesota as the unapologetic wingman for Kamala Harris.""

""Vance absolutely crushed it tonight and secured a very bright future in the GOP,"" American Principles Project President Terry Schilling posted on X.

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION'

""Very proud of JD for a stellar performance tonight,"" former presidential candidate Vivek Ramasawmy posted on X. ""And my condolences to Tim Walz - it was unkind for them to put him in this position.""

""JD Vance won big and demonstrated why he was a fantastic pick by President Trump,"" Arkansas GOP Sen. Tom Cotton posted on X. ""He skillfully contrasted Trump's record of peace and prosperity with Kamala's record of disaster.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

The Harris campaign released a statement following the debate expressing why it believes that Walz, not Vance, had the strongest night.

""Tonight, Governor Walz showed exactly why Vice President Harris picked him: he is a leader who cares about the issues that matter most to the American people,"" Harris-Walz Campaign Chair Jen O'Malley Dillon said in a statement. ""In the debate, Americans got to see a real contrast: a straight talker focused on sharing real solutions, and a slick politician who spent the whole night defending Donald Trump's division and failures.""

""On every single issue - the economy, health care, foreign policy, reproductive freedom, gun violence - Governor Walz won. He spoke passionately about the Vice President's vision for a new way forward for the country. And in what was the most critical moment of the entire debate, which came in its final exchange, he stood up for our Constitution, while JD Vance admitted he'd put Trump ahead of the country.""

O'Malley Dillon continued, ""The choice facing the American people in November was on full display tonight: between charting a new way forward, or going backwards. Vice President Harris believes that the American people deserve to see her and Trump on the debate stage one more time. She will be in Atlanta on October 23 - Donald Trump should step up and face the voters.""

The Trump campaign said in a statement that Vance ""unequivocally won tonight's debate in dominating fashion"" in what was ""the best debate performance from any Vice-Presidential candidate in history.""

""Senator Vance spoke the truth, eloquently prosecuted the case against Kamala Harris' failed record, and effectively held Governor Tim Walz accountable for his lies on behalf of the Harris-Biden Administration,"" Trump senior advisers Susie Wiles and Chris LaCivita said. ""Senator Vance also perfectly articulated the Trump-Vance vision to make America safe again with their plan to launch the largest mass deportation operation in history; to make America strong again with a peace through strength foreign policy agenda; and to make America wealthy again by cutting taxes, unleashing American energy dominance, and ending inflation.""

""Tonight, Senator Vance proved why President Trump chose him as his running mate. Together, they make the strongest and most dynamic presidential ticket ever, and they are going to win on November 5th."""
Mothers who lost daughters to illegal immigrants say VP Harris' border trip was 'political stunt',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/mothers-lost-daughters-illegal-immigrants-vp-harris-border-trip-political-stunt,2024-10-02T08:07:02Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Two mothers who lost their daughters to illegal immigrants called out VP Kamala Harris for not reaching out to their families and called the vice president's border trip a ""sham"" and a political stunt.

""I lost my 12-year-old daughter to illegal immigrants that the Biden-Harris administration policies, border policies have let in this country, and we're not safe anymore,"" Alexis Nungaray, who lost her daughter Jocelyn, said on ""Hannity"" Monday.

Jocelyn Nungaray was sexually assaulted before being strangled and left dead in a Houston creek by two illegal immigrants from Venezuela in June.

HARRIS HEADS TO SOUTHERN BORDER LOOKING TO FLIP SCRIPT ON IMMIGRATION CRITICISMS

""I think Kamala Harris's border trip this past Friday was such a sham. It was the most disgraced, hollow effort I have ever seen from a candidate for presidency,"" she added.

Harris visited the southern border in Douglas, Arizona on Friday; Arizona is a swing state that is currently considered a ""toss up"" for the presidential race, according to the latest Fox News Power Rankings.

Nungaray said, ""it pissed me the hell off when I saw it. She's been in charge of the border for more than three years. She's done absolutely nothing.""

She added that Harris had her people there to capture the ""right angles"" during her border trip, calling it a photo-op for ""political gain.""

Nungaray said it was ""disgusting"" that she was only at the border for approximately ""20 minutes"" and didn't speak to any ""ground people or agents.""

Nungaray said when Trump visited the border she was invited, but she was not invited by Harris.

""If I was there this time and I would have witnessed how she handled that entire interaction, I would have walked up to her and I would have asked her, 'with this same effort you're giving, which is not any, would it be the same if this was your daughter that you had to bury?'"" said Nungaray.

Additionally, Nungaray said Harris has not reached out to her family to ""even give condolences.""

""It's because of people like Kamala Harris and [Democrat] Collin Allred, who's running for senator in Texas, which is where I'm at. People like that, they don't keep the people safe. They don't keep our children safe. We need somebody who will actually make change and actually do something. And that's not Kamala.""

Patty Morin, who lost her daughter Rachel Morin to an illegal immigrant, called out Harris as well.

Rachel Morin, a mother of five, was raped and murdered by an illegal immigrant from El Salvador in an affluent Baltimore suburb north of the city while going on a run in 2023.

""She's done nothing the last four years. She's denied that there's been a problem. She hasn't even acknowledged the murders of my daughter or Alexis's or some of the other victims,"" Morin said on ""Hannity.""

""This whole thing going to the border is just a political stunt, hoping that she's going to check off a box and win some points.""

""[Harris] has not done anything to keep America safe at all,"" Morin added.

Nungaray said she felt ""empathy"" from former President Trump when he reached out to the family.

""It wasn't him calling me as a previous president. It was him calling me as a father. As someone who has kids, someone who couldn't even imagine what it would be like if this was their child.""

Morin said, ""President Trump has reached out to our family multiple times, to multiple members. He's been very compassionate and genuinely cares about our family and our recovering from this tragedy.""

Vice President Kamala Harris visited the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona on Friday, the first time she has been to the border since 2021. It comes as her campaign is being dogged by her record on illegal immigration.

""After years of not just ignoring the problem, but helping create it, Vice President Kamala is finally headed down to the border,"" the National Border Patrol Council said in a statement. ""This is nothing more than for her to check the box, but what it is in reality is a slap in the face towards the men and women that put their lives on the line every day, and also a slap in the face to the American public. Where has she been?""

Harris became vice president in 2021 and the administration immediately rolled back a number of Trump-era initiatives and attempted to place a moratorium on deportations.

Migrant numbers skyrocketed, and Biden told reporters in March that Harris would be put in charge of tackling root causes, issues like climate change, poverty and violence that the administration believes was driving migrants north.

It quickly led to Harris being dubbed by media outlets and Republicans as the ""border czar."" The White House rejected that title, but it has made her a figurehead along with DHS Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas for the crisis.

""The border is secure, but we also have a broken immigration system, in particular over the last four years before we came in, and it needs to be fixed,"" Harris said on NBC in 2022.

Fiscal year 2023 broke the record for migrant encounters with over 2.4 million, while December had nearly 250,000 encounters in a single month."
"Politics hijacks hurricane devastation in the South, Biden calls Trump a liar",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/politics-hijacks-hurricane-devastation-south-biden-calls-trump-liar,2024-10-02T07:15:37Z,"Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee (R) reacts to Hurricane Helene response from Biden and Harris and said visiting areas affected by the storm helps bring additional help and support.

Television news, with few exceptions, completely botched the unimaginable devastation that struck western North Carolina over the weekend.

Once Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida and headed inland, officials assumed it would lose strength. Instead, cities like Asheville, and eastern Tennessee, were hit with an almost biblical level of flooding, leaving a trail of impassable roads and collapsed bridges.

Why was this not the lead story everywhere?

To be candid, North Carolina is just a blip on the radar of the coastal media elites, dismissed as fly-over country. Most news organizations don't have a single reporter based there.

NORTH CAROLINA REELING FROM DEVASTATING HELENE AS DEATH TOLL CLIMBS: 'NEVER SEEN ANYTHING QUITE LIKE THIS'

President Biden just put out statements over the weekend, adding to the sense that this wasn't a Katrina-level crisis. I went to New Orleans eight months after that 2005 storm and was stunned to see mile after mile and after mile of uninhabited suburban homes damaged by the flooding.

Imagine if the same level of flooding hit northern New Jersey, right across from Manhattan. There would have been 500 times as much coverage. In fact, we had a real-life example in Superstorm Sandy, which rightly drew enormous media attention.

Many shows had their B teams in, with few taking charge and ordering a full-scale mobilization on the story.

I was just realizing the magnitude of the destruction on my show when leadoff guest Mary Katharine Ham, who's from North Carolina, texted me an hour before airtime and pushed to cover the story that was being largely ignored. It was a packed program, but I gave her a couple of minutes to talk about it on ""Media Buzz.""

By Monday, perhaps realizing that they looked terrible, TV outlets shifted gears and started constant coverage of the plight of North Carolina, interviewing local officials and survivors. But their journalists faced the challenge of getting to a mountainous region that was isolated and in some towns all but wiped out.

And yet the New York Times and Washington Post did a terrific job of getting their reporters to produce one front-page story after another from the city of Asheville, an artsy town partially submerged by the monster flooding.

KAMALA HARRIS' SOFT MEDIA INTERVIEWS ARE A 'BETRAYAL OF JOURNALISM': MARY KATHARINE HAM

As the Times put it, the storm left ""at least 37 people dead in the region and communities struggling to cope without water, food, power, gasoline and cellphone service.""

The Washington Post, from Canton, N.C.: ""Doris Towers awoke to the beeping of her husband's dialysis machine early Friday morning, meaning it had lost power. Her neighbor's Christmas lights, still up from last year, had gone out. Those were early hints of Helene's destruction to come. She hadn't known a storm was on the way.

""Across the mountains in Swannanoa, Joe Dancy and Jenna Shaw got up before dawn to walk their dog and saw floodwaters creeping toward their house. An hour later, they were climbing out a window with the help of a National Guard soldier.""

Biden, who will visit North Carolina today - Kamala Harris is also planning a visit-addressed the nation on Monday morning with his trademark empathy: ""I'm here to tell every single survivor in these impacted areas that we will be there with you as long as it takes.""

But the president, who kept coughing because of a cold, should have given that speech on Sunday. That would have spurred the journalists into action, because they often follow the White House, and instead left the impression that no one was in charge.

Donald Trump, meanwhile, visited a shelter in Valdosta, Ga., and said, reading from notes:

TRUMP LAUNCHES GOFUNDME TO HELP HURRICANE HELENE VICTIMS, RAISES MORE THAN $1M

""As you know, our country is in the final weeks of a hard-fought national election. At a time like this when a crisis hits, when our fellow citizens cry out in need, none of that matters. We're not talking about politics now. We have to all get together and get this solved.""

The important thing is that Trump, working with Franklin Graham, son of Rev. Billy, who heads a Christian relief group, brought plenty of supplies.

But the former president didn't stay on that high road for long. He posted that Biden and Harris ""have left Americans to drown in North Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, Alabama, and elsewhere in the South.""

FEMA officials have been working furiously - more than 3,300 federal agents are on the ground-and Harris, canceling several events, returned to Washington for a briefing from agency chief Deanne Criswell, and addressed officials there about the ""heartbreaking"" losses.

Trump also claimed that GOP Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp had not been able to reach Biden. But Kemp told reporters he did talk to Biden and the president ""offered that if there are other things that we need just to call him directly, which - I appreciated that.""

""He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying,"" Biden said. ""I don't know why he does this. I don't care what he says about me. I care about what he communicates to people that are in need. He implies that we're not doing everything possible. We are.""

Trump also suggested, without evidence, that the Biden-Harris administration is deliberately not helping Republicans in red counties.

Vance vs. Walz debate: Top takeaways from VP candidates' face-off,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/vance-vs-walz-debate-top-takeaways-from-vp-candidates-face-off,2024-10-02T05:50:19Z,"In recent weeks, Tim Walz' team tried to lower expectations for his debate with rival JD Vance. Now we know why.

Democratic vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Walz did not turn in a disastrous performance on the debate stage, but he was clearly outclassed by Ohio Sen. Vance. Trump supporters who have questioned the young Ohio senator's qualifications for the nation's second-highest office, or asked why the former president chose him to be his running mate, slept better on Tuesday night. He was sharp, appealing, and policy-savvy. Most important, Vance totally upended the media's unflattering characterization of him by being sympathetic, respectful and likeable.

Vance had the advantage of having held dozens of press interviews in recent weeks; he was ready and tested. By contrast, Walz has done almost no unscripted encounters with the media since he became the Democrats' vice-presidential candidate; his inability to go beyond talking points and delve deep into policy was not surprising.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

Walz spent much of the debate talking about programs he claimed to have successfully enacted in Minnesota, like paid family leave. What he was supposed to do on Tuesday night was make the case for running mate Vice President Kamala Harris.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

As with the ABC presidential debate between Donald Trump and Kamala Harris, the CBS News moderators embarrassed themselves by clearly favoring the Democrat contestant. Moreover, CBS' Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell affected a grating school-marmish tone, overly eager to chaperone what was an extremely orderly debate.

Their questions featured well-worn Democrat priorities (climate change, abortion) and they largely avoided topics that could have played well for Vance, like crime. O'Donnell challenged the senator on Trump formerly calling climate change a ""hoax"" and then asserted gratuitously that ""the overwhelming consensus is that the climate is changing.""

Moreover, having said they would not fact-check the candidates, the two women intervened more than once to question a response from Vance, while doing so only one time with Walz.

Unhappily for the Minnesota governor, that one probing question was calamitous. Asked why he had falsely claimed to be in Hong Kong during the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre, Walz launched into a word salad that would have made Kamala Harris proud, talking about his experiences traveling in China. Asked again to answer why he had been untruthful, Walz misfired and looked stunned. In effect, he was caught out in a lie. Since he has a history of spinning falsehoods about his past, and especially about his military rank, this was not helpful.

Vance, like Walz, was meant to argue the case for his running mate, and that he did. When the moderators and Walz derided Trump's claim during the presidential debate that he had the ""concept of a plan"" on health care, Vance said that Trump did not have a plan - he had a record. More than once during the evening he reminded the audience that during Trump's presidency inflation was low, the border was closed and the world was at peace.

KAMALA HARRIS MAKES A DESPERATE MOVE ON A CRITICAL ISSUE TO SAVE A SINKING CAMPAIGN

When moderator Margaret Brennan pushed Vance to explain why Trump had abandoned the Iran nuclear deal, thus purportedly allowing the terror state to speed up its efforts to build a nuclear weapon, Vance noted that for the past three-plus years Harris and Biden have been in charge. He rightly pointed out that they helped rebuild Iran's ability to wage war by not enforcing the Trump sanctions, thus allowing the mullahs to grow their income by $100 billion. With Iran just having attacked Israel with 180 missiles, Vance's referencing the Reagan-Trump doctrine of peace through strength resonated.

While Walz repeated Harris' vague promises about making life better for middle class families, Vance reminded the audience that take-home pay had risen under Trump and inflation was low, while under Harris, prices on everything from food to housing had shot up more than 20%. When Walz claimed economists backed Harris' plan over Trump's, Vance responded that Trump didn't have Ph.D.s on his team, he had common sense.

When Walz accused Trump of wanting to enact tariffs on imports, which would serve as a new tax on Americans, Vance congratulated President Joe Biden on keeping the former president's tariffs on China in place, defusing the issue.

Over and over during the nearly two hour debate, Vance asked the most salient question, also posed by Trump during his debate. Harris has been in the White House for the past three and a half years - why hasn't she moved forward on the policies she now claims will solve the nation's problems?

Vance clearly won the dispute over the border, noting that Harris had bragged for three years about undoing all the restrictions that Trump put in place. When Brennan challenged Vance on how Trump would handle separating families while carrying out deportations, Vance referred to the horrifying report that the Department of Homeland Security has lost track of more than 320,000 children brought across the border illegally - a damning and heartbreaking situation that has resulted from Harris' open border.

Not surprisingly, the debate got heated on the subject of abortion. Vance criticized the Minnesota law signed by Walz that does not require the doctor to do everything necessary for the care of a baby that survives a late-term abortion. Walz disputed the characterization, but Vance is correct. Walz, meanwhile, charged Vance with having earlier backed a 15-week national abortion ban. Vance explained that he shares Trump's view that the states are now charged with setting the regulations.

The candidates sparred on other topics, and took expected swipes at each other's running mates, but both maintained their composure and even agreed that on some issues, like school safety, they could likely find some common ground. Especially given the Harris-Walz strategy of avoiding scrutiny and trying to hide their progressive agendas, it was an unusually useful event for America's voters.

The winner of the night, without a doubt, was JD Vance. Will it matter? After all, many argue that no one votes for the V.P. But voters tell pollsters they do not enough about Kamala Harris and Tim Walz.

Now they know more, and on the basis of Tuesday night's performance, Vance might have won over a few folks. With the race a dead heat, everything matters."

Ohio Sen. JD Vance's argument that the U.S. needed to ""stop the bleeding"" at the border during Tuesday's debate elicited a mixed response from voters,

""Before we talk about deportations, we have to stop the bleeding,"" Vance argued during Tuesday's debate. ""We have a historic immigration crisis because Kamala Harris started and said that she wanted to undo all of Donald Trump's border policies.""

According to Fox News debate dials, which measure how Republican, Democrat, and Independent voters are responding to particular answers by candidates during the debate, the response by Vance received mixed responses.

While Republican views of Vance's answers had an immediate positive response, Democratic viewers of the debate went in an opposite direction, the dials showed. Independents, meanwhile, hovered around 50% approval with Vance's answer.

Voters began to see Vance's response in a more positive light when he touched on former President Donald Trump's border policies, arguing that the next administration should return to handling the border similar to how Trump did during his four years in office.

""You've gotta reimplement Donald Trump's border policies, build the wall, reimplement deportations,"" Vance said, garnering an improved response from independent voters and a very positive response from Republicans. Meanwhile, Democratic voters remained sour on the Ohio Senator's answer.

Voters also responded well to Vance's remarks on deportation, where the Ohio Senator argued in favor of focusing on those who have committed crimes in addition to crossing the border illegally.

JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz's performances at the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

The largely civil and arguably quite informative debate between Democratic nominee Gov. Tim Walz and Republican nominee Sen. JD Vance on Tuesday night has underscored one thing. We need another presidential debate.

Both Walz and Vance stuck to familiar positions on the issues on the debate stage, whether it was on the economy, health care, energy or immigration. No new ground was broken, no dramatic changes in policy were unveiled.

Still, the debate, in my estimation, was very important for a fundamental reason: it was civil, it was informative, and it included a surprisingly high degree of bipartisanship that has been noticeably absent from the 2024 presidential race.

It is certain that Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump watched the debate. And both, I am sure, concluded that their respective running mates did an excellent job in both underscoring their core positions as well as attacking their rivals.

VANCE, WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE ENDS WITH BOTH CANDIDATES TOUTING 'NEW' FUTURE

But most importantly, on Tuesday night there was a comment that I think both candidates underscored in their own way: That we can do better as Americans, we can solve our problems and provide leadership as people who disagree, and sometimes vigorously, but have a broader purpose beyond our narrow partisan concerns.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

This is not simply a homily. It's much more. It is a large-scale call for a different kind of politics, even if implicitly made by both candidates, it is a recognition of the extraordinary challenges we face, both domestically and internationally, in the wake of Iran's attack on Israel. And most of all, it underscores to me why both presidential candidates need to quickly accept the invitation of various news networks for another debate or more debates in the final 35 days of this campaign.

It's virtually certain that no minds were changed on Tuesday night.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

To be sure, the pundits will be vetting what the candidates said or didn't say about immigration and abortion. Two topics on which they disagree vehemently. But the two vice presidential candidates were largely repeating and underscoring what their respective nominees have said and believe.

The key now is for the media to focus on what the American people want and require as this extraordinary race comes down to the finish line. The two presidential campaigns need to face off, at least once, if not more times, to discuss and debate their positions on the issues with a greater degree of specificity and precision than they have done previously.

The 2024 presidential race is now an effective statistical tie. This is especially true when one looks at the seven key swing states in this election. There is a degree of uncertainty about precisely where the candidates stand on the important issues facing our country after a raucous presidential debate last month that was more personally divisive than it was informative.

JD VANCE REMINDS CBS MODERATORS OF DEBATE RULES AFTER THEY TRY TO FACT-CHECK HIM

For us to make an informed choice as Americans, we need to replicate what happened on Tuesday night with Kamala Harris and Donald Trump. The two presidential candidates need to tell us, in programmatic terms, what they will do on the economy, immigration, crime, health care, energy and, of course, on foreign affairs, a critical topic which did not get anywhere near the attention it deserved and required.

The level of dissatisfaction of the American electorate with the candidates and with the political process cannot be overestimated. We saw what the American people deserve but have not received until now in this presidential election.

The nearly two-hour event underscored this key point: you can't just run on joy and you can't just run on bitterness about what has happened in the past.

Both vice presidential candidates were likable on Tuesday night. Vance had heretofore not been seen that way. On the debate stage, it was hard not to empathize with him, even if you disagreed with him. Likewise, Walz delivered as a likable everyman figure.

I came away from the presidential debate last month not wanting to have dinner with either Trump or Harris. After the V.P. debate, I wanted to get to know both candidates better.

My takeaway from Tuesday night is that, for virtually the first time in this election cycle, Vance and Walz quietly acknowledged that the electorate requires something more before Election Day. It's up to Trump and Harris to give it to them--in person--at least one more time, if not more."

JD Vance addresses the Iran Nuclear Deal during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Democrat vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off Tuesday night in their first -- and only -- debate, sparring over issues from foreign policy to border security; abortion to climate change; and introducing themselves and their records to the American people with just five weeks to Election Day.

Vice presidential debates are traditionally seen as second-tier, but with former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris unlikely to debate again before voters cast their ballots on Nov. 5th, the stakes were raised for their running mates as they attempted to tackle the most important issues facing the nation.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

CBS News anchors Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan moderated the debate in New York City Tuesday night, which was filled with more substantive policy discussion than personal jabs, on a day that began with nearly 50,000 unionized dock workers going on strike from Maine to Texas and ended with Iran launching its largest attack on Israel in history, firing nearly 250 ballistic missiles at the Jewish State.

The first question for Walz and Vance was whether they would support a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran.

A visibly shaky Walz had a tough start to the debate, pausing and stumbling over his words as he spoke about the need for ""steady leadership"" from the White House. Instead of answering the question, Walz took a shot at Trump.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter,"" Walz said, pointing to Trump's debate performance against Harris last month. ""It's clear, and the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment.""

But Vance, in his first answer, defended Trump, saying he ""delivered stability to the world, and he did it by establishing effective deterrence.""

""People were afraid of stepping out of line,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump recognized that for people to fear the United States, you needed peace through strength. They needed to recognize that if they got out of line, the United States global leadership would put stability and peace back in the world.""

As for a preemptive strike, Vance said ""it is up to Israel what they think they need to do to keep their country safe.""

""And we should support our allies wherever they are, when they're fighting the bad guys,"" Vance said.

Walz fired back, slamming the Trump administration for pulling out of the Iran Nuclear Deal, saying Iran is ""closer to a nuclear weapon than they were before because of Donald Trump's fickle leadership,"" while saying Harris is providing ""steady leadership.""

But Vance fired back.

""You blame Donald Trump, but who has been the vice president for the last three and a half years? And the answer is, your running mate -- not mine,"" Vance said.

Vance, again defending Trump, said he ""consistently made the world more secure.""

""Gov. Walz can criticize Donald Trump's tweets, but effective, smart diplomacy and peace through strength is how you bring stability back to a very broken world,"" Vance said. ""Donald Trump has already done it once before.""

Vance also urged voters to ask themselves ""when was the last time that an American president didn't have a major conflict break out?""

""The only answer is during the four years that Donald Trump was president,"" Vance said.

The debate shifted to the ongoing crisis at the southern border -- a top issue for voters.

Vance said he has already been to the border more than ""border czar"" Kamala Harris, while touting Trump's plan to secure the border.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

But Walz blasted Trump for his alleged efforts to get Republicans to vote against a border bill.

""As soon as it was getting ready to pass and actually tackle this, Donald Trump said no. told [lawmakers] to vote against it, because it gives him a campaign issue,"" Walz said. ""What would Donald Trump talk about if we actually did some of these things?""

On the same topic, moderators asked Vance whether he and Trump would support family separation as part of Trump's proposed ""mass deportation"" should he be elected.

""We have 320,000 children that the Department of Homeland Security has effectively lost,"" Vance explained. ""Some of them have been sex trafficking; some of them, hopefully are at homes with their families; some of them have been used as drug trafficking mules,"" Vance said. ""The real family separation policy in this country is, unfortunately, Kamala Harris's wide open southern border. And I'd ask my fellow Americans to remember when she came into office, she said she was going to do this. Real leadership would be saying, you know what, I screwed up. We're going to go back to Donald Trump's border policies. I wish that she would do that. It would be good for all of us.""

Walz pushed back, saying children have not been used as ""drug mules,"" and defending Harris, saying she was attorney general in California and ""prosecuted transnational gangs for human trafficking and drugs.""

Walz also hit Vance over claims he had made about Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, saying he had demonized them.

""Look in Springfield Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed, you've got hospitals that are overwhelmed, you've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans,"" Vance said.

At that point, moderators tried to correct Vance--but the GOP vice presidential nominee pushed back, reminding that the moderators said they would not fact-check the candidates.

The moderators said that many Haitian residents in Springfield, Ohio have legal temporary status. Vance jumped in to ""say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process and tying it to a Harris-backed process, the moderators spoke over him, sarcastically thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""We have so much we have to get to, thank you so much for explaining the legal process,"" Margaret Brennan said before asking her co-moderator to ask the next question.

As for the issue of abortion, another top issue for voters this cycle, Walz maintained that he and Harris are pro-choice, while Vance said Republicans need to ""do so much better of a job at earning the American People's Trust back on this issue, where they frankly, just don't trust us.""

""And I think that's one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do. I want us as a Republican Party, to be pro-family in the fullest sense of the word. I want us to support fertility treatments. I want us to make it easier for moms to afford to have babies,"" Vance said. ""I want to make it easier for young families to afford a home so they can afford a place to raise that family. And I think there's so much that we can do on the public policy front just to give women more options right now.""

Vance echoed Trump's view of abortion--supporting the Supreme Court's decision to return the issue of abortion back to the states, while supporting exceptions for rape, incest, and life of the mother.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: TRUMP MAINTAINS LEAD ON 2 TOP ISSUES AHEAD OF VP DEBATE

""The proper way to handle this, as messy as democracy sometimes is, is to let voters make these decisions,"" Vance said. ""Let the individual states make their abortion policy. And I think that's what makes the most sense in a very big a very diverse. And let's be honest, sometimes a very, very messy and divided country.""

Meanwhile, the moderators switched to questions of leadership -- with the moderators pressing Walz on whether he was actually in China for the Tiananmen Square protests, like he claimed.

A visibly nervous Walz attempted to explain the discrepancy, ultimately saying he ""misspoke"" and was not there until later that year.

And the question for Vance was about his past criticisms of Trump.

Vance said, at the time, he disliked Trump because he ""believed some of the media stories that turned out to be dishonest fabrications of his record.""

""Donald Trump delivered for the American people rising wages, rising take-home pay, an economy that worked for normal Americans, a secure southern border. A lot of things, frankly, that I didn't think he'd be able to deliver on. And yeah, when you screw up, when you misspeak, when you get something wrong and you change your mind, you ought to be honest with the American people about it,"" Vance said.

Meanwhile, Vance offered his sympathies to Walz during the section of the debate focused on gun violence, when he learned that Walz's son had witnessed a shooting.

Walz said his 17-year-old son ""witnessed a shooting at a community center playing volleyball.""

""I didn't know that your 17-year-old witnessed a shooting. I'm sorry about that -- Christ, have mercy,"" Vance said.

The two spoke about school shootings and their plans to solve gun violence.

""We have to make the doors locked better. We have to make the doors stronger. We've got to make the windows stronger, and of course, we've got to increase school resource officers. Because the idea that we can magically wave a wand and take guns out of the hands of bad guys, it just doesn't fit with recent experience,"" Vance said.

Walz said the conversation was a good start but had to go further.

""Even though they have a high gun ownership rate in the country, there are reasonable things that we can do to make a difference. It's not infringing on your Second Amendment. And the idea to have some of these weapons out there, it just doesn't make any sense,"" he said.

And on another top issue this cycle: democracy.

Vance was pushed on his past comments, in which he said he would not have voted to certify the 2020 election results on Jan. 6, 2021.

Vance fired back at the assertion that Trump could pose a ""threat to democracy,"" saying that he believes ""we actually do have a threat to democracy in this country.""

""But unfortunately, it's not the threat to democracy that Kamala Harris and Tim Walz want to talk about. It is the threat of censorship. It's Americans casting aside lifelong friendships because of disagreements over politics. It's big technology companies silencing their fellow citizens,"" Vance said.

Walz redirected the discussion back to Jan. 6, 2021, blasting Trump and Republicans for allegedly denying the events of that day.

""I will tell you this, that when this is over, we need to shake hands this election and the winner needs to be the winner. This has got to stop. It's tearing our country apart,"" Walz said.

But Vance replied, saying it is ""really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th.""

""As we have done for 250 years in this country, we are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election. And of course, I hope that we win, and I think we're going to win,"" Vance said. ""But if Tim Walz is the next vice president, he'll have my prayers. He'll have my best wishes and he'll have my help whenever he wants it.""

But Vance reminded Americans that ""for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections.""

""Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board,"" Vance said. ""But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor.""

As the debate came to a close, Vance and Walz both promised voters a new direction for the United States.

""Kamala Harris is bringing us a new way forward,"" Walz said. ""She's bringing us a politics of joy. She's bringing real solutions for the middle class. And she's centering you at the heart of that, all the while asking everyone, join this movement. Make your voices heard.""

Vance also gave a message of change to the voters.

""We need change. We need a new direction. We need a president who has already done this once before and did it well. Please vote for Donald Trump,"" Vance said. ""And whether you vote for me or vote for Tim Walz, I just want to say I'm so proud to be doing this and I'm rooting for you.

Walz came into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating. Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable.

Heading into the debate, Vance had been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Both running mates get right back on the campaign trail on Wednesday in two of the key seven battleground states that will likely determine whether Harris or Trump succeed President Biden in the White House.

Vance holds campaign events in Auburn Hills and Marne, Michigan. And Walz takes part in a campaign bus tour swing through parts of central Pennsylvania which kicks off at the airport in Harrisburg, the state capital."

Tim Walz, D-Minn., discusses abortion access during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate. (Courtesy: CBS News)

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz claimed during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws following the overturning of Roe, despite doctors previously denouncing such a narrative as ""fearmongering.""

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe versus Wade,"" he said.

Walz joined Ohio Sen. JD Vance in New York City on Tuesday evening where the pair squared off on key voter issues this election cycle, including the economy, immigration and abortion.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022. Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Members of the Democratic Party, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying a healthcare provider will only start providing that care when you're about to die?"" Harris said during an Atlanta campaign event last month, while citing Thurman's death.

OB-GYNs have since criticized the narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, but was instead caused by alleged complications from abortion pills, as doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected.

As Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz faced off in the Vice Presidential debate in New York City Tuesday, both parties took to social media to express support for their candidate, with Democrats fact checking Vance on every point.

Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg claimed Walz was ""laying down facts"" and that Vance was ""unaware"" that the U.S. energy production was up.

TIM WALZ REVISES NUMBER OF TIMES HE WENT TO CHINA

California Gov. Gavin Newsom also fact checked Vance and said if he and Donald Trump were elected, American families would pay a high cost.

Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., said Vance made ""false"" claims about the Middle East.

""Vance says Trump ""restored deterrence"" in the Middle East. Totally false. Iran and its proxies weren't shooting at U.S. troops UNTIL Trump became President,"" Murphy wrote.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer applauded Walz for ""standing up for American workers.""

""Michigan remembers what happened under Donald Trump. Hundreds of thousands of jobs were lost across all industries, including manufacturing. The Biden-Harris administration was critical to bringing jobs back to Michigan.""

Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., alleged that Trump and Vance's ""Project 2025 agenda will raise costs on Arizona families while giving more tax breaks and power to big corporations.""

""@KamalaHarris and @Tim_Walz will lower costs and build an economy that works for all Americans.""

Project 2025 refers to a set of conservative policy proposals from the Heritage Foundation and has turned into a right-wing-'boogeyman' style Democratic talking point and fodder for Trump critics.

Republican lawmakers and top voices reacted as Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance faced-off in New York City.

""Senator JD Vance spitting the cold hard TRUTH on the debate stage,"" Trump 2024 national press secretary Karoline Leavitt wrote on X. ""Total domination and we are only 20 minutes in.""

The debate in New York City on CBS News was Walz and Vance's only debate prior to the monumental election on Nov. 5.

""Tim Walz is as radical as they come on the issue of immigration,"" Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., wrote on X. ""As governor of Minnesota, he supported free health care, free college tuition, and driver's licenses for illegal immigrants. Innocent Americans have been assaulted & murdered because of this border crisis.""

The debate began with CBS News moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan asking the candidates about their Middle East policy after Iran attacked Israel with a massive missile barrage.

""Tim Walz's answer on Israel was incomprehensible. Like Kamala--Walz has no idea what he is talking about,"" Sen. Tom Cotton, R-Ark., wrote on X. ""Kamala and Walz would make the chaos in the Middle East worse.""

""Iran rained missiles down on Israel TODAY, 1,350 days into Kamala Harris' tenure as Vice President, so naturally Tim Walz says it's Donald Trump's fault,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Tim Murtaugh wrote on X.

""JD knocks it out of the park with first question!!! Tim Walz implodes on first question in presentation, communication, and substance,"" Rep. Elise Stefanik, R-N.Y., wrote on X.

Republican voices highlighted the Kamala Harris campaign's immigration policy. Immigration is a top issue for American voters this year, as a record number say the situation at the southern border is a major problem or an outright emergency, according to the latest Fox News national survey.

""Law enforcement has been attacked. Deadly fentanyl has taken the lives of thousands of Americans,"" Texas Gov. Gregg Abbott wrote on X. ""Kamala Harris & Tim Walz support open border policies. They will make the border crisis WORSE.""

The candidates turned their attention to abortion, with Republicans criticizing Walz's abortion stance.

Tim Walz during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate on The Ingraham Angle.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz baffled the internet on Tuesday when he accidentally declared he has ""become friends with school shooters"" during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate against Sen. JD Vance.

The poorly timed mishap occurred when Walz was asked about changing positions on banning assault weapons, which he previously opposed but now supports.

""I sat in that office with those Sandy Hook parents. I've become friends with school shooters. I've seen it,"" Walz said.

SOME BIDEN 2020 VOTERS SAY THEY DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT KAMALA HARRIS

While Walz presumably meant he has become friendly with parents who lost children during horrific school shootings, the internet was sent into a tizzy.

""Walz saying he's become friends with school shooters, when he meant victims, is an innocent misstatement. Repeatedly lying about his military rank, his DUI, IVF and Hong Kong/Tiananmen Square are not innocent misstatements,"" Fox News contributor Guy Benson responded.

The Media Research Center called it an ""unfortunate slip of the tongue.""

Walz's critics were quick to mock Vice President Kamala Harris's running mate. Former President Trump asked if Walz is ""insane,"" Trump War Room quickly shared video of the gaffe and Walz was declared ""not ready for primetime"" by Trump national press secretary Karoline Leavitt.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

Fox News contributor Andy McCarthy downplayed the gaffe.

""Walz obviously misspoke, he didn't mean he'd become friends with school shooters. C'mon. This is a good, high minded debate as things go these days,"" McCarthy wrote.

Pundit John Podhoretz added, ""Walz obviously meant he's become friends with parents whose children were tragically shot. People will forgive his misstatement. As long as it's true.""

However, journalist Andy Ngo called it the ""gaffe of the 2024 election"" and influence Robby Starbuck asked, ""Umm... Does he want to explain that?""

Vice presidential candidates JD Vance and Tim Walz sparred on the issue of immigration in their debate Tuesday night, and Vance called out the immigration policies of VP Kamala Harris.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during the Tuesday night debate on CBS during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris' open border. It is a disgrace, Tim, and I actually think I agree with you. I think you want to solve this problem, but I don't think that Kamala Harris does.""

Walz repeatedly made the case that Trump shut down the Senate immigration bill earlier this year that VP Harris has said she will sign in a move he believes would have made strides at the border.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

Vance referred to the Biden-Harris record on immigration as a ""disgrace.""

""Look, what Tim said just doesn't pass the smell test,"" Vance said. ""For three years. Kamala Harris went out bragging that she was going to undo Donald Trump's border policy. She did exactly that. We had a record number of illegal crossings. We had a record number of fentanyl coming into our country.

""And now that she's running for president or a few months before, she says that somehow she got religion and cares a lot about a piece of legislation. The only thing that she did when she became the vice president, when she became the appointed border czar was to undo 94 Donald Trump executive actions that opened the border. This problem is leading to massive problems in the United States of America. Parents who can't afford health care, schools that are overwhelmed. It's got to stop. And it will when Donald Trump is president.""

A Harris campaign official told Fox News Digital that its focus group of undecided voters watching the debate reacted more strongly in favor of Walz's comments.

""Overall, Gov. Walz outperformed JD Vance in the immigration section, and the highest rating for Gov. Walz of the night so far was when he reminded viewers of Donald Trump's failed promise to build a wall, only building 2% of it,"" the campaign said."

Sen. JD Vance pushed back on the CBS News moderators who attempted to fact-check him in a contentious moment during the vice presidential debate on Tuesday.

Despite CBS announcing that it would not allow live fact-checking during the debate, moderator Margaret Brennan, interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

When Vance tried to push back on the fact-check, Brennan and her co-moderator Norah O'Donnell attempted to speak over Vance, insisting that they had to move on to the next question.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance reminded them. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz attempted to argue with him.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" she added when Vance continued to respond.

CBS News announced last week that it would not allow its moderators to partake in any fact checking or correcting live in an effort to avoid the fury sparked by ABC News for its partisan handling of the first presidential debate between former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris.

Walz forced to correct record on whether he was in China for the Tiananmen Square protests,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-forced-correct-record-whether-he-china-tiananmen-square-protests,2024-10-02T02:36:59Z,"Rep. James Comer, R-Ky., joins 'Jesse Watters Primetime' to discuss a House investigation into Democratic vice presidential candidate Tim Walz's alleged ties to China.

Democrat vice presidential nominee Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz was forced to answer questions about his controversial travel to China, and misstatements about those trips, during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. But Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

COMER SUBPOENAS DHS FOR RECORDS RELATING TO WALZ'S ALLEGED TIES TO CHINESE COMMUNIST PARTY

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly-shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms, and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

Walz said that as a ""passionate young teacher"" he had ""the opportunity in the summer of '89 to travel to China -- 35 years ago.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams, we would take baseball teams, we would take dancers, and we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times,"" Walz said.

Walz said his commitment ""from the beginning"" has been to ""make sure that I'm there for the people.""

""Many times, I will talk a lot. I will get caught up in rhetoric. But being there, the impact it made, the difference it made in my life, I learned a lot about China,"" Walz said. ""I hear the critiques of this.""

Walz said he would ""make the case that Donald Trump should have come on one of those trips with us.""

""I guarantee you he wouldn't be, praising XI Jinping about Covid. And I guarantee you he wouldn't start a trade war that he ends up losing,"" Walz said. ""So this is about trying to understand the world. It's about trying to do the best you can for your community, and then it's putting yourself out there and letting your folks understand what it is.""

He added: ""My commitment, whether it be through teaching, which I was good at or whether it was being a good soldier or was being a good member of Congress. Those are the things that I think are the values that people care about.""

But Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question, and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So I will just that's what I've said. So I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests went in and from that I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

Walz's ties to China have come under the microscope since becoming Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate.

HOUSE OVERSIGHT INVESTIGATING WALZ OVER 'LONGSTANDING CONNECTIONS' TO CHINA

House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., launched an investigation into Walz's alleged ties to the Chinese Communist Party.

Comer revealed that Walz has ""engaged and partnered with"" Chinese entities, making him ""susceptible"" to the CCP's strategy of ""elite capture,"" which seeks to co-opt influential figures in elite political, cultural and academic circles to ""influence the United States to the benefit of the communist regime and the detriment of Americans.""

Comer has pointed to reports that Walz, while working as a teacher in the 1990s, organized a trip to China for Alliance High School students. The costs were reportedly ""paid by the Chinese government.""

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Comer is investigating Walz's 1994-created private company named ""Educational Travel Adventures, Inc.,"" which coordinated annual student trips to China until 2003 and was led by Walz.

The company reportedly ""dissolved four days after he took congressional office in 2007.""

Comer said Walz has traveled to China an estimated ""30 times.""

Comer has now issued a subpoena for Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, compelling him to produce DHS records related to Walz's alleged ties to the CCP.

Walz, meanwhile, during a congressional hearing in 2016, said he had ""been to China dozens of times.""

""I've been there about 30 times,"" Walz told an agriculture-focused publication in 2016.

However, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson recently said to Minnesota Public Radio that the number was ""closer to 15 times."""

""Honestly, Tim, I think he's got a tough job here because you've got to play Whac-A-Mole. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver rising take home pay, which of course he did. You've got to pretend that Donald Trump didn't deliver lower inflation, which of course he did,"" Vance said Tuesday evening during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate in New York City.

Vance was responding after Walz slammed the GOP ticket as one that protects billionaires with tax cuts and pledging that he's a ""union guy"" who wants to keep jobs in the U.S.

The economy is a top voter concern this election cycle, ranking alongside issues such as the immigration crisis, abortion and national security.

""I hope we have a conversation on health care then, senator,"" Walz said as Vance wrapped up his points on the economy.

""Please,"" Vance responded.

Tim Walz has the capacity to be 'sharp' during the CBS Vice Presidential Debate on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz kicked off his debate against Ohio Sen. JD Vance on shaky footing when he was first asked about his foreign policy platform in the Middle East.

""Governor Walz, if you were the final voice in the Situation Room, would you support or oppose a preemptive strike by Israel on Iran?"" CBS' Margaret Brennan asked Walz on Tuesday evening in New York City during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

Walz thanked the moderators for hosting him before delivering a halting and stammering answer while calling for ""steady leadership.""

""Iran, our I, Israel's ability to be able to defend itself is absolutely fundamental. Getting its hostages back, fundamental. And ending the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. But the expansion of Israel and its proxies is an absolute fundamental necessity for the United States to have to steady leadership there. You saw it experienced today where along with our Israeli partners and our coalition, able to stop the incoming attack,"" Walz responded, taking a few pauses between words.

ISRAEL UNDER ATTACK: IRAN LAUNCHES MISSILES, GUNMEN KILL AT LEAST 8 NEAR TEL AVIV

Earlier Tuesday, Iran launched more than 100 ballistic missiles at Israel. War broke out in Israel nearly one year ago on Oct. 7 when Hamas launched attacks on the nation.

""What's fundamental here is that steady leadership is going to matter. It's clear. And the world saw it on that debate stage a few weeks ago, a nearly 80-year-old Donald Trump talking about crowd sizes is not what we need in this moment,"" Walz continued.

GOP LEADER SAYS VANCE 'ABSOLUTELY PREPARED' FOR VP DEBATE SHOWDOWN WITH WALZ

Walz continued his response by taking shots at former President Donald Trump and his former administration officials.

""His chief of staff, John Kelly, said that he was the most flawed human being you'd ever met. And both of his secretaries of defense and his national security advisers said he should be nowhere near the White House. Now, the person closest to them... said he's unfit for the highest office. That was Sen. Vance,"" Walz said, referring to Vance's previous criticisms of Trump before he was elected to the White House in 2016.

""What we've seen out of Vice President Harris is we've seen steady leadership.

Former CBS News anchor Dan Rather scolded his former employer for declining to fact-check during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, saying the network is ""trying to avoid the blowback ABC got"" for fact-checking former President Trump.

Rather stepped down from his role as CBS' evening news anchor in 2005 and eventually left the network the following year after reporting a discredited story about then-President George W. Bush. He took to Substack Monday ahead of his old employer hosting the CBS Vice Presidential Debate between Sen. JD Vance and Gov. Tim Walz, which will be moderated by Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell.

""There are few guarantees in life, but odds are that more than one lie will be told by Donald Trump's protege and running mate, JD Vance. If there's one thing Vance has learned from Trump, it's that lying to get ahead is OK. If you get caught, just double down and lie some more. Who's going to fact check you? Well, apparently not CBS News,"" Rather wrote.

ABC PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: MODERATORS DAVID MUIR AND LINSEY DAVIS FACT-CHECK TRUMP 5 TIMES, 0 FOR HARRIS

Rather said he was ""reluctant"" to criticize CBS News, where he worked for 45 years, but he feels it is necessary. His call for fact-checking come after ABC News was widely criticized for correcting Trump multiple times but failing to fact-check Vice President Kamala Harris during the recent presidential debate.

""With that as background, it is necessary to report and comment on the fact that CBS News has decided not to fact-check the candidates in real time. I would love to know what went into this decision, because it feels spineless, especially after ABC's Linsey Davis and David Muir effectively and correctly fact-checked Trump during the debate with Kamala Harris,"" Rather wrote.

""CBS says it is up to the candidates to fact-check, though 'the moderators will facilitate those opportunities' during rebuttal time,"" he continued. ""While both fact-checking (ABC during the Harris-Trump debate) and not fact-checking (CNN during the Biden-Trump debate) have drawn criticism this year, for the most part, the criticism was unsurprisingly partisan.""

Rather noted that CBS News would fact-check the candidates online, but dismissed viewers for being able to follow along in real time.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS RAISES EYEBROWS WITH ABORTION FACT-CHECK AGAINST TRUMP: 'COMPLETELY INTERJECTS HERSELF'

""Simply put, this 'rule,' imposed by CBS, incentivizes lying. It invites the participants to bend the truth, since their opponent then has to spend his rebuttal time calling out the lie, rather than giving an opposing view. And the calling out of a lie by an opponent rather than an impartial moderator is less credible,"" Rather wrote.

""It seems clear that CBS is trying to avoid the blowback ABC got after the presidential debate. A journalist, much less a news organization, should not be afraid to take heat,"" Rather continued. ""Their responsibility is to call out lies. If they don't do that on live television, during the most consequential election in modern history, they are the lesser for it. But the biggest loser is the American electorate.""

CBS News did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

CBS News did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Cheung was alluding to the testy exchange Trump had with veteran ""60 Minutes"" correspondent Lesley Stahl, who dismissed the Hunter Biden laptop scandal during their interview just days before the 2020 election.

At the time, Trump insisted that then-candidate Joe Biden was ""in the midst of a scandal.""

""He's not,"" Stahl gleefully replied.

""Of course he is, Lesley,"" Trump sternly doubled down.

""No, c'mon,"" Stahl continued to reject the president's claim, before lecturing him, ""This is '60 Minutes' and we can't put on things that we can't verify.""

Rep. Byron Donalds, R-Fla., accused Vice President Kamala Harris of breaking the economy during a heated exchange on ""The Breakfast Club,"" where he sparred with hosts over her role in handling the current inflation plaguing the U.S.

A discussion on Tuesday's episode of the show devolved into a fiery exchange between the lawmaker and the hosts after he blamed Harris for the failed economic policies of the Biden administration.

""I would argue we're not really thriving right now. This inflation, which by the way was brought to us by Kamala Harris, has really slowed people down from being able to excel,"" Donalds said.

VP HARRIS' TIE-BREAKER VOTES IN THE SENATE WERE KEY TO INFLATION-BOOSTING BIDEN POLICIES: EXPERT

""By Kamala?"" host Charlamagne Tha God replied. ""She's vice president. There's still a president.""

""Oh Charlamagne,"" Byron said, reminding listeners that Harris cast the tie-breaking vote on the $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan Act in 2021.

""She broke the tie that started this inflation that has hurt so many people in our country,"" Donalds said.

Guest-host Angela Rye dismissed Byron's argument as ""not true.""

""You sure you want to go there?"" the Florida Republican shot back, pulling out a pamphlet of ""facts"" from his suit jacket to back up his claim as Rye tried to speak over him.

Donalds argued that experts anticipated ""massive inflation"" if the American Rescue Plan was passed.

""That's what happened,"" he said.

""The problem we have in our economy today is that prices have gone up massively, wages adjusted for inflation is down, people's pocketbooks are hurting,"" he continued.

Donalds asked co-host DJ Envy, whether he would hire someone who broke a house to fix more houses.

When Rye wondered how his question was pertinent to the topic at hand, Donalds shot back, ""Chill, Angela.""

CRITICS BLAST HARRIS' GRASP OF INFLATION, ATTACK ON BUSINESS AHEAD OF POLICY SPEECH: 'LUNATIC BEHAVIOR'

""Because I'm bringing facts...so now you don't want to do it anymore? C'mon Angela, that's not right. I want to have a fact-based conversation,"" Donalds said.

Donalds posted a clip of the exchange on X later Tuesday, writing ""Democrat economists warned her it would cause inflation. And it did...It caused 20+% inflation. It created a cost-of-living crisis. It crushed hardworking Americans. Kamala broke our economy.""

The Harris campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Biden in the past has called assertions that the American Rescue Plan's substantial spending might have been a cause of the skyrocketing inflation ""bizarre,"" waving away the accusation.

Hours before the vice presidential debate, former President Donald Trump addressed a crowd at his campaign rally in Wisconsin and bashed the Biden administration over Iran's historic attack on Israel.

""A short time ago, Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at Israel... I've been talking about World War III for a long time, and I don't want to make predictions because the predictions always come true. We're not going to make [predictions]... but they are very close to global catastrophe,"" Trump said. ""We have a non-existent president and a non-existent vice president who should be in charge, but nobody knows what's going on.""

Trump's comments come after Israel said Iran launched 181 ballistic missiles at the country, marking the largest ballistic missile attack in history.

Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps said the attack was in retaliation for the killing of Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah in Beirut, Lebanon, in an Israeli airstrike late last week and the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Tehran in July, according to Fox News Chief Foreign Correspondent Trey Yingst.

IRAN ATTACK ON ISRAEL 'INEFFECTIVE' BUT A 'SIGNIFICANT ESCALATION': WHITE HOUSE

Iran's Revolutionary Guard warned in a statement released by Iranian state media that if Israel responds to the missile barrage, ""it will face crushing attacks.""

Trump accused President Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris of weak leadership on the world stage.

""That's why Israel was under attack just a little while ago. Because they don't respect our country anymore. The so-called enemy doesn't respect our country any longer,"" Trump said.

IRAN FIRES MULTIPLE MISSILE STRIKES ACROSS ISRAEL

Trump claimed Biden and Harris made Iran rich in a very short period of time.

""They have $300 billion now. They're rich. I mean, they pay 6 billion every time they have somebody that was kidnaped, it's always $6 billion,"" Trump said.

""Iran was on the verge of bankruptcy. They had no money left. They had no money for Hamas. They had no money for Hezbollah. The people they're fighting now, they would have been willing to make any deal. You could have made any deal. But Kamala flooded them with American cash and everything. Now, I mean, they're flooding them with cash. It's honestly not even believable,"" Trump continued.

National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan said the Iranian missile attack on Israel was ""defeated and ineffective"" and that the U.S. military coordinated with the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) to repel the strikes.

""U.S. naval destroyers joined Israeli Air Defense units in firing interceptors to shoot down inbound missiles. President Biden and Vice President Harris monitored the attack and the response from the White House Situation Room, joined in person and remotely by their national security team,"" Sullivan said.

Sullivan characterized the attack as a ""significant escalation"" while speaking at a White House briefing on Tuesday.

Sullivan said no deaths were reported on the Israeli side, although the White House is monitoring the reported death of a Palestinian civilian in Jericho in the West Bank.

""We do not know of any damage to aircraft or strategic military assets in Israel. In short, based on what we know at this point, this attack appears to have been defeated and ineffective. The word fog of war was invented for a situation like this. This is a fluid situation,"" he said.

Many missiles were intercepted by Israel's missile defense systems, while others did hit the ground.

The Pentagon says the U.S. fired approximately 12 interceptors against Iranian missiles.

Secretary of State Antony Blinken published an op-ed Tuesday touting the Biden-Harris administration's foreign policy record, stating they took drastic deviations from former President Trump, the same day Iran directly attacked Israel with hundreds of ballistic missiles.

Iran launched nearly 200 ballistic missiles towards targets in Israel Tuesday evening local time in what the administration called a ""signigicant escalation by Iran."" The indiscriminate rocket fire were part of the Shia regime's response to Israel assassinating nearly all of Hezbollah senior leadership, including long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah.

Hours before Iran's attack, Blinken's op-ed touted how Biden-Harris' ""renewal"" strategy post-Trump was working and strengthening America's interests abroad.

""The Biden administration's strategy has put the United States in a much stronger geopolitical position today than it was four years ago,"" Blinken said.

PENTAGON SENDING A 'FEW THOUSAND' PERSONNEL TO MIDDLE EAST DAY AFTER BIDEN SAID HE WOULDN'T ADD COMBAT TROOPS

Blinken said the administration prioritized international cooperation and avoided making decisions abroad in isolation.

""From day one, President Biden and Vice President Harris made a foundational choice that in a more competitive and combustible world, the United States cannot go it alone. If America wants to protect its security and create opportunities for its people, it must stand with those who have a stake in a free, open, secure, and prosperous world and stand up to those who threaten that world,"" he wrote. ""President Biden and Vice President Harris pursued a strategy of renewal, pairing historic investments in competitiveness at home with an intensive diplomatic campaign to revitalize partnerships abroad,"" he said. ""This twin-pillared strategy, they believed, was the best way to disabuse competitors of their assumptions that the United States was declining and diffident.""

Blinken also stated the war in Gaza is interconnected to Iran's maligned behavior.

""Without an end to the war in Gaza and a time-bound, credible path to statehood that addresses the Palestinians' legitimate aspirations and Israel's security needs, normalization cannot move forward. But if these efforts succeed, normalization would join Israel to a regional security architecture, unlock economic opportunities across the region, and isolate Iran and its proxies,"" he continued. ""Glimmers of such integration were on display in the coalition of countries, including Arab states, that helped Israel defend itself against an unprecedented direct attack from Iran in April.""

The State Department referred Fox News Digital to the department's briefing when asked for comment.

House Republicans have described Biden-Harris foreign policy as one aiming at ""appeasement,"" particularly towards Iran.

Jewish American leaders on Tuesday afternoon reacted to Iran's unprecedented missile attack against Israel.

The attack, which included more than a hundred missiles, according to Israel, came in response to the recent deaths of Hezbollah and Hamas leaders.

""The United States stands with its only democratic ally in the Middle East, Israel, as it defends itself and its people against evil,"" Ohio Republican Rep. Max Miller told Fox News Digital in a statement. ""Iran and its proxies must stop threatening the world.""

""I commend the effort to eliminate Hezbollah's Secretary General, Hassan Nasrallah, who is responsible for the deaths of Americans and countless innocent civilians,"" Miller wrote.

From his official congressional account, Moskowitz said his ""thoughts are with the people of Israel tonight.""

CNN data reporter Harry Enten said Tuesday that Sen. JD Vance had nothing to lose in his debate against Gov. Tim Walz because of his low favorability ratings.

""This is the net favorable ratings, -11 points for JD Vance. No bueno,"" Enten said. ""Tim Walz, look at that, a +4 net favorability rating.""

According to the favorability ratings, Vance has a lower net favorability than his running mate, former President Trump, whose net favorability rating is -9. However, Walz has a higher net rating than his running mate, Vice President Kamala Harris, who sits at a +1 net favorability rating.

""The bottom line is JD Vance not very well liked going into this first debate, but he really has nothing to lose because he's already the least liked VP nominee going into his first debate.

""I'm just a little worried about the expectations game at this point.

But he will be articulate and he will be prepared and he will be better than Trump was,"" she said on the liberal network on Sunday.

""I just think we need to lower expectations a little bit, because then we can all be pleasantly surprised if I'm wrong and that Tim Walz just mops the floor with him the same way Kamala Harris mopped the floor with Donald Trump,"" McCaskill added.

From August 6 to September 30, a whopping 71% of The Post's content was negative, according to its online search results. Just 1.4% was positive, while roughly 28% was neutral.

The search results included news reports, opinion pieces, political cartoons, videos and podcast links spanning from when his Democratic rival, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, was tapped by Vice President Kamala Harris as her running mate. Negative results include unflattering reports about the candidate.

CBS NEWS CASTS A LONG SHADOW OF ANTI-TRUMP BIAS AHEAD OF ITS VICE-PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Seventeen of the 49 negative results, or more than one-third, involved his comments about Springfield, Ohio. Three of them involved taking his quote about school shootings out of context when he said ""I don't like that this is a fact of life."" Also among the negative results were five separate fact-checks against Vance, three of them resulting in the harshest rating of ""Four Pinocchios.""

Last week, The Post made headlines after it obtained private messages Vance sent in 2020 critical of then-President Trump.

Perhaps the most prolific in the anti-Vance bashing is columnist Philip Bump, who has written at least ten pieces primarily knocking the Republican hopeful during the 55-day period.

Fellow columnist Jennifer Rubin is setting expectations low for Vance ahead of Tuesday night's vice-presidential debate with Walz, in a piece headlined, ""Vance had better buckle up: His debate might go as badly as Trump's.""

The only remotely positive article Fox News Digital was able to find was an op-ed with the headline ""JD Vance isn't wrong about the value of family caregivers.""

Meanwhile, Walz has gotten much rosier coverage since he joined the Democratic ticket. More than 50% of The Post's coverage was either positive or took a defensive stance of the Minnesota governor. Just 8% of the coverage was negative, and 41% of the results were neutral.

Two of the eight negative articles among the search results were on how Walz was facing ""new scrutiny"" over his military service record as well as his handling of the 2020 George Floyd riots in Minneapolis.

While Vance was the subject of five fact-checks, Walz was only the main subject of two, one of them rated ""Four Pinocchios."" Walz was also included among fact-checked speakers on Day 3 of the Democratic National Convention.

FOX NEWS MEDIA WILL PRESENT SPECIAL LIVE COVERAGE OF VANCE-WALZ DEBATE

The only opinion piece overtly critical of the governor that Fox News Digital was able to find was one written Aug. 30 by columnist Kathleen Parker about his history of dishonesty.

Despite largely keeping a low profile, particularly from the media, Walz was showered with glowing pieces by The Post right out of the gate.

""Tim Walz's journey from high school football coach to VP candidate,"" one headline read on the day Harris announced her running mate. The next day, columnist Michele L. Norris laid out ""6 reasons Tim Walz was the right choice."" The day after that, The Post published the story ""Harris and Walz seize on joyful message in contrast to darker Trump themes.""

According to The Post, Walz was a man of political evolution in stories like ""How Tim Walz went from NRA-endorsed to a gun-control advocate"" and ""How Black women shaped Tim Walz's politics after the death of George Floyd.""

Additionally, the ""Democracy Dies in Darkness"" paper made Walz into a fashion icon with stories like ""For Tim Walz, 'a dad in plaid,' dressing down is leveling up"" and ""Viral Harris-Walz camo hats riff on red-state style, draw ire of NRA."" He became the pinnacle of manliness in articles like ""Masculinity's check-engine light is on. Let Tim Walz have a look"" and ""Tim Walz as football coach: A rambunctious, rah-rah joker.""

More recently, The Post ran a headline on Sunday reading, ""Democrats, with 'Coach Walz' as VP pick, embrace political power of football."""

""The View"" co-host Whoopi Goldberg pushed back on ""Shazam!"" actor Zachary Levi on Tuesday and dismissed the notion that him announcing his support for former President Trump might be ""career suicide"" in liberal Hollywood.

""That's not necessarily true. From the beginning of Hollywood, it's always been a very right-leaning town, but I know you don't know much about the Hollywood history, so let me school you,"" Goldberg said.

""We are mixed, like America is, we're mixed. We're a mixed bunch and sometimes it may seem like there's more Democrats and sometimes it seems like there's more Republicans, but the truth of the matter is, very few people seem to bite it because they're Republican. Jon Voight, who is working,"" Goldberg continued.

Levi said that Hollywood was a very ""liberal town"" and suggested that his support for the former president might ""constitute career suicide."" He expressed his support for Trump while moderating an event on Saturday with former presidential candidate Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and former Democratic Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard.

Biden has 'privately complained' about how quickly Democrats have moved on from him: Report,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/biden-has-privately-complained-about-how-quickly-democrats-have-moved-from-him-report,2024-10-01T18:29:04Z,"President Biden had some fun on ""The View"" by pretending to squash former President Trump like a bug and said his former rival has no ""redeeming value.""

A new report disclosed that President Biden is feeling left out in the cold by the Democratic Party after going all in on Vice President Kamala Harris' presidential campaign.

According to the Monday NBC News report, Biden has mentioned to his allies his feeling that his accomplishments and legacy as president are being forgotten by the party, especially as Harris has tried to distance herself away from her boss' policies and forge her own political identity after replacing him on the Democratic presidential ticket.

""President Joe Biden has privately complained to allies that his name and his accomplishments have virtually disappeared from the national conversation and about how quickly the party that he has served for more than five decades appears to have moved on from him, according to six people familiar with his comments,"" the piece reported.

PELOSI DEMURS ON IF 'EVERYTHING IS OK' BETWEEN HER AND BIDEN: 'YOU'D HAVE TO ASK HIM'

According to these sources, the president has commented on Harris not mentioning him during recent campaign speeches, noting that he believes she should acknowledge his economic accomplishments while touting her own vision on the issue.

""Biden has noted at times that Vice President Kamala Harris... hasn't been mentioning him in her campaign speeches lately, including when she talks about an economy he believes his policies set on a positive trajectory, these people said,"" according to NBC.

Additionally, the sources told NBC that Biden ""was particularly stung"" by Harris' recent line during her debate with former President Trump in which she drew a stark distinction between her and her boss.

""Clearly, I am not Joe Biden. And I am certainly not Donald Trump. And what I do offer is a new generation of leadership for our country,"" the vice president said during the debate, drawing a stark contrast between her and Biden's policies, as Trump was trying to grill her over the current administration's record.

Those familiar with Biden's feelings on the matter acknowledged that he still wants Harris to win and ""that he plans to do whatever he can to help her,"" the report noted.

An anonymous senior Harris campaign official said that Biden ""always just says to her, 'The most important thing is that you win.'"" The official added, ""We have to tell people who she is and what she would do.""

They also noted, ""There wasn't a real interest in hearing about [Biden's] accomplishments when he was running. That's still the case.""

However, White House spokesperson Andrew Bates denied the claims made by these sources, telling the outlet, ""These uninformed claims are the polar opposite of the truth.""

""President Biden welcomes the strong response the American people are having to Vice President Harris' leadership and to policies that move us into the future, away from dangerous agendas from the past like MAGAnomics and abortion bans,"" Bates added.

The spokesperson doubled down on his rejection of these claims, telling Fox News Digital they are ""not"" true.

The sources have said that Biden understands the political reasoning behind shifting away from his record, though they noted it still ""frustrates him at times.""

""But while Biden is attuned to political realities, he also has expressed a range of emotions about his exit from the race -- from feeling his legacy rests on a Harris victory to anguishing over his imprint's vanishing from the national stage, according to the people familiar with his private comments,"" the article stated.

One source described his mixed emotions on the issue, stating, ""It's very complex.""

Another Harris campaign official defended Harris' pivot away from Biden, telling NBC, ""She has to become her own person. She needs to do that to win.""

Despite Biden's acceptance of Harris' candidacy, he maintains that he would have beaten Trump in November if he was still in the race. He told the co-hosts of ""The View"" last week that he was ""confident"" he could have beaten Trump and said he didn't sense an ""overwhelming reluctance"" about his re-election effort from fellow Democrats.

""I was confident I would beat Trump -- he's a loser,"" he declared.

DAVID MARCUS: The Vance vs. Walz debate is best scored using boxing rules,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-vance-vs-walz-debate-best-scored-using-boxing-rules,2024-10-01T17:53:41Z,"DEBATE DAY: Live coverage begins today at 8 p.m. ET for the Fox News Simulcast of the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate.

The first rule of deciding who won a major political debate is that nobody wins a major political debate. There is no final score as the buzzer sounds, no final wink to be tiddled, it is a purely subjective matter. And that will be true of the vice-presidential debate between Republican nominee JD Vance and Democratic nominee Tim Walz.

That having been said, I've recently adopted a method of scoring debates from the world of pugilistics, that I think actually gives a pretty decent assessment of what most American voters see.

My advice in picking a winner is to borrow the scoring system of a boxing match. The basic rules are relatively simple. In each round the boxer who wins the 3 minutes gets 10 points, the loser gets 9, unless there is a knockdown or it is overwhelming, in which case the round is scored 10-8. A tie is 10-10.

Obviously, a knockout ends the fight.

HEIGHTENED 'SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPORTANCE' AS VANCE, WALZ FACE OFF IN VP DEBATE

I first tried this approach last month with the Trump vs. Harris debate. And I wound up with Trump winning 157 to 150. It wasn't the only reason I thought and wrote that night that Trump won the debate, despite overwhelming media insistence that girl boss Kamala had kicked ass. But it was part of it.

And with polling showing no significant bump for Harris since their face-off and the fact that we've even seen some Trump swing state surge since their debate, my ostentatious declaration of a Trump victory looks a little less crazy today.

The legacy news media, who wanted any excuse to hand Harris a W anyway, viewed the tête-à-tête as a kind of Lifetime movie in which Harris had finally spoken truth to power, but I find in most of America that narrative doesn't have a whole lot of purchase. The voters want answers.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

That's where boxing scoring comes in. If openings, closings, and each question, are the ""rounds"" of the debate, you wind up with about 15. See what I'm saying? The incremental 10-9 or 10-8 scores of each, mirror the nuance of how swayable voters watch the event.

The basic philosophy behind boxing scoring is that the primary job is to survive the round, so if you manage that, you get an automatic 8 points, winning the round, and can only bump that up by at most 2.

One could argue there is a fundamental unfairness here, that if I am 40 percent better at landing punches in a round than my opponent, I only get a 10 percent point advantage in scoring, but that is also the beauty of the system. Fights aren't just about math.

This actually tracks very well with how political debates work.

The audience, which is to say the voters, do tend to see each question or issue as one round, and if Walz can get a 10-8 on abortion, or Vance can on the border, that goes a long way towards the kind of 7 point win I gave Trump over Harris.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

Another way to think of this is that 90 percent of Americans likely already know who they are voting for, only 10 percent can be swayed, and boxing's unique scoring system almost perfectly corresponds to this.

Eighty to 90 percent we are just scoring as a wash.

There is, of course, the chance of a knockout, but these days, that chance seems remote. Back when Reagan said ""There you go again,"" or Obama, in retrospect wrongly, told Romney the 1980s wanted their foreign policy back over fears regarding Russia, the possibility of something near consensus on the question existed.

Those days are no longer with us, if they aren't over forever.

Nobody really wins a debate, but we can still score them, we can still pay close attention to who is and isn't actually answering the questions, and that has a lot of value.

So give a shot, grab a pad and paper, if you still have those, and just jot down your score for each question, 10-10, 10-9 or 10-8. Like a Ouija board your political leanings might push the pen a bit, but even so, you might be surprised by the results.

As Mike Tyson once put it, everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face. Let's keep a close eye on the flying rhetorical hands of Tim Walz and JD Vance."

Former NFL star Antonio Brown drew backlash on social media this week over his post about Travis Kelce, which sideswiped pop star Taylor Swift in the process.

Brown was apparently keen on the Kansas City Chiefs' win over the Los Angeles Chargers, in which Kelce led the team with seven catches for 89 yards and set the team's all-time record for receptions. The Chiefs won the game 17-10.

The former wide receiver, who walked off the field while his Tampa Bay Buccaneers were playing the New York Jets, decided to fire off a wild post on X.

""Travis Kelce needs some black p----,"" he wrote. ""Bro Washed.""

It did not appear to go over well with the NFL world.

""Guy who spends Sundays on Twitter calls guy that is one year older than him and that is still playing 'washed'? OK. That checks out.,"" one person wrote on X.

Another person called Brown a ""f---in weirdo,"" while another added, ""Yeah the CTE winning.""

Brown has a history of saying outlandish things on X for engagement.

Brown also made a crude innuendo about Caitlin Clark back in May - weeks after the current WNBA star blocked him on social media.

"Trump edges Harris in North Carolina poll, state that hasn't voted Democratic since 2008",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-harris-struggle-north-carolina-hurricane-recovery-underway-poll,2024-10-01T16:18:21Z,"Swannanoa resident Zach Dasher joined 'Fox & Friends First' to discuss the 'complete devastation' left by Hurricane Helene and how he is taking action to help his community.

North Carolina remains a dead heat in the presidential race as the November elections draw ever nearer.

The state - which is now undergoing serious recovery efforts following the devastation of Hurricane Helene - has been consistently close in its political polling.

A new poll conducted by the Washington Post finds former President Trump leading with 50% of likely North Carolina voters compared to Vice President Harris' 48%.

BIDEN TO VISIT NORTH CAROLINA DAYS AFTER HELENE'S PATH OF DESTRUCTION LEAVES MANY DEVASTATED

Trump's slim lead is within the poll's +/- 3.5% margin of error, but the former president won the state in 2020 with a similarly tight 1.3% lead. The poll contacted 1,001 registered voters randomly selected from a statewide database.

North Carolina has not voted for a Democratic presidential candidate since former President Obama's 2008 victory, but the Democratic National Committee sees the state's Republican majority as fragile, with a possibility to tip the other way.

Because the majority of the survey was conducted before the full impact of Helene on the state, it does not reflect any possible shifts the storm may cause in public opinion.

NORTH CAROLINA REVEALS SHOCKING DAMAGE TO TOURIST TOWN: 'ALL OF IT WAS WASHED INTO THE LAKE'

More than 120 people have been killed by Helene since the hurricane made landfall in Florida late Thursday before tearing a path of destruction through the interior Southeast.

The storm caused millions to suffer power outages and billions in property damage as it smashed through the southern Appalachian Mountains and into the Tennessee Valley.

President Biden announced Monday that he will visit North Carolina on Wednesday after Hurricane Helene ravaged the state.

The president's announcement comes after critics slammed him for a lack of leadership following the monster storm's devastating impact on the southeastern portion of the country.

Elon Musk compares Newsom to 'The Joker' after voter ID requirements banned in California,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/elon-musk-compares-newsom-to-the-joker-after-gov-banned-voter-id-requirements-in-california,2024-10-01T16:18:07Z,"Fox News contributor Tammy Bruce discusses the fear of increased censorship under a potential Harris-Walz administration.

Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom has signed legislation banning local governments from requiring voters to present an ID at the ballot box in order to cast a vote - a move which sparked backlash from Elon Musk, who branded Newsom as ""The Joker.""

""Wow, it is now illegal to require voter ID in California! They just made PREVENTING voter fraud against the law,"" Musk wrote on X late Monday. ""The Joker is in charge.""

The bill was passed by the California Assembly in August after being introduced earlier in the year by state Sen. David Min, a Democrat. Newsom signed the bill into law on Thursday.

NEWSOM SIGNS ELECTION 'DEEPFAKE' BAN, MUSK CLAPS BACK RESHARING AI-ALTERED VIDEO OF KAMALA HARRIS

The new law was in response to the beachside city of Huntington Beach passing a voter ID amendment, Measure A, in March with the support of a majority of residents which would allow the city to require voter identification, increase in-person voting sites, and monitor ballot drop boxes in local elections. The measure won at the polls in March with 53.4% approval, county election data shows.

But Attorney General Rob Bonta and California Secretary of State Shirley N. Weber challenged Huntington Beach's voter ID law, which would have amended the city's charter to allow voter ID requirements by 2026.

In their lawsuit, Bonta and Weber argued that the city's voter ID law ""unlawfully conflicts and is preempted by state law.""

California is one of 14 states that does not require voter ID at the polls, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures.

""The right to freely cast your vote is the foundation of our democracy and Huntington Beach's voter ID policy flies in the face of this principle,"" Bonta said in a statement earlier this year.

He argued that state elections already contain ""robust voter ID requirements with strong protections to prevent voter fraud."" He said the new requirements would disproportionately burden ""low-income voters, voters of color, young or elderly voters, and people with disabilities.""

AG GARLAND PLEDGES TO FIGHT VOTER ID LAWS, ELECTION INTEGRITY MEASURES

While that lawsuit made its way through the courts state, Min introduced Senate Bill No. 1174. It passed out of the State Assembly in a 57-16 vote and in the State Senate in a 30-8 vote.

The Huntington Beach City Council placed the voter ID measure on the March ballot after taking a series of hotly contested decisions on topics ranging from flag flying to the removal of books from the public library's children's section over concerns about the appropriateness of materials. The moves were initiated by a politically conservative council majority, which took office in 2022, and have drawn scores of residents on all sides of issues to city meetings.

Huntington City Attorney Michael Gates said in March that the passage of the amendment approved by voters was ""not only permissible"" but backed by the state constitution.

Last week he vowed to continue to enforce Measure A.

""That bill means nothing to the city of Huntington Beach,"" Michael Gates said, per OrangeCountyLawyers.com. ""The city is going to proceed with its voter ID laws because it has a constitutional right to do so.""

Musk's outburst is not the first time he has sparred with Newsom.

Musk last month encouraged his 198 million X users to share an AI-doctored video of Vice President Kamala Harris after Newsom signed a bill into law banning digitally altered political ""deepfakes.""

Musk said he also plans to move the California headquarters for SpaceX to Texas after Newsom signed a bill into law that will bar school districts from notifying parents if their child uses different pronouns or identifies as a gender that's different from what's on school records.

The Space X owner has also said Democratic states are gaining an unfair advantage over red states in elections as a result of illegal immigration since the census is based on a simple headcount of all residents, both legal and illegal. He said congressional representation and electoral votes are apportioned based on all residents instead of just focusing on citizens.

Musk has often weighed in on voter integrity and immigration matters, writing on X in March that ""failure to require photo ID to vote obviously makes it impossible to prove voter fraud. That is why the far left refuses to require photo ID to vote."""
GOP leader says Vance 'absolutely prepared' for VP debate showdown with Walz,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/gop-leader-says-vance-absolutely-prepared-vp-debate-showdown-walz,2024-10-01T15:50:59Z,"NEW YORK - Republican National Committee chair Michael Whatley is confident that Sen. JD Vance of Ohio is ""absolutely prepared"" for Tuesday night's vice presidential debate showdown.

Vance, former President Trump's running mate on the GOP 2024 ticket, will face off in New York City with Democratic vice presidential nominee Gov. Tim Walz of Minnesota in the one and only debate between the two running mates.

""You look at everything he's done since he was named as the candidate. He's been preparing, he's been talking with the press, he's been out there, he's been moving around and talking to the American voters. So, he's very ready to have this conversation,"" Whatley emphasized in a Fox News Digital interview hours ahead of the debate.

A source familiar with Vance's debate prep told Fox News Digital that over the last month, the senator took part in a series of murder board sessions with his team, where a group of people ask tough questions and have candid discussions to help someone prepare for a difficult examination or test, or in Vance's case, a vice presidential debate.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

According to the source, Vance conducted a mock debate over the past week, with Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the House majority whip, playing the role of Walz. Former Trump administration Treasury Department assistant secretary Monica Crowley played the role of one of the moderators from CBS News, which is hosting the debate in New York City.

Halfway through the mock debate, the power went out, as a strong storm slammed through the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio, where Vance lives and where the prep session was held. But according to the source, who shared the details first with Fox News, Vance and the team continued on, using lanterns for lighting and cellphones for timers.

Heading into the 2024 vice presidential debate, the 40-year-old Vance has been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Walz, who is 60, has been much more reluctant to speak with the national news media.

The governor was in debate camp ahead of the showdown to prepare. Walz huddled with advisers and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - who played the role of Vance in mock debates - in Harbor Springs, Michigan, near the northern tip of the state's lower peninsula.

Also helping out - Walz's wife - Minnesota first lady Gwen Walz.

Asked on the eve of the showdown with Vance how his wife had been helping him with debate preparation, Walz told reporters, ""She wins every one.""

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2024 ELECTION POWER RANKINGS SHOW

With a second face-to-face showdown between Vice President Kamala Harris and Trump unlikely - and with a margin-of-error White House race with five weeks until Election Day in November - there will be heightened stakes at the running mate debate, which is traditionally seen as a second-tier event in the presidential campaign.

""Given that we're only likely to have one head-to-head match-up between the principal candidates and this is the last meet-up between the two tickets directly before the election, it heightens the importance and significance of this debate,"" longtime Republican strategist and communicator Ryan Williams, a veteran of multiple presidential campaigns, told Fox News.

Most political pundits said Harris bested Trump last month in their first and likely only debate. And flash polls of debate watchers agreed.

So a strong showing by Vance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate could give Trump a boost.

And there's a precedent from 12 years ago.

After a shaky first debate by then-President Barack Obama against 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, then-Vice President Joe Biden's well-regarded performance in the running mate debate against Romney running mate Rep. Paul Ryan gave the Democrats' ticket a big boost.

Whatley, the former RNC general counsel and former North Carolina GOP chair who's a close ally of Trump, told Fox Digital that Vance's debate mission is to ""deliver the message"" to voters across the country.

Whatley argued that ""if you look at the Democrats, they don't just have messenger problems, they have message problems. The polices that they're pushing right now are not popular with the American people.... I think on every single one of these issues, the Republican ticket is the ticket of strength, the ticket of common sense, and I feel really great about where we're going into tonight.""

The RNC chair also said that when it comes to Vance's game plan for the debate, ""I think he's going to talk about the issues that the voters care about and those are the issues like inflation, like the southern border, like prices at the grocery store and at the gas pump. That's really what people care about. That's what we're going to talk about.""

Part of the Harris campaign's strategy ahead of the debate is to raise expectations for Walz.

For weeks, they've painted Walz as a regular guy who will be facing off with the Ivy League-trained Vance. What they don't mention is that Walz won six House races and two gubernatorial elections.

The Trump campaign's playing the same game.

""Walz is very good in debates. I want to repeat that. Tim Walz is very good in debates. Really good. He's been a politician for nearly 20 years. He'll be very well-prepared for tomorrow night,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters on Monday.

But Trump seemed to undercut this campaign's argument, charging in an interview with Kellyanne Conway's Fox Nation program ""Here's the Deal with Kellyanne"" that Vance is ""going up against a moron. A total moron, how she picked him is unbelievable.""

Walz comes into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating.

Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable."

Some Biden 2020 voters say they don't know enough about Kamala Harris,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/some-biden-2020-voters-say-dont-know-enough-kamala-harris,2024-10-01T14:33:38Z,"Fox News contributor Mary Katharine Ham and Democratic strategist Tim Hogan analyze Vice President Kamala Harris' 'easy' interview with MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle.

Some Biden 2020 voters still want to know more about Vice President Kamala Harris ahead of the election, telling the New York Times that they don't know enough about the Democratic nominee's policies.

""I need to hear more from Kamala Harris in terms of what she wants to do. I hear a lot from Trump, and I agree with some of his policies, but I don't like his character. And I think I need to hear a little bit more from her for her to win my vote,"" Prince, a Democratic North Carolina voter, told the Times.

The New York Times spoke to 15 voters that voted for President Biden in 2020 in a Times Opinion focus group. While some said they still wanted more from Harris, by the end of the discussion, only three voters remained truly undecided between Harris and former President Trump.

""I don't know that there's much that Trump could say, because we already know what he's like. I think for Harris, if she came out with a more specific outline of some of her policies and if I heard some policies that aren't too good to be true, like the $25,000 home-buyer tax credit,"" a North Carolina Republican voter said.

72 DAYS: KAMALA HARRIS HAS YET TO DO A FORMAL PRESS CONFERENCE SINCE EMERGING AS DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE

The third person who was undecided, a 35-year-old Independent voter from Georgia, said he wanted to know more about Harris' plan for immigration and her economic policies.

The voter also said that he would be more invested in the vice presidential debate and hopes Gov. Tim Walz will be able to talk about Harris' policies in more detail.

An Independent voter from Nevada said while she leaned more towards Harris, she pulled back a bit because she didn't ""know enough about her.""

However, at the end of the discussion, the voter did not say she remained undecided.

The New York Times' moderator of the discussion, Magie Omero, asked the group what they liked best and least about the vice president and the former president.

One Michigan voter said what he liked best about Harris was that she was not Trump. Another said Harris is smart and ""relatable."" Others likened Trump to a dictator, and many suggested he was ""self-centered.""

""I don't feel like she's had time to set herself apart from what Biden's been doing for the last four years. For the most part, she's run with a similar plan. I don't know that that's the best plan,"" one of the Republican voters from North Carolina said, responding to the question about what they like least about Harris.

Another Republican voter agreed and added, ""She gives the impression of a fresh perspective, but I don't think we've had enough time to actually get details as to what that perspective is.""

A Democratic Pennsylvania voter agreed with both Republicans and said they didn't know enough about Harris' agenda.

When asked if they were happy that Harris was the Democratic nominee, multiple people said they were not satisfied, as Harris is the current vice president.

""I'm not that satisfied. She has been the vice president for the past four years and not really implemented anything. I wish the economy were better, and I heard she was in charge of border issues. We could have done a little bit better for a Democratic candidate,"" one Wisconsin Democrat said. She also said Harris was ""wishy-washy."""
Unearthed photo shows Tim Walz appointee decorated house with posters of murderous communist dictators,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/unearthed-photo-shows-tim-walz-appointee-decorated-house-posters-communist-dictators,2024-10-01T14:06:49Z,"Rep. Tom Emmer, R-Minn., reacts to Kamala Harris picking the Minnesota governor as her running mate.

A cabinet-level political appointee of Minnesota's Democratic Gov. Tim Walz decorated the walls of her home with posters of murderous communist dictators, according to a photo posted on Facebook in December 2021 that was discovered by a Minnesota resident and shared with Fox News Digital.

Ida Rukavina, the commissioner of Minnesota's Department of Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation, was appointed by Walz in 2022 to oversee the economic development of the northeastern part of the state, where the world's largest untapped copper-nickel reserve sits.

On Dec. 19, 2021, Rukavina posted a photo of her dog to Facebook, according to metadata attached to the image, which appears to have been deleted. In the background were clearly visible posters of communist leaders Mao Zedong and Che Guevara decorating the wall. The poster of Mao, China's communist dictator from the late 1940s until his death in 1976, and whose policies have been blamed for the deaths of millions, included the communist slogan frequently extolled during his rule: ""Revolution is not guilty.""

Meanwhile, the poster honoring Guevara, a prominent communist figure during the Cuban Revolution who murdered and tortured hundreds of his political opponents, was paired with a novel on Rukavina's bookshelf about his life.

MINNESOTA WALZ-APPOINTED BOARD REQUIRES TEACHERS TO 'AFFIRM' THEIR STUDENTS' GENDER IDENTITIES

Fox News Digital reached out to both Rukavina and the Walz campaign several times but did not receive a response by publication time.

Rukavina's affinity for communist leaders comes amid scrutiny over Walz's ties to communist China. By the governor's own admission, he has traveled there several times, including a trip in 1993 that was paid for by the Chinese government. Walz, a former social studies teacher, was often accompanied on these trips by his students, one of whom described the governor turned vice presidential candidate as ""Maoist to the core.""

Rukavina was tapped by Walz to ensure ""local communities in northeastern Minnesota have the resources they need to thrive."" Part of the region Rukavina oversees includes one of America's only primary domestic sources of nickel, which the United States currently exports from a variety of other countries, including Russia, Canada and Norway.

In 2024, the United States experienced a negative trade deficit on raw nickel of $79.4 million, according to the Observatory of Economic Complexity.

BIDEN ADMIN SEEKS TO LOCK UP CRITICAL MINERALS WITH ECO PROTECTIONS AMID GREEN ENERGY PUSH

Rukavina is the daughter of the late Democratic Minnesota state Rep. Tom Rukavina, who has been described as holding communist and socialist sympathies.

""Tommy Rukavina is someone I once called 'Tommy the commie' on the House floor,"" Congressman Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said jokingly during remarks eulogizing his relationship with the late politician.

Meanwhile, Rukavina reportedly once boasted he was the last socialist in the Minnesota legislature, according to local news outlet the Pioneer Press. ""He's gotten a little conservative in his old age. He's a socialist now,"" former Democratic state Rep. Carly Melin said, the local news outlet added.

Meanwhile, last week, the Daily Caller News Foundation uncovered that one of Walz's other political appointees in Minnesota is a member of China's third-largest political party, which has been granted permission to operate in the communist country because it pledges to ""rally closely around"" the Chinese Communist Party's Central Committee, the outlet reported.

The appointee, a Minnesota-based attorney named Chang Wang, was tapped by Walz in 2020 to serve on the Minnesota Council on Asian Pacific Minnesotans, which advises ""the Governor, the Legislature, state agencies, and Asian Pacific organizations and citizens,"" on issues impacting the Chinese Minnesotan community. Wang is currently the council's vice chair, according to his profile on the council's official government website, and his term there is expected to conclude in January 2025."
"Tim Walz said he went to China 'dozens' of times, now his campaign says its 'closer to 15'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/tim-walz-said-he-went-china-dozens-times-now-his-campaign-says-its-closer-15,2024-10-01T13:08:40Z,"Pennsylvania farmer and GOP State Rep. Eric Davanzo discusses Trump's upcoming visit to his farm ahead of the former president holding a rally in the swing state.

Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, said he traveled to China much less than he had initially highlighted in congressional hearings and media interviews.

""I have been to China dozens of times,"" Walz said during a 2016 congressional hearing. ""I've been there about 30 times,"" Walz told an agriculture-focused publication the same year.

However, a Harris-Walz campaign spokesperson recently acknowledged to Minnesota Public Radio that the number was ""closer to 15 times.""

The revision comes amid growing scrutiny from GOP critics over Walz's potential ties to the People's Republic of China and its ruling Communist Party. Earlier this month, House Committee on Oversight and Accountability Chairman James Comer, R-Ky., sent a letter renewing pressure on the FBI to produce documents related to Chinese Communist Party (CCP) entities or officials that Walz has purportedly engaged with in the past.

WALZ APPOINTEE WITH APPARENT CCP TIES COULD EXPOSE POTENTIAL VEEP'S NATIONAL SECURITY WEAKNESS, LAWMAKER SAYS

According to Walz's own testimony, he first went to China in 1989 amid the Tiananmen Square uprising. Walz was part of the first delegation of American teachers to ever go to the communist nation during the trip. He was a participant in Harvard's WorldTeach program, which gave Walz the opportunity to live and teach young students in China for a year.

Walz apparently enjoyed his time in China so much that after transitioning his teaching career to the U.S., Walz continued to take annual trips back to China with his students. Walz eventually set up a company with his wife Gwen, called Educational Travel Adventures, Inc., which was dedicated to taking students on trips to China and other international destinations. The two even honeymooned in China on one of their trips in 1993. Walz's annual trips with students took place between 1993 and the early 2000s, before he began running for public office.

FANS BOO TIM WALZ AS HE LEAVES MICHIGAN-MINNESOTA GAME: 'GET OUT OF HERE'

Walz and his wife dissolved their student-travel company after he won his seat in Congress in 2006. However, Walz's China experience was a matter of pride for the now-vice presidential candidate when he was trying to join Congress.

Walz's campaign website at the time, for instance, highlighted his work as a visiting fellow at Macau Polytechnic University, a university in China with ties to the CCP.

""What we need in education, what we need in the military, and what we need when I'm fostering cultural exchanges with China, is real solutions,"" Walz also said when he debated incumbent GOP Rep. Gil Gutknecht in 2006, once again highlighting his work in China.

However, after Walz became Harris' running mate this year, Minnesota Public Radio began trying to verify the ""dozens"" of trips he claimed to have gone on. In the end, they could only verify that about 12 of them had actually occurred.

FOX NEWS MEDIA WILL PRESENT SPECIAL LIVE PROGRAMMING OF VANCE-WALZ DEBATE

When the news outlet reached out to the Harris campaign for documentation proving the rest of Walz's trips did indeed take place, instead of offering such proof they acknowledged that Walz had previously exaggerated the number of trips he took to China, and it was actually ""closer to 15 times"" not ""dozens of times.""

Besides apparently misrepresenting how many times he traveled to China, Walz has also been accused of misrepresenting his rank in the Army National Guard as well.

""I'm a retired command sergeant major,"" Walz asserted while running for Congress in 2006. However, while Walz did serve briefly with that rank, he retired too early to keep it. Walz's retirement also prevented him from deploying to the Middle East, another point of criticism against the vice presidential candidate who has suggested that he saw combat. Meanwhile, it has been alleged that Walz and his wife have made false assertions about their use of IVF as well.

A former national guard veteran who reportedly served with Walz told talk show host Megyn Kelly that they think Walz is a ""habitual liar.""

Fox News Power Rankings: Trump maintains lead on 2 top issues ahead of VP debate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/power-rankings-trump-maintains-lead-two-top-issues-ahead-vp-debate,2024-10-01T13:08:36Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Ohio Sen. JD Vance are hours away from the first and only vice presidential debate.

As the latest Fox News Power Rankings reveal, Vance starts the evening with a lead on the economy and immigration, while Walz has an advantage on abortion.

Vice presidential hopefuls do not attract as much attention as their bosses when they debate, but as Fox News' Arnon Mishkin argued Monday, they have changed the direction of at least six elections in the last 50 years.

In most cases, these debates are won on policy. Voters are not as familiar with these nominees as they are with former President Donald Trump or even Vice President Kamala Harris, and they do not need to make their choice.

The smart play for these vice presidential candidates is to focus on the major issues at stake and how their administrations would solve them.

FOX NEWS POWER RANKINGS: HARRIS TICKS UP AND SENATE REPUBLICANS TAKE CHARGE

That is especially true for Walz on the economy and immigration, since the Harris campaign continues to lag on those issues. Vance, meanwhile, has struggled with poor favorability ratings, so his challenge is to hammer the popular parts of the Trump agenda and avoid wading into the culture war trenches.

There are also style points up for grabs. Many voters will only ever see this debate in short clips on social media, so acting like a policy wonk is less likely than ever to get the job done.

Trump continues to hold an advantage on two of the top three issues in this campaign. He leads on the economy by nine points and immigration by 11.

Those numbers have barely budged since Harris and Trump debated. In August, when the Power Rankings last looked at the major issues, the former president led on the economy by eight and immigration by 13.

Harris is far out in front on abortion. She leads by 17 points on that issue, also a negligible movement since the last tracker (Harris +18).

This tracker includes polls from Fox News, Quinnipiac, CNN/SSRS, NBC News and the New York Times/Siena.

Trump lost a point in the horse race after his debate with Harris while the vice president gained one; these modest shifts mirrored those after the first debate in 2020.

Together, these results suggest that the cause of Trump's slight decline was style rather than substance.

Conversely, while Harris won the debate and held on to her advantage on abortion, she has not consistently closed the issues gap, particularly on immigration.

That is not ideal for her, given the economy (38%) and immigration (17%) are two of the top three issues for voters. A recent Fox News national survey showed those issues and abortion (16%) were the only three that a double-digit percentage of voters called their ""most important"" issue in deciding their vote.

According to the same survey, Harris has strong leads in issues outside the top three. That includes health care, helping the middle class and climate change. These are ""bread and butter"" issues that the left has relied on to drag out base voters in previous elections.

The Democratic candidate also has a lead in uniting the country and, as consistent with previous trackers, having the right temperament for the job.

The candidates are evenly divided on national security. Neither has an advantage in handling a crisis that puts the country at risk, being commander in chief or decisions about using nuclear weapons. Trump's temperament deficit should give Harris an opportunity to lead on some of these qualities, but that has not materialized.

ARNON MISHKIN: JD VANCE IS AN EXCELLENT DEBATER AND PRACTICES FOR THE DEBATE EVERY SUNDAY

Finally, voters prefer Trump on foreign policy. He has a six-point lead in handling the Israel/Hamas war and an eight-point lead on the Ukraine/Russia war.

Tuesday is debate night. Walz and Vance will face off at an event hosted by CBS News in New York City. Fox News will simulcast the debate with special coverage anchored by Bret Baier and Martha MacCallum at 8:20 p.m. ET.

Fox News Media has proposed a second Harris-Trump debate to be moderated by MacCallum and Baier in October.

Walz's debate performance expectations lowered ahead of showdown with Vance: 'Still largely untested',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/walzs-debate-performance-expectations-lowered-ahead-showdown-vance-still-largely-untested,2024-10-01T12:55:37Z,"A 'Fox News Live' political panel provided its expectations ahead of the vice presidential debate between JD Vance and Tim Walz, as well as its views on the border issue.

Some Democratic allies of Gov. Tim Walz are concerned about how he will fare in the vice presidential debate between him and Sen. JD Vance, worrying that the Minnesota governor remains untested.

""We've never seen him on the national scale before,"" a Minnesota Democrat told Politico. The outlet reported that Vance hasn't been tested in a scenario like a debate, where he will face direct questioning and attacks from the other side.

Walz and Vance are set to clash on Tuesday during the first vice presidential debate, which will be moderated by CBS News' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan.

""He can be very: 'That's it I'm done,'"" a Minnesota state lawmaker told the outlet. Politico reported that Walz shuts down conversations and gets defensive when he's asked to discuss ""missteps"" in private, and it noted Walz was ""still largely untested and has never faced the intense, direct questioning that Vance is sure to launch.""

HARRIS 2024 SENIOR CAMPAIGN ADVISER PREVIEWS UPCOMING VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE: 'TWO VERY DIFFERENT VISIONS'

""She did so strong. She's actually made it very difficult for Walz, because I don't see any way that he could match her level of intensity and humor,"" another ally of the Minnesota governor said, noting Vice President Kamala Harris' debate performance against former President Trump that received high media praise.

Harris' inner circle reportedly discussed Walz's habit of being ""gruff and brass,"" Politico reported, while they were vetting him.

According to the outlet, a Minnesota lawmaker recalled Walz saying ""'Alright, I've done all the answering I'm going to do. Meeting's over,'"" when he was asked about questions he didn't want to talk about.

A Democratic lawmaker described a call with Walz in 2020 amid the George Floyd riots, during which Walz reportedly ""signaled he was done with the conversation,"" after he was pressed on why he didn't call the National Guard in sooner.

""I don't think he hung up, but definitely that was it. The call was over,"" the Democratic lawmaker said.

""At times, he could be the exact opposite of what he usually is. That was one of them,"" the person told Politico.

Politico also reported that Walz struggled to explain Harris' economic agenda and kept repeating the words ""opportunity economy."" The report said it came off as vague to those in attendance.

MSNBC's Claire McCaskill, a former Democratic senator, said during an interview on Monday that expectations for the VP debates should be ""lowered.""

""I'm just a little worried about the expectations game at this point. I think people -- yes, J.D. Vance has said some really, I think, disqualifying things about women and how he views people and their role in life. But he will be articulate and he will be prepared and he will be better than Trump was,"" she said.

McCaskill said it would be a ""challenge"" for Walz to be able to counter Vance and ""stay really likable and relatable.""

""I just think we need to lower expectations a little bit, because then we can all be pleasantly surprised if I'm wrong and that Tim Walz just mops the floor with him the same way Kamala Harris mopped the floor with Donald Trump,"" McCaskill added.

"Mast demands VA fire staffers over Vance, Walz medical record breach, FBI probe possible foreign interference",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/mast-demands-va-fire-staffers-over-vance-walz-medical-record-breach-fbi-probe-possible-foreign-interference,2024-10-01T12:24:29Z,"FIRST ON FOX - Rep. Brian Mast, R-Fla., is demanding that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) immediately fire the at least a dozen employees who reportedly improperly accessed the medical records of vice presidential candidates Sen. JD Vance of Ohio, and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz this summer.

Mast, chairman of Veterans For Trump, penned a letter urging VA Secretary Denis McDonough for a ""swift response and action to prevent such egregious violations of privacy within the VA from occurring again."" The Florida Republican is also calling for the FBI to get involved to investigate the possibility of foreign election interference.

""I urge you to buck the employee union of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and immediately fire the employees who were caught snooping into the private medical records of Ohio Sen. J.D. Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz - who are both running to be vice president. VA employees know this is not permitted,"" Mast wrote in a letter first obtained by Fox News Digital. ""As a combat-injured veteran, I rely on the VA for my medical care. This isn't just a legal misstep; it's a breach that undermines veterans' confidence in the VA and raises serious questions about the professionalism of VA personnel.""

The Washington Post first reported Monday that at least 12 VA employees within the agency's health administration were under criminal investigation after VA investigators discovered they improperly accessed the medical records of Vance and Walz. VA Inspector General Michael Missal's office reportedly informed both candidates' campaigns and shared evidence with federal prosecutors related to several of the health system employees, including a physician and a contractor who ""spent extended time"" viewing the files of former President Trump and Vice President Harris' running mates.

VA EMPLOYEES IMPROPERLY ACCESSED JD VANCE, TIM WALZ'S MEDICAL RECORDS, PROMPTING CRIMINAL PROBE: REPORT

""Dismissing these employees and referring them to the Justice Department for prosecution, provided there is evidence that laws were broken, is the first step the VA must take to restore credibility,"" Mast wrote. ""Furthermore, I urge you to fully brief Congress on how this violation of privacy transpired and implement new guidelines to prevent such acts from occurring in the future.""

Mast, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, implored McDonough to coordinate with the FBI.

The letter comes a week after Trump's campaign said he was briefed on ""real and specific threats"" from Iran to assassinate the Republican presidential nominee.

""Given the recent foreign meddling in our elections - like Iran's assassination plots against President Trump - I also request your department coordinate with the FBI to ensure Senator Vance and Governor Walz's medical information was neither shared with foreign operatives nor accessed on their behalf,"" Mast, who served in the U.S. Army for 12 years and lost both legs to catastrophic injuries endured while working as a bomb disposal expert in Afghanistan, wrote. ""Safeguarding sensitive information about our public officials is critical to national security and the integrity of our democracy.""

TRUMP REACTS TO ASSASSINATION PLOTS WITH BIG WARNING TO IRAN

Last month, experts from the FBI, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) issued a summary of the current threat environment citing how the ""big three foreign influence actors, Russia, Iran, and China are all trying by some measure to exacerbate divisions in U.S. society for their own benefit, and see election periods as moments of vulnerability.""

""Like Russia, Iran has a multi-pronged approach that looks to stoke discord and undermine confidence in our electoral process. Tehran has also sought cyber access to individuals with direct ties to the presidential campaigns of both political parties, while elements have also denigrated the former president,"" they said. ""Iran has a suite of tools at its disposal, as demonstrated in recent reports outlining Iran's cyber operations, including the hack-and-leak operation against the former president's campaign. Iran is also conducting covert social media operations using fake personas, and is using AI to help publish inauthentic news articles.""

Fox News Digital reached out to the VA and the FBI regarding Mast's letter.

Regarding the Post's reporting on Monday, VA Press Secretary Terrence Hayes said in a statement that the agency ""reported to law enforcement allegations that VA personnel may have improperly accessed Veteran records"" and takes ""the privacy of the Veterans we serve very seriously and have strict policies in place to protect their records.""

""Any attempt to improperly access Veteran records by VA personnel is unacceptable and will not be tolerated,"" Hayes wrote.

The potential motive for accessing the medical records is under investigation, and investigators are still trying to determine if Vance and Walz's information was shared as a result of the breaches, the Post reported.

The VA employees under investigation, including the physician and contractor, accessed the medical records using their VA computers and did so mostly from their government offices, sources told the newspaper. Some of the staffers in question reportedly told investigators they were simply curious to see the files of Vance and Walz given both candidates have defended their military records on the campaign trail.

The Department of Justice declined to comment about the report. The breach reportedly did not include access to any disability compensation, which has more security protocols than health information."

Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance ridiculed a post from MSNBC anchor Stephanie Ruhle over-analyzing his recent off-the-cuff comment about how many eggs his sons eat.

On Sept. 21, Vance visited a supermarket in Reading, Pennsylvania, to discuss the rising prices of groceries under the Biden-Harris administration. He was accompanied by his two young sons, Ewan and Vivek, who interrupted his speech to reach for a carton of eggs.

""Yes, buddy. Want some eggs? Let's talk about eggs. Because these guys actually eat about 14 eggs every single morning. Is that right?"" Vance said.

By Sunday, Ruhle caught wind of his comment and posted her own analysis of it.

MSNBC'S STEPHANIE RUHLE CALLS OUT HARRIS FOR DODGING HOW SHE'D RAISE TAXES: 'SHE DOESN'T ANSWER THE QUESTION'

""14 eggs per day. 98 eggs per week. 2 children consuming 8+ dozen eggs per week,"" Ruhle calculated.

By Monday, Vance himself replied, ridiculing what he considered obvious hyperbole.

""One time I said I was so tired I could sleep for days. Stephanie Ruhle: Vance, in fact, only slept for 8 hours,"" Vance wrote.

Fox News Digital reached out to Ruhle for a comment.

Several other people across X also mocked Ruhle over her original post with a similar joke.

""Vance: 'I'm so hungry I could eat a horse!' Ruhle: 'TONIGHT, we talk to PETA to get to the bottom of this Republican-led equine eating catastrophe,'"" CNN senior political commentator Scott Jennings wrote.

Reason senior editor Robby Soave joked, ""One time I said I was so hungry I could eat a horse. But I actually couldn't eat a horse. Hopefully we'll get the fact-checkers on this soon. Very important.""

""Tim Walz lied about his military service and no can say for sure whether Harris worked at a McDonalds, but they'll fact check the most obvious hyperbole imaginable,"" RealClearInvestigations senior writer Mark Hemingway remarked.

Washington Free Beacon reporter Andrew Kerr commented, ""Eggs are a superfood and you should be eating them everyday.""

""This response reminds me of the time CNN reported on a family who couldn't afford their 12 gallons of milk a week and others in the media ignored the fact that milk was unaffordable and pivoted to making fun of the family instead,"" political commentator Kate Hyde recalled.

RedState writer Bonchie said, ""Stephanie Ruhle is out here fact-checking light-hearted hyperbole. This is who the Harris campaign called up to give an interview to. Now, you know why.""

Ruhle was previously mocked for repeatedly defending Vice President Kamala Harris dodging difficult questions even after giving Harris her first one-on-one cable interview Wednesday.

MSNBC'S STEPHANIE RUHLE FAWNS OVER HARRIS, SAYS NON-ANSWERS ARE 'OKAY': THESE AREN'T 'CLEAR AND DIRECT ISSUES'

""[D]o I think that she answers every single question and gives people exactly what they want? She doesn't. You know why? Because she's a politician, and none of them do. They all speak in platitudes,"" Ruhle said."
Montana GOP Senate candidate Sheehy says he was in Afghanistan while Jon Tester was 'eating lobbyist steak',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/montana-gop-senate-candidate-sheehy-says-he-afghanistan-while-jon-tester-eating-lobbyist-steak,2024-10-01T09:53:21Z,"Montana Senate candidate Tim Sheehy joined 'America's Newsroom' to discuss the importance of the race and what issues matter most to voters as he fights to oust Democratic Sen. Jon Tester.

Montana U.S. Senate candidate Tim Sheehy, a Republican, ripped his opponent, incumbent Democrat Sen. Jon Tester, for his ties to lobbyists during a debate on Monday.

Tester is seeking to hold onto his Senate seat to continue representing the red state of Montana in a race that could determine which party controls the upper chamber of Congress, and recent polling shows that Sheehy is leading just weeks before Election Day.

During the debate on Monday, Sheehy knocked his Democrat opponent for his relationship with lobbyists in Washington, D.C.

""Sen. Tester knows all about backroom meetings, he's been taking them for 20 years ... While I was fighting in Afghanistan, he was eating lobbyist steak in D.C.,"" said Sheehy, a former U.S. Navy SEAL.

'WHOEVER GETS ELECTED': VULNERABLE DEM TESTER DIGS IN HEELS ON NOT ENDORSING HARRIS

Lobbyists have donated more heavily to Tester during this election cycle than to any other member of Congress, according to the non-partisan group OpenSecrets.

Tester is the last remaining Democrat to hold high office in Montana, where Republicans, including former President Trump, supported Sheehy's campaign with the hope that he could defeat the vulnerable Democrat and help the GOP win back control of the Senate.

Republicans need to gain only two seats in next month's election to win the Senate majority. GOP West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice is considered a lock in his state's Senate race against Democrat Glenn Elliott, meaning the Senate majority could run through Montana.

Trump won Montana by about 17 percentage points in 2020 and, given that the state is overwhelmingly Republican, Sheehy has often sought to tie Tester to President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris as the Republican candidate looks to take advantage of public dissatisfaction over the administration's struggles to address the influx of illegal immigration at the Southern Border.

JON TESTER CASTS DOUBT ON UNFAVORABLE POLL IN MONTANA SENATE RACE: 'GIVE ME A BREAK'

""Democrats on the Hill refused to hold the administration accountable for the largest mass migration in the history of this country,"" Sheehy said.

Tester, however, has declined to endorse Harris and has attempted to distance himself from her on the campaign trail, and he skipped the Democratic National Convention in August, when she was named the party's nominee for president after Biden dropped out.

The Democrat has also criticized some of the administration's policy decisions. This includes his opposition to the move for tighter pollution rules for coal plants and his calls for more to be done on immigration.

""Look, I'll be the first person to tell you that President Biden has not done a good job on the southern border,"" Tester said Monday.

Sheehy and Tester also addressed abortion, in which the Democrat said he wants to reinstate Roe v. Wade after the landmark ruling was overturned by the U.S. Supreme Court two years ago, returning the power to make laws regarding abortion back to the states.

The Republican acknowledged that remarks he made last year about Native Americans were ""insensitive,"" but refused his opponent's request to apologize. Sheehy had told a group of laughing supporters about bonding ""with all the Indians ... while they're drunk at 8 a.m.,"" while working cattle at a ranch on the Crow Indian Reservation.

""Yeah, insensitive,"" Sheehy said. ""I come from the military as many of our tribal members do. You know, we make insensitive jokes and probably off-color jokes sometimes.""

Tester pressed his opponent, ""Tim, the statement you made degrades Native Americans across this country. You're a big guy, just apologize.""

""Will you apologize for opening the border?"" Sheehy shot back."
NBC's 'SNL' roasted for mocking assassination attempts against Trump: 'Activism masquerading as comedy',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/nbcs-snl-roasted-for-mocking-assassination-attempts-against-trump-activism-masquerading-as-comedy,2024-10-01T09:23:40Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

NBC's ""Saturday Night Live"" has been blasted as ""completely inappropriate"" for making light of assassination attempts against former President Trump in its latest episode.

""SNL"" has managed to take a break from comedy for somber moments in the past, such as when Kate McKinnon performed a version of ""Hallelujah"" while impersonating Hillary Clinton following Trump's shock 2016 election victory. But while the Democratic nominee losing to Trump in 2016 was worthy of a melancholy cold open, recent assassination attempts on Trump were not.

The long-running program began its 50th season on Saturday evening with a variety of special guests mocking current political affairs, such as Maya Rudolph as Vice President Kamala Harris, Andy Samberg as her husband Doug Emhoff, Jim Gaffigan as Gov. Tim Walz and Dana Carvey as President Biden.

James Austin Johnson played Trump and lampooned the first assassination attempt - which killed one of Trump's supporters - that occurred July 13 in Butler, Pa., as he depicted the former president at one of his rallies.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""Where the hell is everyone going? Where are you going? I see you trying to leave, but the doors are locked. Come on back -- we're having fun. We love my rallies, except when someone does the 'bing, bong, bing, bing, bing' right at me,"" Johnson as Trump said, referring to the sounds of bullets. ""You know that happened because of the rhetoric of the radical left. They say that me blaming the Democrats for inciting violence is the pot calling the kettle black.""

Former NBCUniversal senior executive Mike Sington, who now bills himself as a pop culture expert and Hollywood insider, couldn't believe ""SNL"" went there.

""I was watching it live, and actually cringed when they mocked the assassination attempts in an effort to be funny. I'm no fan of Trump's, but I thought it was in extremely poor taste,"" Sington told Fox News Digital.

Fox News host Jimmy Failla wasn't surprised because ""SNL"" has pivoted from comedy to ""activism masquerading as comedy"" in recent years. The show openly celebrated Trump losing in 2020, and its cast members

""'SNL' has basically devolved into a group therapy session for liberals who are wildly out of touch with the zeitgeist,"" Failla told Fox News Digital.

Failla said the infamous ""Hallelujah"" rendition following Clinton's 2016 loss proved how self-absorbed the show is, specifically when considering that Trump was a longtime NBC personality prior to entering politics.

""They go after things that work well in a liberal bubble, but look stupid to the rest of us, because it looks like activism masquerading as comedy,"" Failla said.

""The things they made fun of with Biden are the harmless things, whereas the things they make fun of with Trump always have the undercoating that's looking to steer the conversation towards how their viewers are going to vote,"" he continued. ""It's beneath the show that really forged an identity by dabbling in politics, but in an accessible way, which is what we try to do on my show.""

Failla, who hosts ""FOX News Saturday Night,"" believes anything can be mocked if it's done tastefully.

MSNBC GUEST CLAIMS LATINOS 'WANT TO BE WHITE' WHILE DISCUSSING THEIR SHIFT TOWARD GOP

""If you're making fun of a situation where he was shot and someone else was killed, then it better be funny. Like the juice better be worth the squeeze, which it clearly wasn't in this case,"" Failla said. ""And they didn't make any effort to hide their political bias in how they covered this.""

Failla said a lot of people turn to comedy as a distraction, but ""SNL"" doesn't offer the escape that it used to.

""They're keeping the focus on division. And I cover politics every week. So, I'm not saying they shouldn't. I'm just saying they're covering it in a way that's clearly catering so wholeheartedly to one side of the aisle that sometimes you see the malice in what they're doing,"" Failla said.

""You can mock anything in the name of comedy. But if you're mocking it in the name of a political ideology, you're no longer doing comedy,"" he added. ""You're doing activism masquerading as comedy. And that's what that came off as. It came off as just tasteless activism.""

FOX NEWS POLL: VOTERS CITE HIGH PRICES AS BIGGEST MOTIVATOR TO VOTE

Political satirist Tim Young believes the NBC program ""jumped the shark politically"" years ago, particularly when they treated Trump's 2016 victory ""as if it were a funeral"" with McKinnon playing the piano on a dark stage.

""From that point forward, it's been full-on leftist propaganda. Their mocking of Trump's assassination attempts was completely inappropriate,"" Young told Fox News Digital.

Young believes poking fun at the assassination attempts ""feeds leftist conspiracies that it never happened"" and also ""downplays the seriousness of the threats on Trump's life.""

""Which I believe encourages more lunatics and foreign adversaries to try,"" Young said.

TRUMP ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT SUSPECT WROTE CHILLING LETTER MONTHS BEFORE GOLF COURSE PLOT

The Trump campaign posted to social media, ""There were two assassination attempts against President Trump within a span of seven weeks. @nbcsnl apparently finds that funny. Disgusting.""

""SNL"" also referenced the assassination attempts during the ""Weekend Update"" segment, during which Colin Jost quipped that he was ""starting to worry that bullet got a little more than just the ear,"" after playing a clip of Trump saying he had a better ""body"" than President Biden at a recent rally.

Conservative radio host Jason Rantz said he is ""all for comedy having no rules about what it targets"" for humor as long as everything is balanced and amusing.

""Bad taste? Sure, but that's their choice to make. My issue is how disgustingly one-sided the humor has become,"" Rantz told Fox News Digital.

""It's not just Trump they loathe -- it's everyone who supports him,"" he continued. ""At the very least, you'd hope they'd be funny while being so obnoxiously partisan. But no, they're not funny. They haven't been funny in decades.""

CNN'S DANA BASH ADMITS SHE PREPPED 'MUCH MORE' FOR HOW TRUMP WOULD ACT DURING FIRST DEBATE THAN FOR BIDEN

When Trump narrowly survived the assassination attempt against him in July, a bullet grazed the president's ear and the shooter killed 50-year-old Corey Comperatore -- a husband, father and former fire chief at the Buffalo Township Volunteer Fire Department. The gunman, Thomas Matthew Crooks, also critically wounded two other rally-goers. Weeks later, Ryan Wesley Routh, 58, was arrested on Sept. 15 after allegedly pushing the muzzle of an AK-47 through the chainlink fence outside where Trump was golfing in Florida.

While Young is appalled the program would make light of the assassination attempts, he also noticed something ""significant"" during the same sketch.

""They mocked all of Biden's confusion, smelling hair, etc. for one of the first real times since he's been in office,"" Young said.

""'SNL' defended Biden by not being hard on him before,"" Young added. ""Now that Kamala has been installed as the Democrat nominee, they finally treat him like they have other candidates pre-Trump.""

Morning Glory: Israel unbound,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/morning-glory-israel-unbound,2024-10-01T09:20:06Z,"'Special Report' panelists discuss the latest presidential polling in key battleground states as Election Day inches closer.

When Israeli Prime Minister visited the United States at the invitation of House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-LA) and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) this past summer, the Congressional leaders intended the visit to be a gesture of support for our embattled ally.

But Vice President Harris, who ought to have presided at the joint session of Congress in her role as President of the Senate along with Speaker Johnson -- with both seated behind Netanyahu -- instead skipped the Israeli PM's address to the joint session of Congress on July 24. Harris thus sent a very public message to her supporters -- she did not care to reschedule previous commitments though Netanyahu's visit was long in planning -- and then met with Netanyahu privately as did President Biden.

Whatever the President and Vice President said to the Prime Minister after what the Vice President did by way of very visible messaging, Netanyahu embraced a different strategy for Israel after his return to Jerusalem. Two months later, when Netanyahu returned to the states to deliver a fiery address the United Nations General Assembly last week, that new strategy had already rolled out in large part in the region, though it is crescendoing still.

First, Israel took the war everywhere in Gaza, and Hamas is all but obliterated as an organized fighting force though 101 hostages remain in the terrorists' tunnel network and the condition of Yahya Sinwar is unknown. Sinwar's military commander, Mohammed Deif, was killed in an Israeli air raid in southern Gaza on July 13, though that news was not confirmed until after Netanyahu's visit to Congress.

Not long after Netanyahu's return to Israel, Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, was assassinated on July 31 along with his personal bodyguard while in the Iran's capital of Tehran.

Fuad Shukr, a senior commander in Iran's proxy in Lebanon, Hezbollah, was killed by the Israeli Air Force a day earlier, on July 30. Hezbollah's top military commander thereafter, Ibrahim Aqil, and 10 other senior commanders of Hezbollah's elite ""Radwan Force"" -- structured as special operation forces trained to invade Israel and hold terriroty -- were killed in an air strike on September 20.

On September 28 the leader of Hezbollah, its ""Secretary General"" for four decades, Hassan Nasrallah, and at least 10 other senior members of the terror organization were killed in a massive Israeli air strike in the southern suburbs of Beirut. Among the dead was also at least one senior general in Iran's Revolutionary Guards Corps. Iranian state media confirmed General Abbas Nilforoushan, 58, had been at the doomed conference in Nasrallah's underground bunker.

HAMAS LEADER KILLED IN LEBANON WAS UN EMPLOYEE, AGENCY CONFIRMS

In the middle of these strikes at all of the senior terror leadership in Lebanon, hundreds if not thousands of Hezbollah terrorists and their accomplices in Lebanon were killed or wounded in the beeper and walkie-talkie attack that astonished the world. (Israel has not claimed responsibility for this attack.)

Over the weekend, strikes continued on the remaining senior leaders of Hezbollah, Hamas and other terror groups and a second round of punishing air strikes on significant assets in Yemen were conducted by the Israeli Air Force in reprisals for that country's ruling terrorists attacks on Israeli via ballistic missiles.

There were also reports on Monday that the Israeli special forces had been conducting raids in southern Lebanon, including inside of Hezbollah's vast tunnel network, in preparation for ground operations to secure northern Israel from the threat of ongoing attacks against the Jewish State which began on October 8th, the day after the barbaric Hamas massacre of 1,200 inside the southern border of Israel (and the kidnapping of 250 more, more than a hundred of whom have been rescued or released via negotiations last fall.) A desperate and disorganized Hamas seems incapable of even responding to proposals for hostage exchanges and the IDF is going about methodically destroying Gaza's 500 miles of terrorist tunnels.

Netanyahu and his governing coalition got stronger this weekend as a former ally turned rival became an ally again as Gideon Saar brought his ""New Hope"" party into the governing coalition led by Netanyahu and his Likud party.

What this week and the next four that follow right up to the United States presidential election will bring in Israel, Lebanon, Gaza and the entire region is unknown, but what is clear is that Israel does not feel in the least constrained by President Biden and his team and their mantra of ""de-escalation.""

Israel tried every tactic requested by the United States, did its best to negotiate a cease-fire and hostage deal, and was repeatedly spurned by the terrorists in Gaza. (The consequences of the U.S.-enforced delays will be assessed after the wars conclude.) Though Vice President Harris had ""studied the maps"" of Rafah and publicly concluded that Israel could not evacuate the more than a million Palestinians taking refuge there, Israel in fact did just that, and without loss of innocent life save those of the soldiers of the IDF killed in the Rafah operations and six hostages Hamas terrorists ruthlessly executed, including an American citizen Hersh Goldberg-Polin.

At the same time as the Gaza War intensified, Israel hammered Iran's other proxies in Lebanon and Yemen, both of which -- Hezbollah and the Houthis -- had kept up a barrage of rocket, drone and missile strikes on the Jewish State.

After Netanyahu's visit to the Congress and his snub by the possible next president, it seems clear he returned to Israel resolved to prosecute Israel's seven front war on his terms, not those of the United States, which itself continues to be subject to missile and drone barrages against its fleet and land forces in the region and to reply only intermittently. Nothing the United States has done can compare with Israel's withering counter-attacks. Israel is restoring deterrence in the region and Iran, which threatened to strike back against Israel, has not yet attempted a reprise of its direct assault on Israel in April.

Whatever Biden and Harris and all their senior officials intended Israel to do, unless they recommended Netanyahu do all of the above, then Israel has shrugged off the demands made of it by the appeasement-driven Biden-Harris administration.

Perhaps Netanyahu is simply unwilling to risk what are widely expected to be the anti-Israel policies of Harris should she win. Perhaps he took the measure of President Biden and concluded the American Commander-on-Chief is spent and not really in command at all.

Correlation is, of course, not causation. But whatever Biden and Harris said to Netanyahu in July, unless it was ""Go get them,"" the Israeli Prime Minister has decided to protect his people and not his friendships with the clueless foreign policy blob inside the Beltway."
Kamala Harris makes a desperate move on a critical issue to save a sinking campaign,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harris-makes-desperate-move-critical-issue-save-sinking-campaign,2024-10-01T09:09:12Z,"The Democrat nominee's campaign is fizzling like a week-old party balloon; desperate to regain momentum, she is trying to defuse one of her most vulnerable positions -- immigration. The latest Quinnipiac poll of 1,728 likely voters shows Harris dead even with Trump; in August the same poll showed her leading by two points. Nate Silver reports that Harris' chances of winning are dropping and the Real Clear Politics average of polls shows Harris' lead declining slightly. That small slippage comes despite massive spending by Democrats, and especially in swing states, where Trump on average leads Harris by the slimmest of margins.

The Harris team sees their ""joy"" campaign losing steam and has decided with great trepidation that the candidate must be more accountable on issues important to voters. Immigration is one of those top concerns on which she is currently being clobbered by Trump. According to CNN, 49% of voters trust the former president on immigration compared to 35% trusting Harris. The open border may prove key to winning toss-up states like Arizona and also to winning over Black men, especially those who are concerned about the impact of lawless immigration on the jobs market.

VP HARRIS OUTLINES 'ORDERLY AND SECURE' IMMIGRATION PLAN, RIPS TRUMP IN FIRST BORDER STOP SINCE NOMINATION

That's the only possible explanation for why she would humiliate herself by visiting our southern border -- the original Biden-Harris crime scene. From the earliest days of this administration, critics were aghast at the sudden spike in the number of people coming across the border illegally. The surge was not surprising; after all, Biden took 89 executive actions in his first 100 days in office to undo the safeguards erected by Donald Trump and open the floodgates. But many were shocked at the White House's indifference to what was called a ""crisis"" even as it built to horrifying and politically damaging levels.

It takes unimaginable chutzpah, 30 days out from the election, to try to convince voters that Harris has been concerned about the border all along, and that Donald Trump is actually to blame for the flood of illegal entrants in the past three years. To that end, Harris engaged in a meaningless photo op showing the vice president striding resolutely next to a wall that she had previously described as a ""gross misuse of taxpayer money"" and vowed to ""block any funding for"" during Trump's presidency.

Harris seemed to believe that taking 20 minutes - 20 minutes!!! - out of her frantic campaigning would change how millions of Americans viewed her failure to secure our border. She was hoping to be excused for allowing more than ten million people to illegally enter our country, and forgiven by the families of those killed by migrants or by fentanyl.

She took this politically risky leap on the heels of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) reporting that 425,431 convicted criminals, including 62,231 convicted of assault, 2,521 kidnappers, 14,301 convicted of burglary, and 13,099 convicted of murder - all of whom crossed our border illegally -- are at large in our country.

Are these the folks that pro-immigration groups, led by United We Dream and Amnesty International USA recently claimed in a letter to Joe Biden, ""make our country better by every measure""? This is an outrage and confirms the system is broken - thanks to Joe Biden, Kamala Harris and Alejandro Mayorkas, who should have been impeached or made to resign for failure to do his job.

Most pathetic, Harris continues to hope that those who blame her for ignoring her duty will decide that it was all Donald Trump's fault. If only he hadn't sabotaged the bipartisan senate bill designed to secure our border, she seems to say, Laken Riley, Rachel Morin and Jocelyn Nengaray would still be alive, as would the hundreds of thousands who have died from fentanyl overdoses.

She lies. The bill that she touts as having had bipartisan backing was ripped by most Republicans because it gave the White House too much discretion in enforcing our asylum laws and left open loopholes flagrantly abused by cartels. It is also true that a number of Democrats voted against the bill, including members of the Progressive Caucus. Finally, the bill showed up just this year after millions of migrants had already trampled our border. As the Border Patrol Union posted on X: ""Vice president Harris has ignored the border problem she created for over three years. She goes down there for 20 minutes for a photo op... where has she been the last 3 1/2 years?""

Recall that Joe Biden actually introduced an immigration ""reform"" bill the day he took office. Originally called the U.S. Citizenship Act, the bill was a sop to progressives and was not about securing the border. Instead, it was, as the name suggested, all about providing a pathway to citizenship for people in the U.S. illegally. That - and not protecting our border - has been the priority for the Biden-Harris White House. The legislation was such a non-starter that Democrats in charge of Congress never took it up.

Pennsylvania absentee voting underway in some counties,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/pennsylvania-absentee-voting-underway-some-counties,2024-10-01T09:09:09Z,"Pennsylvania residents spoke with Fox News Digital about their thoughts on 2024's intense political rhetoric and what issues are driving their vote.

Pennsylvania's 19 Electoral College votes are up for grabs in the 2024 presidential election with absentee voting in the Keystone State underway for some voters there.

Pennsylvania was one of three Rust Belt states that flipped from the Democrats to former President Trump and Republicans in 2016, then back to President Biden four years later. In each case, the margin was thin with less than 100,000 votes separating the main candidates.

The state has also been critical to each president's pathway to victory. It has the largest population and the most Electoral College votes of the seven most competitive states in the Fox News Power Rankings.

A recent Fox News survey has the race tied, with Democrat nominee Vice President Harris and Trump each receiving support from 49% of likely voters.

The bulk of the Democrat vote comes from the ""bookends"" of the state, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, where Harris will likely perform well among Black and suburban voters.

Trump makes up for that with White rural and non-college-educated voters who live in the middle of the state. The former president has brought these voters out to the ballot box twice, and a Pennsylvania-heavy rally schedule shows he is looking to do that again.

Pennsylvania is ranked ""Toss-Up"" in the Fox News Power Rankings.

The Keystone State also has a U.S. Senate race on the ballot. Democrat Sen. Bob Casey has won three elections before, but securing a fourth will be more difficult with White working-class voters drifting away from his party. Republicans are hoping businessman Dave McCormick will connect with them. That race is ranked ""Leans Dem.""

Pennsylvania is also home to a handful of competitive U.S. House races led by:

Black voters across several states spoke with Fox News Digital about whether they were far better off 4 years ago under former President Trump. Voters from Atlanta, Chicago, and Detroit shared if their financial situations had improved or gotten worse since the Biden-Harris administration took over.

One Black man from Chicago said that he has been ""shaking"" under the current economy.

""[The economy has gotten] really moreso worse. A lot of stuff hasn't really been getting better,"" Emmanuel told Fox News Digital. ""Everything went up.""

""Inflation has been terrible. And the person that was in the office there, he wasn't really doing too much for us,"" Atlanta resident Marcellus said.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

""When Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower,"" he added.

However, several voters said because Harris has not served as president, led them to believe she still has a chance to prove herself.

""Kamala, from my understanding, has never really been in office as the president like that ... she has been vice president,"" said Porter, a student at Harold Washington College in Chicago.

Porter, who lived in the Windy City his entire life, said ""I would say that I would have no answer for that. But I believe that when Kamala is elected towards office, her policies and what she believes in will better fit my needs as a person.""

Anneliese, another Chicago resident, said that she ""was absolutely not better under the Trump presidency.""

""Well, I wasn't under Kamala's leadership as president. I was under her vice presidency, so she was never president. Some people also get that messed up,"" she said. ""Ever since Trump started running, I experienced a lot more ... racial discrimination, gender discrimination. And I can't speak to the Kamala presidency because she hasn't been president yet.""

In Atlanta, Tim, raised the fact that Harris has never served as president.

""That's a question that we don't know yet. Right? Kamala not even in office yet, so we can't speak on it,"" Tim said. ""We just want to speak from what we can see, we have experience living under. So I guess you won't have to just wait for Kamala and see what Trump did.""

Federal prosecutors rely on a law known as Section 666 to take down corrupt officials who accept bribes, but they have also been accused of trying to blur the definition of a bribe. They also have to prove an ""official act"" took place in exchange for whatever the allegedly corrupt politician was raking in.

NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS PLEDGES TO 'REIGN' NOT RESIGN

In 2016, the Justice Department filed corruption charges against James Snyder, former Republican mayor of Portage, Indiana, under the Section 666 rule.

He oversaw a $1.1 million deal to buy garbage trucks for the city from Great Lakes Peterbilt in 2013, according to court filings. In 2014, he received a $13,000 check from the dealership.

The FBI and federal prosecutors accused him of taking the money as a kickback for the truck sales. Snyder said it was payment for consulting services in a state where public officials are allowed to have outside employment.

He was convicted at trial, but his legal saga continued for years. After successfully seeking a retrial, he wound up convicted again and then lost his first appeal.

But in a 6-3 opinion written by Justice Brett Kavanaugh, the Supreme Court ruled in his favor, explaining that anti-bribery laws don't make all payments illegal, especially if they come after the fact without any evidence of a corrupt agreement.

FEDS SEIZE ERIC ADAMS' PHONE AFTER NYC MAYOR'S INDICTMENT

Snyder accepted a ""gratuity,"" not a bribe, the court found.

The court described gratuities as two forms of payment, neither of which met the definition of a bribe. The first is something given as a ""thanks,"" anything from a fancy lunch to a framed photograph. The second are gifts designed to ""curry favor"" but not in exchange for anything specific.

In a dissent by Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, the court's liberal wing countered that there was still evidence of corruption that would have made Snyder's payment unlawful. Kavanaugh wrote that the gratuities were not a federal crime but could still violate state and local ethics rules. Snyder was not accused of any crimes at the state level.

ADAMS' OFFICE LASHES OUT AT FBI EMPLOYEE WHO MIGHT HAVE 'IMPROPERLY LEAKED DETAILS' OF CORRUPTION PROBE

Kavanaugh also warned that if a federal law did crack down on gratuities, it could unlawfully infringe on states' right to regulate interactions between their own officials and constituents.

Adams' lawyers are arguing that the mayor never accepted any bribes and never took any actions in his official capacity to make good on a quid quo pro.

Anthony Capozzolo, a former federal prosecutor who handled public corruption cases in a neighboring district, said prosecutors clearly spelled out the alleged quid quo pro in Adams' indictment but that the mayor could have a better chance proving he made no ""official act.""

""This issue about him not being the mayor at the time, and what is the official act? That may get more scrutiny from the court,"" Capozzolo told Fox News Digital.

Adams' lawyer, Alex Spiro, wrote in the motion Monday that prosecutors failed to lay out an actual bribery case.

""The indictment in this case alleges a 'bribery' scheme that does not meet the definition of bribery and indeed does not amount to a federal crime at all,"" Spiro wrote in a court filing revealed Monday.

""It appears that after years of casting about for something, anything, to support a federal charge against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, prosecutors had settled on a theory that depended on the Department's longstanding view that Section 666 criminalizes gratuities, including gifts meant to curry favor with governmental officials but not linked to any specific question or matter,"" Spiro wrote. ""When the Supreme Court rejected that interpretation in June, prosecutors simply added a few vague allegations and called their theory bribery -- 'a far more serious offense than gratuities.'""

Adams' defense argued that the Justice Department's case ""doesn't work.""

""The indictment does not allege that Mayor Adams agreed to perform any official act at the time that he received a benefit. Rather, it alleges only that while serving as Brooklyn Borough President -- not Mayor, or even Mayor-elect -- he agreed generally to assist with the 'operation' or 'regulation' of a Turkish Consulate building in Manhattan, where he had no authority whatsoever, in exchange for travel benefits,"" Spiro wrote.

At issue are three text messages that prosecutors say Adams, during a past term as Brooklyn's borough president, sent to the former FDNY commissioner, Daniel Nigro. But there is additional context and conversations surrounding the texts that may convince the court they are less innocent than they sound when read alone, Capozzolo said.

Eric Adams texts to FDNY commissioner:

Spiro asked the court to dismiss the bribery charge due to the Snyder precedent and argued that the rest of the charges should get tossed because they were allegedly based on ""a host of false claims evidently attributable to a self-interested staffer with an axe to grind.""

NYC MAYOR ERIC ADAMS' ELECTRONIC DEVICES SEIZED BY FBI AMID CAMPAIGN INVESTIGATION

But Capozzolo pointed to page 33 of the indictment, where prosecutors spelled out an alleged series of phone calls between Adams, a staffer and a Turkish official, in which the official told Adams it was ""his turn"" to repay a favor and the mayor allegedly replied, ""I know.""

""That's about as quid pro quo as you're going to get,"" Capozzolo said.

Read the Eric Adams indictment:

On the other hand, the government may have an uphill battle proving Adams actually returned the Turks a favor with an official act.

""Adams may have a chance of getting the charge dismissed as a result,"" Neama Rahmani, another former federal prosecutor, told Fox News Digital.

He said the Snyder decision ""significantly"" weakened the federal bribery law and noted that it's not uncommon to see convictions under the statute get overturned on appeal.

""The Supreme Court has also required an official act for a bribery conviction,"" he said. ""Adams was a candidate for mayor, but he was the Brooklyn borough president at the time, which means he didn't have official authority over a building in Manhattan. The defense is using that important fact to argue that there could be no official act for the purpose of the bribery statute.""

Before the Justice Department announced Adams' indictment last week, the mayor accused federal investigators of retaliation over his criticism of President Biden and Vice President Harris for their handling of the southern border, which he said led to a migrant crisis in New York City that overloaded its shelter system. The influx of illegal immigrants coincided with a spike in robberies in the Big Apple, city police said earlier this year.

Still, the federal investigation has ensnared numerous people in the mayor's orbit, including campaign staffers, city officials and even his former police commissioner, in an alleged corruption ring of such a scale that Capozzolo said it's a throwback to the 1800s-era Tammany Hall and Boss Tweed.

Adams could face up to 45 years in prison if convicted of all charges, which include one count of conspiracy to receive campaign contributions from foreign nationals and commit wire fraud and bribery, one count of wire fraud, two counts of soliciting campaign contributions from foreign nationals, and one count of soliciting and accepting a bribe."
"Heightened 'significance and importance' as Vance, Walz face-off in VP debate",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/heightened-significance-importance-vance-walz-face-off-vp-debate,2024-10-01T08:09:41Z,"NEW YORK - With a second face-to-face showdown between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Trump unlikely - and with a margin-of-error race with five weeks until Election Day in November - there's a lot on the line in the vice presidential debate.

While debates between the running mates are the undercard of a White House race and have rarely moved the need much in the past, when Republican vice presidential nominee Sen. JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, the Democrats' nominee, face-off on Tuesday, there will be heightened stakes.

Any major knockout blow - or agonizing misstep - could turn what's traditionally seen as a second-tier event into an impactful showdown.

""Given that we're only likely to have one head-to-head matchup between the principal candidates and this is the last meet up between the two tickets directly before the election, it heightens the importance and significance of this debate,"" longtime Republican strategist and communicator Ryan Williams, a veteran of multiple presidential campaigns, told Fox News.

THE WHO, WHAT, WHERE, AND WHEN OF TUESDAY'S JD VANCE-TIM WALZ VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Most political pundits said that Harris bested Trump last month in their first and likely only debate. And flash polls of debate watchers agreed.

So a strong showing by Vance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate could give Trump a boost.

CLICK HERE FOR THE LATEST FOX NEWS POLLING IN THE 2024 ELECTION

And there's a precedent from twelve years ago.

After a shaky first debate by then-President Barack Obama against 2012 GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, then-Vice President Joe Biden's well-regarded performance in the running mate debate against Romney running mate Rep. Paul Ryan gave the Democrats' ticket a big boost.

Heading into the 2024 vice presidential debate, the 40-year-old Vance has been very talkative, sitting for scores of interviews and taking plenty of questions from reporters on the campaign trail.

Walz, who is 60, has been much more reluctant to speak with the national news media.

The governor has been in debate camp ahead of the showdown, to prepare. Walz huddled with advisers and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg - who played the role of Vance in mock debates - in Harbor Springs, Michigan, near the northern tip of the state's lower peninsula.

Also helping out - Walz's wife - Minnesota First Lady Gwen Walz.

Asked on the eve of the showdown with Vance how his wife had been helping him with debate preparation, Walz told reporters ""she wins every one.""

WHAT THE LATEST FOX NEWS 2024 ELECTION POWER RANKINGS SHOW

A source familiar with Vance's debate prep tells Fox News Digital that over the last month, the senator took part in a series of murder board sessions with his team, where a group of people who ask tough questions and have candid discussions to help someone prepare for a difficult examination or test, or in Vance's case, a vice presidential debate.

According to the source, Vance conducted a mock debate over the past week, with Rep. Tom Emmer of Minnesota, the House majority whip, playing the role of Walz. Former Trump administration Treasury Department assistant secretary Monica Crowley played the role of one of the moderators from CBS News, which is hosting the debate in New York City.

Halfway through the mock debate, the power went out, as a strong storm slammed through the vicinity of Cincinnati, Ohio, where Vance lives and where the prep session was held. But according to the source, who shared the details first with Fox News, Vance and the team continued on, using lanterns for lighting and cellphones for timers.

Emmer and Walz overlapped for four years in the House before Walz won election in 2018 as Minnesota's governor. ""I do know him probably as well or better than most on the Republican side,"" he said.

And Emmer, taking a shot at his fellow Minnesotan, argued ""the hardest part of playing Walz... is trying to tell lies with a straight face, because that's what he does. He's good at the debate game, but there isn't substance there. There's a lot of air.""

Former President Trump, asked Monday if he had given his running mate any advice, told reporters, ""No, he doesn't need it.""

But he added that he and Vance had ""been speaking a little bit back and forth"" and that he thought the senator was in ""good shape.""

Part of the Trump campaign's strategy ahead of the debate is to raise expectations for Walz.

""Walz is very good in debates. I want to repeat that. Tim Walz is very good in debates. Really good. He's been a politician for nearly 20 years. He'll be very well prepared for tomorrow night,"" Trump campaign senior adviser Jason Miller told reporters on Monday.

Walz comes into the debate with better poll numbers than Vance.

According to the latest Fox News national poll, Walz was slightly above water with a 43% favorable rating and a 40% unfavorable rating.

Vance stood in negative territory, at 38%-50% favorable/unfavorable.

The senator arrived in New York City on Monday afternoon, and in the evening took a break from debate preparations to headline a gathering of GOP mega donors.

Walz was scheduled to fly to New York City on Tuesday, ahead of the debate.

The vice presidential debate is being moderated by ""CBS Evening News"" anchor and managing editor Norah O'Donnell and ""Face the Nation"" host and chief foreign affairs correspondent Margaret Brennan.

The 90-minute debate, which kicks off at 9pm ET, will take place at the CBS News broadcast center in New York City.

The Fox News Channel, FOX Business Network, Fox News Digital, Fox News Audio and Fox Nation will air special programming of the debate.

Both the Harris and Trump campaigns agreed to two four-minute commercial breaks during the debate. Campaign staff are not allowed to interact with the candidates during those breaks.

The other rules - including no studio audience - are similar to September's Harris-Trump debate and June's debate between Trump and President Biden.

But there is one major difference - a candidate's microphone won't be muted when the opponent is speaking."
Pennsylvania deadlock: Why Kamala picked the wrong running mate,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/shows/media-buzz/pennsylvania-deadlock-why-kamala-picked-wrong-running-mate,2024-10-01T07:07:51Z,"Harris 2024 senior adviser Ian Sams reacts to reports Tim Walz is 'nervous' about the vice presidential debate and discusses VP Kamala Harris' stance on the looming port strike on 'The Story.'

If Kamala Harris loses Pennsylvania, Donald Trump is the 47th President of the United States.

Now you could say the same about Michigan or Wisconsin, but it especially seems that a Democratic candidate should be able to carry the Keystone State.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN 'UNDERWATER' IN KEY BATTLEGROUND STATE, DEM REP WARNS DONORS

And that's why, in my view, Kamala should have picked Josh Shapiro, its popular governor.

I have nothing against Tim Walz, of football coach fame, but I don't see what he's done for the ticket. There's a reason the campaign hasn't let him do any solo interviews - a stark contrast with JD Vance, who is constantly doing interviews and holding press conferences.

In fact, Vance now frequently takes reporters' questions in front of supporters, who boo the journalists, sometimes even before they start speaking.

We'll find out whether Walz can think on his feet when he faces off against Vance in tonight's VP debate. The most generous thing I can say is that the Coach will be rusty.

Let's look at the latest numbers.

The Real Clear Politics average has Trump leading Harris by a miniscule margin, 48.1% to 47.9%, which of course is a statistical tie.

At 538, the micro-margin in Pennsylvania is flipped, with Harris averaging 47.9% and Trump at 47.1%, another tie.

Now imagine that Shapiro, who is more of a moderate liberal than the uber-progressive Walz, was the running mate. And let's say Shapiro had brought in another 50,000 votes as the home-state guy. You can see where that would tip the balance.

Kamala didn't pick Josh for two reasons. They had a rough conversation when she interviewed him, with the governor insisting on an influential role if he were to relinquish his current job. But so what? Presidents and their veeps often don't see eye to eye. She preferred the image of Walz, hunter and fisherman, to the prospect of two East Coast lawyers.

But the more important reason is more troubling. Harris was under pressure from the anti-Israel faction in her party not to tap Shapiro, who is Jewish and a strong supporter of the Jewish state.

So the vice president effectively handed veto power to this minority faction, which basically backs the Hamas terrorists who would wipe out Israel, and would have faced a week or two of controversy as a result. I said at the time this would be a world-class mistake if she lost Pennsylvania.

The reason Harris has spent so much time in the Pittsburgh area is that the western end of the state is much more conservative than the eastern section anchored by Philadelphia. Her goal is to hold down Trump's margin in a part of the state that he'll easily win.

KAMALA HARRIS IS GETTING 'OUTHUSTLED' AND 'OUTCLASSED': JESSE WATTERS

One problem Harris faces right now is that she makes little news. By picking ""friendly"" interviewers, such as MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle, who has trashed Trump as a danger to democracy, she avoids tough questions and followups.

Visiting the Mexican border was a smart move, not just because Trump has a major lead on immigration, but because Harris broke into the news cycle, where images can count more than words, and attempted to position herself as tougher than Joe Biden on the issue.

Otherwise, I'm just hearing chunks of her stump speech in response to questions, starting with how her mother raised her. Repetition is important in politics, but if you don't throw in a few new lines, the press is left without a headline.

Meanwhile, Trump over the weekend called Harris ""mentally impaired,"" saying Biden just got old but she was born that way. He also said Harris should be impeached, and maybe prosecuted, for the way she helped run the country.

Now that is classic Trump. By using over-the-top rhetoric, he sparks a media debate about whether he's gone too far, and that debate revolves around the words ""Kamala"" and ""mentally impaired.""

IN HYPERPARTISAN ENVIRONMENT, MSNBC DRAWING FIRE FOR ANTI-TRUMP, PRO-HARRIS PROGRAMMING

Harris has wisely not responded to every Trump jab. But remember, Trump benefits from negative coverage as much as positive coverage because he's driving the news agenda.

Here's a pool report from Harris at a West Coast political event over the weekend: ""She then switched her remarks to talking about the need for comprehensive immigration reform. VP Harris remarks on the issue were very similar to her remarks in Arizona on Friday."" In other words, no news.

Think about this: Trump has been absolutely pummeled by a hostile press corps, is a twice-impeached convicted felon and carries the burden of Jan. 6. Harris has been riding an extraordinary wave of positive press, and yet she's slipped slightly in the polls and is tied in Pennsylvania.

And there's no question that if she loses there, the election is over."

BERNIE SANDERS SAYS HARRIS DROPPING FAR-LEFT POLICIES 'IN ORDER TO WIN THE ELECTION'

Harris has stepped up her interviews in recent weeks, including doing radio hits and a solo sit-down with a Philadelphia TV station. She also spoke to MSNBC's Stephanie Ruhle and she made time to hang out with supporter Oprah Winfrey last month at a star-studded campaign event.

But as for when she'll actually do a formal press conference as a candidate, that day may never come, at least while she's still a candidate.

Conservative Radio Libre host Jorge Bonilla feels Harris should do a press conference but said it's almost ""irrelevant"" because she continues to get a pass.

""She is highly unlikely to do a press conference because the media have enabled and encouraged her 'plexiglass basement' strategy, wherein she preserves the illusion of being out there while remaining wholly inaccessible to the press and therefore unaccountable,"" Bonilla told Fox News Digital.

In her interview in Philadelphia, her answer citing her middle-class upbringing when asked about specifics of her economic policy drew sharp criticism.

Biden to visit North Carolina days after Helene's path of destruction leaves many devastated,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/biden-visit-north-carolina-days-after-helenes-path-destruction-leaves-many-devastated,2024-10-01T02:13:37Z,"Trump transition team member Tulsi Gabbard pans the Biden-Harris administration's response to Hurricane Helene on 'The Ingraham Angle.'

President Biden announced on Monday that he will visit North Carolina on Wednesday after Hurricane Helene ravaged the state.

The president's announcement comes after critics slammed him for a lack of leadership after the monster storm's devastating impact on the southeastern portion of the country.

More than 120 people have been killed by Helene since the hurricane made landfall in Florida late Thursday before tearing a path of destruction through the interior Southeast.

The storm caused millions of power outages and billions in property damage as it smashed through the southern Appalachian Mountains and into the Tennessee Valley.

""I've ensured my travel will not disrupt the ongoing response. I plan to travel to Georgia and Florida as soon as possible.""

But the president's announcement was followed by harsh criticism from the public, with one person writing, ""Joe Biden's visit is too little, too late.""

Another person wrote, ""Don't come to Florida we got hit ground zero. The governor is covering it,"" referring to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis.

JD Vance of Ohio and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate.

The images being projected by the DNC - which were shared first with Fox News Digital - include an eight-year old critical comment of Trump that Vance wrote on social media.

""Vance on Trump: 'What an idiot'"" read the projection, which was a portion of a direct quote from Vance's 2016 social media post.

Vance was a one-time Trump critic when the former president first won the White House. But Vance became a major supporter, and after winning election to the Senate in 2022 with Trump's support, has become a top Senate ally of the former president and his America First agenda.

Another projection charges that ""Trump is a chicken,"" as the DNC continues its attacks on the former president - launched recently on mobile and stationary billboards - for saying he won't debate Harris a second time.

Trump has said that it's too late for another debate because early in-person and absentee voting is already underway in a growing number of states across the country.

Project 2025 is a political initiative published by the well-known Heritage Foundation, a top DC-based conservative think-tank. While some of the authors who worked on the initiative - which includes some controversial planks - are veterans of the Trump administration, the former president and his campaign have pushed back vehemently against repeated attempts by Democrats to link him to Project 2025.

Another projection from the DNC is less controversial. It merely says ""Go Coach Walz!""

Walz was a longtime high school teacher and coach in Nebraska and then Minnesota before entering politics.

""These projections on Trump Tower NYC are a reminder that Trump and Vance are out for themselves while Trump remains afraid to go back on that debate stage and be held accountable by Vice President Harris for his failed record and his dangerous agenda,"" DNC deputy communications director Abhi Rahman argued in a statement.

And Rahman predicted that ""America will reject their self-serving, extreme Project 2025 plans this November.""

This is the second time in a month that the Democrats have projected images on a Trump Tower.

The DNC also shined images on Trump Tower in Chicago ahead of the Democratic National Convention in August.

Trump Tower in New York City - at the intersection of 5th Avenue and 57th Street - has long been a staple of the Midtown Manhattan skyline for nearly four decades.

""What I didn't hear from her was divisive language,"" Ruhle told her MSNBC colleague Nicolle Wallace. ""Imagine if I was sitting against Donald Trump, imagine the language he would be using, please! And just the fact that we were talking about collaborative inclusivity -- I don't know. Vote for her or don't vote for her, but isn't it great to just have a positive conversation right now?""

Ruhle admitted that Harris didn't answer a question about how she would get the funding for her ambitious economic agenda without Congress, but quickly defended her by saying Trump would ""balloon"" the deficit ""significantly bigger than Vice President Harris will.""

She went on to say it's ""okay"" for Harris not to offer specifics about her policy proposals and shrugged off the non-answers as her simply being a ""politician.""

""It's complicated, right?"" Ruhle exclaimed. ""We're a country of 330 million people, our economy is complicated. In the same way -- is the economy good or bad? It totally depends! So tariffs, if used in the right places, can work. And one could watch that and say, 'Well, she didn't give a clear, direct answer.' That's okay, because we are not talking about clear or direct issues."""

LAURA INGRAHAM: Time for a real president. That's the focus of tonight's ""Angle."" Millions of Americans are suffering and more than 130 are dead in the aftermath of one of the worst hurricanes ever to hit the United States.

HURRICANE HELENE WREAKS HAVOC ACROSS ASHEVILLE, NC; NATIONAL GUARD DEPLOYED, 119 RESCUED

You should expect more. Americans can't get out, they said, but Kamala Harris had no trouble getting into California and to Las Vegas to campaign over the weekend. While the same with Biden, he spent most of his time at Rehoboth Beach.

Well, needless to say, they were both slammed for their failure to address the nation in real time. ""Asleep at the wheel. Absentee leaders. The dereliction of duty."" These are just some of the phrases ricocheting around Instagram and Twitter about what seemed like a low-key public response to an epic national natural disaster. Now, Biden finally got shamed into going. He says he'll go to the region on Wednesday. As for Kamala, her team released a statement saying she would visit the regions affected when it was not disruptive to ongoing operations. Ande what they really meant was when it wasn't disruptive to Harris' previously scheduled campaign events."
Will Israel Attack Iran's Nuclear Program? Here's What To Know As Ex-PM Calls For Strikes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/10/08/will-israel-attack-irans-nuclear-program-heres-what-to-know-as-ex-pm-calls-for-strikes/,2024-10-08T21:39:57Z,"While Iran does not yet have nuclear arms, analysts believe the country's nuclear development program might be a prime target for Israeli retaliation -- despite U.S. opposition -- following Iran's missile launches at Israel, as a former Israeli prime minister argues for an attack on Iranian nuclear facilities.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

Israel and Iran are archrivals with a history of terse relations dating back to Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution. A corresponding decades-long shadow war -- fueled by Iran's years of supporting Lebanese Shia militia Hezbollah and Islamist militant group Hamas -- has become a direct conflict as tensions spiked in recent years, particularly after Hamas' attack on Israel last year and Israel's intense invasion of Gaza. Israel -- alongside the U.S. and the U.N. -- has been concerned with Iranian nuclear progress since Iran started its weapons program in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Israel has spent the decades since targeting the program to prevent nuclear development through Israeli-connected missions like stealing nuclear secrets, sabotaging explosions and launching drone attacks. While Israel never took responsibility, Iran accused the country of assassinating top Iranian scientist Mohsen Fakhrizadeh in 2020. Iran has enough weapons-grade nuclear fuel to make three bombs and is one of the only countries without nuclear weapons that can produce 60%-enriched uranium, a quality of enriched uranium close to the 90% needed for weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal. Russian ties to Iran have deepened in recent years, and Bloomberg has reported the U.S. is concerned about the sharing of information and technology between the two countries -- a potential boon to Iran's nuclear interest. Israel is considered an undeclared nuclear weapons power because it is believed to have nuclear arms but has not confirmed possession of them, according to the Center for Arms Control and Non-Proliferation.

While hitting it would be viewed as a major escalation, Israel has long watched Iran's nuclear enrichment plant in Natanz, an enrichment facility buried in the desert with thousands of centrifuges, according to the New York Times. Other facilities, like the enrichment plant buried under a mountain in Fordow, represent another potential target, yet U.S. officials have historically blocked Israel from getting the bomber planes and weapons powerful enough for an attack so deep underground, The Times reports. But Israel's methods have used other methods than bombings or missile attacks. Israel has a strong cyberdefense program -- exhibited recently when it launched an attack that exploded wireless devices owned by Hezbollah members. Another attack believed to be from the U.S. and Iran happened in the early 2000s -- called ""Olympic Games"" and known commonly the Stuxnet virus -- was a cyberattack that used digital ""worms"" to disrupt Natanz's facility operations.

Matthew Bunn, a professor of energy, national security and foreign policy at Harvard, told Forbes that there would be no nuclear fallout, or spreading of radioactive material, from attacking a uranium enrichment facility like Natanz or Fordow. These facilities deal with uranium that has not been irradiated in a nuclear reactor, meaning it's less radioactive. In an attack, some areas may suffer ecological damage, but the result would be isolated to the limited quantity of uranium at the locations, he said.

In April, top Iranian general Ahmad Haghtalab threatened that the country could revise its nuclear policies if Israel hit its nuclear sites, saying such an attack could incite Iranian counterattacks targeting Israel's own nuclear facilities, according to reporting by state-run Islamic Republic News Agency.

In mid-2018, former President Donald Trump pulled out of a 2015 nuclear deal with Iran, formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Under the Obama administration deal, Iran agreed to limit its nuclear activities and permit U.N. inspections, and in return, economic and financial sanctions set by the EU, U.S. and U.N. were lifted. The deal outlined three main points: reducing Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium (a key ingredient in making bombs) by 98%, stopping production of higher-grade enriched uranium for 15 years and removing two-thirds of its more than 19,000 centrifuges (machines that enrich uranium). Under the deal, it would take Iran about 12 months to make a nuclear weapon. Trump was outspoken against the deal, calling it ""too much in exchange for too little."" Since 2018, Iran has significantly advanced its nuclear program, and while there is no evidence of nuclear-armed missiles, officials are concerned about metallurgy and computer modeling research related to weapons, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Iran's nuclear capacity is playing out as a point of contention in the 2024 presidential campaign and was the leading question posed in Tuesday's vice presidential debate, with Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz arguing Trump was incapable of de-escalating tensions and did not put adequate nuclear protections in place when he pulled out of the 2015 nuclear deal. Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, argued the Biden-Harris administration has supported Iran financially and that ""Donald Trump consistently made the world more secure."" Trump said on Oct. 4 at a campaign event in North Carolina that Israel should ""hit the nuclear first and worry about the rest later."" When asked in a 60 Minutes interview on Oct.7, Vice President Kamala Harris responded that Iran was the U.S.'s greatest foreign adversary."

President Joe Biden addressed the country from the White House Tuesday morning and called Hurricane Milton ""a matter of life and death."" He encouraged Florida residents in the path of the storm to evacuate ""now"" and postponed a planned international trip to Germany and Angola ""in order to oversee preparations for and the response to Hurricane Milton."" Vice President Kamala Harris and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis have been in a strange he-said-she-said about the incoming storm, with Harris accusing DeSantis of not taking her calls and ""playing political games"" Desanis said Harris ""has no role in this"" and that he's been communicating just fine with Biden, who also said he has been in touch. Biden said he gave DeSantis his personal phone number and told him to call if there is anything the federal government can do to help. Tampa Mayor Jane Castor said in an interview with CNN, ""I can say without any dramatization whatsoever: If you choose to stay in one of those evacuation areas, you're going to die.""

Tampa International Airport closed at 9 a.m. Tuesday with plans to reopen ""as soon as it is safe"" later this week and Orlando International Airport will close at 8 a.m. Wednesday. Almost 1,000 flights into and out of the United States were delayed as of Tuesday afternoon with another 700 canceled. More than 1,500 flights scheduled for Wednesday have been canceled, Reuters reported, and major airlines have told passengers they can change their plans without paying a fare difference. Walt Disney World Resort was open and running as usual Tuesday, and the company said it is monitoring the weather and will make adjustments as needed. Universal Resort Orlando announced Tuesday afternoon it will close at 2 p.m. EDT Wednesday and remain closed Thursday. Legoland Florida Resort and SeaWorld Orlando will both be closed on Wednesday and Thursday, and Busch Gardens Tampa is now closed through Thursday.

Milton will be the second major hurricane to hit Florida in two weeks. Hurricane Helene hit the state on Sept. 26, killing at least 20 in Florida, before going on to devastate parts of the southeastern United States. More than 220 people have died and hundreds more are still missing, with western North Carolina taking the brunt of flooding that the state's governor says wiped communities ""off the map."" In Florida, people are still working to clear debris from Helene as the next storm bears down. Ahead of Hurricane Milton, Hillsborough County, home to Tampa, ordered evacuations for areas near Tampa Bay and for all mobile and manufactured homes by Tuesday night. Lee County, home to Fort Meyers, issued a mandatory evacuation order for the island of Fort Myers Beach. Other mandatory evacuation orders have been issued in Pinellas County, Pasco County and Manatee County. DeSantis on Tuesday said he wasn't sure exactly how many people plan to evacuate for Hurricane Milton, but that he thinks those who saw Hurricane Helene will be particularly motivated to leave the area.

Federal Emergency Management Agency has said it is grappling with ""extremely damaging"" false narratives circulating about Hurricane Helene, which hit the U.S. two weeks ago. FEMA chief Deanne Criswell said misinformation about the storm and the federal government's response is the ""worst"" she's ever seen as former President Donald Trump and his allies slam the agency. Trump incorrectly claimed FEMA couldn't respond appropriately to the storm because it diverted so much money to helping migrants on the order of Vice President Kamala Harris. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas said the agency is ""meeting the immediate needs with the money that we have."" Other rumors include that FEMA has been withholding aid from areas that have historically voted Republican and that the agency is only giving $750 to disaster survivors to support their recovery."
Harris Would Create A New Medicare Benefit For Long-Term Care,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2024/10/08/harris-would-create-a-new-medicare-benefit-for-long-term-care/,2024-10-08T20:30:01Z,"Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has backed an earth-shattering idea: For the first time, traditional Medicare would pay for personal assistance at home and related long-term care. Currently, only Medicaid and certain Medicare managed care programs provide long-term care benefits.

Harris endorsed the idea in an appearance on the television show The View and her staff heavily promoted her initiative to news organizations. She'd break down the six-decade wall between traditional Medicare and long-term care and potentially vastly expand government support for frail older adults and their families.

In her television appearance, Harris spoke passionately about being a caregiver for her own mother. She proposed having ""Medicare cover in-home health care,"" but it was clear from the rest of her remarks that she meant in-home long-term care. Medicare already covers home health care, though with many limitations.

No Details

But Harris has not offered any details of a plan. We don't know who would be eligible, what services would be covered, or what dollar limits, if any, would be placed on benefits. How would the program interact with Medicaid or with private long-term care insurance? She did say she'd pay for at least some of her initiative with Medicare savings from negotiating drug prices. A Harris staffer did not respond to a request for more information about her idea.

While Harris is not willing to disclose details of a plan, if she indeed has settled on any, we may be able to see hints of what she has in mind from new two papers written by influential policy experts who are well connected to top Democratic lawmakers.

Some Hints

One, published by the Brookings Institution in September, proposed making long-term care available to all Medicare beneficiaries who need assistance with at least two activities of daily living (such as eating, bathing, and transferring from a bed to a chair). Benefit amounts would be linked to income and assets so that higher-income, wealthier beneficiaries would pay more of the cost of their care than low-income people. Care would only be covered if it is provided through a licensed home care agency.

The paper's authors include Wendell Primus, a former top domestic policy aide to then-House Speaker Nancy Pelosi; Jonathan Gruber, who served as a senior Treasury Department official in the Clinton Administration; and Sherry Glied and Richard Frank, who held senior policy positions in the Department of Health and Human Services during the Obama Administration.

The second paper, published by Georgetown University in late September, was authored by Judy Feder, who served as a senior policy aide at HHS during the Clinton Administration, and Nicole Jorwic of the advocacy group Caring Across Generations.

They proposed a benefit that would cover those with a somewhat lower need for assistance, including those with cognitive limitations, as well as support for family members. They also said any plan should include ""a significant investment in building the workforce"" -- presumably through increased compensation or career advancement opportunities.

More Ambitious Than Biden

Whatever she does, Harris would be moving well beyond existing government support for long-term care and be far more ambitious than President Biden.

In 2021, the Biden Administration proposed increasing the federal government contribution to Medicaid long-term care by $400 billion over 10 years. Medicaid, which is run by the states with funding assistance from the federal government, does pay for long-term care, but only for those with very low incomes and very few financial assets.

But Biden's plan died in Congress. More recently Biden and Harris proposed a scaled down $150 billion version of the same idea. It too went nowhere.

Harris would take a very different path. Rather than expanding Medicaid long-term care, she'd create a long-term care benefit through traditional Medicare.

Medicare Managed Care

Despite common misconceptions, traditional Medicare does not pay for long-term care, except under very limited circumstances.

Various forms of Medicare managed care may pay for long-term care, however. Special Needs Plans do so. The PACE program, which generally benefits those eligible for both Medicare and Medicaid, provides fully integrated long-term care and managed health care. But both have limited enrollment.

Medicare Advantage managed care plans, which currently insure more than half of all Medicare beneficiaries, may provide very limited long-term care-like services. But they are very modest, averaging less than $50-a-month.

Dipping A Toe

In 2023, the Biden Administration dipped its toe in the traditional Medicare long-term care world. It created a program called GUIDE, which pays Medicare providers such as physicians and therapists a monthly supplement for providing care navigation services and limited social supports to traditional Medicare recipients living with dementia and their families.

But that effort also is quite modest, limited only to those with dementia, and focused mostly on care coordination rather than personal care.

In her tight race for president, Harris is trying to win support of tens of millions of family caregivers. Creating a viable Medicare long-term care benefit surely would be an enormous help to those caregivers and a stunning shift in federal policy. But, poorly designed, it could be unworkable or a massively expensive give-away. If only we knew how Harris would turn her talking point into a real plan."
Pennsylvania 2024 Trump-Harris Polls: Harris Has Less Than 1-Point Lead In Polling Averages,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/08/pennsylvania-2024-trump-harris-polls-harris-has-less-than-1-point-lead-in-polling-averages/,2024-10-08T19:37:17Z,"Former President Donald Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris are nearly tied in Pennsylvania, according to two new polls this week in the battleground state, where a win for either candidate could pave the way to the White House.

No Democrat has won the White House without Pennsylvania since 1948. If Harris wins Pennsylvania, and the trend of also winning Wisconsin and Michigan holds, she's all but certain to win the White House.

82%. That's the share of registered voters in Pennsylvania who said the economy is a major factor in their 2024 vote, followed by inflation at 78% and the state of democracy at 70%, according to the CBS/YouGov survey. The results are on par with the national electorate, according to a recent Pew Research survey of registered voters that found 81% of registered voters rate the economy as ""very important"" in the election.

Trump and his allies have repeatedly attacked Harris over her previous endorsement of a fracking ban -- Pennsylvania is the country's second-largest natural gas producer. ""Fracking? She's been against it for 12 years,"" Trump said during Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. Harris, who said during a 2019 CNN climate town hall while she was running for president ""there's no question I'm in favor of banning fracking,"" has said she's since changed her stance. During Tuesday's debate, she said she made ""very clear"" in 2020 that she's against a fracking ban, presumably referring to her vice presidential debate with Mike Pence, and noted the Inflation Reduction Act opened new gas leases -- reiterating a stance she took in a CNN interview last month. Harris didn't actually say she changed her own position on the issue during the 2020 debate -- instead she said then-Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden ""will not end fracking.""

Pennsylvania has a divided state legislature. The state's Democratic governor, Josh Shapiro, is widely popular in the state. Democrats also control the House, but Republicans hold the majority in the Senate.

Harris leads Trump in four of seven battleground states, while Trump is ahead in North Carolina, Arizona and Georgia, according to FiveThirtyEight's polling averages that show margins of less than two points in all seven battleground states (Nevada, Arizona, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin). If Trump maintains his leads in Arizona and Georgia, and wins North Carolina, as he's expected to, he would need just one of the ""Blue Wall"" states (Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin) to win the White House.

Matt Barnes And Stephen Jackson Talk Success Of 'All The Smoke' Podcast And Their Long-Term Career Objective,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/djsiddiqi/2024/10/08/matt-barnes-and-stephen-jackson-talk-success-of-all-the-smoke-podcast-and-their-long-term-career-objective/,2024-10-08T18:05:22Z,"Former NBA stars Matt Barnes and Stephen Jackson have made quite the impact in the podcasting space.

While athlete podcasts are all the rage these days, with Travis and Jason Kelce recently inking a $100 million deal for their podcast, New Heights, that wasn't always the case just a few years ago when Barnes and Jackson started All The Smoke in October of 2019.

Although Barnes and Jackson never had aspirations or defined objectives of becoming notable figures in the media space once their playing career ended, that's exactly what happened. The two former NBA stars have a strong social media audience for their podcast, with two million followers combined across YouTube and Instagram. They recently hosted presidential candidate, Kamala Harris, for an episode and notably featured the late great Kobe Bryant in his last interview before his passing.

The 44-year-old Barnes -- who leads a lot of the business operations behind the scenes of All The Smoke -- explains how the podcast came together.

""At the time, I didn't really know what a podcast was,"" Barnes explains in a one-on-one interview. ""Stak (Jackson) and I we were both working for ESPN and FOX back and forth between those networks and we received a lot of positive feedback. We met up at my place in the Bay Area watching the game one day and I was just like, 'Hey, let's do a podcast.' He was like, 'What's a podcast? I told him, 'I don't really know, but I think it's more lax and you might be able to have a drink.' He kind of started laughing and said, ""Hey I'm in.'

Barnes then details that he met Showtime Sports digital programming executive Brian Dailey through Aaron Newman, who produced the ""The Resurgence: DeMarcus Cousins"" documentary. From there, the deal quickly came together with Showtime Sports.

""It sounds crazy how easily it came together when I really didn't know what I was doing,"" says Barnes. ""But that's how it came together. They took a big chance on us and we were able to create something special. Our first season we got 'Sports Podcast of the Year,' put our foot down in the sports podcast space and it's almost like we're the OG's of the game now. Because at the time, it was Knuckleheads -- featuring former NBA stars Darius Miles and Quentin Richardson -- and there was really no other sports podcasts. Now, everywhere you turn, there's a new sports podcast coming out. I love the growth of the space.""

Barnes once again hammers home that he and Stak really didn't know what they were doing when the started the podcast on Oct. 8, 2019.

""When we started out, we really didn't know what we were doing or what it was and we were just free-styling,"" says Barnes.

Jackson himself admits that he didn't see the podcast developing into the well-oiled machine that it is today.

""No, not at all,"" Jackson says when asked if he envisioned becoming a podcasting gaints. ""There's a lot of things in your life you never predicted. Even the George Floyd stuff, I never predicted to be in that space. I knew that I had a hunger to do something on television after basketball, whether it was sports or acting, whether it was anything.

""But the opportunity came -- Rachel Nichols gave me the opportunity -- to work with her on the show on ESPN and it just spearheaded from there. We came up with the idea -- All The Smoke -- we didn't know it was going to blow up the way that it did. But we met all of the right people that helped us bring this together and it's just been growing.""

To commemorate the five-year anniversary of the podcast, Barnes and Jackson are releasing a book titled exactly how their podcast is framed, All The Smoke from Simon & Schuster on Tuesday, Oct. 8. The book features quotes from notable athletes and celebrities who have appeared on the podcast such as Bryant, Shaquille O'Neal, Kevin Garnett, The Game and Ice Cube.

The two are currently on a book tour which will feature an interactive fan experience with a live taping of All The Smoke in cities such as New York and Philadelphia (Oct. 9). They previously held a live taping in Chicago back in June.

The pair have been close friends since they teamed up to lead the ""We Believe"" 2006-2007 Golden State Warriors squad. That team is best known for upsetting the No. 1-seeded Dallas Mavericks, becoming just the third No. 8 seed in NBA history to beat a No. 1 seed. Barnes signed with the Warriors just prior to the start of the season while Jackson was traded to the team from the Indiana Pacers in the middle of the year.

""I knew him from competing against him, but I didn't really know him,"" says Barnes. ""I wouldn't even call him a friend at that point, it was just he was in the league, I was in the league. As soon as he got to the team, he and I hit it off instantly. We both like to partake in cannabis, that was kind of the common ground outside of basketball, we just started hanging out and getting to know each other better.""

Barnes explains how the passing of his mother at the start of the 2007-08 season is when the two really became ""brothers.""

""From teammates to friends to brothers and I think really when our friendship became brothers was after that season, my mom died at the very beginning of the next season,"" says Barnes. ""Even though the organization was great, Stak went out of his way daily to text me, call me, come by the house, watch TV with me, bring me food, come smoke with me and just kind of be that shoulder for me as I was trying to grieve through the loss of my mom. Obviously my mom and his mom connected -- they were really close. So it was almost like a real family affair and that's when we went from teammates to brothers.""

Jackson agrees with Barnes' sentiment that their ""brotherhood"" grew following the untimely passing of Barnes' mother.

""When I got there (to Golden State), I was a guy that was looking to re-brand myself,"" explains Jackson following his trade to the Warriors in 2007. ""But I wasn't looking to change. And Matt was the guy who accepted me for who I was. Our mothers clicked immediately, I think that made our brotherhood grow and then his mother passed so quick. I was there for him the whole time and I made it a point to be there for him.

""That's how our relationship built. I think a lot of times when you have relationships built off real-life issues, they're more genuine than if you just have a relationship playing basketball together. That was a tough experience for him and I was glad I was able to be there for him and I think our relationship has been solid ever since -- regardless of it was doing a podcast or anything. We have a brotherhood beyond any show or any type of business, we just love each other that type of way.""

While the All The Smoke podcast is a success in itself, the popularity of the podcast has led to creation of the All The Smoke Productions. The production company was founded in January of 2024 by Barnes and Dailey after the closure of Showtime Sports last December. The production company features a number of podcasts and partnerships under its umbrella, including The 25/10 Show featuring former NFL stars LeSean McCoy and DeSean Jackson, All The Smoke Fight -- a division dedicated to the fight game -- and a partnership with The LeBatard Show featuring veteran radio show host and TV personality Dan LeBatard.

It's all a part of the process of transforming the brand from a podcast entity into a full-fledged media production company.

""It's going to be a slow burn, but we want to be a full-fledged production/media company,"" explains Barnes. ""We're also on the political side, we do some political content, we're in talks for the golf space, I'm bringing in more talent for people in the MMA space, we sold our first show to Amazon, we're picking up two amazing documentaries that I don't really want to speak on right now, because I don't want to jinx it, but they're going to be really big and I'm excited about them.

The goal was obviously to get off the ground with what we knew, which was building podcasts and the ecosystem we've created, but our goal is to be a full-fledged company, production house, studio and media company.""

Jackson wants to continue to grow the All The Smoke Fight division as one of his long-term objectives while making their production company the ""Black Barstool Sports.""

""Long-term goals, big plans in the fight space,"" says Jackson. ""Just trying to take the blueprint that Showtime made and try to build on that and make it bigger and better. With All The Smoke and our production company, we want to be the Black Barstool Sports. We want to be able to do things like that -- build our brand.

""We have a lot of different angles. Brian Dailey is adding something new to our production company by the minute. We're just growing, we just want to be the best in every aspect of our production company. I think we're heading to that, because we all have a certain respect for each other, and when it's family like that, things can't help but work.""

While All The Smoke Productions continues to do that and expand with its talent and production roster, one thing that is undeniable is that the media space is transforming. Prior to recent years, it was the media -- mostly writers and TV personalities who had no experience playing pro sports -- that dictated the narrative and the perception of athletes.

That is now no longer the case, as Barnes points out -- which is part of the reason he entered the media world, particularly the podcasting space.

""Media wasn't in the plans in my day from '02 to '17, there was kind of a weird relationship with media and players and the narrative always being spun,"" explains Barnes. ""I wasn't really a fan, I had some people that I liked and respected in the space, but the overall sports media, I wasn't a fan. I've seen what they've done to me and my teammates over the years. How stories were told and how they were written or told on these platforms.

""I was kind of against the whole thing. but a friend of mine told me, 'If you don't like it, why don't you help change it? Get into it.'"" I don't feel like you need those machines (ESPN, FOX, etc.) anymore to get your point across, to go viral, or to really freely speak your mind."""
Taylor Swift Becomes World's Richest Female Musician: Here's Who Is Right Behind Her,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/08/taylor-swift-becomes-worlds-richest-female-musician-heres-who-is-right-behind-her/,2024-10-08T18:05:15Z,"Taylor Swift leapfrogged singer and beauty mogul Rihanna to become the world's richest female musician following the blockbuster success of her Eras Tour, as other female artists, including Madonna and Beyoncé, rank just outside the billion-dollar club.

Swift, 34, became the first musician to become a billionaire solely based on the value of songs and performances in 2023. Forbes estimates her music catalog is worth $600 million, and her tours and royalties have pocketed her another $600 million. She also owns an estimated $125 million in real estate. Her jump to billionaire status was driven largely by her ongoing Eras Tour, which began in March 2023 and is set to conclude in December. Last year, Forbes estimated the first leg of the Eras Tour alone earned her $190 million. The Eras Tour became the first ever concert tour to surpass $1 billion in total gross, Pollstar reported in December.

Rihanna, 36, became a billionaire in 2021, Forbes estimated, largely because of the value of her stake in Fenty Beauty, the cosmetics company she launched in 2017. She owns a 50% stake in the company, as well as an estimated 28% stake in lingerie brand Savage X Fenty. Both companies are named after the singer, whose real name is Robyn Fenty. She launched her latest beauty line, Fenty Hair, in June. Forbes ranked Rihanna as the 74th most powerful woman in the world in 2023. The rest of her wealth comes from her music catalog -- she has 14 Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits, the third-most of any artist, only behind The Beatles and Mariah Carey. She performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023, a brief break from her years-long hiatus from her music career. She hasn't released an album since her 2016 album ""Anti.""

Jay-Z is the richest musician on the Forbes billionaire list, with an estimated net worth of $2.5 billion. He's the first rapper to make the ranks. His wealth largely comes from his liquor business: He sold a 50% stake in his champagne brand, Armand de Brignac, to French luxury goods company LVMH in 2021 for at least $300 million, and a majority stake in his D'Usse cognac brand to Bacardi for $750 million in 2023. Forbes ranked Jay-Z as the fifth-richest celebrity in the world in April. Forbes reported Bruce Springsteen became a billionaire in June, with an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion. The New Jersey legend made much of his wealth from his music catalog, which he sold to Sony in 2021 for $500 million. Outside of music, Kim Kardashian ($1.7 billion) and Oprah Winfrey ($3 billion) both rank ahead of Swift and Rihanna as the world's richest female celebrities.

As Swift's wealth and fame have ballooned, so has her reputation as one of the world's most powerful people. Forbes ranked her the fifth most powerful woman in the world in 2023 -- making her the highest-ranked entertainer, and putting her in the company of the world's most influential political and business leaders -- citing the impact her Eras Tour has had on local economies and the dedication of her fan base, known as Swifties. Swift was also named the 2023 Time Person of the Year, and she has been considered an influential figure in politics. Her endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris was credited with a spike in visits to vote.gov, a voter registration website.

Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text ""Alerts"" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.

FEMA recently launched a website dedicated to correcting misinformation about the response to Helene on which it corrects falsehoods, encourages people to be ""aware of rumors and scams and (to share) official information from trusted sources.""

Hurricane Helene made landfall in Florida's Big Bend region on Sept. 26. It has killed at least 220 people across six states and caused extreme damage in a number of towns in the southeast, including Asheville, North Carolina, the AP reported. Millions of people were without power in the days following the storm, and more than 111,000 people were still without power in North Carolina as of Tuesday, according to poweroutage.us. The Biden administration mobilized 1,500 troops to assist National Guard and federal personnel in their recovery responses, and had given out more than $137 million in federal assistance as of Sunday. Both President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris visited the southeast last week to survey the damage and meet with leaders, and Trump visited Valdosta, Georgia, and said he brought ""truckloads of things"" like water and equipment to Georgia, Reuters reported. Trump almost immediately made the response to Helene political when he visited Georgia -- a key battleground state in November -- and alleged Biden had not called Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, despite Kemp saying earlier that day he had spoken to Biden. The president responded by saying Trump's lies were ""irresponsible"" and that the White House was doing everything it could to assist in recovery.

""It's un-American,"" Biden said Tuesday of political figures who spread misinformation about the hurricane response. ""It misleads people, it puts people in circumstances where they panic, where they really really really worry, they think 'I'm not being taken care of.'""

Harris criticized Trump for continuing to spread misinformation, saying on Monday it was ""extraordinarily irresponsible"" of him to push false information about what is available to survivors and those impacted by the storm, the Associated Press reported.

Harris also criticized Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis for not taking her calls about the incoming Category 4 Hurricane Milton, saying ""people are in desperate need of support right now and playing political games at this moment in these crisis situations ... is utterly irresponsible."" DeSantis later pushed back on Harris' criticism, saying ""she has no role in this"" and that he has been in touch with President Joe Biden to prepare for Milton.

How misinformation spreads with Hurricane Milton. Milton is expected to make landfall in Florida on Tuesday as a Category 4 hurricane after being downgraded from a Category 5. Officials have warned ""Milton will remain an extremely dangerous hurricane when it reaches the state,"" and much of Florida was under hurricane warnings, hurricane watches or tropical storm warnings as of Tuesday afternoon."

Whether scandals surrounding GOP gubernatorial candidate, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson, could hurt Trump's chances in North Carolina. Trump endorsed Robinson prior to a CNN report revealing a string of racist and derogatory comments he allegedly made on a pornographic website chat forum before his entrance into politics, including referring to himself as a ""Black NAZI."" Polls taken after the Sept. 19 story show Democratic candidate Josh Stein has widened his lead over Robinson, to as many as 19 points in a recent Emerson College survey. A CNN/SSRS poll released Sept. 27 also found Robinson trailing Stein by 17 points and a tie between Trump and Harris, suggesting Robinson's scandals haven't affected Trump's standing there. Historically, the demise of down-ballot candidates rarely drag down the affiliated party's presidential candidate, CNN notes.

16. That's how many electoral college votes North Carolina has, after gaining a vote after the 2020 census. The state has the eighth most electoral votes in the country, tied with Georgia.

Despite the electorate's increasingly Democratic leanings, Republicans hold a supermajority in both chambers of the legislature, giving it the power to override Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's vetoes.

North Carolina has only voted for one Democratic presidential candidate since 1980: Barack Obama in 2008.

Harris holds an advantage over Trump in almost all of the seven battleground states, according to the Bloomberg News/Morning Consult survey showing her leading among likely voters by seven points in Nevada, five in Pennsylvania, three in Arizona, Michigan and Wisconsin, and two in North Carolina, with a tie in Georgia. Trump also trails Harris in most recent national surveys and now leads him by two points overall, according to RealClearPolitics' polling average. North Carolina was the only swing state where Biden lost to Trump (by one point) in 2020.

In a shocking moment, Trump most recently bragged about his ""very good"" relationship with Putin in September while standing next to Putin's enemy Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Woodward's book also depicts the two remaining in touch after his presidency, with an unnamed aide saying calls between the two happened as much as seven times since 2021, according to the Post, citing the book. Trump has also publicly praised Putin, once calling him a genius, according to the New York Times.

Trump's relationship with Putin has become a prominent point on the campaign trail and at rallies, with Trump never saying that he wants Ukraine to beat Russia in the ongoing war and the former president repeating his claim of ending the Ukraine war before he gets into office. Vice President Kamala Harris mocked Trump during the debate in September for cozying up to dictators, saying that ""Putin would eat"" Trump for lunch if he returns to office. At the debate, Harris also criticized Trump for his relationship with other dictators."
How Immigration Can Become A Strategic Solution For U.S. Housing Needs,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/andyjsemotiuk/2024/10/08/how-immigration-can-become-a-strategic-solution-for-us-housing-needs/,2024-10-08T13:11:57Z,"As the United States grapples with housing shortages, the influx of migrants and homelessness, the need for innovative, scalable, and humane solutions has never been more urgent. Traditional housing approaches prioritizing permanent solutions, often miss the mark. Whether it is young people seeking to buy their first home, individuals moving to new cities, immigrants who have just landed, migrants shuttled to a new state, or unsheltered homeless people in California, a flexible and forward-thinking housing model is essential. And Immigration may be able to contribute to such a solution.

Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have made housing a key issue in the current presidential race. Vice President Harris promises to ""cut the red tape that stops housing construction, take on corporate landlords hiking rental prices, work with builders and developers to construct 3 million new homes and rentals, and help first-time homebuyers with $25,000 down payment assistance."" On the other hand, President Trump focuses on deregulation, proposing the opening of federal land for housing development and reducing regulatory hurdles to speed up construction. He opposes rent controls and aims to preserve single-family zoning, framing it as protecting suburban communities.

While these proposals target housing shortages through construction and regulatory reform, neither candidate has sufficiently focused on a critical opportunity: using immigration policy to address U.S. housing needs.

When Congress passed the Reform and Integrity Act of 2022 (RIA) to reform the EB-5 investor immigration program, it created three priority areas for EB-5 funding: high unemployment areas, infrastructure, and rural development. The EB-5 program enables foreign investors to obtain U.S. residency by investing in job-creating projects. Historically, the program has been used for commercial developments, luxury housing, and large-scale projects. However, expanding the EB-5 program to include affordable housing projects could significantly benefit U.S. cities facing severe housing shortages. By directing foreign capital into affordable housing developments, investor immigration could become a key component in solving the U.S. housing crisis. What is proposed here is to add housing to the EB-5 program as a fourth priority. This expansion would encourage foreign investors to channel their investments into developments in cities with the most pressing housing needs, such as affordable apartments in urban centers or temporary housing for new migrants in need of immediate shelter.

To further enhance the program, the U.S. could introduce an Expression of Interest (EOI) system for selecting such EB-5 investors. Such a system is currently in use in Canada, for example, to avoid long backlogs in processing of applications. The system would allow the government to pre-select investors based on factors such as their language proficiency, integration potential, ties to the U.S., and the urgency of housing needs in specific areas. By prioritizing high-quality investors who align with U.S. housing goals, the government can ensure that projects are completed efficiently and in a timely manner. This approach adds flexibility, allowing the U.S. to target investors who are not only financially capable but also committed to contributing to the communities they are entering while preventing frustrating backlogs.

Apart from helping young people looking to buy their first homes and people moving across the country to locate a house they can afford, expanding the EB-5 program for housing, together with some innovative programs we will mention shortly, would also help ensure that migrants and refugees arriving in the U.S. have access to adequate living conditions as they settle into new communities. This approach could reduce the pressure on cities and states already struggling with limited housing availability and strained public resources.

As migrants and refugees continue to arrive in the U.S., the availability of immediate, safe housing is critical to their successful integration. Cities that experience sudden surges in migrant populations often face a severe shortage of affordable housing, leaving many new arrivals without a place to live. Traditional housing models, focused on permanent homes, can take years to develop, and temporary shelters are often overcrowded and unsafe.

A more flexible housing model is needed to address these immediate needs. The U.S. could adopt innovative solutions like those used by Dignity Moves, a California-based nonprofit that provides interim housing for homeless individuals. Dignity Moves constructs affordable, dignified prefabricated units on vacant or underutilized land, providing private, lockable spaces for individuals in need of temporary shelter. This approach could be adapted to house migrants and refugees, offering them a safe place to live while they go through the immigration process and work towards more permanent housing.

To make these solutions work, public-private partnerships will be essential. Local governments, private investors, and nonprofits must work together to ensure that new housing is built quickly and affordably. As already mentioned, the EB-5 program can serve as a key funding mechanism by incentivizing foreign investors to contribute to affordable housing projects in exchange for U.S. residency. Local governments can further support these efforts by offering tax incentives, zoning benefits, and streamlined permitting processes to developers focused on affordable housing. Additionally, philanthropic organizations and corporate social responsibility initiatives can play a role by providing grants and operational support to nonprofits working on innovative housing solutions.

The U.S. housing crisis demands bold and innovative solutions that go beyond traditional construction and regulation reforms. By integrating immigration programs like EB-5 with innovative housing development programs like those mentioned and incorporating an Expression of Interest system to select the most suitable investors, the U.S. can address both the immediate housing needs of migrants and refugees and the broader national shortage of affordable housing while avoiding long immigration backlogs. This could be a game-changing approach to solving the problem involving creative partnerships between governments, private investors, and nonprofits -- all working together to ensure that everyone, from young couples buying their first home, to newly arrived migrants, to homeless people, has a place to call home."
New Study Finds Harris's Down Payment Subsidy Would Raise Home Prices,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adammillsap/2024/10/08/new-study-finds-harriss-down-payment-subsidy-would-raise-home-prices/,2024-10-08T13:11:46Z,"Back in August, Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris proposed $25,000 in taxpayer-funded down payment assistance to four million first-time homebuyers. While the intent of the program is to offset the high cost of housing, a new analysis from the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) finds that it would have the opposite effect, actually raising national home prices by 4%.

Kamala Harris's plan sounds simple enough: Give people money they can use to supplement their down payment, thus making it easier to buy a home. Unfortunately, real life is more complicated. Shortly after the plan was announced, more astute observers pointed out that subsidizing demand when there is a housing shortage in most areas would likely increase prices, not lower them. Why? Because when supply is constrained, subsidies that boost demand do not lead to more supply. Instead, the price rises until the higher demand meets the limited supply.

In housing markets throughout the United States, the supply of housing is constrained by land-use regulations -- density restrictions, minimum lot sizes, apartment bans -- and permitting processes that restrict construction. In such markets, economic theory tells us that housing subsidies are largely captured by the sellers of homes in the form of higher prices. Sure enough, that is what AEI scholars Edward Pinto, Tobias Peter, and Sissi Li find in their new study.

Building on a study published in the Journal of Housing Economics, Pinto and coauthors find that Harris's down payment assistance would increase home prices by 4.1% on average. They estimate the program would increase the total cost of the homes purchased by the four million subsidized homebuyers by $177 billion, which is more than the $100 billion total value of the subsidy (four million times $25,000 each). This means that on average the subsidy is not even helpful for those who get it. But it gets worse: The first-time homebuyers who receive the subsidy would bid up the prices of all homes, not just those they ultimately purchase, and the authors estimate that the total price increase would hit $1 trillion. Ouch.

America is a big place with hundreds of regional housing markets, so in addition to the national impact the authors estimate the impact of the subsidy on the 100 largest metropolitan areas. The program's impact on housing prices would vary by place due to differences in current home prices and inventories, as shown in the map below. In expensive areas, such as coastal California, $25,000 doesn't go very far so the impact on prices would be relatively small, around 1% to 2%. In cheaper areas like the Midwest, the program would boost prices by as much as 6%.

Though the AEI study's results may seem counterintuitive, they support what economic theory predicts: When supply is constrained, subsidies that boost demand also increase prices. The only sustainable way to decrease housing prices, or at least slow their growth, is to build a lot more housing. The only way to build more housing is to reform the land-use regulations and permitting processes that artificially constrain it. Harris should put her down payment assistance plan back on the shelf and instead urge state and local officials to make it easier to build housing in their communities."

The bitcoin price shot past its previous all-time high of over £70,000 per bitcoin this year before dropping back to around $60,000 as the U.S. and China begin what could become a crypto cold war.

Now, as Tesla billionaire Elon Musk warns the U.S. could collapse under the weight of its $35 trillion debt pile, JPMorgan analysts have predicted a so-called ""debasement trade"" could fuel a bitcoin price boom going into the U.S. election -- with Trump expected to add $7.5 trillion to U.S. debt.

""Rising geopolitical tensions and the coming U.S. election are likely to reinforce what some investors call the 'debasement trade' thus favoring both gold and bitcoin,"" JPMorgan analysts led by Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou wrote in a note to clients seen by Marketwatch.

Gold and bitcoin could be boosted by ""persistently high government deficits across major economies, to waning confidence in fiat currencies in certain emerging markets, and to a broader diversification away from the dollar,"" according to the analysts who said a Trump election win would likely reinforce the debasement trade.

Trump is forecast to increase the federal debt by around twice the increase expected if Democratic Party candidate Kamala Harris is elected, according to a report from the non-partisan Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

Trump would raise federal debt by $7.5 trillion by 2035 if he retakes the White House next month while vice president Harris is estimated to increase the debt by $3.5 trillion over the same period.

U.S. national debt has skyrocketed in recent years, crossing the $34 trillion mark at the beginning of 2024, largely due to Covid and lockdown stimulus measures.

JPMorgan analysts later wrote the bitcoin price has ""yet to see the 'pop' ... expected from lower rates since the Fed's September 18 cut,"" predicting in a note seen by The Block that the market may be waiting for more sustained stability before making a major move.

Despite Tesla billionaire Elon Musk's concerns about the out-of-control U.S. debt pile, causing him to warn last week the U.S. could collapse into ""bankruptcy,"" Musk has doubled down on his endorsement of Trump during a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania, the site of the first assassination attempt on Trump in July.

Trump now leads Harris by almost three percentage points in the crypto-powered Polymarket's election contract, with 52% to 46%.

Meanwhile, billionaire investor Mark Cuban has teased a plan floated by Trump to pay off U.S. national debt with bitcoin or crypto -- and the Doge Department of Government Efficiency backed by Musk.

""We don't know what Elon would actually do,"" Cuban said during an appearance on the All-In Podcast alongside fellow investors David Friedberg, Chamath Palihapitiya, Jason Calacanis and David Sacks, responding to a question about how the U.S. could begin to tackle its huge debt pile.

""Maybe [he'll] put doge in the Treasury, who knows, and that's how we make it all up,"" Cuban joked, referring to Elon Musk's on-again-off-again relationship with the meme-based bitcoin rival dogecoin.

Earlier this year, Trump floated the possibility of using bitcoin to pay off the U.S.'s $35 trillion debt pile.

"" Crypto is a very interesting thing,"" Trump told Fox Business in August. ""Maybe we'll pay off our $35 trillion, hand them a little crypto check, right? We'll hand them a little bitcoin and wipe out our $35 trillion."""
Markets In The Balance: Election Impact Hinges On Sweep Or Gridlock,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeffreyschulze/2024/10/08/markets-in-the-balance-election-impact-hinges-on-sweep-or-gridlock/,2024-10-08T12:40:55Z,"I write about financial market trends and recession risk indicators.

With a month to go before election day, the presidential race remains tight with Kamala Harris maintaining a slight lead over Donald Trump. Based on the prediction markets, the two most likely outcomes are either a Republican sweep or a Harris presidency with a divided government. This is due to races for the Senate favoring the Republicans.

Different presidential and congressional configurations will dictate how much legislation can be passed and ultimately how much an effect politics will have on stocks and the economy. A sweep scenario can lead to drastic changes in tax and spending policies. With a divided government, regulation and trade policy will come into play, because those are the areas where the president can act unilaterally.

Taxes

The new president will face a unique tax situation because major elements of the TCJA, the Trump tax cuts, are sunsetting in 2025. If nothing is done, almost every taxpayer will see a higher average tax rate. This should act as an incentive from both sides of the aisle to negotiate and extend some of these expiring provisions.

Kamala Harris recently released tax proposals to dramatically increase the tax rates on corporations and high-income households while leaving most Americans taxes unchanged, promising to protect households making under $400,000 from higher taxes. Her tax goals are unlikely to become reality, however, unless the Democrats retain control of the Senate and flip the House of Representatives.

Meanwhile Donald Trump would likely prioritize extension of the TCJA, including reinstating individual provisions that expired, including business depreciation allowances such as immediate expensing for equipment, property and research and development.

Regulation

From a regulatory standpoint, Harris is focused on prescription drugs, more affordable housing, a higher minimum wage, lower grocery costs and a supportive stance toward clean energy. She has also talked about accelerating Medicare negotiations on more drugs and cracking down on pharmacy benefit managers, creating more risk in health care.

Trump significantly dialed back regulation in his first term. Most of the former president's efforts on the deregulation front will likely be focused on labor, education, the environment and health care, with a slowdown in the transition to EVs. Energy production and fracking in particular should increase. A potential negative, at least from a labor market perspective, is more stringent immigration policies, which could hurt labor-intensive companies.

It's worth noting, however, that the expected election outcomes due to regulation are usually very different from what ends up occurring. The consensus thought energy would thrive under the Trump administration, yet it was one of the worst-performing sectors in his four years. Under Obama, health care was expected to be a tough sector, but it performed well on a relative basis. So, it's important not to read too much into higher regulation and what the impacts will be for these sectors.

Trade

Harris is expected to mostly maintain the status quo on trade policy from the Biden administration. Changes are expected to be more surgical compared to the broad brush approach Trump has discussed. Harris would likely remain firm on China to protect industries like solar and semiconductors.

From a Trump perspective, we expect a repeat of what we saw under his first term. He is proposing two types of tariffs: a 10% across the board tariff on all imported goods and increases on Chinese tariffs to 60%. According to a Tax Foundation analysis, a 10% tariff and retaliation from U.S. trading partners would be expected to contract the economy by 1%. From a trade perspective, equities would face more headwinds under Trump while a Harris win would continue the status quo.

Fiscal Spending

The most bipartisan view right now is that government spending will keep growing. Neither candidate wants to rein in spending. Deficits are forecast to be in the 6%-7% of GDP range for the foreseeable future and potentially even higher in a sweep scenario where more legislation gets passed. Harris would prioritize spending on health care, housing, childcare, clean energy and infrastructure.

Trump is expected to keep spending focused on defense and infrastructure. The fiscal thrust from a Republican administration will come in the form of tax cuts, while the Democrats will likely lead with more spending. We expect such policies to boost the economy in either scenario.

Impacts of a Trump Victory

In aggregate, we view a second Trump presidency under a sweep scenario as net positive for equities. The expectation is for a more favorable corporate tax regime and less of a regulatory burden, both of which should boost corporate profits. Conversely, there is the potential for increased tariffs and retaliation from U.S. trade partners. A gridlock scenario where the House is under Democratic control would be mildly negative as fewer provisions of expiring tax legislation would get extended.

We view U.S. stocks as best placed under Trump, with banks and capital markets, as well as the oil and gas complex, well positioned due to lighter regulation. Aerospace and defense is also likely going to benefit as well as biopharmaceuticals.

Impacts of a Harris Victory

We see a Harris win as mildly negative to equities should she preside over a divided Congress. It will be more of a headwind to the markets should we see a Democratic sweep as she will then be able to implement higher taxes on corporations and high-income individuals, as well as push a more ambitious regulatory agenda. However, tax credits for low-income individuals would provide an offset, creating an economic boost to this segment of the economy.

Tighter regulation could weigh on biopharmaceuticals, banks, capital markets, energy as well as mega cap technology. Areas to be bullish about under Harris would be consumer discretionary, specifically restaurants & leisure, home building and building products.

It's easy to categorize each candidate as bullish or bearish, but markets have gone up regardless of the party in control. In our view, economic momentum will be a bigger driver of equities over the medium to long term."

Forbes recently spoke with Austan Goolsbee, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago and an alternate member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which votes on the target federal funds rate. The Fed began hiking rates in March 2022, and then raised the federal funds rate from near-zero to over 5% -- the fastest interest rate increase in four decades.

Looking ahead to the second half of the decade, Goolsbee is keeping a close eye on growth in productivity, which he said would support an expanding economy without inflation.

Despite losses for its big tech peers, Nvidia's stock rallied Monday, leading it to eclipse Microsoft as the second-largest company in the world amid the AI boom. Nvidia registered its highest market cap since August at $3.19 trillion, trailing only Apple, valued at $3.4 trillion.

Influencers are touting egg donation as a cash cow to millions of followers on the internet. But while social media is helping to destigmatize fertility problems and procedures, some donor-conceived people and experts say the vast majority of content that lures donors with big payouts is doing more harm than good.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 suffered their worst days since early September following two new hurdles for investors that threaten to increase the cost of doing business and cut into profit margins. Crude oil prices and government bond yields, which influence borrowing costs as many loans are benchmarked against Treasury notes, both moved to multiweek highs Monday.

Andreessen Horowitz cofounder Ben Horowitz tweeted that he and his wife will make a ""significant"" donation to Vice President Kamala Harris, a notable reversal of his previous support for former President Donald Trump. Still, Horowitz said Harris' campaign has yet to formally state its intentions with their tech policies and that the ""Biden Administration has been exceptionally destructive on tech policy across the industry.""

Vice President Kamala Harris defended her economic plan in an interview with 60 Minutes on Monday, predicting Congress will go along with paying for her agenda, as the nominee has already called for an ""opportunity economy"" focused on the middle class and released plans that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis. Harris' economic plan would increase the federal deficit by $3.5 trillion through 2035, according to an estimate by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.

One of Donald Trump's prized properties, the landmark building 40 Wall Street, now appears underwater. The remaining 35 years on Trump's leasehold in the Financial District tower is worth about $116 million, which is $2 million less than the estimated $118 million Trump owes on his mortgage, according to a Forbes analysis.

The Supreme Court declined to take up a challenge brought by social network X on Monday, after the Elon Musk-owned company sued the federal government for forcing it to turn over information about former President Donald Trump to Special Counsel Jack Smith and his team. Prosecutors asked the company, formerly known as Twitter, to sign a non-disclosure agreement barring them from informing Trump or his associates about the warrant.

As Hurricane Milton, now a Category 4 storm, is slated to make landfall in Florida this week, major U.S. airlines are issuing travel waivers allowing passengers flying in or out of impacted airports to rebook without paying the fare difference. Even if you're not traveling through Florida this week, your flight may be impacted, so monitor your airline's app for flight notifications.

The Supreme Court's new term kicked off Monday, and the justices are slated to hear cases on major issues like guns, transgender rights, vaping and environmental impact studies. The nation's highest court is likely to add a number of other key cases to its docket, including former President Donald Trump's criminal cases and challenges to the Biden Administration's student loan forgiveness relief efforts.

TOPLINE Phoenix Capital Group, founded in 2019, says it's an oil and gas company, specializing in acquiring mineral rights and drilling independently. But its core competency seems to be raising funds from yield-hungry investors.

Mostly through advertising run on conservative radio shows like The Sean Hannity Show and webinars which it holds daily, founder Adam Ferrari reports that Phoenix has so far raised $700 million of a planned $750 million private high yield bond offering. Some 95% of its sales, says Matt Willer, head of Capital Markets, are to people above the age of 55, with half of the funds coming from 401(k)s and IRAs.

Phoenix is one of a growing number of little-known financial firms taking advantage of Congress's Jumpstart Our Business Startups (JOBS) Act, signed into law by President Barack Obama in 2012, which enabled companies to more easily sell unregistered securities, otherwise known as private placements, directly to individual investors.

From 2009 through 2020, $15 trillion of so-called Reg D offerings were sold, according to a 2023 study by SLCG Economic Consulting. During the same time period, fully SEC registered offerings, of stocks, bonds and ETFs trading on exchanges, tallied $16.4 trillion in sales.

As the ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) movement gained traction, many banks and large institutional investors began withdrawing from fossil fuels, citing environmental concerns. This opened a window for sellers of unregistered securities, especially those with enticing offerings like Phoenix and its oil bonds yielding as much as 13%.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The private placement market is booming, offering a fast track for companies to raise capital,"" says Forbes senior reporter Brandon Kochkodin. ""Phoenix Capital Group has tapped into this trend, drawing mom-and-pop investors to its debt with promises of high yields and the opportunity to create 'generational wealth.' Yet, a recent deal between Phoenix and Fortress Investment Group, a Wall Street behemoth, suggests that smaller investors might not be getting paid enough interest for the risk they're taking.""

Elon Musk announced his pro-Trump America PAC will pay for each successful referral of a registered swing state voter who signs a petition ""to show support for free speech and the right to bear arms"":

$23.5 million: The amount the PAC would pay out if 500,000 signatures came from successful referrals

A lack of response, or ""ghosting,"" can be frustrating in the workplace, especially when it comes from your boss. First, assess whether their absence is out of character, and if so, give them leeway. Ensure your communication is concise and prioritized, establish regular check-ins and keep a detailed record of your communication attempts. If the behavior becomes a chronic issue, consider seeking advice on potential solutions from a mentor or senior leader.

During Sunday night's preseason NBA game between the L.A. Lakers and the Phoenix Suns, LeBron James found himself in a situation that left him wondering, ""'Is this The Matrix or something?' It just didn't feel real,"" he told ESPN. What happened during the game?

A. James sustained a concussion

B. He scored zero points for the first time in his career

Cybersecurity Risks: When AI Becomes A Tool For Evil,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/emilsayegh/2024/10/08/cybersecurity-risks-when-ai-becomes-a-tool-for-evil/,2024-10-08T11:22:05Z,"October marks Cybersecurity Awareness Month, a perfect moment to explore one of the most pressing challenges facing our digital world today: artificial intelligence being used as a weapon. The staggering power of AI and Large Language Models like GPT-4 has the potential to transform industries. But as with any powerful tool, it can be misused, and in the wrong hands, AI can become a cybercriminal's greatest asset. From deepfakes to phishing attacks and election interference, malicious actors are leveraging AI to wreak havoc on organizations and individuals alike.

This is the new frontier of cybersecurity -- an arms race where we're not just battling hackers, but also battling AI-powered machines that can think, adapt, and innovate faster than ever before.

Let's not mince words: AI is being weaponized. While the world marvels at how AI can write essays, code, and even compose music, hackers are using these very capabilities for far more sinister purposes. Election tampering, phishing schemes, and sophisticated man-in-the-middle attacks are just the beginning of how AI is being misused.

One of the most frightening examples is the rise of deepfakes -- hyper-realistic video and audio forgeries that can make it look and sound like anyone is saying anything. Deepfakes have already been weaponized to discredit political figures and spread disinformation. Recently, deepfakes of former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris went viral, spreading false messages that could have had real-world consequences. These AI-generated fabrications are blurring the line between reality and fiction, undermining trust and destabilizing our information ecosystem.

But it's not just deepfakes. AI is also being used to generate convincing phishing schemes. Remember when phishing emails used to be easy to spot with their broken English and suspicious links? That's no longer the case. With LLMs, hackers can create phishing emails so sophisticated they look like they were penned by your CEO. One notable case involved an LLM-generated email that impersonated a company's C-suite, successfully convincing an employee to transfer millions to a fraudulent account. By the time the scam was uncovered, the money had vanished, and the company was left reeling from the financial and reputational blow.

Perhaps even more concerning is how AI is being used to automate and scale attacks. AI tools can scan codebases and infrastructure setups at lightning speed, identifying vulnerabilities faster than any human ever could. In ransomware attacks, for instance, AI-driven automation allows hackers to deploy encryption faster than traditional security teams can react. This speed makes it nearly impossible to prevent the damage once an attack is in motion, leaving businesses locked out of their systems with no choice but to pay up or face the consequences.

It's easy to feel like we're losing the battle, but the good news is that AI is also our greatest defense. Just as hackers are using AI to attack, we can use it to help us defend against AI generated threats.

The most advanced AI-enhanced threat detection systems are learning to identify threats in real-time. These tools can process vast amounts of data in seconds, identifying patterns and anomalies that signal an impending attack. Unlike traditional security measures that rely on predefined rules, AI-powered systems learn and adapt, making them far more effective at catching new, never-before-seen threats.

AI-powered cybersecurity systems and automated monitoring agents are increasingly leveraging machine learning to detect subtle shifts in network behavior, flagging suspicious activity before it escalates into a full-blown attack. In a world where split-second delays can lead to devastating consequences, these AI-driven systems provide the speed necessary to respond swiftly and effectively, preventing hackers from inflicting serious damage.

Another powerful defensive use of AI is in endpoint protection, where AI analyzes device behavior rather than relying solely on predefined attack signatures. This approach enables AI to identify brand-new, previously unseen attacks based on abnormal patterns of behavior, stopping threats before they can do harm. These tools are particularly critical for defending against zero-day exploits, which target vulnerabilities that have yet to be discovered by traditional security systems.

AI is not going away. In fact, its influence will only grow. As cybersecurity professionals, we must accept that AI is here to stay -- and so too are the evolving threats. But there's a silver lining: By leveraging AI for defense, we can stay ahead of the hackers who use it for harm. However, success will not come from AI alone. It requires the collaboration of trained cybersecurity professionals working in tandem with AI. Human expertise combined with AI's speed and precision forms a powerful defense capable of adapting to new, sophisticated attacks. The key is constant vigilance, innovation, and an unwavering commitment to ethical standards.

This October, as we celebrate Cybersecurity Awareness Month, let's remind ourselves of the stakes. Cybersecurity has always been a battle of minds, but now it's also a battle of machines. As long as AI continues to evolve, the arms race will only intensify. Our challenge is to stay one step ahead -- combining the power of AI with human expertise -- before AI becomes a tool for evil."
Harris To Propose New Medicare Benefit To Cover Home Care Costs For Seniors,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2024/10/08/harris-to-propose-new-medicare-benefit-to-cover-home-care-costs-for-seniors/,2024-10-08T10:28:09Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris will outline a new Medicare benefit proposal Tuesday aiming to help families caring for seniors at home, in what is the Democratic candidate's latest policy pitch targeted at middle-aged voters who have to grapple with the costs of caring for both their children and elderly parents.

This is a developing story.

Harris' appearance on ""The View"" is part of a big media blitz by the Vice President this week. The morning show appearance will be followed by interviews on The Howard Stern Show and The Late Show with Stephen Colbert later on Tuesday. On Wednesday, Harris is set to take part in a town hall in Las Vegas hosted by Univision. Earlier this week CBS' 60 Minutes aired an interview with the vice president and she also appeared on the ""Call Her Daddy"" over the weekend."
What To Know About Kamala Harris' Economic Agenda As She Claims Congress Will Pay For It,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/07/what-to-know-about-kamala-harris-economic-agenda-as-she-claims-congress-will-pay-for-it/,2024-10-08T01:20:44Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris defended her economic plan in an interview with ""60 Minutes"" on Monday, predicting Congress will go along with paying for her agenda, as the nominee has already called for an ""opportunity economy"" focused on the middle class and released plans that include lowering grocery and prescription drug prices and addressing the housing crisis.

Harris was asked about how she'd pay for her economic plan in her ""60 Minutes"" interview on Monday, with correspondent Bill Whitaker noting that while she wants to make the richest Americans pay more taxes, ""We're dealing with the real world here."" Harris expressed optimism that Congress will be willing to pass her economic agenda, arguing, ""When you talk quietly with a lot of folks in Congress, they know exactly what I'm talking about, 'cause their constituents know exactly what I'm talking about."" The vice president disagreed with Whitaker saying Congress ""has shown no inclination"" to back her economic plans, saying she knows ""the limitations of government"" and claiming, ""There are plenty of leaders in Congress who understand and know that the Trump tax cuts blew up our federal deficit.""

$3.5 trillion. That's how much Harris' economic plan would increase the federal deficit by through 2035, according to an estimate released Monday by the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget -- still far smaller than the $7.5 trillion Trump's plan would cost. The organization noted its estimate is subject to a ""wide range of uncertainty,"" and actual figures could range anywhere from not having any impact on the deficit to costing $8.1 trillion at most.

""I am a capitalist. I believe in free and fair markets,"" Harris declared at a September event hosted by the Economic Club of Pittsburgh, pushing back against her opponent Trump's attacks classifying Harris as a ""communist.""

Harris told CNN host Dana Bash in an August interview that her priority on ""Day One"" as president would be to start implementing her economic agenda. The vice president said one of her ""highest priorities is to do what we can to support and strengthen the middle class,"" arguing that while she believes the Biden administration has done ""good work"" on the economy, ""there's more to do.""

Harris' economic policy agenda is largely in line with Biden's economic platform, with some tweaks to emphasize causes that are more important to her, like the child tax credit. ""Same values, different vision,"" a Harris aide told The Guardian. ""She's not moving far away from him on substance, she will highlight the ones that matter most to her."" The initial plans from Harris' campaign also suggest the vice president plans to be more aggressive in her policy approaches than Biden, however, as polls have suggested voters hold dim views of how the president has handled the economy. While Biden has also opposed price gouging, Harris' proposal to enable the FTC and U.S. attorneys to go after companies that hike up prices goes beyond what the president has proposed, Politico notes, and her proposed $40 million investment in the housing crisis is double the amount the Biden administration spent.

Harris' economic agenda so far hasn't gone fully in depth about her proposals, which The New York Times reports is by design. The Times reported before Harris unveiled her agenda that the Harris campaign has adopted a ""strategic vagueness"" for her economic proposals, believing that being more of a ""blank slate"" will help ward off attacks and attract more support from business groups.

Trump's economic agenda is largely focused on raising tariffs on imported goods, which Harris has said she opposes. The ex-president has also called for cutting taxes and regulations in hopes of lowering inflation, including lowering the corporate tax rate, and has encouraged increasing oil production in order to lower energy prices. In addition to his ""no tax on tips"" proposal that Harris has also endorsed, Trump has called for ending taxes on Social Security benefits, which Harris has not yet responded to. Experts believe the ex-president's proposal could speed up Social Security and Medicare becoming insolvent, with the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget projecting exempting taxes on benefits would result in Social Security and Medicare receiving $1.6 trillion less in revenue between 2026 and 2035. The Trump campaign opposed reports of Harris' economic proposals in September, with spokesperson Steven Cheung saying in a statement, ""Kamala Harris can't hide from her disastrous record of skyrocketing inflation ... Americans are struggling under the Biden-Harris economy, and now she wants to gaslight them into believing her bald-faced lies.""

41%. That's the share of voters who trust Harris more to handle the economy, according to an Associated Press/NORC poll conducted Sept. 12-16, versus 43% who trust Trump more. While Trump still maintains a narrow lead, recent polling has broadly shown voters are warming up to Harris on the economy, with polls on who voters prefer on the issue going from being strongly in Trump's favor to more of a toss up. A Washington Post analysis of five recent polls found that while Trump still leads on the economy by an average of six points, that's narrowed from a 12-point lead that the ex-president held against Biden before the president dropped out of the race.

Harris became the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee in July after Biden stepped down suddenly from the presidential race, following weeks of pressure over mounting concerns about his mental fitness. While the vice president has quickly garnered Democrats' support and risen in the polls, Harris released few concrete policy proposals in the first few weeks of her campaign -- drawing some criticism as a result. The vice president has made releasing a platform on economic proposals her first priority, delivering a speech earlier in August laying out her economic platform that marked the most substantive remarks she had given on policy so far. Her focus on the economy comes as polling has repeatedly shown it's the most important issue to voters in this election cycle, with the vice president hoping to attract support amid low approval ratings for Biden's handling of the economy. Harris' August 16 speech also came days after news that inflation fell in July to its lowest point in more than three years, with federal data showing inflation at 2.9% in July, the first time it's been below 3% since March 2021."

Harris supports enacting gun control restrictions including universal background checks, banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines and implementing ""red flag"" laws that take guns away from people who are a danger to themselves or others. The candidate's website also notes she would invest in law enforcement to help combat gun violence and expand existing gun violence prevention programs.

Harris' ""60 Minutes"" interview came as the vice president has faced criticism from the media and Trump campaign for not doing more major interviews since becoming the Democratic nominee. Harris has sat down for an increasing number of outlets and podcasters as the election nears, however, speaking with CNN, local media and the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast among others. Polls continue to show the two candidates are neck-and-neck even as the Harris campaign has garnered a commanding lead in its fundraising, and Harris was asked about her policy positions Monday as the candidate has faced criticism for not being specific enough about her platform.

""60 Minutes"" told viewers it also invited Trump to sit down for an interview, but the ex-president backed out after initially agreeing to participate. The Trump campaign gave ""shifting reasons"" for canceling, correspondent Scott Pelley told viewers Monday, including objecting to the program's fact checking and demanding an apology for Trump's ""60 Minutes"" interview in 2020. Harris responded to Trump's cancellation in her interview with the program, saying, ""If he is not gonna give your viewers the ability to have a meaningful, thoughtful conversation, question and answer with you, then watch his rallies."" ""You're gonna hear conversations that are about himself and all of his personal grievances,"" Harris said, arguing that voters won't hear ""anything about you."""
Could Republican Ties To X Impact Voters? Here's What Experts Say As Trump Outspends Harris On The Site.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/10/07/could-republican-ties-to-x-impact-voters-heres-what-experts-say-as-trump-outspends-harris-on-the-site/,2024-10-07T21:40:26Z,"Elon Musk's X has become a major outlet for Republican campaigning as the party targets the site with ads, reportedly spending double that of Democrats on the platform amid Musk's endorsement of former president Donald Trump, which experts say won't swing undecided voters but is a strong way to boost campaigns from party members directly.

Democrats have outspent Republicans on digital ads by millions, and they have been outspending since early August, according to data analytics platform AdImpact, as reported by the Post. Democrats have focused spending on tech platforms like YouTube, Facebook and Instagram, according to the Post. Vice President Kamala Harris has not bought an ad on X, and Nu Wexler, a political strategist, told the Washington Post that Democrats don't view it as their audience.

Donald Trump -- the biggest buyer of political ads on X, according to the Washington Post -- has fueled an alliance with Musk in recent months. The billionaire Tesla founder publicly endorsed Trump in July after an assassination attempt at a rally in Pennsylvania. Musk has posted in support of the Republican candidate several times since and said he is committing tens of millions monthly to a pro-Trump super PAC. As Musk imprints his politics on the site, the uptick in Republican ad spending also represents a big shift in the platform from 2019 when it banned political ads and sought to retain nonpartisan governance, Kreiss said. In August, Musk hosted Trump on the platform to discuss political topics. Trump has said he plans to ""create a government efficiency commission tasked with conducting a complete financial and performance audit of the entire federal government,"" mentioning that Musk has agreed to potentially lead the program. Musk sealed his July endorsement on Saturday by attending a rally in Pennsylvania -- his first time at a campaign event.

On Monday, Musk said his America PAC, the pro-Trump group he primarily funds, will pay $47 for each time someone refers a registered swing state voter to sign a petition to ""support for free speech and the right to bear arms"" in his latest attempt to boost support for Trump. The petition has a goal of 1 million signatures."
Kamala Harris' 'Call Her Daddy' Appearance Divides Podcast Host Alex Cooper's Listeners,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/07/kamala-harris-call-her-daddy-appearance-divides-podcast-host-alex-coopers-listeners/,2024-10-07T19:54:16Z,"Podcast host Alex Cooper interviewed Vice President Kamala Harris on her popular ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, Spotify's second-biggest podcast which has a large audience of women listeners, drawing criticism from some of Cooper's conservative-leaning listeners.

""Call Her Daddy"" has ranked as Spotify's second-biggest podcast, only behind Joe Rogan's ""Joe Rogan Experience,"" for the past two years. Spotify also says it is the biggest podcast for women on its platform. ""Call Her Daddy"" ranked as the fourth-biggest podcast across all platforms for the second quarter of 2024, according to Edison Research, behind Rogan, ""Crime Junkie"" and The New York Times' ""The Daily."" Cooper also has a significant social media following, with 2.4 million followers on her ""Call Her Daddy"" Instagram account and 3.9 million followers on the podcast's TikTok. Cooper regularly hosts high-profile celebrity guests on her podcast, including Simone Biles, Post Malone and Katy Perry. Cooper has also raised her podcast's profile through media appearances, including a stint as a host at the Paris Olympic Games this summer for NBC. Her podcast has been highly sought after by streaming services: SiriusXM spent $100 million on the rights to her podcast in August, three years after Spotify paid $60 million for exclusive rights.

Though it's unclear how much of Cooper's listening base is made up of conservatives, Cooper said she has a ""very mixed audience when it comes to politics"" prior to her Harris interview, acknowledging she seldom talks about politics to make her podcast a welcome space for all listeners. Cooper, however, has previously spoken out in favor of abortion rights. In one ""Call Her Daddy"" episode released in October 2022, Cooper spoke with women who had to travel from states with restrictive abortion laws to other states to receive care, which she said was to highlight the impact of anti-abortion legislation on women. She also criticized the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Cooper's podcast also exploded in popularity after it was acquired in 2018 by Barstool Sports, the media company founded by Dave Portnoy known for its conservative-leaning audience that Politico called ""Barstool Republicans.""

Cooper released her interview with Harris on Sunday, in which she largely asked the vice president questions about women's issues, including reproductive rights. Harris slammed state laws she called ""Trump abortion bans"" and dismissed Trump's claim that he would be a ""protector"" for women as president. She also addressed comments made by Arkansas Gov. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, a Republican, last month in which she said Harris does not have biological children to keep her ""humble."" Harris said she feels ""sorry"" for Sanders, stating many women are ""not aspiring to be humble"" and ""have a lot of love in their life, family in their life and children in their life"" who lift them up.

""I couldn't see a world in which one of the main conversations in this election is women, and I'm not a part of it,"" Cooper said, defending her decision to interview Harris despite her politically mixed audience, as well as her choice to center their conversation around women's issues.

Cooper ranked No. 12 on Forbes' list of the top-earning creators of 2023, with estimated earnings of $20 million. She was also included on Forbes' 30 Under 30 list in 2022.

Harris' ""Call Her Daddy"" interview was one of several media appearances she has scheduled for this week. Also this week, Harris will appear on ""The View,"" ""60 Minutes,"" ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert"" and Howard Stern's radio show.

Trump's Tariffs Can't Pay For His Many Promises,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2024/10/07/trumps-tariffs-cant-pay-for-his-many-promises/,2024-10-07T19:54:13Z,"GOP presidential candidate Donald Trump's tariffs would raise a lot of money -- $2.8 trillion over 10 years, according to the Tax Policy Center. But even that would fall far short of paying for all the ambitious ideas he claims it would fund. Indeed, his campaign promises likely would add trillions of dollars to the federal debt.

At various times in the 2024 presidential campaign, Trump has said his tariff revenues would replace the income tax, finance an unspecified child care initiative, create a US sovereign wealth fund, eliminate the federal budget deficit, and even begin to pay down the $28 trillion public debt.

Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris has her own list of costly promises that appear to be only partially offset by proposed tax hikes. But Trump's tariff revenue would fall far short of paying for all his promises, though it is impossible to know since they mostly are unspecified.

And Trump would inevitably be caught in the same fiscal trap that so many other policymakers have faced: Once you use revenues to pay for new programs or tax cuts, those funds are no longer available to reduce deficits. More often than not, the result is even higher deficits and debt.

Indeed, The Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget estimates that Trump's campaign proposals would increase the federal debt by $7.5 trillion over the next decade.

How Much Would Tariffs Raise?

While the former president has pitched many different tariff plans over the course of the campaign, TPC analyzed one version he promotes often, a 10 percent tax on all goods imported into the US and a 60 percent levy on Chinese imports. It would raise about $3.7 trillion in gross tariff revenues over the next decade.

But the tariffs would increase net federal revenues by much less -- about $2.8 trillion. That's because they'd significantly raise prices of imported goods, which would mostly be passed on to consumers. The Federal Reserve could raise interest rates to offset those price increases. But that likely would reduce profits of US corporations and incomes of US workers, lower projected corporate and individual tax revenues, and offset nearly $1 trillion of increased tariff revenue.

How would Trump spend the added revenue?

Could tariffs replace the income tax? Not even close. They'd replace only about 8 percent of the $34 trillion in federal individual income tax revenue the Congressional Budget Office expects the Treasury to collect over the next decade. They'd even fall short of paying the $4 trillion cost of extending the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act.

Could they fund other tax cuts?. Trump has promised many other tax cuts, including exemptions for tip income, overtime pay, and Social Security benefits, repealing the cap on the state and local tax (SALT) deduction, and reducing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent for some companies and 15 percent for others. All of those ideas would cost at least an additional $4 trillion, $1.2 trillion more than the income his tariffs would generate.

Could tariffs pay down the national debt? The public debt currently is about $28 trillion and CBO expects it to rise to $50 trillion by 2034. CBO projects the 2025 deficit will approach $2 trillion. By themselves, Trump's tariffs would lower this year's deficit by about $200 billion, or roughly 10 percent. They'd barely make a dent in the projected debt.

How about financing a sovereign wealth fund? Trump has provided no details on his idea to create a US government investment fund, but has promised it would be the biggest in the world. Currently, that honor belongs to Saudi Arabia, with a fund it values at about $925 billion. Trump could create a comparable US investment fund with about one-third of his tariff revenue. But that would leave less than $2 trillion for all his other initiatives.

Could tariffs fund child care? Trump has not specified what child-related programs he supports. But his running mate, Sen. JD Vance (R-OH) has endorsed a $5,000 Child Tax Credit (CTC) for all parents, regardless of income, which could pay for services such as child care. While Trump has not publicly commented on the plan, it is at least a hint of what his administration could do.

A Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget calculator estimates a Vance-like credit would cost roughly $2.7 trillion over a decade, almost exactly what Trump's tariffs would raise. But that would leave almost nothing for his other initiatives.

Of course, Trump could try to raise more money with even higher tariff rates. But at some point, tariff-driven price increases will shrink demand for imports so much that tariff revenues would no longer offset the decline in corporate and individual income taxes caused by a slowing US economy.

Trump's use of tariff revenue to finance his many ambitious promises feels a bit like the stage magician who appears to be pulling countless rabbits out of a top hat. He's not the first politician to try that trick. But never forget, it is all an illusion."
Trump Suggests Migrants Commit Murders Because They Have 'Bad Genes',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/07/trump-suggests-migrants-commit-murders-because-they-have-bad-genes/,2024-10-07T18:53:18Z,"Former President Donald Trump suggested migrants coming to the U.S. border have ""bad genes"" on Monday while accusing Vice President Kamala Harris of ""allowing people to come to an open border,"" including ""murderers.""

Recent studies contradict claims that migrants in the U.S. illegally are committing crimes at higher rates than people living in the country legally. A 2023 Stanford University study found immigrants were 60% less likely than U.S.-born men to be incarcerated. The Cato Institute has also published several studies that show migrants in Texas who are in the country illegally have lower incarceration and lower homicide conviction rates than U.S. citizens.

Trump has ramped up his anti-immigration rhetoric and proposals during his most recent campaign, promising mass deportations of undocumented migrants if elected. In recent weeks, he has repeated the baseless claim that Haitian migrants in Springfield, Ohio, are abducting and eating residents' pets despite city officials saying there are no verifiable reports of such incidents. He's also referred to the Biden-Harris immigration policies as a ""border bloodbath,"" while repeating a false claim he's made for years that other countries are sending ""prisoners, murderers, drug dealers, mental patients and terrorists"" to the U.S., he said in April. Trump has also falsely referred to Harris as the ""border czar,"" a mischaracterization of the role Biden appointed her to in March 2021 to work with Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to address root causes of migration to the U.S.

or years, the clearest impacts of a warming climate across the U.S. were seen in bigger and more frequent western wildfires, droughts and heatwaves in the Southwest, coastal erosion and increasingly powerful hurricanes hammering Florida's low-lying coastline. But the monster storm generated by Hurricane Helen that dumped more than 40 trillion gallons of rain across the Southeast, killed hundreds, destroyed roads and infrastructure and left millions without power has dramatically reframed things.

The destruction caused by the worst U.S. storm since Hurricane Katrina was notable not simply for the scale but where it was concentrated: communities like Asheville and surrounding towns in North Carolina that are far inland, at a higher elevation, are more temperate and generally perceived as less prone to extreme weather events. Just as Canada's vast and brutal wildfires demonstrated in 2023, the effects of hotter, drier weather and intense, stronger and wetter hurricanes fueled by warming oceans that take longer to dissipate over land mean that no region is safe from a changing climate.

In the current presidential election, there's been far too little discussion about the climate crisis and need for the U.S. to accelerate the transition to zero-carbon energy, with Democratic candidate Kamala Harris offering no new plans to build on or expand the work done by President Biden through the Inflation Reduction Act and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Meanwhile, Republican nominee Donald Trump talks mainly about boosting production of carbon-spewing oil and gas and suggesting rising sea levels are good because they create more ocean-front property (seemingly unaware his beloved Mar-a-Lago sits in a flood zone on Florida's porous bedrock).

Whether it's Asheville or Palm Beach, there are no climate havens.

Microsoft's recent announcement that it has inked a 20-year deal to buy power from a retired nuclear reactor at the notorious Three Mile Island site graphically illustrates a seismic shift in political attitudes toward nuclear power. Three Mile Island, of course, is where a nuclear reactor experienced a partial meltdown in 1979. There were no injuries and no permanent damage.

Nonetheless, the accident freaked out the public, and the construction of new nuclear power facilities became politically radioactive. Attitudes are changing, in no small part because high tech -- once a font of antinuclear sentiment -- is a power hog and needs all the juice it can get. However, this segment of What's Ahead cautions that the realities of suffocating regulation and the time it takes to construct such facilities mean that no rapid energy rescue is in the offing.

What's your view of the conjunction between AI and climate and its benefits and risks?

I'm a lot more worried about natural stupidity than artificial intelligence because there's way too much of that going on right now. This is a double-edged sword because AI in many ways will help the clean energy revolution. It's going to help us decide what's the most effective silicon anode battery. It's going to help develop fusion. And by the way, I'm bragging about my state: we have three of the leading fusion companies in the United States within 10 miles of each other near Seattle, Washington.

AI can really help in the development of these things. To stop the development of a system that can help you develop clean energy technologies is probably not a really good idea.

But if you look at the [energy] numbers, they are massive. They are absolutely massive. One major company in our state had a reduction of about 30% of their goals just because of the AI requirements. We're facing this big time because I'm having trouble siting facilities for wind, storage and solar just to feed the AI centers.

It's not hard to site an AI center. Nobody objects to them. It's a black box. There's hardly anybody in the parking lot. They just sit there. But people do object to some of these other technologies. So we've got to find a way to cite these, the clean energy projects, in my book.

We're not going to stop the use of technology in my view.

What Presidential Candidates Can Teach Business Leaders About Branding,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/edwardsegal/2024/10/06/what-presidential-candidates-can-teach-business-leaders-about-branding/,2024-10-06T15:09:33Z,"The strategies, tactics, and techniques that presidential candidates use to whip up and sustain energy, enthusiasm and support among voters can be employed by business leaders to successfully brand themselves and their companies.

Corporate executives can learn several lessons about effective branding by paying close attention to what the men and women who run for the White House say -- and how and why they say it.

Unless people can understand what you are saying and why, nothing else matters.

""One significant lesson is the importance of a clear message. Barack Obama's 2008 campaign with its crisp slogan 'Yes, we can!' is a powerful example. It encapsulates his mission and passion, much like companies need to crisply communicate their mission, vision, and values to resonate with their target audience,"" Greta Maiocchi, the head of marketing and recruitment at the Open Institute of Technology, said in an email interview.

""Clarity is the ultimate example of things CEOs and brands can learn from presidential candidates that follow that rule. Who remembers Donald Trump's slogan from 2016? Yup, you know the one -- and it's still being used by his campaigntoday. What about Hillary [Clinton's ] from back then? No idea. I am sure she had plenty of important things to say, but it wasn't clear enough for any of us to remember,"" Jo Caruna, founder and CEO of Finesse group, observed via email.

Make it as easy as possible for consumers to remember your messaging.

""The right marketing will be so simple that your clients can repeat it back to you -- rather than you having to constantly repeat it to them. Today Kamala Harris' is 'We're not going back' -- clear, easy to remember/repeat, and exactly what her target voter wants to hear,"" Caruna pointed out.

Coming across as fake and insincere can sink any branding campaign.

""Authenticity matters. Voters can see through manufactured personalities and disingenuous promises. Companies should build transparent brands that match their true values and mission,"" branding and expert Haiko de Poel noted out via email.

To ensure success, branding efforts need to stay current and in sync with those they are trying to reach.

""Politicans' methodsof staying relevant to their voters parallellshow brands must constantly evolve to stay relevant to their consumers. Politicians often adapt their strategies based on audience feedback and show agility and responsiveness, reinforcing the importance of being attuned to customers' evolving needs -- a lesson every brand should adopt,"" according to Maiocchi.

""As an example, take Elizabeth Warren's 2020 campaign which did [extensive testing] of slogans and messages to see what resonated with voters. This reflects an approach commonly used by brands and marketers to refine their messaging,"" she observed.

Telling stories will help to hold the attention of consumers, and avoid the risk of boring them.

""Politicians are masters of storytelling. They share powerful stories and testimonials to create an emotional connection with voters. Companies should do the same by highlighting customer success stories and sharing authentic experiences,"" according to branding expert Haiko de Poel

The more you know about your audience, the more likely it is that your messages will resonate with them.

""Deeply understanding your target audience is the cornerstone of branding. Trump has a laid-back, informal campaigning style, which resonates with his voters,"" Emily Williams, a content strategist and CEO of Web Copy Collective, pointed out via email.

By contrast, Vice President Kamala Harris ""has a disciplined, structured approach to campaigning, which connects more to her demographic. Policies aside, each does a great job of staying on brand and using that on their campaign,"" she noted.

""The most successful campaigns don't just broadcast a marketing message -- they create a movement that people feel compelled to join. For example, the Harris campaign has inspired voters to build their own diverse coalitions, like Win With Black Men, Beyhive for Kamala, Military Families for Kamala, Swifties for Harris, Republicans for Harris, and even White Dudes for Harris,"" Lakesha Cole, principal publicist at she PR, observed via email.

""These grassroots groups bring together people from different backgrounds, united by their shared belief in the candidate's vision and values. From a marketing perspective, these voter-led coalitions show the power of community-driven marketing,"" she said.

Build an identity that ""resonates so deeply with various audiences that they become advocates and feel personally invested in the brand's success,"" Cole advised.

""It's about turning customers into fans who will spread your message because they believe it represents them. The Harris campaign has shown that by embracing the unique identities and passions of these groups, you not only strengthen your core base but also expand your reach and impact. That's a powerful lesson for any CEO looking to build a brand that truly connects,"" she concluded.

The ability to quantify the impact and success of your branding campaigns is critical.

""Data-driven decisions are key. Politicians constantly analyze polls and metrics to optimize their messaging. Companies must analyze metrics like customer satisfaction, retention, and lifetime value to make strategic branding choices,"" Haiko de Poel suggested.

""An essential lesson comes from Barack Obama's campaign of 'Hope and Change.' He reinforced this message at every opportunity, silently affirming it through his demeanor, speeches, and the cultural zeitgeist he embodied. Corporations can learn the importance of consistency -- every touchpoint a customer has with your brand should uphold the key messaging and brand ethos,""Sarah Mitchell, marketing director for Relyir, said via email

Make sure that your branding efforts are in sync with what people know about the products or services you are marketing to them.

'""Politicians embody their branding -- every action and every statement aligns with their brand image. You can't dispute the fact that Donald Trump's 'Make America Great Again' and his bold, direct approach fed seamlessly into each other. Corporate leaders should similarly live their brand, fostering an authentic connection with consumers. "" according to Mitchell.

Don't zig and zag.

""Candidates who succeed do so by consistently communicating their values and vision across every platform, whether it's social media, TV, or live events. This is exactly what strong brands do -- they maintain a clear, unified message that resonates with their audience,"" Nikkia Adolphe, founding partner and head of media strategy at Tenet Consultancy, counseled via an email interview.

""A recent example is how President Biden's campaign consistently used the themes of 'restoration' and 'unity' to differentiate him from opponents, which created a strong emotional connection with voters,"" she concluded."
Sense And Nonsense About Taxes,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johngoodman/2024/10/05/sense-and-nonsense-about-taxes/,2024-10-06T01:51:36Z,"As we draw closer to the November elections, there is an inordinate amount of attention being paid to ""disinformation,"" and a great deal of fact-checking of candidates' statements.

Yet here are four surprising facts: (1) the subject on which there is the most disinformation is ""taxes""; (2) almost all the disinformation comes from the left; (3) it is spread to the general public by the mainstream media; and (4) it is almost never fact-checked.

Most of the benefits of the 2017 (Trump) tax cuts went to the rich.

The tax code today is just as progressive (if not more so) than it was before the tax cuts went into effect.

Surprisingly, both these statements are true. The first statement is true but misleading. The second statement is simply true.

What is rarely said in policy debates is that for the most part, half the population isn't paying income taxes at all. Specifically, the top one-half of taxpayers are paying 97.9% of all income taxes, while the bottom half pays a paltry 2.3%. So, it's hard to think of a tax cut that wouldn't confer most of the benefits on the top half of the income distribution.

Progressivity is a different matter. Suppose we cut everyone's taxes by 1%. For a millionaire, that would be $10,000. For a $30,000-a-year worker, that would be $300. That's a big difference in raw numbers. But from an equality standpoint, everyone's share of the country's after-tax income would be the same both before and after the tax cut.

If we define the rich broadly (to refer to the upper half), their share is already approaching 100% and that is as high as it can go. But even if we are talking about the really rich, their share is quite high.

The top 1% (people who earned more than $682,577 in 2021) paid 45% of all income taxes collected that year. The top 10% (earning more than $169,800) paid three-fourths of all income taxes.

This reflects the fact that the United States has the most progressive tax system in the world. We tax the rich proportionally more than any other country.

Why is our income tax system so progressive?

Although they don't like to talk about it, Republicans are the main reason. Going all the way back to Ronald Reagan, every Republican tax bill threw more and more people off the income tax rolls. Through this and other provisions, Republicans have been shifting the tax burden to the rich every time they have legislated on taxes.

Both private and government analyses confirm that the same is true of the 2017 tax reform law. In 2018, the top 20 percent of the income distribution faced a lower tax rate, but they paid a larger share of the total tax burden than the year before.

Had Democratic opponents had their way, the share of the tax burden would actually be lower for the rich and higher for low- and moderate-income families than it is today.

What about corporate taxes?

Although corporations send checks to the U.S. Treasury, economists do not regard corporate entities as bearing the real burden of taxation. That burden is borne by people in their role as shareholders, workers, customers, etc.

The Tax Policy Center (TPC) estimates that 20% of the corporate income tax is paid by labor in the form of lower wages and 80% is paid by capital (lower dividends and interest payments, for example). For certain types of tax changes, the TPC assumes a 50/50 split. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) assumes that 25% is paid by labor, and it is the official score keeper for Congress.

When Joe Biden and Kamala Harris say that raising the corporate income tax rate from 21 percent to 28 percent will not result in a tax on anyone earning less than $400,000, almost no economist will agree with that assertion. If members of Congress vote for the measure, they will be instructed by the CBO that they are voting to take one out of every four dollars of increased government revenue out of the pockets of ordinary American workers.

Also, remember that workers are also shareholders through their pension plans, 401(k) plans and IRA accounts. So, to the extent that corporate taxes fall on capital, workers bear part of that burden as well.

The most sophisticated model of international capital flows and corporate taxes ever developed has been produced by Boston University economist Laurence Kotlikoff and his colleagues. Their finding: the burden of corporate taxation is almost entirely shifted to labor. If Kotlikoff and his colleagues are right, then almost all of the Biden/Harris proposed increase in corporate taxes will come out of the pockets of people who make less than $400,000 a year.

Taxing capital gains

Last time I checked, the stock price of Microsoft was $416. That's what investors have to pay for the right to share in the company's earnings indefinitely into the future, as long as they hold the stock. The world ""future"" is key. If a sell my share after a rise in price, I will have a capital gain. But that gain does not reflect any increase in income to Microsoft. It merely reflects a change in the market's expectations.

Eventually the future will arrive, Microsoft will experience real earnings, and investors will pay taxes on those earnings. That's why we don't need a capital gains tax on the trading of Microsoft stock. Eventually, all of Microsoft earnings will be taxed by regular income taxes.

It is noteworthy that capital gains are not included in the calculation of GDP. They are nowhere to be found in our national income accounts. Ditto for capital losses.

If there were a logical reason to tax capital gains, there would be an equally compelling reason to allow the full deduction of capital losses. But were that allowed, the government would probably get no net income in the process. By way of analogy, the only reason the government collects any money by taxing the winnings of gamblers is because it doesn't allow them a full deduction for their losses.

Taxing unrealized capital gains is even harder to justify. It would be like taxing the gambler -- not at the end an evening of gaming, but after each time a roll of the dice produces a win, while ignoring each time there is a loss.

What is wrong with taxing investment to pay for consumption?

Take the progressive $5 trillion plan for cradle-to-the-grave benefits, including child care, elder care and everything in between. Like the idea of taxing unrealized capital gains, almost all progressive ideas for new revenue involve confiscating funds that are now in the capital market and using those funds to pay for current consumption.

But less investment means slower economic growth. And that means our children and grandchildren will have a lower standard of living. And since economic growth is the greatest anti-poverty program ever discovered, slower growth means more people will continue to live in poverty for a longer period of time.

That's why many economists - on the right and the left - advocate a progressive consumption tax, with no tax on saving and investment. That would be a fairer tax. It would tax the rich for what they take out of the economy by consuming, but not tax them on what they contribute to the economy by saving and investing."

Horowitz, who said in his email Harris was a friend to his venture capital firm in its early days, planned to support Trump just three months ago, when The Information reported he and Andreessen told employees they were going to donate to PACs supporting Trump. The co-founders pledged their support for Trump before President Joe Biden dropped out of the race and later posted a podcast explaining their rationale for backing Trump. Horowitz and Andreessen's support for Trump was rooted in anticipation for the loosening of regulations in cryptocurrency. The venture capitalists joined a wide range of tech moguls who threw their support behind Trump this summer including Tesla chief Elon Musk, Palantir co-founder Joe Lonsdale and Gemini executives Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss.

How Will The 2024 Election Impact Your Job? Changes To Expect At Work,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/dianehamilton/2024/10/05/how-will-the-2024-election-impact-your-job-changes-to-expect-at-work/,2024-10-05T14:51:37Z,"The 2024 election could bring major changes to your workplace -- whether you're in HR, a team leader, or an employee. Both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris have very different approaches to labor laws, unions, diversity programs, and technology in the workplace. These shifts might impact you directly, so here's what you can expect and what you can do to stay ahead.

If Trump Wins: Expect fewer regulations. Companies may have more flexibility with how they classify employees (think freelancers vs. full-time staff). For gig workers, this could mean changes in benefits or job status, so it's important to stay informed.

If Harris Wins: Stronger worker protections could come into play, including a higher minimum wage and expanded family leave. While this could mean more benefits for you, companies may need time to adapt, so changes might not happen immediately.

Something To Consider: When California introduced new gig worker laws, companies like Uber and Lyft had to rethink their worker classifications. You might see similar shifts at your own company, depending on how the election goes.

If Trump Wins: Union activity might decrease, especially if fewer regulations are put in place to support organizing. This could mean less pressure to unionize, but companies will still need to focus on employee satisfaction to avoid workplace issues.

If Harris Wins: Expect more union influence. This could lead to stronger job protections, particularly if you're in a unionized industry. You may see more negotiations around wages, benefits, and working conditions.

Something To Consider: Companies like Amazon have faced increasing pressure from workers to unionize, especially during leadership changes. Depending on the election results, you might see more -- or fewer -- attempts like this at your own workplace.

If Trump Wins: DEI initiatives may receive less government support, but most companies will likely continue these programs. DEI is a key factor in attracting top talent, so you can expect companies to stay committed to fairness and inclusion, even without a regulatory push.

If Harris Wins: There may be stronger government oversight on DEI programs. Policies around pay equity, anti-discrimination, and diversity could become more visible, and companies might have to follow stricter guidelines for reporting and transparency.

Something To Consider: When Starbucks faced backlash over its handling of diversity issues, the company responded by doubling down on DEI efforts. Regardless of political changes, many companies will take similar action to protect their brand and reputation.

If Trump Wins: With fewer regulations on AI, companies might adopt technology more quickly to streamline hiring and performance management. While this could lead to greater efficiency, it's essential to understand how AI might impact your job and how decisions are made.

If Harris Wins: Expect stricter regulations around AI, especially when it comes to fairness and preventing bias. You may see more transparency in how AI tools are used to make hiring, promotion, and performance decisions.

Something To Consider: Large companies like IBM and Google have been early adopters of AI in their HR practices. Depending on how the election goes, your company might follow suit -- either with more freedom or under stricter oversight."
Tax Breaks: The There's No Crying In Baseball Edition,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2024/10/05/tax-breaks-the-theres-no-crying-in-baseball-edition/,2024-10-05T14:08:01Z,"This is a published version of our weekly Forbes Tax Breaks newsletter.

My grandfather worked his entire life. By the time he reached what we would consider ""retirement age,"" he was still working. Farming and other manual labor had taken their toll on his body, so in his mid-70s, he would suit up in his uniform as a security guard and work nights at the local hospital. He was gone a lot. But on those hot, sticky summer afternoons in the south, when he had a free moment, he and I would sit and watch baseball on the old TV in the family room (for the record, he was a Cubs fan). Those are some of the most special memories of my life, and I suspect they are why I love baseball to this day.

I'll bet you have a similar story. For many, especially those of us in the U.S., baseball is synonymous with childhood summers and evening games of catch.

Baseball has been on the minds of many folks this week -- and not just because of the World Series. Earlier this week, baseball great Pete Rose died at age 83. I noted (☆) that if you asked ten people what they think about Rose, you'd likely get ten different answers. Rose's resume dazzles on paper -- he still holds several baseball records, including the major league record for games played (3,562) and plate appearances (15,890). He racked up multiple awards, including two Golden Gloves (1969 and 1970), Silver Slugger (1981), and World Series MVP (1975). But he had his vices and polarized the baseball community. He admitted to cheating on his taxes -- for which he did jail time -- and betting on baseball. The latter is why he died without seriously being considered for the Baseball Hall of Fame.

Those hot, sticky summers? I spent them in my native state of North Carolina. The stories coming out of western North Carolina -- and neighboring states -- are heartbreaking. Recovery will be slow and expensive. If you can be generous and help, please do (here's how). Many Americans donate even if they can't claim a tax deduction. But some of the tax rules that apply are good to follow even if you're not claiming a tax deduction.

The IRS acted quickly (☆) to announce relief for individuals and businesses affected by the storm, including the entire states of Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, and South Carolina and parts of Florida, Tennessee, and Virginia. These taxpayers now have until May 1, 2025, to file various federal individual and business tax returns and make tax payments. That date is particularly noteworthy as it's after the traditional tax filing deadline of April 15, 2025. Additionally, some of the areas hit by Helene were already extended because of Hurricane Debby -- those due dates have also been pushed forward to May 1, 2025.

The recent damage to communities caused by natural disasters has renewed discussions about climate change. According to the United Nations, as greenhouse gas emissions blanket the Earth, they trap the sun's heat, leading to climate change. As a result, the world is warming faster than ever in recorded history. As policymakers seek to curb greenhouse gas emissions through taxation, the star of the show has always been carbon dioxide, but methane emissions are a significant challenge that also require attention. So why is it essential to address methane emissions, and what policy tools are we seeing in this area? Tax Notes contributing editor Nana Ama Sarfo tackles this issue in the latest episode of the Tax Notes Talk (transcript available).

Another controversial topic in the tax world is also getting a new look -- whistleblowers. Earlier this year, the annual report to Congress issued by the IRS Whistleblower Office (WBO) suggested more taxpayers than ever (☆) are blowing the whistle on bad tax behavior. The IRS paid whistleblowers 121 awards totaling $88.8 million in 2023 -- those amounts correspond to information that resulted in tax collections of $338 million. That's a significant increase from the total whistleblower awards paid in 2022 when just $37.8 million were distributed.

The WBO has recently announced some significant awards (details on two can be found here). The WBO has also revised its part of the Internal Revenue Manual and provided guidance on when the WBO will ""disaggregate"" claims, i.e., make partial awards. This issue of partial awards has been a significant one. A classic example involves a criminal tax case that has been settled and all dollars collected, but there is an open civil tax matter. The WBO has historically waited for the civil matter to be resolved before paying. Whistleblowers, writes Dean Zerbe, have been in Mudville -- with no joy (a bonus baseball reference).

Much of coming forward with a whistleblower claim -- or defending an action based on such a claim -- relies on having great records. Many people face the dilemma of what to do with old tax returns and supporting paperwork, often wondering when it's safe to discard them. However, determining the right time can be tricky, especially for taxpayers with foreign assets. Those with overseas financial interests must pay particular attention for many reasons, including expanded statutes of limitation that permit an indefinite IRS audit timeline and problems in retrieving records from foreign institutions, which can often be more challenging.

Speaking of records, it's possible that a few could be broken in the coming weeks. I know the extended tax deadline is just days away, but the World Series postseason heats up this weekend. Let's hope your team wins (and hopefully, your team will also be the Phillies).

Most taxpayers opt for the standard deduction -- but not all taxpayers understand why that happens. For most taxpayers, it comes down to numbers.

If your total deductions on Schedule A exceed the standard deduction for your filing status, you can claim that amount instead -- these are your itemized deductions. Itemized deductions include, among other things, the home mortgage interest deduction, medical and dental expenses, taxes paid (including up to $10,000 of state and local income taxes), and charitable gifts. If the total of those deductions exceeds the standard deduction for your filing status, you will (in most cases) want to claim itemized deductions instead of the standard deduction. If the total of those deductions is less than the standard deduction for your filing status, you will want to claim the standard deduction.

If you're not sure whether you'll want to take the standard or the itemized deduction, and the math in your head makes it seem too close to call, run the numbers and see which is the most beneficial. If you're using tax software, that should be pretty simple, ditto if you're using a tax preparer.

As with almost everything tax-related, there are some exceptions. You cannot use the standard deduction if you file as married filing a separate return and your spouse itemizes deductions; you are a nonresident alien or a dual-status alien during the year; or you are filing a tax return for less than 12 months because of a change in your annual accounting method.

The 2017 tax reform changed the game for many taxpayers -- the much larger standard deduction, together with limits on mortgage and SALT deductions and the elimination of other deductions (like unreimbursed job expenses, including the home office deduction for employees), made itemizing deductions less appealing. The overwhelming majority of taxpayers now claim the standard deduction -- for 2021, nearly nine out of ten taxpayers (88.2%) claimed the standard deduction.

For the tax year 2024, the standard deduction is $14,600 for individuals and married couples filing separately, an increase of $750 from 2023. Married couples filing jointly can claim $29,200, a boost of $1,500 from 2023, while heads of household can claim $21,900, an increase of $1,100 from 2023.

You are entitled to a higher standard deduction if you are age 65 or older at the end of the year (for this purpose, you are considered 65 on the day before your 65th birthday). If you are blind on the last day of the year, you are also entitled to a higher standard deduction.

For 2024, the standard deduction amount for an individual who may be claimed as a dependent by another taxpayer cannot exceed the greater of $1,300 or the sum of $450, and the individual's earned income (not to exceed the regular standard deduction amount).

I'm buying a house. I am married. How much can each of our parents, three in total, give us in gift money before taxes?

Each year, you can make gifts up to the federal gift tax exclusion amount to as many people as you like without any gift tax consequences. For 2024, that number is $18,000, up from $17,000 in 2023. That means that any person can gift you $18,000 without gift tax consequences -- or they could gift 10 people $18,000 without gift tax consequences.

(The annual exclusion for federal gift tax purposes is predicted to increase to $19,000 in 2025.)

So, doing the math from your question, your three parents can gift you and your spouse a total of $108,000 ($18,000 limit x 3 donors x 2 recipients).

Here's where it gets tricky. If a gift exceeds the $18,000 limit for 2024, most taxpayers don't automatically pay gift tax. Instead, the amount of the gift over the $18,000 limit ""chips away"" at your available federal estate tax exemption -- for 2024, that's $13,610,000 per person.

Let's assume your father gifted you $1,018,000 -- that amount is $1 million over the annual gift tax exclusion. Instead of paying gift tax on the $1 million, your father would file a gift tax return (Form 709) notifying the IRS that his exemption is reduced by $1 million. At death, he would only be able to pass $12,610,000 to his heirs, federal estate tax free (assuming he died in 2024-the federal estate tax exemption can vary from year to year due to inflation and, of course, any changes in the law).

The reality? Most taxpayers are not subject to the federal estate or gift tax.

The IRS has announced that the number of states offering Direct File will double for the 2025 tax filing season to 24. For the next filing season, Direct File will be available in Alaska, Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Idaho, Kansas, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Nevada, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New Mexico, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Washington, Wisconsin, and Wyoming. That means 62% of Americans will live in states offering Direct File.

In addition to expanding the number of participating states, Direct File will now cover additional types of income, credits, and deductions. It's estimated that more than 30 million taxpayers will be eligible to use Direct File in the 2025 filing season.

With about a month left before the elections, the highly critiqued ""no tax on tips"" proposal promoted by both Donald Trump and Kamala Harris is still a talking point. Tax experts appear to hate everything about these proposals -- Steve Rosenthal of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center spoke for many with his list of complaints. ""In tax policy, we evaluate proposed reforms by how well they promote equity, efficiency, and revenue,"" he wrote in a recent piece for Forbes. ""'No taxes on tips' fails all three tests by singling out certain taxpayers for relief but not others similarly situated; distorting compensation arrangements and labor markets; and losing substantial revenue, potentially hundreds of billions of dollars in the first 10 years.""

And, one of the worst things about the proposals is how ineffective they would be at actually helping tipped workers. The Budget Lab at Yale University noted in a recent report that ""about 4% of families report tips to the IRS, and those who do are disproportionately young, unmarried, and lower-income. This means that many tipped workers do not pay income tax to begin with and would not benefit from a new deduction.""

A little history, writes Tax Notes' Joseph Thorndike, can illuminate today's rush to exempt tips from taxation. Here's more.

While the official numbers are generally available at the end of the year, estimates suggest that the New York Mets, Los Angeles Dodgers, New York Yankees, and my own Philadelphia Phillies will be subject to the luxury tax for the 2024 season.

By rule, teams that exceed the payroll threshold are subject to the luxury tax -- for 2024, that number is $237 million. The tax is figured on each dollar that payrolls are above the threshold, and the tax rate increases based on the number of consecutive years a club has exceeded the threshold (for the first year, there's a 20% tax on all overages, for the second consecutive year, the tax is 30%, and for the third consecutive year or more, it's 50%).

Tops on the list for the season will likely be the New York Mets, who are paying more money to players no longer on their roster ($70.3 million) than the entire total the A's are paying for players on their team ($60.5 million).

Barack Obama Joining Harris Campaign Trail In Final Election Stretch: What To Know About His Campaign Strategy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephenpastis/2024/10/04/barack-obama-joining-harris-campaign-trail-in-final-election-stretch-what-to-know-about-his-campaign-strategy/,2024-10-04T22:45:01Z,"Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign hopes to get a boost as former President Barack Obama sets out to stump for her in swing states, adding a Democratic heavyweight to campaign events with a history of success in grassroots outreach and digital focus.

Harris' campaign has hired key Obama pollsters, speechwriters, aides, strategists and advisers like David Plouffe, Obama's 2008 campaign manager; Stephanie Cutter, a former deputy campaign manager and strategist; and Mitch Stewart, an organizing operative, among others. The two politicians differ, but the buzz around Harris' campaign compares to Obama's 2008 campaign by promoting a positive outlook, Jamal Simmons, a former Harris adviser, told Reuters. Simmons is pointing to Harris' campaign promotion of ""a new way forward"" with joy and positivity, while Obama's campaign became associated with hope and change, a winning message considering the sweeping victory it brought. ""This is already a sharp contrast to the Clinton 2016 and Biden 2020 campaigns, which did not have the same authentic groundswell of enthusiasm,"" McKenna said. Other similarities exist in the campaigns through the mass training events called ""Camp Kamala,"" reminiscent of ""Camp Obama"" programs from 2007. But the Harris campaign has operated for far less time, so ""Camp Kamala"" is focused on last-minute mobilization tactics such as phone calls and door knocking, while the ""Camp Obama"" events were dayslong sessions held a year before the election to teach about grassroots organizing and leadership, McKenna said. The Harris campaign's efforts on TikTok and with online jokes reaching younger audiences (even if the memes have often been user-generated and Trump has a substantially larger social media command) garnered significant attention after she launched her campaign in July.

After endorsing Harris in July and calling her the successor of his movement and coalition (""Now the torch has been passed,"" he said in his Democratic National Convention speech), Obama's support in fundraising events and content has raised more than $76 million for Harris' campaign. Obama, in some ways a mentor to Harris, will expand his involvement in campaign efforts in the coming days, according to adviser Eric Schultz, who said the former president plans to ""do everything he can"" to help Harris win. Even before joining the trail, Obama played a role in Harris' campaign by offering campaigning advice (occasionally unsolicited), according to reporting by Reuters.

Harris and Obama met two decades ago, and Harris went on to support Obama's 2008 campaign by knocking on doors and helping fundraise before the Iowa caucuses, the BBC reported. Obama later supported Harris during her campaign to be California's attorney general in 2010 and her Senate bid in 2016."
Bruce Springsteen Endorsed Harris -- But Bill Murray Didn't Endorse Trump,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/04/bruce-springsteen-endorsed-harris-but-bill-murray-didnt-endorse-trump/,2024-10-04T19:32:54Z,"Just weeks after Vice President Kamala Harris received the endorsement of pop superstar, rock legend Bruce Springsteen threw his support behind her as well. In a video post on Instagram, the 75-year-old rocker -- who is known simply as ""The Boss"" -- suggested this is ""one of the most consequential elections in our nation's history.""

The ""Born in the USA"" singer further offered a critique of former President Donald Trump, while he lamented the fact that the nation is as ""politically, spiritually and emotionally divided"" as at any time since the American Civil War.

""It doesn't have to be this way,"" Springsteen added.

The endorsement wasn't entirely surprising, as Springsteen has a long history of backing Democrats. He previously endorsed Barack Obama in 2008, and in the 2020 U.S. presidential election provided a narration for a Joe Biden campaign ad while the song ""My Hometown"" played in the background.

Whether Springsteen's endorsement will move the needle in this year's razor-close election isn't clear, it likely could cost him some fans due to the deep political divide he warned about.

""Steve Van Zandt was quoted recently as saying Bruce's political views had cost the band a lot of fans,"" explained Bruce Barber, professional in residence at the University of New Haven and general manager of radio station WNHU. ""He's probably right -- but that to me is what a true artist is all about, the ability to speak truths, in words and song, regardless of the consequences. Springsteen's support for Kamala Harris is definitely not a surprise, but it's another example of his undying commitment to being genuine in his art and his personal life.""

Just as Springsteen released his endorsement of Harris, it was another celebrity that went viral on Thursday -- namely, What About Bob? actor Bill Murray for his alleged backing of Trump.

Internet personality Bo Loudon posted a clip of Murray from 2016 ""praising"" some of the former president's policies, and suggested ""Who needs Taylor Swift when you have BILL MURRAY?""

The clip, which was seen nearly six million times, seemed to convince many that the Ghost Busters star had endorsed Trump. However, as of Friday afternoon, Bill Murray has been silent on the issue and hasn't endorsed either candidate. According to Vanity Fair, Murray had campaigned for the Green Party's Ralph Nader in the 2000 presidential race -- but perhaps that was ""lost in translation.""

Murray would just be the latest celebrity to see his/her/their endorsement of a candidate -- even if it wasn't made. Such endorsements might barely move the needle, but given how close this race is every single vote is going to matter.

""Celebrity endorsements are very important in today's political world,"" said Dr. Julianna Kirschner, lecturer at the Annenberg School for Communication and Journalism at the University of Southern California.

""Taylor Swift's endorsement of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz has made notable political, cultural, and social waves. Likewise, other celebrities endorsing candidates can have a similar ripple effect,"" added Kirschner.

A video clip from eight years ago is hardly an endorsement, but it was enough for many to believe that Murray was a Trump supporter.

""Without any corroborating evidence, the comment's validity appears dubious at best,"" suggested Kirschner. ""News organizations verify facts from several sources before broadcasting them, which is the likely reason for a lack of reporting on the subject. All we have right now is conjecture, a premise through which misinformation on social media thrives.""

These faux endorsements are just the latest form of misinformation that we've seen this election cycle. In this particular case, the video is just enough to make the story seem credible.

""Misinformation booms when information cannot be validated. In this case, Murray's position is unclear,"" added Kirschner. ""Users may double down when presented with contrasting information is presented to them. There is plenty of research that would support the likelihood of such an outcome. Given the high chances of users doubling down, the possibility of celebrity endorsements moving the needle would be small but not insignificant. In the tight race we are in, everything, no matter how small, makes a difference.""

The other side of this story is that Swift and Springsteen could receive some backlash from fans, but as Barber noted, the Boss likely knew it going in. In Murray's case, he could face scrutiny for something he didn't even do.

As an A-lister, he likely won't be impacted; yet, we could see the careers of up-and-comers affected -- perhaps running afoul of a casting director, movie producer, publicist, etc.

""From the celebrity's perspective, they should be concerned with how they are politically represented online. This can affect their reputation and potential support from fans, which inevitably allows them to continue to do their work,"" Kirschner continued.

And the problem could get worse. Murray may have actually offered his past comments in an interview, but advances in deep fakes could soon put words into the mouths of celebrities -- living and dead alike!

""As AI becomes more advanced, it is likely that comments, images, and videos of what appears to be celebrities endorsing a candidate may be outright false,"" warned Kirschner. ""As cases like Murray's attributed comment come up in the future, it will become increasingly challenging to discern fact from fiction."""
Trump FEMA Claim Debunked: Agency Not Running Out Of Money Because Of Migrants,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/04/trump-fema-claim-debunked-agency-not-running-out-of-money-because-of-migrants/,2024-10-04T15:43:05Z,"Former President Donald Trump and his allies have claimed the Federal Emergency Management Agency can't respond well enough to the aftermath of Hurricane Helene because it's diverted so much money to helping migrants -- but that's not true, as FEMA's funds for handling disaster relief efforts are separate from money given to immigrant communities.

Hurricane season runs through Nov. 30 with September and October usually the busiest months, the Associated Press notes, so it's possible another hurricane could strike by the end of the month that FEMA would struggle to respond to with its present funding levels. It remains unclear whether lawmakers will return to Washington to pass more funding before their recess ends in November. While even some Republicans have advocated for doing so -- including Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., Rick Scott, R-Fla., and Marsha Blackburn, R-Tenn., all from Helene-hit states -- House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., told The New York Times ""there's no necessity for Congress to come back.""

$34 billion. That's approximately how much Hurricane Helene's devastation could cost, according to a projection Moody's Analytics made Thursday, based on estimated property damage costing up to $26 billion and an estimated $5 billion to $8 billion in resulting economic losses. Those estimates are still early and are likely to change as there's a clearer sense of the scope of the damage, Moody's noted.

Another claim made by Trump and his allies is that Vice President Kamala Harris and the Biden administration are giving only $750 to victims of Helene's devastation and not doing anything else. That is also false, with FEMA noting on its website that the $750 figure is specifically for Serious Needs Assistance, which is immediate aid that disaster victims can receive to pay for essential items like food, water and emergency supplies. Victims can still apply for and receive additional support from FEMA on top of that, however, such as money for temporary housing and repairs.

Hurricane Helene has brought widespread devastation to parts of the South including North Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida, with an estimated death toll so far of 215. The natural disaster has also become a political debate ahead of the presidential election, as Trump has criticized the Biden administration's response to the disaster, often by making up false accusations. Trump claimed Monday that Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp was ""having a hard time getting the president on the phone"" and that the ""federal government is not being very responsive,"" for instance, even as Kemp clarified he had spoken with Biden and the president told Kemp to call him directly if he needed further assistance. Trump has also claimed Biden and Harris ""have left Americans to drown"" -- which is false, as the government has sent significant supplies and federal troops to affected areas -- and Trump allies have pointed to the FEMA's equity efforts to claim the agency's ""#1 goal is to be woke."" The Biden administration has strongly denounced Trump and his allies' claims: FEMA spokesperson Jacklyn Rothenberg said the agency ""help[s]

It's unlikely Musk would be able to serve in a public position due to his vast private business interests. Entrepreneurs looking to take government jobs usually divest their shares and holdings to avoid conflicts of interest, but Musk is unlikely to be able to divest his massive stakes in companies like Tesla, SpaceX and X without causing major disruption. And, because his business interests touch so many sectors, he'd likely find himself forced to recuse regularly to avoid the appearance of any conflict.

Trump was often criticized in his presidency for his own conflicts of interest after deciding not to divest his business empire before entering public office. The ethics watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington says he committed more than 3,400 violations while in office, including visits by foreign officials and political events held at Trump-owned properties, dozens of foreign trademarks granted to Trump businesses and more than 100 events by special interest groups held at Trump properties. A report from American Public Media found that more than half of Trump's 20-person Cabinet during his presidency had engaged in ""questionable or unethical conduct,"" including in relation to their business holdings and investments.

The relationship between Musk and Trump has not always been an amicable one. In the leadup to the 2016 election, Musk said Trump was ""not the right guy"" to be president before going on to join -- and later quit -- two of the president's business-advisory councils. In 2022, when Musk was attempting to buy Twitter, Trump called him a ""bullshit artist."" He said Musk would never be able to buy Twitter, and said Musk claimed he'd never voted for a republican after privately telling Trump he voted for him before. In response, Musk said it was ""time for Trump to hang up his hat & sail into the sunset."" At the time, he said Trump was too old to run for the presidency again in 2024 and said he was supporting Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis. That same year, Musk reinstated Trump's previously banned Twitter account. The two have been linked a few times since -- the New York Times reported the pair met in March and the Washington Post reported they'd discussed a potential buyout of the Truth Social platform last year -- and in July of this year, Musk endorsed Trump for the presidency. Since then, Trump returned to Twitter for a live interview, Musk has repeatedly attacked his opponent Vice President Kamala Harris and Musk claimed he helped start the pro-Trump America PAC.

Musk, who founded Tesla, SpaceX and other companies, is ranked as the richest person in the world as of Friday with an estimated net worth of $258.7 billion, more than $50 billion more than Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, the second-richest person. Trump has an estimated $4 billion net worth as of Friday thanks to his stakes in Truth Social's parent company, the Trump Media and Technology Group, his real estate investments and other assets."
The Latest Employment Numbers And The Presidential Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntharvey/2024/10/04/the-latest-employment-numbers-and-the-presidential-election/,2024-10-04T12:44:31Z,"The Employment Situation Report for the month of September was released this morning. It showed what everyone expected: very little change in the unemployment rate. At 4.1%, it was actually slightly lower than that for August (4.2%). One open question was the impact of Hurricane Francine on jobs, but ""Our analysis suggests that Hurricane Francine had no discernible effect on national payroll employment, hours, and earnings from the establishment survey, or the national unemployment rate from the household survey.""

As important as these releases are in normal times, they take on extra significance in the lead up to an election. In fact, experts claim that the economy is particularly important to voters this year. It has consequently been a running theme for both parties, with Democrats focusing on low unemployment and robust growth and Republicans on the recent spike in inflation.

What's curious about this campaign is the fact that the Democrats are having to scramble to defend themselves. You'd think that theirs was the high ground given that:

Meanwhile, though it is true that inflation accelerated temporarily, there is little question that this was related to factors outside of the US and has calmed down considerably.

Despite this, however, voters have a very dim -- and flawed -- view of the state of the economy:

""Nearly everything Americans believe about the economy is wrong, according to a recent Harris-Guardian poll...The poll, conducted earlier this month, found that perceptions of the U.S. economy are often at odds with reality. For instance, most Americans (55 percent) think the economy is shrinking, with about the same share saying we're in a recession.""

Unfortunately for the Democrats, perceptions are more important than reality in situations like this.

There are three more key indicator announcements before the November 5th election:

If any of these is out of line with what we have been experiencing of late, it could have an impact on voters.

That said, economists do not expect any significant deviation from our current low unemployment, solid GDP growth, and moderating inflation. Even if the dockworkers' strike (now resolved) and recent flooding were to raise prices, the October 10 CPI announcement only covers September. It simply wouldn't show up yet.

What this suggests is that the releases will include very little new information and both parties will simply recycle their earlier talking points. If the outcome is going to be affected by the state of the economy, it is going to be because one party did a better job of spinning than the other. And while there is evidence that Kamala Harris' economic message may be gaining ground on Donald Trump's, a lot can happen in a month.

Everyone will be watching these numbers closely."

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin and director Ken Burns hrew their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyoncé has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyoncé's mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported. Actress Aubrey Plaza posted a photo of herself on Instagram holding Grumpy Cat -- the face of a famous meme -- with the caption ""HARRIS 🇺🇸 WALZ. Mel Brooks said he was ""all in"" for the Harris and Walz ticket in a post to social media holding his dog, adding ""I don't have a cat, so a dog will have to do!"" Stevie Nicks did not name a particular candidate when she encouraged her followers to vote in an Instagram post this week, but signed her message ""Childless Dog Lady."" Billionaire pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post minutes after a debate between Harris and Donald Trump wrapped up, with a photo of her holding her cat that has since been recreated by several other celebrities. After declining to endorse a candidate in 2020, Martha Stewart said at the Retail Influencer CEO Forum she will supporting Kamala Harris in the election because she wants a president ""who doesn't hate New York"" and ""doesn't hate democracy,"" the Daily Beast reported. Pop star Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas, a songwriter and producer, made a video about National Voter Registration Day and Billie said they would both be voting for Harris and Walz ""because they are fighting to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy."" Famous television scientist Bill Nye, in a video posted to the Kamala HQ TikTok account, called Trump a ""climate change denier"" and encouraged viewers to ""vote with the climate in mind."" Nye participated ""Geeks & Nerds for Harris"" fundraiser on Sept. 28 hosted by ""Wonder Woman"" star Lynda Carter that will also feature ""Star Trek"" actors LeVar Burton and Anthony Rapp, actor Misha Collins of ""Supernatural,"" Star Wars actor Mark Hamill and others.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio. Trump thanked Brittany Mahomes, wife of NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes, for her ""defending him"" after she lashed out at social media users who criticized her for liking several pro-Trump posts last month (Mahomes has not formally endorsed a candidate). At a rally in Las Vegas, Trump thanked reggaeton star Nicky Jam for his endorsement, but apparently thought he was a she -- saying: ""Do you know Nicky? She's hot. Where's Nicky?"" -- before correcting himself after Jam climbed to the stage, saying, ""Oh, look, I'm glad he came up.""

Notable names missing from the list of public supporters include billionaire Michael Bloomberg, who called the decision ""too important to rush."""
Forbes Daily: Toyota's Latest $500 Million Bet On Flying Taxis,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/10/04/forbes-daily-toyotas-latest-500-million-bet-on-flying-taxis/,2024-10-04T12:22:11Z,"This is a published version of the Forbes Daily newsletter, you can sign-up to get Forbes Daily in your inbox here.

The Forbes Billionaires List reached a new milestone: For the first time, it has four members worth $200 billion or more.

Mark Zuckerberg joined the elite $200 billion club Thursday after his net worth rose by $3 billion as Meta shares ticked up 1.7%. His fortune of $201.5 billion puts him just ahead of Jeff Bezos, worth $200.2 billion, but behind Larry Ellison, worth $203.3 billion, and the world's richest person, Elon Musk, with a net worth of $258.7 billion.

The Meta cofounder's wealth has rebounded significantly since a 2022 low point for the company's shares when Zuckerberg's net worth was just $57.7 billion. But Meta's had a banner year, with shares up 68% so far in 2024.

Nvidia chief Jensen Huang said during a recent interview with CNBC that there's ""insane"" demand for its upcoming Blackwell ""Superchip,"" sending shares of the tech giant up more than 3% on Thursday. ""Everybody wants to have the most and everybody wants to be first,"" he said. Nvidia's stock is up more than 147% since the start of the year.

Striking dockworkers and port employers reached a tentative agreement Thursday that will end the work stoppage, after the strike halted about half of the ocean shipping conducted by the U.S and raised concerns of potential economic shocks. The tentative agreement includes a 62% wage increase over six years, according to The Wall Street Journal, but the matter of automation in dock work is still up for negotiation.

When Oscar-winning actress Gwyneth Paltrow started brand empire Goop in 2008 as a simple newsletter from her kitchen table, her lack of formal business training initially led to moments of self-doubt. But at the 2024 Forbes Power Women's Summit, she said that her willingness to embrace vulnerability became key to her leadership style. ""The difficult things and the difficult conversations are the only ones really worth having,"" she says.

Toyota will invest $500 million in U.S. electric air taxi company Joby Aviation for its launch of commercial passenger services, which are slated to begin as soon as 2025. It's Toyota's latest bet on futuristic transportation technologies, and Morgan Stanley has said electric flying taxis could be a more than $1 trillion market by 2040.

A federal judge on Wednesday ruled that the Biden Administration can resume its student loan forgiveness program, which, once finalized, would forgive student loan debt for more than 25 million Americans. It would partially or fully forgive the debt of borrowers whose loans exceed the amount they initially borrowed after interest, those with loans older than 20 or 25 years, those who attended career-training programs that resulted in high debt or low earnings, and those who are eligible for forgiveness programs but never applied.

It was a record-breaking year in the music business: Forbes estimates that the top 10 touring acts collectively grossed more than $3 billion from January through the end of August, a nearly 10% increase from the same period last year. Taylor Swift's Eras Tour was the top-earning summer concert tour for the second year in a row, earning approximately $400 million, followed by Coldplay, whose Music of the Spheres tour earned the band an estimated $131 million.

While Iran does not yet have nuclear arms, analysts believe the country's nuclear development program might be a prime target for Israeli retaliation following Iran's missile launches at Israel, despite U.S. opposition. Iran's attack ""greenlights a counterstrike by Israel, potentially the final showdown blow that Prime Minister Netanyahu has been seeking for years,"" possibly targeting Iran's nuclear or oil facilities, says Laura Blumenfeld, an author and Middle East analyst at Johns Hopkins University.

Community colleges were hit harder by Covid-era enrollment declines than any other type of higher education institution, but a new report from S&P Global Ratings finds that those steep drops are over, and the finances of the community colleges it tracks have stabilized. Many of the enrollment bumps can be attributed to an uptick in students who take community college classes while they're still in high school, according to one expert.

TOPLINE For the first time, Forbes dug into how many superyachts are owned by America's 400 richest people and how much they're truly worth.

While the largest -- and most valuable -- yachts in the world are owned by Middle Eastern royals and Russian oligarchs, Americans own the most, with roughly one out of four of all superyachts -- commonly defined as those larger than 40 meters (131 feet) -- belonging to an American. That's three times as many as Russians, the second-largest group of yacht owners, according to industry publication SuperYacht Times.

Collectively, Forbes estimates that 40 members of the Forbes 400 own at least 60 yachts worth more than $6 billion, according to yacht valuation experts VesselsValue. Some own multiple, while others focus on one extravagant build, which can cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

These ships range from the modest -- Igor Olenicoff's 118-foot, $2 million Rusalka -- to the grandiose, such as David Geffen's Rising Sun. The 18th-largest yacht in the world at 453 feet and the biggest one owned by an American, Rising Sun comes with a basketball court that converts to a helipad and has hosted celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and fellow billionaire Oprah Winfrey.

The most valuable American-owned yacht is Jeff Bezos' Koru, a custom-built 417-foot sailing yacht that's worth an estimated $500 million.

WHY IT MATTERS ""America's 400 richest people are now wealthier than they've ever been, worth a collective $5.4 trillion,"" says Forbes staff writer Giacomo Tognini. ""As their fortunes have grown, these billionaires have increasingly been spending on lavish purchases, from luxury real estate to megayachts. And while yachts aren't great investments -- they tend to depreciate around 10% in the first year after purchase -- that hasn't stopped America's richest from dedicating hundreds of millions of dollars to build opulent, custom-made yachts, with Jeff Bezos spending an estimated $500 million on his superyacht Koru, the second-largest sail yacht in the world, which was delivered in 2023.""

Record-low birth rates among American women and an overall decrease in the world's population growth rate have become a hot topic this election cycle, especially among conservatives. More politicians are looking to offer tax and other benefits for parents:

$5,000: The amount per child that Republican vice presidential candidate JD Vance has suggested as a tax credit, while Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed a $6,000 tax credit to parents of newborns

As exciting as it is to land a job interview, it's important to evaluate whether the organization is a place where you can grow in your career. Ask questions about how the company helps its employees grow and develop their skills, and inquire about the average tenure of team members. Frequent turnover could mean employees are overworked. Ask your interviewers what they like most about working at the company, and pay attention to how they describe the workplace culture.

A strong solar flare is expected to cause Northern Lights sightings across several states as the sun's solar cycle is approaching its anticipated peak. How long is the cycle?

Democrats Mobilize Crypto Voters To Counter Trump's Bitcoin Appeal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2024/10/04/democrats-mobilize-crypto-voters-to-counter-trumps-bitcoin-appeal/,2024-10-04T10:05:16Z,"As the 2024 election approaches, cryptocurrency is no longer a fringe topic. Once dismissed as a niche concern, crypto asset and blockchain policy has rocketed to the forefront for millions of Americans who recognize the critical role of crypto in driving future economic growth and innovation. This shift underscores a broader divide among voters, particularly within the crypto space, with some leaning towards the Democratic Party, while others rally behind former President Donald Trump, positioning him as the so-called ""champion"" of their bitcoin holdings. In response, Suite View PAC has launched Crypto Rides, a direct effort to mobilize Democratic-leaning pro-crypto voters in a way that counters the GOP's bitcoin-only voter narrative.

Crypto Rides represents a dynamic example of how Democrat-leaning voters for this election are reclaiming crypto support by focusing on balanced and responsible regulation. Offering Uber ride vouchers to pro-crypto, pro-tech voters in New York, this initiative seeks to boost turnout for those committed to advancing thoughtful, nuanced oversight of digital assets -- especially in stark contrast to the ""bitcoin maximalism"" embraced by Trump's base.

The Rise Of The Single-Issue Bitcoin Voter

Trump's transformation from bitcoin skeptic to crypto advocate has been one of the most notable shifts in his political stance as he vies for the presidency in 2024. Once dismissive of bitcoin -- calling it a ""scam"" in 2021 -- Trump now positions himself as a champion of cryptocurrency, promising to turn the U.S. into the ""crypto capital of the world."" His pledges to dismantle the Biden administration's war on crypto, and his purchase of a meal with bitcoin, has endeared him to a growing segment of bitcoin maximalists and crypto entrepreneurs who see his return to office as a potential boon for deregulating the industry.

The allure of Trump's pro-bitcoin stance is hard to ignore for many in the crypto community. Despite what some described as his ill-timed and questionable DeFi project for accredited investors, Trump has attracted millions of dollars in donations from crypto founders and investors, and his promise to make bitcoin a centerpiece of his economic policy has galvanized a bloc of voters solely focused on this issue. However, while Trump's campaign may appeal to single-issue bitcoin voters, a broader group of Democratic and independent crypto enthusiasts are concerned about what his broader policies under Agenda 47 (based on Project 2025) could mean for the industry's future stability and inclusivity.

The Democratic Crypto Agenda: More Than Bitcoin

While Trump courts the bitcoin vote, many Democrats are focusing on a more nuanced approach to crypto regulation. Rather than pushing for the wholesale deregulation of digital assets, Democratic crypto voters are calling for policies that balance innovation with consumer protection, financial inclusion, and economic equity.

This difference in approach was highlighted in a recent letter sent to Vice President Kamala Harris' campaign by leaders in the Web3 and DeFi communities. Industry stalwarts like Olayinka Odeniran, Founder and Chairwoman of Black Women Blockchain Council, emphasized the importance of ensuring that Black, Latino, AAPI, and Indigenous communities -- early adopters of cryptocurrency -- are included the regulatory conversation. She, and other diverse Web3 and DeFi leaders, advocated for policies that foster capital formation and financial access for these groups, while also protecting consumers from fraud and ensuring transparency in the industry. For these voters, the stakes are high -- not just for bitcoin's survival but for the entire ecosystem of emerging technologies that could reshape the global economy to be as inclusive and democratizing as its promise, and as articulated in Satoshi Nakamoto's whitepaper. And according to a recent Morning Star poll, crypto voters are evenly divided.

Resetting The Democratic Stance On Digital Assets

In addition to voter mobilization efforts like Crypto Rides, the Crypto4Harris initiative has emerged as a key movement aiming to reshape the Democratic Party's stance on digital assets. This group of cryptocurrency advocates, which includes high-profile figures like Mark Cuban, Anthony Scaramucci, and Congressman Adam Schiff (D-CA), is rallying behind Harris's campaign with a clear agenda: influence future regulatory direction for the crypto industry.

One of the most notable developments within the Crypto4Harris group is the backing of Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), who participated in a virtual rally hosted by the initiative. Schumer expressed strong support for pushing through crypto legislation this year, warning that if the U.S. does not take a proactive approach to regulate digital assets, the industry could move overseas. Schumer's involvement indicates that key Democratic leaders are becoming increasingly receptive to the crypto community's concerns.

Additionally, Jonathan Padilla, CEO of Snickerdoodle Labs and a leading organizer for Crypto4Harris, confirmed that the group has been in early discussions with the Harris campaign, aiming to shape policy and influence regulatory appointments. However, skepticism remains due to Harris's obvious connection to the current anti-crypto administration as the Vice President.

Despite the limited constitutional role of a Vice President to preside over the Senate, break ties in case of a 50/50 vote, to serve at the pleasure of the Chief Executive (the President), and to replace the President in times of crisis, vice presidents are inextricably linked to policies advanced during their time in office. Nonetheless, Harris has begun the challenging and nuanced task of separating herself from the current anti-crypto policies in favor of a pro-digital asset and blockchain stance in alignment with her Opportunity Economy policies to bolster the middle and working classes. She even went so far as to be the first Democratic presidential candidate to publicly declare support for pro-digital asset innovation and reasonable regulations, a stark contrast from Biden's approach.

If the Crypto4Harris movement succeeds in resetting the Democratic Party's stance on digital assets, it could lead to increased investment and innovation in the U.S. digital assets industry and broader Web3 economy. However, the outcome may turn on how willing the Harris campaign is to engage with the ""proof of pivot"" demands of the crypto industry and push back against more stringent regulatory measures of the current administration.

Polling Data Shows Crypto's Growing Importance In The Election

New polling data from Consensys and HarrisX reveals just how much cryptocurrency has risen in importance as an election issue. Nearly 49% of U.S. voters now consider a candidate's stance on crypto to be ""important"" when deciding their vote. This is a massive shift from previous elections and highlights the increasing relevance of digital finance in shaping the political landscape.

The 2024 election is shaping up to be pivotal for the crypto community, with 92% of crypto holders planning to vote -- a striking statistic that makes them a demographic both parties are keen to win over. Yet, the crypto community is anything but monolithic. Recent data shows that 40% of respondents favor the GOP's stance on crypto, while 38% align more with Democrats. This split highlights an opportunity for Democrats and independents to connect with voters who, while perhaps skeptical of the GOP's bitcoin maximalist approach, are seeking a more balanced and inclusive regulatory framework.

Swing States: Crypto as a Deciding Factor

Swing states could very well be where the crypto vote makes the most significant impact. A poll by DCG and The Harris Poll reveals that 26% of voters in these crucial states are actively considering candidates' positions on digital assets when deciding whom to support. With crypto emerging as a key issue in these battlegrounds, initiatives like Crypto Rides are essential in rallying Democratic crypto supporters.

Crypto Rides: Mobilizing the Democratic Crypto Vote

This is where Crypto Rides enters the fray as a direct counter to the GOP's single-issue bitcoin voter. By offering Uber ride vouchers to pro-crypto, Democratic-leaning voters in New York, Crypto Rides ensures that voices advocating for innovation, consumer protection, and financial equity are heard at the polls. ""Crypto Rides isn't just about turnout,"" says founder Will Schweitzer, ""it's about turning out the right votes."" While Trump may have rallied a faction of the crypto community around bitcoin, Schweitzer emphasizes that initiatives like Crypto Rides focus on a more inclusive and responsible approach to digital finance.

The Importance Of Down-Ballot Voting

Though much of the spotlight is on the presidential race, it's crucial to recognize that lasting regulatory reform comes from Congress. Lawmakers across the country will be pivotal in shaping the future legal framework for digital assets, whether in a swing issue or one with a clear party leaning. Initiatives like Crypto Rides remind voters that real change happens up and down the ballot, ensuring that representatives pushing for smart crypto regulation are elected to Congress.

As we approach November 5th, the race for the crypto vote is intensifying. Trump may have energized the bitcoin vote, but Democrats, independents, and never-Trump voters are expanding the tent and the conversation with initiatives like Crypto Rides and Crypto4Harris. The outcome of this election will undoubtedly have lasting implications for the future of digital assets. Whether through ride vouchers, grassroots efforts, legislation or shaping regulatory appointments, the Democratic crypto vote is making its presence felt -- and it could well tip the balance of power in Washington."
"Immigration Isn't The 'Crisis,' But Planning Of Markets Activity Is",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johntamny/2024/10/03/immigration-isnt-the-crisis-but-planning-of-markets-activity-is/,2024-10-03T21:10:21Z,"Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris has taken to blaming the Republicans for problems associated with a surge of immigrants at the southern border. Republicans have hit back. Commentary at the Wall Street Journal asserted that ""Blaming the surge on Republicans evades years of failed policies.""

Without taking sides, it should be obvious to Republicans that ""failed policy"" is a redundancy of sorts. We're talking government after all, and government policies are but the substitution of the knowledge of the few for that of the marketplace itself.

Applied to the southern border, naturally the policies have failed. Central planning of a market phenomenon always fails. Which is no insight.

At the same time, some readers will no doubt reject the assertion that human beings massing at the southern border is a market phenomenon, but if not, what is it? Really, what explains the paucity of humans north of the United States desperately trying to get to the U.S.?

Hopefully the implied point is sufficiently illuminating. Though not Singapore, Canada's economy is largely free and sufficiently prosperous such that the desperation to exit Canada isn't so great.

South of the U.S., and right on down to Venezuela at the very least, let's just say there's too much ""policy"" of the economic kind. And where there's an excess of central planning, there's invariably an outflow of people in search of the much greater opportunity that exists where policy isn't so ubiquitous. That's the United States. People have been coming here to cure their poverty for as long as the U.S. has existed, and surely before that.

Which is evidence yet again that this human migration to the U.S. is a market phenomenon. Even those who seek more border-patrol enforcement, a wall, or both, might agree. Figure that Haiti doesn't have a ""problem"" of desperate people trying to make their way there, but the U.S. generally always does. It's markets at work.

Conversely, let's call central planning the ultimate wall. Though invisible, it guards against the arrival of people better than any wall of any size ever could. Just the same, free markets and freedom ultimately overwhelm any wall, or any kind of border enforcement.

Which is a not-so-insightful way of saying that it's free markets borne of a lack of economic policy exerting their powerful pull for human capital from countries defined by a lack of free markets, and way too much policy. Think about it. Before Maduro and Chavez in Venezuela, was Venezuela's loss of human capital nearly as substantial? Hopefully the question answers itself.

In being answered, ideally it can be said that people generally do best economically where rules and regulations concerning commercial matters are the lightest. Yes, people do best in locales where policy is least apparent.

Applied to the U.S., its market economy is in so many ways a beautiful picture of human cooperation. At the same time, how ironic that the chaos and misery at the southern border resembles what it's like in the countries that would-be U.S. immigrants are trying to escape.

Why aren't Republicans talking about this? Why aren't they showcasing the always and everywhere failure of policy? Just as a policy meant to regulate the number of laptop computers, cars, and chips imported into the U.S. would amount to overwhelming failure, so do efforts to centrally plan people.

Which means we can end the chaos at the southern border in one of two ways: either mimic the economic policies of the countries migrants are exiting so that the U.S. is no longer attractive, or legalize work in the free-market U.S. so that wages and prices can dictate who comes to the U.S., and where. Anything else is central planning."

""There's no question the discussion around family life, childbearing and pronatalism has gotten a lot more popular and gotten media attention because of JD Vance,"" Brad Wilcox, the director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, told the Associated Press.

The total fertility rate in the United States fell to 1.62 births per woman last year, a 2% decline from the year before and the lowest recorded rate since at least the 1930s. Reasons for the declining birthrate are varied and plentiful -- women are getting married later and pushing off having children as they pursue careers and higher education; the rising cost of living has impacted the economic realities of starting a family; and the U.S. lacks affordable child care and universal paid family leave policies, to name a few. Both Democrats and Republicans have supported policies that encourage family growth -- Republican senators have drafted a plan for monthly cash benefits for working families and Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed a $6,000 tax credit to parents of newborns, for example -- though conservatives tend to be more vocal about the goal of boosting birth rates. Economists have warned that a declining birth rate, and aging population, could spell disaster for the nation's Social Security program -- without enough young, working people to counterbalance the number of Social Security dependents, the existing system isn't sustainable. The same is true of other economic institutions that need to continue to replace retiring workers with those of the next generations. Experts also say that a low birth rate demonstrates an overall decline in American stability -- people aren't expressing a desire to have fewer children, research shows, but they are more worried about the economic and social impacts that they are excited to start a family.

The United States isn't the only developed nation experiencing a decline in birth rates, and it's not the only one to be encouraging reproduction at the government level. France in 2023 had the lowest number of babies born in the country since 1946; the Japanese government has described the situation ""critical"" after years of a declining birth rates; and Italy's birth rate has declined more than 34% since 2008. Each country has implemented new policies to address the situation, including an Italian parental leave that can be taken until a child is six years old and Japan extending public insurance coverage to maternity expenses. Hungary's birth rate, once the lowest in the European Union, has started to increase over the last decade as the country implements policies like exempting women who have more than three children from income tax providing home buying and building subsidies that increase based on their marital status and the number of children per household.

The unsealing of Smith's filing revealed new details in his case against Trump accusing him of attempting to overturn the results of the 2020 election. Smith alleged in the new filing that Trump acknowledged the claims the election was rife with fraud and stolen from him had no merit and that he planned to declare victory before the votes were tallied. Trump also hired former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani to lead the legal team fighting the election results in court because he couldn't find any other lawyers who were willing to take the case and he knew Giuliani ""was willing to falsely claim victory,"" according to the court papers. Trump also allegedly reacted with apathy when he was alerted that former Vice President Mike Pence had to be moved to a secure location during the Jan. 6 attack, responding ""So what?"" when an aide told him. Trump, who has pleaded not guilty to the charges against him, argued Tuesday on Truth Social the documents shouldn't have been released before the election. He also accused the Justice Department of unveiling them to distract from Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's performance in Tuesday's vice presidential debate.

Democrats and Democrat-aligned groups have also filed a series of election-related lawsuits challenging rules in Republican-led states, generally arguing that the laws are too restrictive, could hinder voter access and unnecessarily delay the election process. The Georgia state and national Democratic parties sued Georgia last month, arguing new rules from the Georgia State Election Board could allow county election officials to reject the results. The rules require county election officials to conduct a ""reasonable inquiry"" into possible fraud and misconduct. Democrats argue the county election officials don't have the authority to refuse certification of the results and that any allegations of fraud and misconduct should be handled in court, not by county elections officials.

Trump has said he will accept the election results if it's a ""fair and legal and good election,"" he said during the June CNN debate with President Joe Biden. At the same time, he has repeatedly said on the campaign trail he believes the only way Democrats can win is if they cheat. Trump also said recently in an interview with the radio program ""Full Measure,"" he wouldn't run again in 2028 if he loses.

Some Republicans in Congress have echoed Trump's stance that they will only accept the election results if it's a fair election without any evidence of fraud or misconduct. Congress is charged with certifying the results of the electoral college, typically a routine, ceremonial process that was upended in the wake of the 2020 election as Trump's supporters stormed the Capitol in an attempt to prevent Congress from approving the results. House Speaker Mike Johnson, R-La., who helped draft legal arguments some Republicans in Congress used to support their decision to vote against the certification of the results, told reporters last week ""of course if we have a free, fair and safe election, we're going to follow the Constitution, absolutely.""

Trump's legal efforts to contest the results of the 2020 election by claiming various types of fraud and mismanagement resoundingly failed. Of the 64 cases Trump and his allies filed in the six battleground states (Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada), only one -- in Pennsylvania -- was successful, according to a 2022 report, ""Lost, Not Stolen,"" by a group of eight conservative legal experts. The cases included allegations of improper ballot counting, voting machine malfunctions, irregularities in absentee ballot processes and voter ineligibility. The cases were dismissed by both Republican and Democratic state and federal judges, including some appointed by Trump.

How Americans Think The Election Will Impact Their Personal Finances,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/presidential-election-personal-finance-impact/,2024-10-03T16:32:49Z,"Editorial Note: We earn a commission from partner links on Forbes Advisor. Commissions do not affect our editors' opinions or evaluations.

The economy is the top issue on the minds of voters heading into the 2024 presidential election, and Americans are divided on which candidate will improve their personal finances, according to a Forbes Advisor and Talker Research survey of 2,000 registered voters. Of these, 48% were Democrats, 39% were Republicans and 10% were independents.

For instance, 48% of respondents said Vice President Kamala Harris would deliver a better economy compared to 44% for former President Donald Trump.

However, 52% said their personal finances were healthier four years ago, when Trump was in office, compared to less than a quarter who said they're doing better now during the Biden Administration.

Voters want the eventual winner to focus on bringing down prices; 60% cited inflation as the top priority for the next administration.

A look at the topline figures paint a positive picture of the public's appetite for a potential Harris Administration.

Nearly half (48%) of respondents said the economy would improve under her presidency, compared to 36% who said it would worsen. Another 16% said it wouldn't change.

Meanwhile, 44% said that a Trump Administration would bode well for the nation's economic future, while 42% believed the economy would suffer. A seventh (14%) replied that the economy wouldn't change much in a second Trump Administration.

But when you drill down on the specific issues that affect personal finances, including borrowing costs and the stock market, Americans seemed to have a better appreciation for a Trump victory.

More than half of respondents (52%) said their finances are worse than four years ago, compared to just 23% who think they're better off. Another 20% said they were about the same, while another 5% weren't sure.

Republicans (70%) and independents (65%) were far more likely to think they're finances have gotten worse over the past four years than Democrats (35%).

This finding jibes with a series of data points and sentiment surveys.

For instance, median household income adjusted for inflation was higher in 2019 ($81,210) than in 2023 ($80,610), according to the U.S. Census Bureau.

Just 31% of Americans believe the economy is getting better, according to Gallup, which is down from 51% at the end of 2019.

High prices continue to plague the American consumer.

Even as the rate of inflation has come down, prices are still growing much faster than the Fed's preferred target of 2%.

The personal consumption expenditures (core PCE) price index that strips out volatile food and energy prices, which is the Fed's preferred gauge, rose by 2.7% in August over the previous 12 months.

That's why 60% respondents in our survey think that easing the cost of living should be the top priority of a future Harris or Trump administration.

The next most important issues, lowering income taxes and creating more jobs, were each selected by just 10% of respondents.

Those results dovetail with what Americans say is impacting their decision this November.When asked to name the two biggest economic issues in the election, nearly three-quarters (74%) identified inflation. The second most popular response was healthcare expenses at just 33%.

This is a bipartisan issue: 79% of Republicans and 69% of Democrats selected inflation as one of their biggest concerns.

Americans are likely taking their vote seriously since 68% of respondents either somewhat or strongly agree that the president has a tangible impact on their financial situation.

Meanwhile, 54% think macroeconomic events, such as inflation or stock market performance, have the biggest impact on their financial health, compared to just 20% who say their personal choices are more important.

That makes sense given the massive events American consumers have faced over the past four years, from pandemic-era business and school closures to stimulus checks to sky-high inflation.

While folks believe that the outcome of the election will impact their personal finances, few will wait for a winner before making financial decisions.

In 2016, while President Barack Obama, a Democrat, was finishing his final year in office, those with a Democratic party identification were optimistic about the economy (+18), according to Gallup's U.S. Economic Confidence Index, while Republicans were gloomy (-31).

In 2017, when Obama was replaced by Trump, a Republican, the two sides flipped. Republicans (+46) were now ecstatic, while Democrats (-20) were miserable.

Independents were even-keeled throughout.

Obviously, these voters were viewing events through their partisan lens; people's fortunes didn't radically shift overnight.

This can have real consequences.

A Democratic voter who believed Trump would bring a market collapse missed out on years of stock market gains, for instance.

While your political passions may run hot, don't let them influence how you operate your personal budget.

Of course, big events impact your personal finances. Anyone who has lived through the past four years may have seen wild fluctuations in the value of their home, the interest rate on their high-yield savings account or the annual percentage rate (APR) on their credit card.

Where you run into trouble, though, is believing that these events have a bigger impact on your financial health than your own actions.

Research shows that financial self-efficacy, which is the belief that you're in control of your fate, is key to financial success.

Yes, big stuff happens. But big stuff always happens. The 2000s, for instance, were bookended by two recessions that led to a lost decade for stocks and a housing bubble burst.

Should CISOs Be Held Liable For Cybersecurity Attacks?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/cio/2024/10/03/should-cisos-be-held-liable-for-cybersecurity-attacks/,2024-10-03T16:10:48Z,"Considering how controversial California's SB 1047 was among the tech community, it is not surprising that Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed it. The bill, which would have required the biggest AI platform developers to conform to specific rules in order to prove their safety, was opposed by many because of the sweeping regulations it would have placed on their models, regardless of how they were used. And since so many tech companies are based in California, some spoke out against it, saying it could stifle innovation.

In his veto message, Newsom wrote that he strongly feels AI needs to be regulated by the state, but the bill does not go about evaluating risk in the correct way. Smaller systems, or those used for uses more critical to people's health and welfare, could pose a risk of greater actual harm than a large, expensive-to-train chatbot.

""We cannot afford to wait for a major catastrophe to occur before taking action to protect the public,"" Newsom wrote. ""...I do not agree, however, that to keep the public safe, we must settle for a solution that is not informed by an empirical trajectory analysis of Al systems and capabilities. Ultimately, any framework for effectively regulating Al needs to keep pace with the technology itself.""

Reaction to the veto was mixed. Peter Guagenti, president of AI coding assistant Tabnine, said in an email statement that he was disappointed, but not surprised. Big tech's pushback against the bill was similar to that of big banks and oil and gas companies trying to evade stringent regulation. ""Regulators need to hold Big Tech accountable, demand genuine transparency about data usage, and refuse to accept opaque systems and rigid, unchangeable solutions,"" Guagenti wrote. ""This may affect their cost of doing business, but will build trust in AI more broadly and ultimately help us build a more vibrant, more profitable ecosystem.""

But Austin Vance, CEO and cofounder of software development and consultant agency Focused Labs, countered in an email statement that this legislation actually would have stifled innovation from new players and entrenched the dominance of big companies including Google, Amazon and Meta. Matt Calkins, cofounder and CEO of cloud computing and software company Appian, told The Hill that the California legislation was ambitious, but wouldn't have worked because it didn't seem to understand AI technology.

The drive toward AI regulation will continue, but it remains to be seen how it will work and at what level. It's unlikely that Congress will take action on any proposals in its two months left in the current term, and it's unclear what priority the next president will place on the matter. However, with the deep interest of so many politicians, companies, industry groups, coalitions and international governments, it likely will remain top-of-mind for lawmakers.

Ever since the SolarWinds breach gave Russian hackers access to networks of several federal government agencies and private companies as far back as 2019, cybersecurity has been a front-burner issue for the federal government. In 2023, the SEC criminally charged SolarWinds and its CISO with fraud and internal control failures related to the breach. This July, most of the charges, including those against CISO Timothy Brown, were thrown out, but the case and the issue has changed the way companies look at cybersecurity. I talked to Derek Vadala, chief risk officer at cybersecurity firm Bitsight, about it. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Generative AI titan OpenAI announced this week it closed a massive $6.6 billion funding round, which raises the company's valuation to $157 billion, nearly twice what it was worth in February. The round was led by Thrive Capital, which invested about $1.25 billion, and Microsoft committed just under $1 billion, the Wall Street Journal reported. Other new investors include SoftBank and Nvidia. OpenAI said it will put that money toward AI research, products and services and computing capacity. The Journal reported this new valuation gives OpenAI a market capitalization rivaling AT&T and Goldman Sachs, and it places OpenAI in the realm of the top 100 publicly traded companies.

OpenAI has been active in the last month, both with releases and controversy. It launched a preview of its new o1 model, which spends more time ""thinking"" and was specifically designed to tackle more complex problems and reasoning. And longtime CTO Mira Murati announced she is leaving the company, along with Chief Research Officer Bob McGrw and VP of Research Barret Zoph. Specific reasons for their departures were not provided, though media outlets reported CEO Sam Altman is taking steps to transform OpenAI into a traditional for-profit company.

A federal judge put new California laws cracking down on political deepfakes in the run-up to an election on hold, ruling that they may violate the First Amendment. The laws were signed by Governor Gavin Newsom last month, and took effect immediately. They prohibited ads with altered audio and video of candidates illegal in the 120 days before elections and up to 60 days after, required online platforms to take down deceptive political deepfakes, and required public disclosure on campaign ads using AI-generated content. Christopher Kohls, who shared an AI-created parody campaign video for Vice President Kamala Harris on X -- which Newsom commented ""should be illegal"" -- sued the state over the laws, arguing they were a flagrant use of state power to force censorship of private citizens' speech.

U.S. District Judge John A. Mendez agreed the risks of these kinds of posts are ""significant,"" but there is a longstanding American tradition of critique, parody and satire protected by the First Amendment. ""YouTube videos, Facebook posts, and X tweets are the newspaper advertisements and political cartoons of today, and the First Amendment protects an individual's right to speak regardless of the new medium these critiques may take,"" the ruling states.

In a statement to Politico, Newsom's office said it was confident the courts would uphold the new laws. ""Deepfakes threaten the integrity of our elections, and these new laws protect our democracy while preserving free speech,"" said spokesperson Izzy Gardon. ""Satire remains alive and well in California -- even for those who miss the punchline.""

Nvidia acquired OctoAI, a Seattle-based startup that makes generative AI tools, in a $250 million deal. Forbes senior contributor Janakiram MSV writes that OctoAI develops software that simplifies the deployment and scaling of AI models, which makes generative AI hardware more accessible to developers. OctoAI's technology makes it a leader in secure, enterprise AI deployments. This aligns with Nvidia's ambitions to broaden into providing customers with an end-to-end generative AI stack, as well as new and more powerful GPUs.

Beginning as far back as 2019, network management platform SolarWinds was hacked by Russian actors who inserted malicious code into an update, compromising networks of thousands of customers, as well as local, state and federal governments. In 2023, the SEC criminally charged the company and its CISO Timothy Brown with fraud and internal control failures. SolarWinds and Brown fought the charges, most of which were thrown out in July.

I talked to Derek Vadala, the chief risk officer at cybersecurity firm Bitsight, about how the case has impacted CISOs and the corporate view of cybersecurity. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity. A longer version is available here.

What immediate things did companies and CISOs start doing after the indictment came down?

Vadala: Companies immediately started looking at a few things. What has been our practice and process around disclosure of cybersecurity events, and do we have a robust, transparent process? Do we have all of the right people at the table to make those decisions when it's a matter of cybersecurity or technology? Does it include the CISO?

The second thing I think that companies did was really look at their public-facing statements about cybersecurity, and make sure that they're consistent with what the company believes it's doing to protect the organization from cyber attacks and data disclosure and other factors. It's important to recognize that the indictment was about those disclosures and those representations that SolarWinds had made in various website publications. What most companies did at that point was reaffirm: We have a CISO or a person responsible for cybersecurity. We know who that person is. They are sufficiently represented in decisions around disclosure, and do we have a robust process for this? And then, do we have a good inventory of the places where we've made public statements or have persistent public material about this? Is it consistent with our current understanding, not only of the program, but also of the materiality and status of prior incidents?

What impact do you think this has had on the role of CISO in general? Are qualified candidates less likely to apply for roles, or are people less interested in pursuing this as a career goal?

I don't think it's been a deterrent. I've been a CISO at a Fortune 500 company. It is a great job. It's fast paced, it's exciting, it's technical. It's in an area of growth and demand. People want these jobs. People want the jobs underneath the CISO that will allow them to get into that role one day. But I do think it is creating a conversation about what is the worth of the role in the context of balancing the risk to the compensation, the reward, et cetera. I think that's a healthy dialogue, and there's certainly a lot of talk about that, but I don't believe it has really lowered the demand for CISOs.

It has created a little ambiguity. Where you might see the pressure point that ambiguity creates is seasoned chief information security officers who have been highly successful at this for 20 to 30 years, in the later stages of their career, thinking: Do I want to continue to take on personal risk here? I do think that could have some chilling effects on the industry broadly, if some of those people decide to take a step back from some of those roles where we need them.

From where you sit, what do you see the SEC doing with cybersecurity cases like SolarWinds in the future? SolarWinds isn't the only cybersecurity case that the SEC, which previously dealt with more traditional financial fraud, has pursued. Judgment has been mixed, with some going forward to settlements.

I'm not sure what the SEC will do, but I hope they have seen the community reaction here. I hope they have read some of the letters that have been submitted on behalf of Tim, and even in other similar and adjacent cases. I hope that they use that to balance how they might think about cases like this in the future. And I hope that they create more clarity on expectations.

From time to time, every company needs to make statements about their cybersecurity. Those statements are generated at a point in time. They're reflective of management's best assessment of the state of cybersecurity at the company. They are reflective of the CISO's views of what the state of the company is. They tend to have input from a variety of programs and assessments that the organization is conducting on an ongoing basis to understand. And there's an expectation in the market that companies have information about their cybersecurity programs available to everyone from consumers to other businesses that are engaged. Getting some clarity from the regulators on how they're thinking about those statements -- not the ones that go into the SEC disclosure filings, [but] statements that people make on their websites, on trust pages, on ESG and other pages -- we really have to have clarity on what the balance is.

I think it's important to continue to make statements like that and provide data about cyber practices in the interest of market transparency. We've made significant progress on that in the last decade. There are many more companies with trust centers and other places where people can go and understand what they're doing from a cyber perspective, and I wouldn't want to see that dialing back as a result of the SEC's previous indictments, or what they might do in the future. If they could establish for the community, for the CISOs, what are our expectations here and how should you be thinking about a balanced view, that would be helpful.

Trump Vs. Harris 2024 Polls: Harris Leads In 4 New National Surveys -- Amid Virtual Tie In Swing States,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/03/trump-vs-harris-2024-polls-harris-leads-by-2-points-in-latest-survey/,2024-10-03T14:38:46Z,"The race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump is close to a dead heat less than five weeks before the election, according to a string of surveys this month -- the latest four showing Harris with leads ranging from two to five points.

2.2. That's how many points Harris leads Trump by in RealClearPolitics' latest polling average. Meanwhile, FiveThirtyEight's average shows Harris with a 2.8-point lead.

Harris leads Trump by one point overall in the seven battleground states likely to decide the election: Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Nevada, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia, according to Cook Political Report survey released Wednesday. Harris leads Trump in five of the states, Trump is up by two points in Georgia, and they're tied in North Carolina.

A poll from NBC News released Sept. 29 found that while Harris still leads Trump among Latinos, the lead is shrinking. The NBC News/Telemundo/CNBC poll -- which was conducted Sept. 16-23 among 1,000 registered Latino voters -- showed 54% supported Harris compared with 40% who supported Trump and 6% who said they were unsure who they would vote for. The support for Harris is higher than it was when Biden was running against Trump, NBC said, but is still significantly lower than past leads Democratic candidates have had, including a 36-point lead in 2020 polling and 50-point lead in 2016 polling. The poll had a margin of error of +/-3.1 percentage points.

Pre-debate surveys found Harris' polling surge appeared to plateau, including a NPR/PBS/Marist survey of registered voters taken Sept. 3-5 that showed Harris leading Trump 49% to 48%, down from a three-point lead in August. Harris was up by two points, 47% to 49%, in a Sept. 3-4 Emerson College survey of likely voters, a slight decline from her four-point lead in Emerson's August poll. Most post-debate surveys show the majority of respondents believe Harris won the debate, but not enough to significantly impact the horserace between the two. A New York Times/Siena poll of likely voters released Sept. 19 found the majority of voters in every demographic gave positive reviews of Harris' Sept. 10 debate performance, with 67% overall saying she did well, compared to 40% who said the same about Trump (Trump led Harris 48%-47% in Times/Siena surveys from early September and late July). The poll also found Harris and Trump are tied at 47%. Two other polls from Sept. 19 show Harris with a slight edge: She's up by four points (49%-45%) in a YouGov/Economist survey of registered voters, and two points (50%-48%) in Fox News' likely voter survey, a small shift after Harris trailed by one point in an early August Fox poll and led by just two points in an early September YouGov poll. Harris was up 52%-46% among likely voters and 51%-47% among registered voters in an ABC News/Ipsos poll taken days following the debate on Sept. 11-13, essentially unchanged from her six-point leads with likely voters in late August and early August ABC/Ipsos surveys -- even though 63% of Americans said Harris won last week's debate.

Harris has narrowed Trump's lead in Iowa over Biden from 18 points in June to four points in a Des Moines Register/Mediacom Iowa poll conducted Sept. 8-11 by longtime pollster Ann Selzer, known for her accuracy.

Biden dropped out of the race on July 21 after resisting calls from within his own party for weeks to end his reelection bid in the wake of his disastrous performance in the June 27 debate. He immediately endorsed Harris and she announced plans to seek the nomination. The party quickly coalesced around her, with 99% of Democratic delegates voting to officially nominate her in a virtual roll call prior to the Democratic National Convention in August. Harris tapped Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz as her running mate, weeks after Trump announced Ohio Sen. JD Vance as his pick for vice president. ABC News hosted the first debate between Harris and Trump on Sept. 10 from Philadelphia. Pundits, including former Fox News anchor Chris Wallace and NBC News presidential historian Michael Beschloss, widely considered Harris to be the winner of the debate, as she repeatedly needled Trump, causing him to veer off topic. Harris' rise in polls is coupled with an increase in Democratic enthusiasm for the election, which has nearly doubled since Harris' entrance into the race, from 46% in June to 85% now, while enthusiasm among Republicans has stayed stagnant at 71%, according to a Monmouth University poll released Aug. 14.

Voters will soon cast their ballots to decide which party controls Congress -- now they will be able to bet on it, too.

A federal appeals court lifted a ruling Wednesday that had blocked Americans from betting on the outcome of congressional elections through the prediction market Kalshi. Federal regulators had sought to ban the wagering, arguing it would ""threaten election integrity.""

Kalshi is far from the only market for predictions on politics and other topics. In July, Forbes reported that some $446 million was being wagered on the outcome of the presidential election on Polymarket.

Shortly after the court's decision, 63% of bettors on Kalshi's website predicted Democrats would take the House, while 37% said the Republicans would be victorious.

OpenAI closed a $6.6 billion funding round that valued the booming AI company at $157 billion, nearly double what the company was valued at earlier this year as it is set to transition to a for-profit firm. The company said the funding, from Thrive Capital, SoftBank, Nvidia and longtime backer Microsoft, will go toward its AI research, products and services, and computing capacity.

Crude oil prices, which heavily influence gas prices, rose again Wednesday amid heightened concerns about violence in the Middle East. Oil prices remain far cheaper than they were this summer, with international benchmark Brent crude down 14% from its July peak.

Tesla's stock slumped Wednesday after reporting third-quarter car deliveries that just barely exceeded analyst projections, but failed to meet the most bullish of Wall Street expectations. Still, the 6% year-over-year quarterly delivery growth was a ""mini step in the right direction,"" wrote Wedbush analyst Dan Ives.

IT entrepreneur David Steward, the majority owner of World Wide Technology alongside partner Jim Kavanaugh, is the wealthiest Black person in America, and is one of just four Black members on the 2024 ranking of the wealthiest Americans. Steward initially put up $250,000 in capital to start WWT in 1990, according to a 2019 Forbes profile, and has gone on to nab top corporate clients like Apple, Citi, Microsoft and the federal government.

Former shoe salesman Mitchell Morgan's firm Morgan Properties has become the third-largest owner of apartments in the country, landing him on the Forbes 400 for the first time with a net worth of $5.5 billion. He's earned his success by investing in older apartment buildings in midsize cities and quickly renovating them to boost rental income.

In a break from some House Democrats, President Joe Biden is expected to sign a bipartisan bill that will limit federal oversight on qualifying semiconductor projects in the U.S. The legislation comes in response to concerns that ""unnecessary delays"" could stifle the construction of domestic microchip facilities.

Drew Crecente's daughter was murdered 18 years ago, but on Wednesday, he found out someone made a chatbot using her name and yearbook photo on the Character AI platform. ""A grieving father should not have to find out that his dead daughter is being used to try and make money as a chatbot on some website,"" he told Forbes. Character AI said it has since removed the chatbot from the site for violating its policies.

Former President Donald Trump fired his attorneys after the 2020 election and replaced them with Rudy Giuliani because he would be willing to ""spread knowingly false claims of election fraud,"" Special Counsel Jack Smith alleged in a filing on Trump's efforts to overturn the election. Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung denounced Smith's filing as ""falsehood-ridden"" and ""unconstitutional.""

New York City Mayor Eric Adams will ""likely"" face additional charges, prosecutors said Wednesday, less than a week after he was indicted on federal charges of bribery and fraud. Adams, who appeared during a hearing Wednesday in Manhattan federal court, has pleaded not guilty to all charges.

A federal judge paused a new California state law that cracked down on the use of AI-generated deepfakes targeting political candidates, weeks after the creator of an AI-altered campaign video mocking Vice President Kamala Harris sued to block the legislation. In his ruling, the judge wrote that while fear of deepfakes may be justified, the law likely violates the First Amendment.

President Joe Biden directed 1,000 active-duty soldiers to assist in delivering food, water and other services to communities impacted by Hurricane Helene, which decimated the South over the weekend.

TOPLINE The deadly Switchblade is central to AeroVironment CEO Wahid Nawabi's ambitions to make the drone maker a multibillion-dollar company in the next three to five years, up from $717 million in revenue in its fiscal 2024.

Switchblade is a loitering munition, an expensive type of one-way kamikaze drone designed to circle the battlefield, awaiting a good opportunity to obliterate its target. Both the Russians and Ukrainians are using them in a war where dense networks of antiaircraft systems have pushed fighter jets and bombers to the margins.

Starting in 2022, the U.S. supplied Ukraine with 700 Switchblade 300s, a $50,000 missile small enough to be carried in a soldier's rucksack and launched with minimal effort. It was quietly used by U.S. special forces in Iraq and Afghanistan in the past decade to take down ""high-value"" insurgents at a distance of as much as 6 miles.

The Ukraine war has been a buzzing laboratory for unmanned aircraft, where makers test and improve their designs. AeroVironment's got off to a rough start against Russian electronic warfare, which reportedly has hampered many sophisticated Western drones, but the company is now looking like one of the winners. (Nawabi says modifications to overcome jamming and better training have pushed Switchblade's effectiveness rate north of 80%.)

Plenty of companies are chasing the opportunity: A study last year by the Vertical Flight Society counted 123 entities in 32 countries that were producing one-way attack drones. But AeroVironment, which has quietly been the Defense Department's main supplier of small drones for the past two decades, may have the relationships, technology and industrial experience to better satisfy the U.S. military's sudden desire for unmanned systems en masse.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Ukraine conflict has changed the way war is waged, and countries around the world are rushing to acquire loitering munitions,"" says Forbes senior editor Jeremy Bogaisky. ""AeroVironment seems poised to meet the demand from the U.S. military and allies.""

Trump Immigration Plan May End Deportation Safeguards For 2.7 Million,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stuartanderson/2024/10/03/trump-immigration-plan-may-end-deportation-safeguards-for-27-million/,2024-10-03T12:04:45Z,"Up to 2.7 million people will lose protection from deportation in a second Trump administration if Donald Trump ends current immigration safeguards. New data show individuals in Temporary Protected Status and other immigration programs could see their legal protection expire in the next two years. Trump officials could add millions of people to potential deportation rolls by allowing immigration safeguards, such as TPS, to end. Immigration enforcement personnel in a second Trump administration could find targeting long-time residents and workers an advantageous way to boost deportation numbers.

""Protection from deportation may expire for up to 2.7 million people within the next two years,"" according to a National Foundation for American Policy analysis. ""The vast majority face dismal prospects if forced to return to their birth countries, and obstacles in Congress mean legislation may not rescue even the most sympathetic groups.""

NFAP gathered the data from the Department of Homeland Security and other sources. The immigration programs and categories include Temporary Protected Status, humanitarian parole programs for Cubans, Venezuelans and others and the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, also known as DACA. Some individuals paroled into the United States, such as Ukrainians, could also hold TPS. The 2.7 million does not include individuals on Deferred Enforced Departure from Liberia, Hong Kong and elsewhere, participants in smaller parole programs or people who received parole at ports of entry.

Donald Trump stated he intends to implement mass deportations of immigrants without legal status that include ""sprawling camps."" Some have argued the plans will be difficult to implement. However, the existence and likely known whereabouts of millions of people who would lose protection from deportation during a second Trump administration adds credibility to the threat. Many of the up to 2.7 million people have lived in the United States for one to two decades or longer.

Economists have warned that reducing the supply of available workers through deportations or new immigration restrictions will harm U.S. workers and the economy. According to an analysis for the Peterson Institute for International Economics by George Mason University economics professor Michael Clemens, it is likely that for every one million unauthorized immigrant workers removed from the United States, 88,000 U.S.-born workers will be ""driven out of employment."" Deporting three million unauthorized immigrant workers per year ""would mean 263,000 fewer jobs held by U.S. native workers, compounded each additional year that mass deportations continue.""

Entrepreneurs will invest in fewer new businesses when ""hit by sudden reductions to labor supply,"" writes Clemens, and business owners will ""invest their capital in other industries and in technologies that use lower-skill labor less intensively, reducing demand for U.S. workers too."" Fewer immigrant workers will also shrink the demand for U.S.-born workers due to less consumer spending on ""grocery stores, leasing offices and other nontraded services."" According to the American Immigration Council, ""Due to the loss of workers across U.S. industries, we found that mass deportation would reduce the U.S. gross domestic product by 4.2% to 6.8%.""

Today, 863,880 people live in the United States under Temporary Protected Status, notes the Congressional Research Service. According to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, ""During a designated period, individuals who are TPS beneficiaries . . . are not removable from the United States; can obtain an employment authorization document; [and] may be granted travel authorization.""

TPS will expire in 2025 for 13 of the 16 countries, while the TPS designations for Haiti, Somalia and Yemen will end in 2026 unless extended. ""The Trump administration is likely to terminate most if not all new TPS designations in addition to not renewing prior designations,"" according to Elizabeth Carlson and Charles Wheeler, attorneys with CLINIC. Courts blocked attempts by Trump officials to eliminate TPS for at least 300,000 beneficiaries. However, the Ninth Circuit later vacated a lower court injunction, and legal avenues for helping people whose TPS designation has expired might prove fruitless in a second Trump administration.

Donald Trump has denounced Haitians as pet eaters and Venezuelans among migrants ""attacking villages and cities all throughout the Midwest,"" so expect the 200,005 Haitians and 344,355 Venezuelans currently living in America with TPS to be high priorities for deportation. In an interview with NewsNation (October 2, 2024), Trump said he would ""absolutely"" revoke TPS for Haitians and ""bring them back"" to Haiti. ""The Venezuelan government is unlikely to accept the return of its nationals, which would put the Trump administration in an unusual position if it ended the legal status of over 300,000 people but could not remove them from the United States,"" notes the NFAP analysis. More than 180,000 Salvadorans have lived in America with TPS since February 2001.

Trump has promised to end the humanitarian parole programs for several countries. According to data NFAP obtained from DHS, 528,000 individuals from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua and Venezuela arrived in America after the Biden administration approved them for the CHNV humanitarian parole program. As of August 31, 2024, there are 110,000 approvals for humanitarian parole for Cubans, 210,000 for Haitians, 92,000 for Nicaraguans and 116,000 for Venezuelans. The numbers represent differing migration patterns.

DHS has received more applications than the 30,000-monthly allotment, resulting in a selection process, which may have limited the program's effectiveness in reducing illegal immigration. Still, even with these restrictions, after the humanitarian parole programs began, Border Patrol encounters declined by 92% for Cubans, Haitians and Nicaraguans as a group between December 2022 (the month before the parole programs started) and November 2023 compared to an 18% increase for nationals of non-parole countries, according to an NFAP analysis. Illegal entry also declined for Venezuelans, although that was shorter-lived, likely due to the greater demand and other factors affecting Venezuelans.

Eliminating the humanitarian parole program will likely increase illegal entry, in part because of the expected response from Mexico. The Mexican government agreed to accept 30,000 migrants a month from the four countries if expelled after unlawfully entering America. ""Normally, these migrants would be returned to their country of origin, but the U.S. cannot easily send back people from those four countries for a variety of reasons that include relations with the governments there,"" noted PBS.

After the full-scale Russian invasion of Ukraine, Biden officials granted humanitarian parole to Ukrainians under a new program called Uniting for Ukraine. The United States also paroled Afghans following the fall of Kabul.

According to DHS, 651,000 Ukrainians have been approved for humanitarian parole in the United States: 221,000 from Uniting for Ukraine and an additional 430,000 other Ukrainians. Under Operation Allies Welcome, 77,000 Afghans came to America and were approved for humanitarian parole, along with approvals for an additional 56,000 Afghans. If a future administration does not allow them to remain paroled in the United States, the 651,000 Ukrainians and 133,000 Afghans could be subject to deportation unless they can live legally in the United States through other means, such as TPS or asylum.

The Biden administration provided a ""re-parole"" process for Ukrainians in February 2024 and Afghans in June 2023. If Kamala Harris wins in November, her immigration team could use a similar process for individuals in the CHNV program.

Voters have heard little lately about Dreamers, young people without legal status brought to America by their parents. According to DHS, there are 535,030 DACA recipients in the United States as of June 30, 2024. DACA recipients could be deported should the U.S. Supreme Court rule against them. The Biden administration has sought alternative ways for Dreamers to remain in the United States, such as qualifying for H-1B status. A Supreme Court ruling stopped Trump officials from removing current DACA recipients from the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.

During the vice-presidential debate on October 1, 2024, GOP candidate JD Vance said a second Trump administration would prioritize criminal aliens when attempting to deport millions of people living in the United States without legal status. Analysts point out that is unlikely to be the case and belies how bureaucracies work: Once numerical targets are set, immigration agents will go after the easiest people to find and deport.

Shaul Schwarz, a filmmaker on the six-part Netflix documentary Immigration Nation, had unprecedented access to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents during the Trump administration. ""I think we repeatedly saw a desire to get numbers,"" he said in an interview in 2020. ""I think anybody who works in ICE knows it, because it was kind of everywhere we went. . . . We definitely saw a lot of agents wanting to hit numbers.""

In other administrations, under normal practice, ICE agents focus on criminal aliens due to limited resources. Yet once an administration decides all undocumented immigrants should be deported, the priority on criminals will fade. ""We thought a number of times during this administration that the priorities had shifted to be that it's no longer just detaining egregious criminals, but there was a wider mandate to say that anybody here illegally could potentially be a target,"" said Schwarz.

Economists note that deporting individuals who have lived in America and worked for years will harm U.S. workers and the American economy. It would also upend the lives of millions of people who sought and were granted protection in the United States."

Last month, California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed three laws targeting election-related deepfake images and videos. The law temporarily blocked by Mendez Wednesday was Assembly Bill 2839, which made it illegal to distribute ""materially deceptive audio or visual media of a candidate"" 120 days before an election and in some cases, 60 days after. The law also allowed targeted candidates to seek a court order to pull down any deepfake ads and also sue the person who distributed them -- although parody and satire deepfakes disclosed as such were exempted. The two other laws, AB 2655 and AB 2355, are focused on online platforms and campaign groups' handling of such content respectively. However, unlike AB 2839, they will go into effect next year.

The judge said: ""While California has a valid interest in protecting the integrity and reliability of the electoral process, AB 2839 is unconstitutional because it lacks the narrow tailoring and least restrictive alternative that a content-based law requires under strict scrutiny.""

Shortly after the court's ruling, Elon Musk tweeted, ""California's unconstitutional law infringing on your freedom of speech has been blocked by the court."" Musk also congratulated Kohls, saying: ""Score one for the people's right to free speech."" In July, Musk -- who has endorsed former President Donald Trump's candidacy for the White House -- boosted Kohls' deepfake campaign video, which used AI-generated audio clips to mimic Harris' voice and described her as the ""ultimate diversity hire"" and a ""deep state puppet."" Musk's post promoting the video garnered more than 135 million views on X. The post drew an immediate reaction from Newsom, who vowed to sign legislation to crack down on political deepfakes, prompting a mocking response from Musk saying: ""parody is legal in America."" After Newsom passed the laws, Musk reshared the video and wrote: ""You're not gonna believe this, but Gavin Newsom, just announced that he signed a LAW to make parody illegal, based on this video.""

Monday's debate between Vance and Walz was largely considered civil and policy-focused. The candidates touched on topics including the economy, the Jan. 6, 2021 Capitol riot, health care, the southern border and abortion rights. Microphones were only cut once in a heated exchange after the moderators fact-checked Vance and he went on a tangent about the process for applying for an asylum appointment online following a discussion about migrants in Springfield, Ohio. An early poll from after the debate showed there was no clear winner: Forty-two percent of respondents to a CBS and YouGov poll said they felt Vance won and 41% felt Walz won, while 17% said it ended in a tie.

2.2. That's how many points Harris is leading Trump by as of Wednesday afternoon, according to RealClearPolitics' national polling average. FiveThirtyEight's national average has Harris leading Trump by 2.8 points.

Shortly after Walz and Vance's debate ended, Trump claimed on social media the Harris campaign ""just put out a request for another Debate"" and suggested the Democrats are seeking a rematch because Walz ""lost so badly tonight."" Trump reiterated in the post he does not plan to debate Harris a second time, adding: ""Votes are already cast - And I'm leading BIG in the Polls."" Harris' team suggested after she first debated Trump she would participate in a second debate, but did not publicly comment on Trump's claim Tuesday night."

Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, Democrat and running mate of Vice President Kamala Harris, squared off against Ohio Senator JD Vance, Republican and running mate of former President Donald Trump. Although they couldn't be more divergent in their positions, views, and political stances - none of which I will discuss here - they both seemed committed to a respectful debate. I've watched every debate since the first one - JFK versus Nixon in 1960 - and was more than delighted to see a return to civility on the debate stage, as rare as that has become.

Maybe it's just me, but I appreciate a good formal debate rather than a couple of combatants slinging around sound bites, platitudes, and bromides at will, with no or little respect for the rules and procedures, thinking that the one who screams the loudest ingest wins. That's reminiscent of the food fight in Animal House.

As a member of my high school debate club and intermural debate team¸ I've been watching - election after election for 64 years with hopes of seeing a good mutually respectful debate. There were some but not enough. Last night we got one.

Casting off, for a moment, the larger issues of rhetoric, context, and presentation because brevity rules here, making a winning argument that can be fairly adjudicated involves your claim 9what you are contending), warrants (reasons for your claims, and proof (evidence and logic to support your position). Both Walz and Vance complied, thereby precluding a brawl that erupts when one boxer fights by Marquess of Queensbury Rules and the other one doesn't - or if neither does.

Of course, strong enforcement of the rules of engagement is crucial, and with two brief but noticeable moments, Nora O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, both of CBS, provided exactly that. In one, Vance just wouldn't stop talking over an instruction to stop (time elapsed), and in the other, both candidates refused to give way. But in a 90-minute debate, we had 89 civil, respectful minutes.

By agreement on both sides, there was to be no fact checking going on, and it was glaring at times. But in keeping with my promise not to discuss politics, suffice to say it would have been nice - and practical.

But in the meantime, hats off. We had a real debate. It could have been more substantive at times, but it was a real debate"
Vance Suggests Health Insurance Changes Could Raise Premiums For Those With Pre-existing Conditions,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2024/10/02/vance-suggests-changes-to-health-insurance-that-may-raise-premiums-for-those-with-preexisting-conditions/,2024-10-02T18:24:55Z,"Update, Wednesday, Oct. 2: This article has been updated to include comments from the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate.

Memorably, former President Trump mentioned ""concepts of a plan"" when asked about his proposal to reform healthcare at last month's presidential debate. But in the days leading up to and during Tuesday's vice presidential debate, Trump's running mate, Sen. JD Vance, says there is a plan to ""fix healthcare,"" specifically with respect to the Affordable Care Act.

Vance has argued that the health insurance market needs to be deregulated. He has spoken of placing people with chronic conditions into separate insurance pools. But this could lead to insurers charging higher premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions.

During the Oct. 1 vice presidential debate, Vance appeared to walk back his previous statement a bit by saying he was referring to reinsurance, or a way in which the government could insulate itself from the risk of high-cost claims. He went on to state that Trump favors the idea of permitting ""states to experiment a little bit on how to cover both the chronically ill and non-chronically ill.""

Kamala Harris' campaign released a report on Monday that maintained that millions of people with preexisting conditions could lose protection guaranteed them by ACA rules if the changes Vance and Trump are proposing go through. Her running mate, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, emphasized that point at Tuesday's debate.

Vance responded that he and Trump plan to keep in place the existing laws and regulations protecting those with preexisting conditions. He did not, however, explain that those laws are within the ACA.

At the debate, Vance also defended Trump as having ""saved"" the ACA. But, as Walz pointed out, during his term in office, Trump sought to undo ACA by executive action, legislation and lawsuits. The law survived. And during Trump's bid to secure a second presidential term, he has wavered on the idea of whether to repeal the ACA.

Perhaps given the fact that the ACA is popular and growing in terms of enrollment and the uninsured rate is at an historic low, rather than do away with the ACA, Trump is now calling for what he describes as improvements in the law.

However, Vance is proposing substantial changes to ACA health insurance coverage that could lead to the elimination of the ACA's protection against insurers levying higher premiums on individuals in poor health.

Vance has spoken of deregulating the insurance market so that ""people can choose a plan that actually makes sense for them,"" as reported in The Hill. On the campaign trail in North Carolina last month, for instance, Vance suggested getting rid of the ACA's single-risk pool which enables community rating and introducing separate risk pools for people with chronic health conditions. This would disrupt one of the ACA's guiding principles which states that health insurers may not charge people higher premiums based on their health status.

KFF estimates that 27% of adults have a condition that would have led to denied coverage by an insurer in the individual market before the ACA. Prior to the law's passage, insurers were able to deny coverage for a wide range of diseases and conditions or charge substantially higher premiums for individuals with preexisting conditions.

Vance has said he wants to leave decisions on how to regulate what insurers do with the aforementioned high-risk insurance pools up to individual states. Subsequently, if certain states permit premium surcharges based on health status, people with preexisting conditions would theoretically have access to health insurance, but it could be unaffordable.

State high-risk pools could provide access to coverage to people with preexisting conditions as an alternative to the private insurance market. But whether such pools would be effective depends on adequate funding, which did not occur in the states that had instituted them before the ACA was enacted. And so these insurance pools were not a feasible option for many due to exorbitant premiums.

On the stump, Vance has also said ""we're going to actually implement some regulatory reform in the healthcare system that allows people to choose a healthcare plan that works for them. If you only go to the doctor once a year, you're going to need a different healthcare plan than somebody who goes to the doctor 14 times a year because they've got chronic pain or they've got some other chronic condition.""

Though it's unclear what in particular Vance has in mind for healthier individuals, maybe he's referring to short-term insurance plans, which the Trump Administration promoted and made more accessible. These options do not offer coverage as comprehensive as ACA plans. Some healthy people might have an incentive to opt for short-term insurance, which can be renewed every three to 12 months, as a way to lower premiums.

The problem is that this may drive up costs considerably for the sicker folks who remain on ACA exchange plans. Moreover, the idea of offering healthy individuals a cheaper plan with far less complete coverage tacitly presumes that people's health needs are static, which they often are not. Perhaps the most important aim of having health insurance is to provide financial protection from unforeseen events. The fact that a person only sees a doctor once now has no bearing on the future, whether that's next year or later.

Only 39% of survey respondents polled by KFF in February of this year were aware that the ACA prohibits insurers from denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions, and only 31% knew that the ACA also prevents sick people from being charged higher premiums than healthy individuals. In light of Vance's statements on ACA reform, it would seem important that the electorate be better informed about what the proposed changes could entail."

Biden announced the 1,000 soldiers just before he is set to visit North Carolina and South Carolina to survey the damage and meet with local leaders. Vice President Kamala Harris will visit Georgia on Wednesday.

Trump criticized the Biden administration's response to the hurricane Monday, alleging Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp was ""having a hard time getting the president on the phone"" -- despite Kemp saying he had spoken to the president -- leading Biden to say Trump was lying, and calling him ""irresponsible."" Trump also accused Harris of staging a photo on social media of her being briefed by FEMA about the storm because her headphones were not plugged into her phone. Forbes has reached out to the Harris campaign for comment on the allegation.

Hurricane Helene made landfall as a Category 4 storm in the Big Bend region of Florida on Thursday before moving northward. It brought ""historic and catastrophic flooding"" to the southern Appalachians. North Carolina had the most reported deaths from the storm of any state -- about 90 -- followed by South Carolina, Georgia and Florida, though there were also deaths in Tennessee and Virginia."
Does Project 2025 Plan A 'Registry Of Pregnancies'?

Tim Walz claimed at Tuesday's vice presidential debate that the right-wing policy agenda Project 2025 calls for a ""registry of pregnancies,"" repeating claims he's made on the campaign trail -- but that mischaracterizes the conservative proposal, which wants states to report detailed abortion, though not pregnancy, information to the government.

Get Forbes Breaking News Text Alerts: We're launching text message alerts so you'll always know the biggest stories shaping the day's headlines. Text ""Alerts"" to (201) 335-0739 or sign up here.

Vice President Kamala Harris described Project 2025's proposal more accurately in her speech at the Democratic National Convention, decrying that Republicans want to ""force states to report on women's miscarriages and abortions.""

In addition to monitoring abortions in a more comprehensive way, Project 2025's proposal also calls for the CDC to stop collecting data on gender identity -- part of a broader move away from the federal government supporting transgender rights -- claiming that collecting that data ""legitimizes"" arguments in favor of transgender rights ""and encourages the phenomenon of ever-multiplying subjective identities.""

Project 2025's policy agenda -- which broadly calls for a total overhaul of the executive branch if former President Donald Trump wins the election -- is overwhelmingly opposed to abortion, proposing a total focus by the federal government to push a pro-family agenda that rejects abortion rights. The agenda says HHS should be known as the ""Department of Life"" by ""explicitly rejecting the notion that abortion is health care"" and having a mission statement that protects Americans' well-being ""from conception to natural death."" Project 2025 broadly calls for restricting abortion, suggesting the Food and Drug Administration should rescind its approval of abortion drug mifepristone and the federal government should start enforcing the Comstock Act, a long-dormant 19th century law that would ban abortion pills and any abortion equipment from being sent through the mail.

It's unclear if Trump would take up Project 2025's proposals on abortion or other issues if he's elected. The ex-president has sought to distance himself from Project 2025 and its policy proposals as they've come under controversy, though he does have ties to the Heritage Foundation -- the group spearheading the agenda -- and could always take up its proposals if elected regardless of what he says while campaigning. Trump has said he wants to leave abortion up to the states and said he opposes a national abortion ban, but has not commented on any federal reporting of abortions in states where it is allowed. Vance, who has strong links to the Heritage Foundation, said only at the debate that ""certainly we won't"" create a ""federal pregnancy monitoring agency,"" but did not comment beyond that on any increased surveillance of abortions. Vance has called for banning abortion nationwide in the past -- even as he denied doing so at Tuesday's debate -- but has more recently said he backs Trump's view that it should be left to the states.

625,978. That's the number of U.S. abortions that were reported to the CDC in 2021, the most recent year for which data is available. The CDC already requests data including the pregnant person's age, state of residence, gestational age of the fetus, race, marital status, method of abortion and number of previous births and abortions, though Project 2025's proposals would add more data like why people got abortions and impose consequences if states don't report the data. The CDC's most recent data is from before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade and states started banning the procedure, though reports from non-governmental organizations suggest abortion rates have actually gone up despite the restrictions.

Polling shows that most Americans are broadly in favor of abortion rights and the issue has historically galvanized voters since the Supreme Court's June 2022 ruling, with a series of ballot measures all breaking in favor of abortion rights and races in which abortion has been a big focus often breaking in favor of Democrats. Trump has tried to minimize the issue and said he now supports leaving abortion rights up to states after previously floating support for a national 15-week ban, and Vance, who previously touted his anti-abortion views on his website prior to becoming Trump's nominee, has downplayed them since getting on the ticket. The senator said Tuesday he acknowledges Republicans have ""to do so much better of a job at earning the American People's trust back on this issue, where they frankly just don't trust us."" Democrats and the Harris campaign have also used Project 2025 as a key argument against Trump, repeatedly pointing to its extreme proposals as a key reason for voters to oppose the ex-president and insisting he will carry out its plans even as Trump has tried to distance himself."

Harris is receiving more support from younger, non-white and female voters -- demographics who showed indecision over their support for Biden before he dropped out -- according to a recent New York Times survey, which noted Harris had support from 84% of Black voters in the polls, a higher share of support than Biden had before withdrawing from the race in July.

Biden dropped out of the race on July 21, despite insisting he would continue his campaign amid an intraparty revolt in the wake of his June 27 debate performance. He immediately endorsed Harris, she announced plans to seek the nomination and officially became the nominee in the first week of August when 99% of delegates voted for her in a virtual roll call. Prior to Biden dropping out of the race, polls consistently found Trump would beat him in most battleground states, despite Biden winning six of the seven (with the exception of North Carolina) in the 2020 election.

The betting markets declared Vance the winner of the debate. On the crypto-based betting platform Polymarket, bookmakers believe Vance has a 73% chance of being judged the winner of Tuesday night's debate in post-debate opinion polls, compared to Walz's 27%. This is a complete inversion from before the debate, when bettors gave Walz a 70% chance of being declared the debate winner.

Bookmakers on the election betting markets gave former President Donald Trump's chances of winning a slight boost on Tuesday, but most of the shift occurred a few hours before the debate -- likely as a result of some favorable polling for the Republican in Georgia and North Carolina. Vice President Kamala Harris, however, holds a slight lead, with bookmarkers giving her a 50.3% chance of winning in November compared to 48.9%.

Trump Claims Harris 'Just' Requested Another Debate -- But Says Again He Won't Do It (Forbes)"
Bipartisan Support Builds For Strategic Bitcoin Reserve,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/02/bipartisan-support-builds-for-strategic-bitcoin-reserve/,2024-10-02T11:10:10Z,"So declared Senator Cynthia Lummis at Bitcoin Nashville in July when she unveiled legislation to create a strategic bitcoin reserve. Senator Lummis' bill would use existing funds at the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department to purchase 1 million bitcoin. The move would cement the United States' position as the largest nation-state holder of bitcoin, granting it five percent ownership of the entire network -- on par with the country's stake in the global gold supply.

Lummis' comparison to the Louisiana Purchase resonated with the pro-crypto crowd. In 1803, President Thomas Jefferson made an asymmetric bet by buying the Louisiana Territory -- one that paid asymmetric returns. Now in 2024, innovation-friendly policymakers see a similar opportunity in bitcoin.

On the same day Lummis released the details of her bill, former President Donald Trump outlined his own policy to create a ""national bitcoin stockpile"" and to ""never sell"" the roughly 200,000 bitcoin currently owned by the US government. President Trump also likened bitcoin to ""the steel industry of 100 years ago"" and vowed to make the United States ""the crypto capital of the planet.""

At the same conference, Robert F. Kennedy Jr. -- who has since suspended his presidential campaign and endorsed President Trump -- fleshed out an alternative strategic reserve plan to acquire 5 million Bitcoin, or approximately 25 percent of the global supply. Kennedy is now acting as an advisor and surrogate for President Trump on the campaign trail.

Support for a strategic bitcoin reserve has now crossed party lines. In a recent episode of the Unchained Podcast, Democratic Representative Ro Khanna, threw his support behind the idea: ""We want to make sure that we have the openness to having bitcoin as part of the Federal Reserve and as a reserve asset because of its potential for appreciation and because of its potential to allow America to set the financial standards.""

The bulk of bitcoin owned by the United States was confiscated from illicit actors. Typically, the US government would sell these funds back into the market. But in the case of bitcoin, Representative Khanna believes Uncle Sam should hold onto it. In a statement from the Congressman's office, he said, ""Bitcoin that has been seized by the US government should be used as a strategic reserve asset given its potential for appreciation.""

Representative Khanna has an outsize voice on crypto issues in the Democratic Caucus. In July, he helped spearhead a letter to the Democratic National Committee, which urged leaders to shed the ""perception that the party holds a negative view on digital assets."" In the same letter, Democrats encouraged party leaders to enact what has since been dubbed ""the crypto reset"" by including pro-digital asset language in the party platform, engaging with industry experts, and selecting a pro-innovation chair of the Securities and Exchange Commission (translation: Someone who isn't Gary Gensler).

But short of replacing the current SEC Chair, some advocates believe there is an even easier way to enact a ""crypto reset"" -- by supporting a strategic bitcoin reserve.

Dennis Porter is the CEO and co-founder of the Satoshi Action Fund, a nonprofit advocacy organization dedicated to educating lawmakers on the benefits of bitcoin. According to Porter, ""Supporting popular policy initiatives such as a strategic bitcoin reserve or the 'right to self-custody' would go a long way in helping Democrats secure the support of the new and rapidly growing Bitcoin voter base.""

Porter believes bitcoin partisanship is temporary and will subside as the asset matures. ""Across the political spectrum, there is consensus on the importance of a strategic gold reserve,"" said Porter. ""There is equal agreement on maintaining a strategic oil reserve. Now, both sides are recognizing the need for a strategic bitcoin reserve.""

Representative Khanna expressed a similar sentiment. ""You can't be against bitcoin or crypto,"" said the California Congressman. ""It's like saying 'I'm against the iPhone' or 'I'm against the laptop.' It's just a technology.""

Representative Khanna has been especially influential in encouraging Vice President Kamala Harris to adopt a pro-innovation stance on cryptocurrency. Thanks in large part to his advocacy, the Harris team recently released a policy document stating the campaign's desire to ""encourage innovative technologies like AI and digital assets."" And in a recent episode of the Coin Stories Podcast, Khanna said he is confident that -- in contrast to President Biden -- Vice President Harris will champion Bitcoin if she wins the White House in November.

Cody Carbone, the President of The Digital Chamber, considers a strategic bitcoin reserve to be a crucial component of the Democrats' ""crypto reset."" In an interview, Carbone said, ""There is an opportunity here for Democrats to shift from opposing bitcoin to leveraging its success and potential to advance party goals in financial equity and sustainable energy policy. And supporting a strategic bitcoin reserve is a good place to start.""

Like Carbone and Representative Khanna, Senator Cynthia Lummis also sees a bipartisan future for bitcoin. That's why she is urging both Republicans and Democrats to support her bill to create a strategic bitcoin reserve.

In a statement from her office, Lummis said, ""Although the Republican National Committee and President Trump have come out strong in support of bitcoin and digital assets, I would expect my colleagues across the aisle to join us in supporting digital assets, especially as it has become an incredibly important focus of the 2024 election.""

As I have written previously, the data shows that backing bitcoin is a good bet for members of both political parties. From an electoral perspective, there is massive upside to embracing digital assets and virtually no downside -- which makes it all the more likely that bipartisan support for a strategic bitcoin reserve will continue to grow."
"Vance-Walz Debate: Vance's 'Stolen Valor' Attack Against Walz's Military Record, Explained",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/01/vance-walz-debate-vances-stolen-valor-attack-against-walzs-military-record-explained/,2024-10-01T20:34:16Z,"Republican vice presidential nominee, Ohio Sen. JD Vance, has accused Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz of leaving the National Guard to avoid being deployed to Iraq -- a years-old claim that may resurface during Tuesday's debate, even though it lacks evidence and has long been disputed by Walz and some of his fellow guardsmen.

""When the United States of America asked me to go to Iraq to serve my country, I did it,"" Vance, a former Marine who was deployed to Iraq, said previously. ""When Tim Walz was asked by his country to go to Iraq ... he dropped out of the Army and allowed his unit to go without him.""

""After 24 years of military service, Governor Walz retired in 2005 and ran for Congress, where he chaired Veterans Affairs and was a tireless advocate for our men and women in uniform - and as Vice President of the United States he will continue to be a relentless champion for our veterans and military families,"" the Harris-Walz campaign said in statement.

In a New York Post interview published in August, Behrends suggested Walz falsely inflated his military rank by calling himself a command sergeant major throughout his political career, despite his rank being reduced to master sergeant since he retired before completing the terms of his promotion. Harris referred to Walz as ""Sgt. Maj. Walz"" while praising his background during their first campaign event together in August, hours after she announced him as her running mate. Minnesota National Guard spokesperson Capt. Holly Rockow told Minnesota Public Radio in 2018 it's fair to say Walz served as sergeant major since that was his rank at the time of his retirement in 2005, though it was retroactively reverted back to master sergeant because he retired before completing requirements associated with his promotion. Vance also criticized Walz for saying he carried a gun ""in war"" when there is no evidence Walz served in a combat zone. ""He said 'we shouldn't allow weapons that I used in war to be on America's streets,'"" Vance said of Walz. ""Well, I wonder, Tim Walz, when were you ever in war?"" Walz, while calling for gun controls in 2018 said ""we can make sure those weapons of war, that I carried in war, are only carried in war."" Walz was never deployed to a combat zone, but he would have carried a gun when he was deployed to Italy in 2003 to support U.S. operations in Afghanistan after 9/11. Harris campaign spokesperson Lauren Hitt told multiple outlets when the 2018 remarks resurfaced in August that Walz ""misspoke"" when he said he carried weapons ""in war.""

Walz -- a Nebraska native who later moved to Minnesota -- joined the Nebraska Army National Guard in 1981 and retired in 2005 as a master sergeant, according to Military.com, citing his military records and a statement from the Minnesota Guard. Walz responded to natural disasters and received several awards, including Nebraska Citizen Soldier of the Year in 1989. Walz simultaneously worked as a high school teacher and football coach during his time as a guardsman prior to his run for Congress in 2005.

Walz and Vance are set to face off Tuesday in their first debate hosted by CBS from New York City. The debate could be the last of the 2024 campaign cycle as Trump has said he won't debate Harris for a second time. Harris selected Walz after a rushed process to choose her running mate in the weeks following her entrance into the race, hoping he can appeal to midwestern voters in the crucial swing states of Wisconsin and Michigan. While the GOP has described Walz as a ""far-left lunatic,"" he developed a reputation as a centrist in Congress while representing a deep-red district for 12 years. He bucked his party to vote to hold former Obama Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress and to approve the Keystone XL pipeline, though he signed legislation often championed by progressives during his second term as governor.

Kamala Harris And Capitalism: What The Polls Say,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bowmanmarsico/2024/10/01/kamala-harris-and-capitalism-what-the-polls-say/,2024-10-01T19:48:07Z,"In her economic speech in Pittsburg last week, Vice President Kamala Harris declared, ""I am a capitalist."" Earlier, she had told Wall Street and fashion titans (capitalists all) in the Hamptons that ""I believe in capitalism, but capitalism is not working for most people."" Her supporters are touting a new ""middle-class capitalism."" Harris' recent declarations are no doubt intended to answer Donald Trump's repeated claims that she is a Marxist. But they also are intended to reassure the business community that she has shed her more progressive views about capitalism and free markets.

We're barely a decade removed from the infamous 59-day Occupy Wall Street demonstration in 2011, when protestors told us America's capitalist system was irretrievably broken. Yet polls taken before and after Occupy show Americans have been remarkably steady -- and modestly more positive than negative - in their opinions of capitalism.

A new NBC News poll provides strong evidence. In their September poll, 51% of registered voters had positive feelings about capitalism, virtually indistinguishable from their 2020 (52%), 2019 (50%) and 2018 (52%) polls. Between 18% and 25% said their views were negative and around two in ten were neutral. Hardly a full-throated endorsement, but positive nonetheless -- what Irving Kristol described in his 1978 book with the title Two Cheers for Capitalism.

There were familiar partisan and demographic differences in the poll, conducted by the bipartisan team of Public Opinion Strategies and Hart Research. Registered Republicans were much more positive about capitalism than Democrats (67% to 39%). Men were more supportive of capitalism than women, and older people much more so than younger ones, a familiar pattern in all recent polls. In the poll, 18-29 year old split roughly evenly, 38 to 35%. A larger 18-34 subgroup were slightly more positive, 40% to 33%. Sixty-one percent of those 65 and over were positive. Forty-three percent of white working-class voters compared to 60% white middle class had positive feelings.

In a 2022 Pew Research Center survey, 57% had a positive impression of capitalism and 39% a negative view, a modest decline from their 2019 poll. In 2022, 74% of Republicans and 46% of Democrats did. There were also significant disagreements about capitalism's strengths. More than twice as many Republicans as Democrats (56% to 21%) said the phrase ""gives all people an equal opportunity to be successful"" described capitalism extremely or very well. Conversely, Democrat were much more likely (62%) than Republicans (38%) to disagree that capitalism makes sure everyone's basic needs are met.

In six Gallup polls between 2010 and 2021, there was also little movement in views about capitalism. In 2010, 61% of Americans had a positive image of capitalism, as did 60% in 2021. A solid majority of Republicans in the 2021 poll had a positive image compared to a bare majority of Democrats. The Millennials/Gen Z subgroup's view of capitalism had slipped from 66% positive in 2010 to 51% eleven years later. In a compilation of their five polls between 2010 to 2019, solid majorities of Gen Xers and Boomers/Traditionalists gave it solid majority support. It's unclear whether this skepticism is permanent for young people or whether they age out of their more negative views.

In 2022, Fox News asked registered voters if the US was moving away from capitalism and toward socialism. Fifty-four percent said it was, while 38% disagreed. Those results were in line with their 2021 poll (51% to 39%) and their 2010 one (56% to 34%).

Another question asked whether it be a good for bad thing for the US to move away from capitalism and toward socialism. In 2010, 23% said it would be a good thing and 65% a bad thing. The ""good thing"" response has been inching up, with around a third agreeing in both 2019 and 2022. In the 2022 poll, 53% of Democrats, 24% of independents, and 14% of Republicans said this would be a good thing.

Given extensive discussions of inequality, wealth concentration, and government expansion in recent years, the steadiness of the modest positive opinions about capitalism may seem surprising. Kristol argued that giving three cheers for any social, economic, or political system was a ""misplaced enthusiasm"". He argued that a capitalist order needs to have a ""keen sense of its own limitations."" The public seems to agree."
"Tuesday, October 1. Russia's War On Ukraine: News And Information From Ukraine",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/katyasoldak/2024/10/01/tuesday-october-1-russias-war-on-ukraine-news-and-information-from-ukraine/,2024-10-01T19:09:12Z,"On Tuesday, October 1, the Russian military attacked residential areas and infrastructure facilities in Zaporizhzhia. In the evening, the estimated number of victims raised to 32, including three children aged 9, 10, and 12, with one person confirmed dead.

Russian forces unleashed 10 glide bombs on residential areas in the city of Zaporizhia on September 29, wounding 16 civilians. The region continues to suffer frequent attacks. Two years ago, Russian forces killed 32 people in a strike on convoys of cars near a checkpoint to the occupied territories, the deadliest attack in the region's recent history.

Sumy region. On the morning of September 28, Russia launched a brutal two-step strike on yet another medical facility, this time in Sumy, killing 10 and wounding 22. As rescue teams responded to the initial hit, Russia struck the site again, killing a police officer. In July, Russian forces attacked Okhmatdyt, one of Eastern Europe's largest children's hospitals specializing in cancer treatment.

Kharkiv region. A Russian FPV (first-person view) drone strike on September 28 killed 61-year-old Supreme Court judge Leonid Loboyko in the village of Kozacha Lopan, just two miles from the Russian border, as he was delivering humanitarian aid. Three women in the car were also wounded in the attack. In the past month, Kharkiv has suffered a record number of airstrikes since 2023, with 53 attacks recorded, marking the most intense period of bombardment by Russian forces this year.

Kherson region. On October 1, Russian forces launched a deadly strike on a bus station near an open-air market in the region, killing at least six civilians and wounding six others. The incident follows another strike just two days earlier that killed four civilians and left 10 wounded.

Donetsk region. Russian forces in the Donetsk region reportedly have captured two villages and are close to taking Vuhledar, a hilltop town considered a vital stronghold for Ukraine. Ukrainian troops in the town, which had a pre-war population of 14,000, are surrounded and have been attempting for days to slip away in the face of heavy Russian artillery and drone attacks that have prevented the arrival of reinforcements.

World.

Following recent meetings with U.S. leaders, President Zelenskyy asserts that Ukraine is making progress toward receiving Western approval for long-range strikes into Russian territory. In an interview with Fox News, Zelenskyy expressed optimism about the ongoing discussions, stating that Ukraine has presented a victory plan to U.S. President Joe Biden and also spoke with Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump. ""We are closer to obtaining this permission,"" he said, emphasizing that the decision now rests with Ukraine's international partners.

Germany, which also has long-range weapons, currently refuses to provide Ukraine Taurus missiles, which have a range of 300 miles. Although German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock supports Ukraine's request for these missiles, Chancellor Olaf Scholz remains opposed.

Ukraine has requested such weapons as an essential element in making a breakthrough in the war. U.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken recently acknowledged that the Biden administration is ""closely evaluating"" Zelenskyy's proposed victory plan while considering ""additional options"" to bolster Ukraine's efforts against Russian aggression.

Ukrainian president retains ambassador to the U.S. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has declined to discuss the immediate dismissal of Ukraine's ambassador to the U.S., Oksana Markarova, following a request from U.S. House Speaker Mike Johnson. In an interview with Fox News, Zelenskyy said that such discussions can be held only with the speaker of Ukraine's parliament, not foreign politicians.

Ukraine's constitution, cited by Zelenskyy in support of his stance, gives the President the authority to appoint or dismiss ambassadors upon the recommendation of the Minister of Foreign Affairs. Johnson called for Markarova's removal last week for her alleged role in organizing Zelenskyy's visit to a Pennsylvania munitions plant, where Democratic officials, but no Republican representatives, were present.

Denmark is set to invest nearly $650 million in Ukraine's military industry, with more than two-thirds of the funding derived from profits from frozen Russian assets. Denmark in April was the first country to commit to allocating almost $30 million for purchasing weapons from Ukrainian manufacturers for Ukraine. Although the national state budget amounts to only $6 billion, the Ukrainian military industry is capable of producing weapons worth $20 billion per year. That is why Ukraine seeks to attract an additional $10 billion for domestic arms procurement through the ZBROYARI program, according to Forbes Ukraine. Several nations, including the Netherlands, Canada, the United Kingdom and Lithuania,, as well as the European Union, have joined Denmark in supporting the initiative with contributions of $750 million to the program.

New Russian draft. Russian President Vladmir Putin has ordered the conscription this autumn of 133,000 servicemen. The new troops, aged 18 to 30 years, will serve a standard term of 12 months. According to the head of the national draft service, the latest conscripts will serve only in Russia, not in Ukraine.

National.

In September alone, Russia launched a record-breaking 1,339 long-range Iranian Shahed drones, of which Ukrainian defenses shot down nearly 1,100. Russian forces just last week launched 900 glide bombs, 300 Shahed drones and more than 40 missiles. Russia produces more than 500 Shaheds per month, according to Forbes Ukraine.

The cultural effects of the war have been devastating: Russia has destroyed or damaged nearly 1,000 libraries, leading to the loss of more than 200 million Ukrainian books. On May 23, a Russian missile struck Vivat's Faktor-Druk printing house, which printed almost 40% of the books in Ukraine, resulting in the deaths of seven workers, injuries to 22 others and approximately 50,000 books burned. Despite the losses, the printing company resumed production in mid- September. During an official visit to the U.S. last week, Ukrainian First Lady Olena Zelenska presented books damaged in the attack, as a symbol of Ukraine's cultural losses in the war, to the Harvard University library.

Ukrainian artist Petro Antyp has set a new national record with Cosmogony, the largest painting in Ukraine, displayed at the Korsak Museum of Contemporary Ukrainian Art in Lutsk. Spanning more than 215 square feet and consisting of more than 500 pieces, the artwork carries viewers into a universe of existential reflection, symbolizing the birth of stars and galaxies, while raising a question of humanity's place within the boundless cosmos.

More than a masterpiece of artistic expression, Antyp's work is a symbol of cultural resilience. Originally from the Donetsk region, the artist was forced to move both in 2014 and eight years later from the small town of Vasylkiv near Kyiv. Following Russia's full-scale invasion in 2022, he co-founded SaveCultureUA to protect Ukraine's cultural heritage, ensuring that the spirit of Ukrainian art will endure even in times of conflict."
How The Accountant Shortage Impacts CFOs And Financial Hires,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/10/01/how-the-accountant-shortage-impacts-cfos-and-financial-hires/,2024-10-01T16:48:57Z,"This is the published version of Forbes' CFO newsletter, which offers the latest news for chief finance officers and other leaders focused on the budget. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox every Tuesday.

Driving technology, embracing of the strategic importance of a company's financial functions and an emphasizing corporate sustainability are all transforming the CFO's job. But they're also reshaping other jobs in a company's financial operations. A new report from EY zooming in on the financial controller's position found that 86% of people in that role expect significant changes in their career in the next five years. The majority of controllers told EY they expect their role to shift from one focused on value protection -- paying attention to internal controls and regulatory compliance -- to one that looks for value creation -- using technology, strategy and data to find new opportunities and recommend new policies.

""The controller of the future will be a trusted partner to the CFO right across the transformation spectrum,"" Mike Verbeck, EY Global deputy vice chair for Assurance, said in the report. ""They will create value in their capacity as analysts, collaborators, innovators, storytellers and leaders of talented teams, as well as in their capacity as accounting and compliance experts.""

The report makes clear that this is seen as a natural evolution of the controller's role, fitting with how most companies utilize their financial teams in the foreseeable future. But it's also clear that the report found technology -- including AI -- gives the controller the ability to pivot toward more of a focus on strategy and opportunity. The report found that nearly nine in 10 controllers already use AI, which is powerful on two fronts. It can do many of the basic tasks controllers spend their time on now, and also leverage data to find powerful insights.

EY suggests that controllers take advantage of the opportunity to look for value-creation opportunities by embracing data and AI and inspiring team members to see themselves as problem solvers. CFOs should empower their controllers, and also provide training in future-focused skills that build on technology use and responsibilities to climb the ranks at a company. And the CFO should also focus on an innovative and transformational spirit in potential new hires to work under the controller.

Regardless of how financial roles are created and recruited, the entire financial sector is struggling to find talent. Many college students today aren't pursuing accounting degrees, and even fewer are becoming CPAs. That makes recruiting for any financial position harder, from junior-level to CFOs. I spoke with Keith Giarman, president of the private equity and principal investing practice at executive search firm DHR Global, about how this shortage is impacting things right now. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

Forbes is compiling its first-ever list of best-in-state CPAs, and nominations are now open. You can find all the details and submit a nomination here.

Unionized port workers on the East Coast began their first strike in more than 45 years at 12:01 a.m. Tuesday, stopping trade traffic at ports in Baltimore; Boston; Charleston, South Carolina; Jacksonville, Florida; Miami; Houston; Mobile, Alabama; New Orleans; New York/New Jersey; Norfolk, Virginia; Philadelphia; Savannah, Georgia; Tampa, Florida; and Wilmington, Delaware. About 45,000 union members represented by the International Longshoremen's Association want a wage increase of 77% and a ban on new automation as part of their new contract with the United States Maritime Alliance (USMX), the organization that represents shipping companies. West Coast port workers earn over $30,000 a year more than their East Coast counterparts. Union members are refusing to meet with the USMX until their wage demands are met.

The strike could have fast and far-reaching impacts on the U.S. economy, with some analysts projecting it costing $3.8 billion to $4.5 billion a day. If the strike continues for long enough, it could impact consumer prices and the availability of goods. President Biden has urged the two sides to resolve the issue quickly and fairly, sending Chief of Staff Jeff Zients and National Economic Council Director Lael Brainard to meet with USMX on Monday. While Biden can defer the strike for 80 days through the Taft-Hartley Act, he said over the weekend he will not ""because it's collective bargaining.""

While West Coast ports remain open, Boeing machinists remain on strike. The 33,000 unionized employees at the aerospace manufacturer's Pacific Northwest facilities rejected Boeing's ""best and final offer"" last week. From the union's social media posts, the sticking point appears to be the reinstatement of Boeing's pension plan, which the company did away with in favor of a 401(k) plan in 2014, according to Quartz. It's unclear from media reports what's happening currently with negotiations, but according to KING5, Boeing released a statement Monday saying it is ""committed to resetting our relationship with our represented employees and negotiating in good faith and want to reach an agreement as soon as possible. We are prepared to meet at any time.""

The interest rate cut that everyone was waiting for happened last month. And yet there's already lots of talk about how big the next one will be at the Federal Reserve policy-making committee's next meeting in November. (According to CME FedWatch, as of Tuesday morning, 38.4% of economists project another half-percentage point cut.) This isn't just a case of impatient analysts and investors, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. After the rate cut was announced, yields on the 10-year Treasury note increased. These notes are the basis for interest rates on things including mortgages, auto loans and corporate borrowing -- meaning financing might not be getting cheaper after all.

There are many reasons for Treasury yields to be increasing, some benign and some ominous. Some analysts say investors had already priced in the rate cut, especially since its yields are down compared with earlier this summer. But CNBC spoke with analysts who see uncertainty through the federal deficit and the Fed's willingness to cut interest rates, even with inflation a bit higher than the 2% it sees as tolerable. On Friday, reports showed the Personal Consumption Expenditures Index -- the Fed's preferred inflation gauge -- to be at 2.2% in August.

The stock market on the whole is responding well, however. The first nine months of 2024 were the S&P 500's best start to a year since 1997, writes Forbes' Derek Saul. The S&P's year-to-date gain is 20.3%, and the other markets have also fared well this year: The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 12% in the first three quarters of 2024, and the Nasdaq is up 20%. Buoying the markets so far are last month's interest rate cuts -- insurers, home builders and utilities saw some of the best returns in recent months -- and optimism-fueled AI stocks.

Last week, the Chinese government announced several broad measures to boost its economy, which has been sputtering and looks unlikely to meet its government's annual growth target. The multi-pronged effort includes an interest rate cut from China's central bank, a potential capital injection into its biggest banks to increase lending capacity and governmental economic stimulus, reports Forbes' Derek Saul. Chinese stocks traded on U.S. markets rallied on the news and have continued to trade higher.

However, the rally -- and any benefit to China-based businesses -- may be short-lived for those in the U.S. In a note on Monday, JPMorgan Chase strategists said that if Donald Trump wins the presidential election, it's likely to slow down. Trump has campaigned on strict trade policies toward China, including a tariff of 60% or more on all Chinese goods, phasing out imports of essential goods and revoking China's most favored nation trade status. Vice President Kamala Harris has said in her campaign that she wants to enact policies that ensure the U.S. keeps its economic foothold above China, but she has not presented anything specific that is as restrictive. Analysts believe Harris will continue the Biden administration's approach of more targeted Chinese economic policies, including limiting imports and exports from high-tech industries.

As the nature of work has changed and new fields related to finance have cropped up, there's been a shortage of accountants on all levels -- especially with fewer young people opting for accounting degrees, and even fewer choosing to work at traditional firms and pursue the CPA path. This has immediate and potential long-term implications for finance departments and CFOs. I talked to Keith Giarman, president of private equity and the principal investing practice at executive search firm DHR Global, about what it means. This conversation has been edited for length, clarity and continuity.

It's hard to find the right talent today. What are companies doing to keep the talent they have?

Giarman: A lot of the compensation has gone north. It is a different level skill set that [companies] are asking for. There are a few [qualified employees], and they know that. They know that their price tag and their market value have gone up. Especially in private equity, where they've got a hopefully three-year timeline to improve operations and sell a company, they have to have the absolute best and invest in that role. They're working with the CFO more than the CEO.

For everybody else [in finance], if you accept my logic, there's fewer of them. Whether it's somebody running FP&A or somebody lower down in the organization, you've got to pay up.

That doesn't fix it, though, because people come for more than money. [Companies] have to create great working environments and be more flexible, including remote [work]. As a company, we have the same challenges. We've tried to create an environment for our research and associate staff where we emphasize things like wellness and the things that the younger generation wants to focus on and feel good about in terms of the community they're building around them. If you're not doing those other soft HR things, all the money in the world isn't going to make a difference. They'll stay for a couple of years, and they'll go.

Much of the attention of the accountant shortage is focused on lower-level employees. Are you seeing related challenges with recruiting CFOs?

The answer is a very loud yes, with an exclamation point. The CFOs who will make the cut, where the client will not bend on the requirements, seems like [there are] fewer and fewer as we move along.

It's also dependent on the cycle of the market. CFOs have been in assets in private equities for a while. We're finally starting to see the Fed lower interest rates. There could be some exit liquidity opportunity in a year or two. If more transactions are getting done, there's more folks who have proven themselves: They're able to flourish in these environments and get the job done. We haven't been in that for the last 12 to 24 months.

When we do a CFO search today, something that might've taken 90 days can take 180. There's a timing issue with candidates. There's a compensation issue. There's a flexibility issue in terms of where they are in the investment cycle, too, because if you're going to sell the company in two years, are you going to expect somebody to move their entire family on a plane three hours away?

The good news is at that level, you're thinking about wealth creation and longer-term things that take care of your family and your career. You're even more disposed to the financial element of the opportunity, and you're willing to put in the hard work to get it. If [companies] can make the numbers work and people can see a path to the end zone, there's a better chance you're going to land those bigger fish, and they're going to stick.

What does the future look like for this shortage?

The thing that's going to make it better is selling a bunch of companies, where good people free up. There's $8 trillion of private equity money floating around out there, and a lot of that's in companies that have CFOs that are waiting to exit. [After interest rates drop enough to restart more dealmaking, probably in 2025], that's when you're going to see more IPOs. You're going to see more deals, you're going to see more M&A. The people that are really good, there's going to be more freed up that you can get access to. They're going to be looking for their next great CFO opportunity.

How Tim Walz Lost The NRA's Support On Guns: VP Candidate's Views Explained Before Tonight's Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/01/how-tim-walz-lost-the-nras-support-on-guns-vp-candidates-views-explained-before-tonights-debate/,2024-10-01T16:20:00Z,"Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz may be asked about his evolved record on gun legislation at Tuesday's vice presidential debate, as the congressman-turned-governor went from a former darling of the National Rifle Association to one of its foes after vocally supporting restrictions.

Vance will face off Tuesday against Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, in Philadelphia, at the vice presidential debate, marking the first time the two politicians have gone head to head.

""I know guns as well as anyone else in this room ... I know that there's no place for weapons of war in our schools, or in our churches, or in our banks, or anywhere else people are just trying to live their lives without fear,"" Walz said in his State of the State address in 2023. ""I got an A rating from the NRA my first term in Congress. Now I get straight F's. And I sleep just fine.""

Walz is still a hunting enthusiast. The governor tweeted a photo of a yard full of turkeys in August, writing, ""For the past few years I've not seen a turkey while hunting. Today they mock me.""

Unlike Walz, Vance has been vocally opposed to restrictions on guns, with the NRA describing the senator as ""a true Second Amendment champion"" when he was named former President Donald Trump's running mate. Vance has consistently pushed for weaker gun regulations in the Senate, co-sponsoring legislation that would expand concealed carry, increase rights for licensed gun owners who commit violations and oppose a federal rule that expanded when gun sellers must be licensed and conduct background checks, among other measures. Prior to becoming a senator, Vance authored an op-ed in 2021 in which he argued ""the Biden Administration's dull attempts to curb gun violence don't work and they threaten the very foundation of the rights we are afforded as free, American citizens."" Describing the ""unholy alliance"" between government and business in trying to restrict gun ownership, Vance wrote the efforts ""won't stop at the Second Amendment. Eventually, they'll come for other cherished American liberties, too.""

Harris named Walz as her vice presidential pick in August, after the Minnesota governor was one of a number of Democrats floated for the job, along with Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., and Kentucky Gov. Andy Beshear. Originally from Nebraska, Walz served in the Army National Guard and was a school teacher for many years prior to entering politics, teaching social studies along with serving as a football coach and overseeing the school's Gay-Straight Alliance. Republicans have decried Walz, who had been viewed as a moderate earlier in his political career, as pushing the Harris ticket further left, with the Trump campaign claiming in a statement that by picking Walz, ""Kamala Harris not only bent the knee to the radical left, she doubled down on her dangerously liberal, weak, and failed agenda."" Walz's addition to the Democratic ticket came after a series of major gun control reforms failed to pass Congress following a slew of mass shootings that have taken place in recent years, with Republicans remaining opposed to reforms, and as the Supreme Court has opened the doors to more challenges against gun control measures."

JD Vance, R-Ohio is likely to be asked at Tuesday's vice presidential debate about comments he made denouncing Vice President Kamala Harris and others as ""childless cat ladies"" who don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future, which reflects a worldview that has affected Vance's policy views as he stands to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.

Vance will face off against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. The debate comes as the Harris campaign and Walz -- a cat owner himself -- have repeatedly highlighted Vance's ""childless cat ladies"" comments on the campaign trail. Walz has posted videos with cats and said when Taylor Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, ""It's not as if I didn't warn these guys a few months ago: You mess with cat people, you will find out."" The governor attacked Vance for his comments even before he was named Harris' running mate in August, criticizing the senator for apologizing to cats instead of women for his comments and telling MSNBC, ""My god, they went after cat people ... It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.""

In comments to right-wing journalist Megyn Kelly about his ""childless cat ladies"" comments going viral, Vance said his remarks were ""obviously ... a sarcastic comment"" and he has ""nothing against cats,"" but defended his broader views. ""People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance ... and the substance of what I said, Megyn -- I'm sorry, it is true,"" Vance said.

Vance's views that emphasize the importance of married families with children echo views espoused by the Heritage Foundation, a private right-wing organization with close ties to Vance that's recently come under fire for its 900-page policy agenda for a second Trump presidency known as ""Project 2025."" The Heritage Foundation has publicly called for ""encouraging marriage at the front end of a woman's childbearing years"" in order to increase the birth rate, and Project 2025 heavily emphasizes the importance of the nuclear family and imposing policies that strengthen it. The policy blueprint calls for ending ""LGBTQ equity"" initiatives and others in the Department of Health and Human Services and ""replacing such policies with those encouraging marriage, work, motherhood, fatherhood, and nuclear families,"" for instance, along with restricting abortion rights and eliminating federal healthcare mandates around contraception coverage. About the Heritage Foundation's proposals, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk told Forbes, ""The views of any outside group have zero effect on JD's policy positions -- full stop."" Vance's office also directed Forbes to comments Vance has made noting Project 2025 has no affiliation with the Trump campaign and saying he thinks ""there's some good ideas in there"" and ""there's some things that I disagree with.""

Vance's comments denouncing ""childless cat ladies"" have drawn widespread condemnation from the left, particularly from female voters. Actress Jennifer Aniston said in an Instagram post she ""truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States."" Addressing Vance, she added ""I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day."" Swift's post endorsing Harris was accompanied by a photo of the singer holding her own cat. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., also criticized Vance on X, saying she is a ""proud mom"" of stepchildren -- like Harris -- and she and husband Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., were trying to conceive through in vitro fertilization before she was shot in 2011. ""To suggest we are somehow lesser is disgraceful,"" Giffords said. While Harris has not commented on his attacks directly, her stepdaughter Ella Emhoff posted an Instagram story saying, ""How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I,"" referring to her brother. ""I love my three parents,"" she added. Harris also garnered a significant amount of high-profile support from female voters in her campaign's opening days as Vance's comments first went viral, with more than 100,000 women joining a Zoom call Thursday to support the Harris campaign and fans of Taylor Swift mobilizing for the vice president.

How Vance's policy views would actually affect a potential Trump presidency. The vice presidential candidate is likely to fall in line with Trump's chosen policy agenda, and the ex-president has publicly espoused more moderate positions than Vance on issues like abortion, calling for the issue to be left up to the states. (Abortion rights advocates believe he may take harsher action if elected, however.) Trump has also publicly distanced himself from Project 2025 and its more extreme proposals, though many involved with his first presidential administration helped author the policy agenda.

Trump named Vance as his vice presidential candidate on July 15 as the Republican National Convention was underway, siding with allies like son Donald Trump Jr., who had pushed for Vance to be the nominee over more moderate choices like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022 and was previously best known as the author of memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy."" He notably spoke out against Trump in the 2016 election before he ultimately claimed his views had changed and he now strongly supports the ex-president. Trump's selection of Vance has come under increasing scrutiny as his more extreme views have gone viral and as President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and Harris replaced him, shaking up a contest that polling previously suggested could go more easily for Trump. The vice presidential candidate has struggled in the polls, with a FiveThirtyEight analysis finding he is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential nominee since at least 2004, and The Hill reported even some House Republicans denounced him as Trump's running mate."

Vance and Walz are set to debate in Philadelphia Tuesday night, their first time going head-to-head in the presidential election. The debate comes as Walz and the Harris campaign have used Project 2025 as a main line of attack against Trump and Vance, holding its extreme proposals up as a key reason for voters to oppose Trump's candidacy. Walz has repeatedly mentioned Project 2025 while campaigning and tied Vance to it, saying at a September rally, ""My opponent, Senator Vance ... said that when they get power and they will use the Project 2025, they need to be ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power."" (Walz was falsely citing a quote from 2021 -- before Project 2025 was written -- in which Vance, who was not yet a senator, told a conservative publication that conservatives ""really need to be really ruthless when it comes to the exercise of power."") Vice President Kamala Harris brought the issue up when she debated Trump in September, calling Project 2025 ""a detailed and dangerous plan ... that the former president intends on implementing if he were elected again."" The Harris campaign also updated the policy section of its website last month with information on Project 2025, with Harris' policies on a range of issues each accompanied by a section that contrasts the vice president's views with Project 2025.

Trump has denied any connection to Project 2025, claiming on Truth Social last week that he has ""nothing to do with them,"" has ""no idea"" who's behind the plan and finds some of its ideas ""absolutely ridiculous and abysmal."" His campaign advisor Chris LaCivita has also denounced it, calling the effort a ""pain in the ass."" But many aren't buying the ex-president's claims: The team behind Project 2025 includes 140 people who worked for Trump in his administration, according to CNN, including six former Cabinet secretaries and four people he nominated as ambassadors. Trump has also seemingly endorsed Heritage's policy work in the past, saying at a 2022 dinner for the Heritage Foundation that the group was ""going to lay the groundwork and detail plans for exactly what our movement will do ... when the American people give us a colossal mandate.""

Experts have warned Project 2025's proposals could have seismic impacts on how the federal government operates if carried out. In an article for Justia, criminal defense attorney and former prosecutor John May suggested Project 2025's language endorsing the executive branch being able to ""restrain the excesses"" of the judicial branch and Congress means ""if the President wants to, the President can defy any decision of the Supreme Court, any legislation by Congress, maybe even the act of impeachment and removal from office.""

The main team behind Project 2025 includes director Paul Dans and former Trump White House personnel leaders Spencer Chretien (who also served as Trump's special assistant) and Troup Hemenway, according to the project's website. Other groups listed as participating in the project include ex-Trump adviser Stephen Miller's America First Legal, legal group Alliance Defending Freedom, Liberty University, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America and Turning Point USA. The 900-page policy agenda was co-authored by a series of conservative figures, with chapters penned by such Trump allies as former Housing Secretary Dr. Ben Carson, former Deputy Homeland Security Secretary Ken Cuccinelli, former HHS Civil Rights Director Roger Severino and former Trump advisor Peter Navarro, who went to prison in March for contempt of Congress. The Heritage Foundation confirmed July 30 that Dans was stepping down and leaving the organization, saying in a statement he was ""moving up to the front where the fight remains."" The Daily Beast reports Dans resigned amid pressure from the Trump campaign, though the Heritage Foundation said only that it had always intended its ""policy drafting"" work to only last through the party conventions, ""and we are sticking to that timeline."" The Heritage Foundation denied reports Project 2025 is shutting down, and said its personnel efforts would continue.

Trump will not be under any obligation to follow Project 2025's proposals if he wins the presidency, though history suggests he'll listen to at least some of them. The Heritage Foundation made a similar policy proposal for Trump ahead of his presidency in 2016, and boasted two years into his tenure that Trump had already followed 64% of its recommendations, CBS News notes.

One area that Project 2025 doesn't touch on is Social Security benefits and any potential cuts to the program, even as proposals outline changes to numerous other government ""entitlements."" Changing Social Security and making cuts to its spending has been a priority for the GOP for decades, though the American public has long opposed slashing benefits. Republicans' efforts have waned under Trump, however, and the ex-president publicly claimed in March he ""will never do anything that will jeopardize or hurt Social Security or Medicare,"" after he came under fire for suggesting otherwise in an interview with CNBC.

While much of Project 2025's policy agenda concerns federal agencies, the proposal has also gotten attention for its call to outlaw all pornography, which it claims is tied to ""the omnipresent propagation of transgender ideology and sexualization of children"" and is not protected under the First Amendment. Project 2025 calls not only for pornography to be made illegal, but also for anyone involved with its production and distribution to be imprisoned, for any librarians or educators who ""purvey it"" to be registered as sex offenders and for telecommunications and technology firms that facilitate its distribution to be shut down.

The Heritage Foundation's practice of laying out a policy roadmap for a future Republican administration actually dates back to the Reagan era, founder Edwin J. Feulner noted in the afterword of the 2025 edition. The organization first laid out a blueprint in 1981 that President Ronald Reagan ultimately adopted, fulfilling half of its recommendations by the end of his first year in office. The Heritage Foundation has continued to come out with blueprints for potential conservative presidents each election since, it notes, and its 2025 Mandate for Leadership was published in 2023. While it came out last year, Project 2025 gained new attention in the past week since Trump disavowed it -- sparking a wave of reports highlighting his ties to the figures behind the project that debunk his claims. Democrats have also used the controversial proposal as a key talking point and argument for why the left should unite behind President Joe Biden and focus on defeating Trump, particularly as Biden's candidacy came under widespread scrutiny in the wake of the president's poor debate performance in June, sparking his decision to drop out of the race."
A Faux 'October Surprise' -- How Misinformation Could Upend The Election,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/petersuciu/2024/10/01/a-faux-october-surprise-how-misinformation-could-upend-the-election/,2024-10-01T14:08:23Z,"As we head into the final weeks before Election Day, the political campaigns are likely bracing for an unexpected ""October Surprise"" that could influence voters and impact the results. The term was first coined by William Casey, who served as campaign manager for Ronald Reagan during the 1980 presidential campaign, yet, there have been October election-upending events going back to the 19th century.

What Casey and his predecessors likely never expected was how misinformation -- and even disinformation -- could be employed to sway voters. Advances in technology like Deep Fakes, an overreliance on social media for news and information, and foreign actors who seek to undermine confidence in our elections have created a perfect storm for such a nightmare scenario.

Nearly eight years ago, a video of then-candidate and now-former President Donald Trump surfaced in which he bragged about grabbing women by their genitals. It was an ""October surprise"" that almost derailed his campaign. Four years later, Trump contracted Covid-19 and was forced to cancel a debate with then-candidate Joe Biden and stop all campaigning.

With just weeks to go until Election Day, there could be a similar surprise -- and perhaps even a made-up one. Yet, the consequences could be huge.

""When Hillary Clinton recently warned Kamala Harris about the threat of an October surprise, she knew what she was talking about. Remember James Comey, just 11 days before the 2016 election? That turned out to be a nothing burger -- and Comey was rebuked in subsequent investigations for his actions. Or Pizzagate? That, too, turned out to be false,"" said Susan Campbell, distinguished lecturer in the College of Arts & Sciences at the University of New Haven.

""This year, voters must be on guard for the biggest threat to a free and fair election: Misinformation. They must steel themselves against lies and distortions, particularly on social media,"" added Campbell. ""Recently, an army of bots and trolls took to X(witter) to say that the federal government had not done enough to help the people harmed by Hurricane Helene, which was false.""

The spread of misinformation and disinformation during an election season isn't new and actually dates back to the country's founding. Smithsonian magazine previously reported how in the 1800 election Thomas Jefferson engaged in a ""smear campaign against then-president John Adams,"" which ""climaxed with an unexpected October broadside."" The late-season attack, carried out by Alexander Hamilton -- a critic of Adams and who went on to be Jefferson's VEEP -- remains one of the earliest examples of an effective late-campaign attack on a political rival.

During the 1840 election, rumors circulated that the Whig Party had paid residents of Pennsylvania to cross state lines and cast votes in New York during the 1838 election. There was no basis that this occurred, but people believed it -- just as some today believe illegal immigrants can head to the polls to sway the election results.

It was also 100 years before William Casey coined the term ""October Surprise"" that a disinformation campaign almost impacted the presidential election results.

The New York Truth newspaper published a forged letter on October 20, 1880, allegedly written by Republican candidate James Garfield voicing support for Chinese immigration at a time when many white Americans were opposed to Chinese immigration over fears that they were stealing jobs from American workers. In truth, both campaigns were in favor of immigration restrictions. Garfield went on to win the election by a narrow margin, but there has been speculation if the forged letter was released a little earlier the situation could have been different.

Misinformation/disinformation has clearly existed for a while, but social media could impact how it reaches the masses.

""The World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report highlights that the primary risk for 2024 is the use of misinformation and disinformation by malicious actors to disrupt society and further polarize communities,"" warned

Craig Barkacs, professor of business law and ethics in the MBA programs at the Knauss School of Business at the University of San Diego.

The October surprise may no longer be a single event or revelation. We could already see many at work, with misinformation already circulating about Senator JD Vance and his couch, and Governor Tim Walz supporting post-birth abortions.

But users of social media should be on guard for even more misinformation and disinformation in the coming weeks.

""There may be several October surprises in the works,"" said Barkacs. ""For most individuals, these may not make a significant difference as their opinions are already formed. For a small percentage, however, these surprises could be pivotal. The presidential elections of 2016 and 2020 illustrate how a tiny fraction of votes in crucial swing states can determine the outcome.""

Artificial intelligence may offer the ability to micro-target voters on social media while being strategically timed and aimed at a particular audience to help alter the results of the election.

""These micro-targeted voters are likely to be low-information voters, who are more susceptible to misinformation. These individuals, often unaware of the broader context, are the first to believe and spread unfounded stories,"" Barkacs continued. ""Research indicates that micro-targeting specific groups can influence voting behavior. We should be concerned about just what impact a deviously concocted October surprise could have on the outcome of the election.""

The most effective way to combat misinformation and disinformation is to ensure that we have a well-informed electorate, and that could users offering direct responses to the more outlandish commentary spread on the social networks.

""This go-round, there can be no passivity,"" suggested Campbell. ""For the good of the election, voters must find and amplify the truth -- to, in effect, shout down the trolls."""
Vance Suggests Changes To Health Insurance That May Raise Premiums For Those With Preexisting Conditions,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshuacohen/2024/10/01/vance-suggests-changes-to-health-insurance-that-may-raise-premiums-for-those-with-preexisting-conditions/,2024-10-01T13:09:44Z,"Memorably, at the presidential debate last month, former President Trump mentioned ""concepts of a plan"" when asked about his proposal to reform healthcare. Now his running mate, Senator Vance, says there is a plan to ""fix healthcare,"" specifically with respect to the Affordable Care Act. Vance argues that the health insurance market needs to be deregulated. He speaks of placing people with chronic conditions into separate insurance pools. But this could lead to insurers charging higher premiums for individuals with pre-existing conditions.

Kamala Harris's campaign released a report yesterday which maintained that millions of people with preexisting conditions could lose protection guaranteed them by ACA rules if Vance's changes were to go through.

During his term in office, Trump sought to undo ACA by executive action, legislation and lawsuits. Yet the law survived. And during Trump's bid to secure a second presidential term, he has wavered on the idea of whether to repeal the ACA.

But perhaps given the fact that the ACA is popular and growing in terms of enrollment and the uninsured rate is at an historic low, rather than do away with the ACA Trump is now calling for what he describes as improvements in the law. His running mate, Vance, is proposing substantial changes to ACA health insurance coverage that could lead to the elimination of the ACA's protection against insurers levying higher premiums on individuals in poor health.

Vance has spoken of deregulating the insurance market so that ""people can choose a plan that actually makes sense for them,"" as reported in The Hill. On the campaign trail in North Carolina last month, for instance, Vance suggested getting rid of the ACA's single risk pool which enables community rating and introducing separate risk pools for people with chronic health conditions. This would disrupt one of the ACA's guiding principles which states that health insurers may not charge people higher premiums based on their health status.

KFF estimates that 27% of adults have a condition that would have led to denied coverage by an insurer in the individual market before the ACA. Prior to the law's passage, insurers were able to deny coverage for a wide range of diseases or charge substantially higher premiums for individuals with preexisting conditions.

Vance wants to leave decisions on how to regulate what insurers do with the aforementioned high risk insurance pools up to individual states. Subsequently, if certain states permit premium surcharges based on health status, people with preexisting conditions would theoretically have access to health insurance, but it could be unaffordable.

State high-risk pools could provide access to coverage to people with preexisting conditions as an alternative to the private insurance market. But whether such pools would be effective depends on adequate funding, which did not occur in the states that had instituted them before the ACA was enacted. And so these insurance pools were not a feasible option for many due to exorbitant premiums.

On the stump, Vance has also said ""we're going to actually implement some regulatory reform in the healthcare system that allows people to choose a healthcare plan that works for them. If you only go to the doctor once a year, you're going to need a different healthcare plan than somebody who goes to the doctor fourteen times a year because they've got chronic pain or they've got some other chronic condition.""

Though it's unclear what in particular Vance has in mind for healthier individuals, maybe he's referring to short-term insurance plans which the Trump Administration promoted and made more accessible. These options do not offer coverage as comprehensive as ACA plans. Some healthy people might have an incentive to opt for short-term insurance, which can be renewed every three to twelve months, as a way to lower premiums.

The problem is that this may drive up costs considerably for the sicker folks who remain on ACA exchange plans. Moreover, the idea of offering healthy individuals a cheaper plan with far less complete coverage tacitly presumes that people's health needs are static, which they often are not. Perhaps the most important aim of having health insurance is to provide financial protection from unforeseen events. The fact that a person only sees a doctor once now has no bearing on the future, whether that's next year or later.

Only 39% of survey respondents polled by KFF in February of this year were aware that the ACA prohibits insurers from denying coverage to those with preexisting conditions, and only 31% knew that the ACA also prevents sick people from being charged higher premiums than healthy individuals. In light of Vance's statements on ACA reform, it would seem important that the electorate be better informed about what the proposed changes could entail."
"Forbes Daily: Ahead Of Debate, How Much Are Vance And Walz Worth?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/10/01/forbes-daily-ahead-of-debate-how-much-are-vance-and-walz-worth/,2024-10-01T12:11:37Z,"You don't just need to be a billionaire to make this year's Forbes 400 list. The cutoff for the 2024 list of America's 400 wealthiest is $3.3 billion.

In fact, for the first time, there are more American billionaires not on the list than are on it. But many of those who did make the cut are familiar faces: Elon Musk is the richest person in America for a third-straight year, followed by Jeff Bezos and Mark Zuckerberg.

Perhaps the most notable person to make the list, despite falling off of it last year, is Donald Trump, who has cashed in on the presidency more than anyone else, and benefitted from the shaky stock market run of Truth Social's parent company.

The S&P 500 had its best start to the year through September since 1997, gaining 21% so far this year. Big tech stocks benefitting from the generative AI boom have performed best, though the market has shifted slightly in recent months as investors anticipated and reacted to this month's supersized interest rate cut.

Dockworkers along the East and Gulf Coasts walked out on strike early Tuesday, a stoppage that one economist estimated could cost the economy up to $7.5 billion per week. The International Longshoremen's Association is requesting a wage increase as part of a new contract with the United States Maritime Alliance, which represents shipping companies.

If former President Donald Trump wins in November, it could hamper the Chinese stock market's recent rally, JPMorgan Chase strategists cautioned Monday. The risk of a Trump presidency for emerging market stocks is tied to his hawkish trade policies, especially toward China. Still, the strategists noted that emerging market stocks could be at a ""turning point.""

Fintech heavyweights like Jack Dorsey's Block and payments giant Stripe are joining a new compliance coalition for fintechs, in an effort to avoid the missteps of recent years -- which have led to everything from the dramatic collapse of Synapse to a surge in regulatory enforcement actions against fintech sponsor banks. ""Fintechs need to step it up and understand that regulatory requirements are real,"" says former startup CEO Sima Gandhi, a lawyer and former Department of Treasury official who organized the effort.

Aerospace and defense firm Sierra Nevada Corp. landed a $13.1 billion contract to build the next nuclear-ready 'Doomsday' planes, a game-changer for the privately-held company. The Doomsday project will help define the legacy of chairwoman and co-owner Eren Ozmen and her husband, who are worth a combined $7.8 billion. ""Taking smart risks is very important,"" says Ozmen. ""Without that, really, you're just following what's happening -- you're not leading.""

Video game company Epic Games accused Google and Samsung in a federal lawsuit of colluding to harm third-party app stores on smartphones running Google's Android operating system. Epic has taken on both Google and Apple in recent years, alleging that the companies abused their dominant position in the smartphone market to charge excessive fees to app makers.

X, formerly known as Twitter, is worth a little more than one-fifth of the $44 billion Elon Musk paid to acquire it in 2022, according to Fidelity. Fidelity's stake in the social media platform is now worth about $4.19 million, valuing X at $9.4 billion, according to recent disclosures from the financial services company.

Before JD Vance and Tim Walz face off in the vice presidential debate tonight, Forbes took a look at how the candidates stack up financially. While Vance is worth $10 million, exceeding Walz's net worth of just over $1 million, both candidates are less wealthy than their potential bosses: Donald Trump is worth $3.9 billion, while Kamala Harris has a net worth of $7 million.

As Donald Trump became perhaps the most polarizing and controversial president in recent memory, hotels began removing the Trump brand -- but he still made millions. The most likely explanation? Breakup fees. It's tough to say exactly how much all the breakup fees add up to, but Forbes estimates it was at least $15 million and could have been as high as $25 million.

The Israeli Defense Forces began ""limited, localized, and targeted ground raids ... in southern Lebanon"" against Hezbollah targets and infrastructure Monday -- escalating the conflict in the Middle East after Israel killed a number of Hezbollah leaders. The IDF said that the operations were ""approved and carried out in accordance with the decision of the political echelon.""

TOPLINE It was another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months -- some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars.

In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400.

This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500's 27% return.

Much of the gains come from two people: Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They're two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits.

Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after Forbes increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year.

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Forbes 400 is a roadmap of America's great wealth,"" says Forbes senior editor Chase Peterson-Withorn. ""The 400 richest people in the nation are richer, and thus in many ways more powerful, than ever. It's crucial to investigate who they are, how they made it, where they spend it and how they choose to (or, as is often the case, choose not to) donate it.""

Most (80%) gun owners say owning a gun makes them feel safer. Faith in the protective power of guns is so pervasive that it has even shaped recent Supreme Court decisions. During a live-streamed conversation earlier this month, Oprah Winfrey asked Kamala Harris about her gun ownership. She quickly answered, ""If someone breaks in my house, they're getting shot.""

The data tell a different story. On average, keeping one or more guns in the home -- particularly if one is kept loaded and readily available for protection -- poses a greater threat to members of the household than to an intruder.

Nearly 40 years ago, while working in Seattle's busiest ER, I saw many victims of shootings due to family violence, attempted suicide or accidents. I don't recall a single intruder who was shot in self-defense.

This observation led me to Donald Reay, then King County's chief medical examiner. Together, we reviewed all fatal shootings that had occurred in the county between 1978 and 1993. More than half (398 deaths) occurred in the home where the gun involved was kept. Two were intruders shot during attempted entry and seven were killed in self-defense. During the same period, guns kept in homes were involved in 12 accidental gunshot deaths, 41 criminal homicides and 333 suicides -- a lopsided ratio of 43 to 1. The three remaining deaths were of undetermined intent.

A few years later, colleagues and I conducted a similar study in Memphis, Tennessee, Seattle, Washington, and Galveston, Texas. This time, we included non-fatal as well as fatal shootings. We found that fatal and nonfatal suicide attempts, accidental shootings and firearm assaults in homes outnumbered self-defense shootings by a ratio of 22 to 1.

Keeping a gun for protection doesn't ensure that it will be reached. A 1994 review of 198 police-documented home invasions in Atlanta, Georgia, determined that three (1.5%) were successfully resisted with a gun. In six cases, the intruder reached the homeowner's gun before the homeowner did.

Because body counts don't capture instances when a gun is used to frighten off an intruder or deter them from entering the home, a three-city team of researchers and I conducted a study in Seattle, Memphis and Cleveland, Ohio, to determine if homes where guns are kept are less likely or more likely to be the scene of a violent death.

To accomplish the task, we identified ""case"" households where a violent death occurred and matched each with a ""control"" household in the same neighborhood that included an individual of the same age range, gender and race as the victim. We also took a number of important behavioral risk factors into consideration. Our analysis revealed that homes with guns were nearly three times more likely to be the scene of a homicide (mainly domestic homicides) and nearly five times more likely to be the scene of suicide than similar households without guns. Since our work was published, other research teams have generated similar findings.

Despite this information, the percentage of gun owners who cite ""protection"" as their most important reason for owning a gun has doubled since 1999. What explains this increase?

Although crime in the U.S. has dramatically fallen since 1993, the public doesn't believe it. In 23 of 27 Gallup surveys conducted since then, 60% or more of U.S. adults state that there is more crime nationally than the year before. One reason is that local news broadcasts a lot of violent crime stories because they hold viewers' attention. The adage, ""If it bleeds, it leads"" is still relevant today. Once broadcast, social media can nationalize a local story within minutes. This may explain, in part, why every in Gallup crime survey conducted since the 1990s, Americans are less likely to say that crime is up in their area than nationwide.

All of the studies I cited earlier in this commentary were published before 1996. That year, Congress enacted the ""Dickey Amendment"" -- a National Rifle Association-backed measure that sharply curtailed federal funding of firearm injury prevention research for the next 25 years. As time passed, the lack of new studies allowed the public to forgot what was already known. Some in Congress hope to reimpose an even stricter ban on firearm injury prevention research.

As the popularity of hunting declined, the firearm industry pivoted from marketing high-quality hunting rifles and shotguns, which are rarely used in crime, to deadlier weaponry. In Gunfight, author Ryan Busse, a former industry executive who opposed this shift, recalls the 2010 National Rifle Association convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, where he saw a large poster advertising the Bushmaster AR-15-style rifle. It said, ""Consider your man card reissued.""

A longtime industry partner, the NRA offers an extensive training catalog to its members. One of the courses, ""Basic Personal Protection In The Home,"" covers ""the safe and efficient use of a handgun for protection of self and family."" The NRA's Institute for Legislative Action backs the expansion of state ""right-to-carry"" laws, ""stand-your-ground"" laws and even laws to allow armed teachers in classrooms.

From the perspective of the industry and its allies, the shift to more dangerous weapons and a focus on self-protection paid off. Between 2000 and 2020, domestic firearm production nearly tripled, to more than 11 million guns per year. Almost 23 million firearms were sold in 2020, many to first-time buyers, according to CNN. Far from making America safer, gun deaths hit an all-time high in 2021, according to NPR. The following year, they dipped by 1% to 48,204, making 2022 the second-deadliest year on record.

Today, Americans own more firearms than citizens of the next 25 nations in the world combined. A 2019 study in Preventive Medicine determined that America's gun homicide rate is 25 times higher than the average among other high-income nations.

It's natural to want to do everything possible to keep your family safe. In a thunderstorm, it is also natural to take cover under the nearest tree. That doesn't make it a good idea.

Keeping a loaded firearm readily accessible for protection may seem like a reasonable precaution, but it puts the weapon within easy reach of curious children, an angry spouse or a depressed teen. If the gun is ever stolen in a burglary or smuggled out the door to school, it may harm many innocent people. That's why safe storage is so important."
Breaking Down Elon Musk's Big Beef With The FAA,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardnieva/2024/10/01/elon-musk-spacex-faa-feud/,2024-10-01T10:37:58Z,"The billionaire has been publicly warring with the U.S. space regulator over fines and delays with an onslaught of criticism on X, blog posts and letters to Congress.

After days of feuding with the Federal Aviation Administration, Elon Musk, the billionaire CEO of the rocket company SpaceX, ratcheted things up yet again. This time, he took aim at FAA head Michael Whitaker.

""He needs to resign,"" Musk wrote last week on X, the social platform he owns.

Musk called out Whitaker for alleged inaccuracies the administrator made about SpaceX during an unrelated hearing the day before, where he defended delays the FAA imposed on an upcoming SpaceX Starship launch. The FAA had licensed the launch for later in November, months after SpaceX's desired mid-September timeframe.

Whitaker said the delay had to do with permitting laws and an environmental analysis around sonic booms, which the launch could create when it attempts to return the rocket booster to earth -- a first for space flight. But SpaceX claimed the situation could have been fixed by a ""paperwork update"" instead of a two-month delay.

The dustup was the latest salvo in an escalating battle between Elon Musk and the FAA about launch dates and fines related to alleged SpaceX launch violations over unauthorized plans. Adding another layer to the spat: Musk could hypothetically become a regulator himself. Former President Donald Trump has floated the idea of tapping Musk to run a new committee on government efficiency, should he win a second term in November. The body would perform internal performance and financial audits on the federal government. The possibility should be taken with a grain of salt, but Musk, a Trump ally, has said he'd be interested in the role with ""no title, no pay.""

SpaceX's feud with the FAA may be core to Musk's interest in government efficiency. ""Unfortunately, we continue to be stuck in a reality where it takes longer to do the government paperwork to license a rocket launch than it does to design and build the actual hardware,"" the company wrote in a a 2,000-word blog post titled ""Starships Were Meant to Fly"" that slammed the FAA for the launch delay. ""This should never happen and directly threatens America's position as the leader in space.""

SpaceX and the FAA did not return requests for comment.

Big companies face off with regulators all the time. But Musk, with his megaphone of almost 200 million followers on X and his penchant for bluster, has been particularly pugilistic, with a steady stream of missives on X and letters to Congress over the last week. It's generally a bad idea to feud with regulators who ""could make life miserable,"" said Harry Kraemer, a professor of management and leadership at Northwestern University's Kellogg School of Management. ""It's the last thing a company really ought to be doing. You're asking for a headache,"" said Kraemer. Musk persists, he added, because of his ""ego."" ""He doesn't think the rules apply to him.""

The FAA, created in 1958, sits within the Department of Transportation, and regulates civil aviation in the U.S. Its duties include air traffic control, flight inspection standards and drone regulation. The agency undertook regulating space travel in 1995 when the Office of Commercial Space Transportation, established in 1984, was transferred into the FAA as the agency's only space-related entity.

""We don't need another bully like Boeing. It's time for the FAA to do its job.""

Along with SpaceX, other players in the commercial space industry have questioned the FAA's ability to keep up as the sector has grown. In October, Blue Origin, the rocket company established by Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, called out lagging operations at the agency during a hearing with the Senate Subcommittee on Space and Science. ""Congress and the FAA helped accelerate the development of the commercial space launch industry, and now the FAA is struggling to scale with the cadence of operation,"" Phil Joyce, a senior vice president at the company, said during testimony. ""Streamlining regulations and administrative processes and exploring the possibility for increased training opportunities will help utilize resources more efficiently.""

Meanwhile, Musk is warring with the FAA on another front as well. Two weeks ago, the agency announced proposed fines for SpaceX, worth more than $630,000, related to unapproved plans used during two rocket launches last year. The first incident, from last May at Florida's Cape Canaveral, was over a revised communications plan, in which SpaceX added an unauthorized new launch control room and removed a readiness poll from its procedures. Two months later, SpaceX used an unapproved rocket propellant facility as its fuel supplier at a launch at the Kennedy Space Center, the FAA alleged.

In response to the citations, Musk took to X to threaten legal action against the FAA for ""regulatory overreach,"" calling the move ""lawfare.""

Musk's accusations contrast from past criticism of the agency, which has been called out for lax regulation of the aircraft industry. Last week, a Senate subcommittee faulted the FAA's oversight in part for a door panel blowing out on a Boeing jet during an Alaska Airlines flight in January, raising questions about the agency's safety review. The FAA seems to be taking a different tack with SpaceX, which is a welcome change, Jim Hall, a former chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, told Forbes.

""We don't need another bully like Boeing,"" he said. ""It's time for the FAA to do its job. It hasn't in the past, particularly as it has pertained to Boeing.""

A day after the FAA levied the proposed fines, the company sent a letter to the heads of both Senate and House committees overseeing commercial space regulation, aiming to rebut each penalty. When SpaceX posted the letter on X, the company noted that it has been voicing concerns against the FAA for nearly two years for its ""inability to keep pace with the commercial spaceflight industry.""

""The Commerce Committee has received SpaceX's letter responding to the allegations levied by the FAA in its civil penalty notices and will evaluate whether federal agencies are appropriately structured and resourced to facilitate commercial space travel,"" a spokesperson for Sen. Ted Cruz, ranking member of the Senate committee, told Forbes in a statement. He added that Cruz would advocate for policies to ""minimize unnecessary bureaucratic interference and delays"" regardless of this particular dispute.

The Democratic staff of the House science committee declined to comment. The offices of Sen. Maria Cantwell, Rep. Zoe Lofgren and Rep. Frank Lucas -- who also head those committees -- did not return requests for comment.

Now, Musk is seeking to move the issue out of the realm of policy wonks. The billionaire, who has increasingly moved to the political right over the last few years, earlier this month bashed Vice President Kamala Harris's presidential run on X. One reason? He has argued government bureaucracy under Harris would impede SpaceX's lofty mission making humans an interplanetary species. ""This would destroy the Mars program and doom humanity,"" he wrote. ""This is a fork, maybe the fork, in the road of human destiny.""

Later in the week, SpaceX was back to putting out its normal promo on X, posting stunning photos of its Flight 5 Starship at sunset. Musk quote-posted it with an apparent typo in his caption: ""Starships were mean to fly."""
Tale Of The Tape: How The Finances Of JD Vance And Tim Walz Stack Up,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kylemullins/2024/10/01/tale-of-the-tape-how-the-finances-of-jd-vance-and-tim-walz-stack-up/,2024-10-01T10:37:53Z,"There's no debate that JD Vance is richer than Tim Walz. But here's the breakdown on how the two vice presidential candidates, who face off tonight, compare financially.

ice presidents are usually tapped to consolidate the party, carry the presidential candidate's message or appeal to some key constituency. In other words, they're not usually selected for the money they bring to the campaign (RFK Jr's pick of Nicole Shanahan notwithstanding). Still, there's a lot to learn about a candidate from how they much money they've made and how they've made it.

Both Vance and Walz grew up in working class families in the Midwest, joined the military as teenagers and later went on to get social science degrees from state schools. But their career choices afterwards caused their paths to diverge. Vance went to Yale Law School, wrote a bestselling book -- ""Hillbilly Elegy"" -- about his rough-and-tumble upbringing and became a venture capital investor, which helped him rake in millions. Then he won a Senate seat in 2022 and, at age 39, was picked as Donald Trump's running mate. Walz, on the other hand, became a public school teacher, retired from the military and ran for Congress in the wake of the Iraq War that Vance had fought in. He next became governor of Minnesota, winning a second term before Kamala Harris tapped him as her second. Today, he's virtually swimming in pensions -- but not much else in the way of assets.

There is no doubt that Vance is vastly richer than Walz. But as the duo get ready for their debate tonight in Manhattan, here's a head-to-head comparison of how the two vice presidential candidates stack up financially, based on Forbes estimates and reporting.

Both Vance and Walz are less wealthy than their potential future bosses: Donald Trump is worth $3.9 billion -- landing him back on the Forbes 400 list of America's wealthiest people this year -- and Kamala Harris has a net worth of $7 million.

While Walz is about the same age as his running mate, who turns 60 on October 20, Vance has seen just over half of Donald Trump's 78 years. If elected, Trump and Vance would have the largest age gap between president and vice president in history by nearly a decade, according to the Pew Research Center.

Vance owns three homes in Ohio, Virginia and Washington, D.C. Only one, the D.C. home, has any record of debt on it today. Walz, on the other hand, sold his longtime Mankato residence in 2019 when he became governor, paid off his mortgage and moved into the state's executive mansion, owned by Minnesota taxpayers.

Walz and his wife, Gwen, as longtime public sector employees, have at least four pensions that make up virtually their entire net worth. The most valuable is almost certainly Tim's federal pension, which Forbes estimates is worth north of $475,000 thanks to the combination of his congressional and military service. Vance, after a career largely in the private sector, also has a federal pension, but it's worth much less because he's been in elected office for less than two years.

Most of Vance's net worth comes from his investments from his time as a venture capitalist. Not long after law school, he moved out to California and joined Mithril, a firm founded by Paypal billionaire Peter Thiel (who later bankrolled Vance's Senate run). Just a few years later, though, Vance moved back to Ohio, helping AOL billionaire Steve Case invest in middle America before starting his own firm, Narya (a name, like Mithril, sourced from ""Lord of the Rings""). Today, he still has some stakes in his old employers' portfolios, stock market and gold ETFs and even over $100,000 in Bitcoin. Walz, on the other hand, doesn't appear to have much in the markets, other than a 401(k)-style retirement account as governor.

Both men would get a raise if they're elected to the vice presidency -- the commander-in-chief's second-in-command gets paid about $235,000 annually. Walz's salary as governor is the 14th lowest in the country, according to the Council of State Governments. (The governor of Maine makes only $70,000, the lowest of any state).

In addition to his Senatorial salary, Vance reported a minimum of $150,000 in investment and other income in 2023. This includes income from selling his partnership interest in his venture capital firm, Narya, for between $100,000 and $1,000,000. His wife, Usha, earned a salary from D.C. law firm Munger Tolles & Olsen, but was not required to disclose the amount; she left the firm following JD's selection as VP. The Walzes, meanwhile, earned $135,000 in pension income, $50,000 from Gwen's part-time job at Augsburg University in Minneapolis and Tim's gubernatorial salary, according to their 2023 tax returns.

In Congress, the Minnesotan cut a moderate figure as a Democrat from a rural district, picking up endorsements from conservative groups like the National Rifle Association and liberal ones like the League of Conservation Voters.

Vance's memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy"" made him a nationally-known figure, winning him respect -- and interview requests -- from the media and business elites he now frequently rails against. It sold 1.6 million copies in print, according to data from Circana Bookscan, an industry tracking service.

Both men met their wives at schools -- the Walzes both taught at the same Nebraska public school, whereas the Vances met as students at Yale Law School. The Walzes have two children; the Vances have three."
"The Next U.S. President Won't Define Crypto's Future, Congress Will",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonyaevans/2024/10/01/the-next-us-president-wont-define-cryptos-future-congress-will/,2024-10-01T10:03:54Z,"The national conversation around cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology, and U.S. innovation leadership has centered on the White House this election cycle. Presidential candidates Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump have both made notable shifts regarding this emerging industry of financial technology. Harris has pivoted from President Biden's antagonistic approach, led by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and prudential regulators, to a more pro-innovation tone focused on blockchain and digital assets. These technologies, she claims, are crucial to her ""Opportunity Economy,"" aimed at empowering middle-class families and small businesses.

Meanwhile, Trump, who once called bitcoin a ""scam,"" now vows to make the U.S. the ""crypto capital of the planet"" and pledges to fire SEC Chair Gary Gensler (the head of an independent agency who can only be removed for cause) on his first day in office. Although these promises grab attention, the reality is that the President's influence over the future of digital assets is limited. It is Congress that holds the real power to shape the regulatory framework for crypto.

Congress Holds The Real Power

Congress, as the first branch of government, holds the key to determining the future of digital assets in the U.S. While presidential candidates may dominate headlines, under Article II of the Constitution, the President's powers are limited. The President cannot unilaterally enact laws or overhaul regulations for digital assets; their role is primarily to enforce the laws passed by Congress and oversee regulatory agencies like the SEC and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC).

Executive orders, while impactful, are not laws and can be undone by future administrations. For long-term stability in the digital asset industry, Congress must pass legislation. Yet, much of the public and crypto advocates tend to focus on presidential races, overlooking Congress's critical role in shaping the future of cryptocurrency and blockchain innovation.

The ""Do-Nothing"" Congress And Regulatory Bottlenecks

The current Congress has been criticized for inaction, having passed fewer than 230 bills into law during the 2023-2024 term, well below prior legislative sessions. This delay has hindered the development of a modern legal framework for digital finance, leaving regulatory agencies like the SEC to rely on outdated laws from the 1930s, ill-suited for today's digital asset landscape.

Without clear legislation, these agencies continue to enforce old frameworks, leading to regulatory confusion, inconsistent enforcement, and stifled innovation. Democratic and Republican leaders have pledged to change this, with support from figures like House Leader Mike Johnson. However, without decisive action, the U.S. risks falling behind in global digital asset innovation.

Congress's Crucial Role In Shaping Crypto Policy

Congress holds the unique authority to craft laws that reflect the country's evolving needs, particularly in emerging sectors like blockchain and digital assets. The SEC operates under laws such as the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 -- long before the internet or digital currencies existed. Applying these outdated laws to digital assets has led to friction and uncertainty, as many assets -- often dynamic in nature -- do not fit neatly into existing categories and twentieth century legal frameworks.

Agencies like the SEC and CFTC are forced to apply outdated laws in ways that extend beyond their original intent, leading to concerns of regulatory overreach. A recent federal court ruling highlighted this issue, finding that the SEC acted arbitrarily and capriciously in its denials of bitcoin exchange-traded funds. This kind of regulatory overreach hampers innovation, creating uncertainty around compliance and making it challenging for startups to succeed. Industry leaders continue to call for clear rules of the road from the SEC. However, executive agencies get their rulemaking and enforcement powers from Congress. Accordingly, the clearest rules will come from Congress.

The FIT21 Act and Securities Clarity Act

A significant step in this direction occurred with the passage of the Financial Innovation and Technology for the 21st Century Act (FIT21), which included Representative Tom Emmer's Securities Clarity Act. This act aims to provide much-needed legal clarity for the digital asset industry by distinguishing between an asset and the securities contract it may be part of. As Emmer stated, ""This is an important opportunity for the United States to lead... The FIT21 Act will give entrepreneurs the clarity and assurance they need to build here, in the United States.""

Before the FIT21 Act, one of the biggest regulatory hurdles for digital assets was the confusion over how they were classified under existing securities laws. Many cryptocurrencies start as part of a securities contract but may evolve into something else once a project becomes fully decentralized. The Securities Clarity Act, now Title II of the FIT21 Act, addresses this by providing the flexibility for a digital asset project to transition from centralization (controlled by developers or investors) to decentralization, where it operates independently.

Emmer emphasized this point during his remarks on the House floor, saying, ""Among the many important provisions in this bill is my Securities Clarity Act... which provides the legal flexibility for a digital asset project to transition from centralization to decentralization. This transition is critical to the future peer-to-peer digital economy.""

This legislative clarity is crucial for allowing digital asset projects to grow without unnecessary regulatory hurdles. By passing FIT21, Congress aims to keep U.S. innovation onshore and ensure the country remains competitive in the global digital economy.

The Limits Of Leaving It To The Executive Branch

While Congress often delegates authority to executive agencies, this does not give those agencies free rein. Agencies like the SEC are tasked with executing the laws passed by Congress, not creating new laws through regulation. When Congress fails to act however, as it has with respect to the crypto asset industry, agencies like the SEC are left to make judgment calls, leading to inconsistent enforcement that chills innovation.

The SEC's approach of enforcing regulations on a case-by-case basis, without setting clear industry-wide guidelines, has been particularly problematic for digital asset companies. Ongoing legal battles over the classification of certain tokens as securities have cast a chilling effect on the industry. The absence of comprehensive legislation has left both regulators and businesses in a state of uncertainty. Even agency heads disagree on the best approach. While Gensler criticized FIT21, CFTC Chair Rostin Benham commented that with successful passage of the bill, he was ""confident"" his agency could build a regulatory framework within 12 months.

Congress must have the last word and settle these issues by passing comprehensive legislation, such as FIT21, that provides clear guidance to both agencies and businesses.

Shifting Congressional Attitudes Toward Crypto

Key members of Congress are increasingly supporting digital asset innovation. Rep. Maxine Waters (D-CA), once a critic, now acknowledges the importance of engaging with technologies like AI and crypto, stating, ""We've got to move forward with AI, artificial intelligence, cryptocurrency... we have to learn more.""

At the recent Crypto4Harris town hall, aimed at strengthening ties between Harris's campaign and the crypto industry, several pro-crypto lawmakers voiced their support. Rep. Wiley Nickel (D-NC) called for Harris to adopt a more pro-crypto stance, while Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed optimism about passing bipartisan crypto legislation, stating, ""Crypto is here to stay no matter what. So, Congress must get it right.""

Senators Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and Debbie Stabenow (D-MI) also demonstrated support, signaling growing bipartisan backing for a regulatory framework that balances innovation with consumer protection.

Industry leaders echo these sentiments. Sheila Warren, CEO of the Crypto Council for Innovation, emphasized the importance of bipartisan efforts, noting that many in Congress already understand how critical digital assets are to the U.S.'s financial future. Will Schweitzer, co-organizer of Crypto4Harris, added, ""Bipartisan Congressional support for Digital Asset legislation continues to gain momentum.""

The StandWithCrypto.com database shows over 50 Democratic lawmakers, including Rep. Ro Khanna (D-CA), Rep. Brendan Boyle (D-PA), and Rep. Elissa Slotkin (D-MI), are now somewhat or strongly supportive of pro-crypto legislation. This growing base of support suggests that Congress is ready to proceed with bipartisan long-term regulatory changes in the digital asset space.

Why Congress Must Lead on Crypto

To keep the U.S. at the forefront of blockchain technology, Congress must prioritize policies that foster innovation. This goes beyond regulatory reform that tinkers at the edges -- it requires a fundamental shift in how emerging technologies are approached.

Unlike the Executive branch, Congress holds the power to create laws specifically tailored to the needs of the crypto industry. By collaborating with stakeholders, experts, retail investors, and innovators, lawmakers can design frameworks that foster innovation while ensuring consumer protection.

As G. Clay Miller of Penrose Partners noted, ""We will have a pro-crypto President no matter who wins in November, but the real work begins in January."" The future of digital assets in the U.S. depends on the legislative framework Congress creates, as only Congress can provide the long-term stability the industry needs.

Now is the time to focus where the real power lies -- on Congress."
The 2024 Forbes 400: The 25 Wealthiest People In America,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2024/10/01/the-2024-forbes-400-the-25-wealthiest-people-in-america/,2024-10-01T10:02:49Z,"was another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months -- some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars.

In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400.

This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500's 27% return.

Much of the gains come from two people: Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They're two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits.

Most of these 25 were among the top 25 last year, too. But there are three fresh faces: traders Jeff Yass (who ranked No. 28 in 2023) and Thomas Peterffy (who was No. 27), plus Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who jumped from No. 31 last year to No. 25 in 2024 on the back of the retailer's rising stock. They replace MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, who continues to give away her fortune; Miriam Adelson, whose shares of casino operator Las Vegas Sands have hit a cold streak; and investor Len Blavatnik, whose stock in Warner Music Group is worth less than a year ago. Zuckerberg jumped five spots, to No. 3; Huang jumped six, to No. 11.

Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after we increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year.

Here are the top 25 members of the 2024 Forbes 400 list:

One of Sam Walton's eight grandchildren, he inherited an estimated 4% stake in Walmart from his father, John Walton, who died in a 2005 plane crash. Lukas, who survived childhood cancer, founded and runs Builders Vision, a sustainability-focused philanthropic and impact-investing platform that has doled out more than $3 billion since launching in 2021. He is one of just two Forbes 400 members under age 40 (the other: VC investor Josh Kushner, No. 347, who is 39). His mother, Christy Walton (No. 48), cosigned a letter urging President Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election in July and has been fundraising for Kamala Harris. Two members of the family's third generation still sit on Walmart's board: Jim's son Steuart Walton (Lukas' first cousin) and Rob's son-in-law Greg Penner, who is chairman.

""On the doorsteps of the Olympic Games,"" Knight wrote this summer in a letter to U.S. athletes, whose jerseys Nike designed, ""we need to reignite the passion, desire and the want to win."" His sportswear giant could use a pep talk, too. Nike stock is down 15% since last year, making Knight, who created the company with his University of Oregon track coach in 1964, one of just three in the Top 25 to be poorer than in 2023.

Peterffy is more than $10 billion richer than last year as shares of Interactive Brokers Group, the electronic trading firm he founded in 1993, rose 30%. The company booked $4.3 billion in revenue last year, a 42% year-over-year increase. Since he failed to persuade Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin to enter the Republican presidential primary race, Peterffy, a longtime supporter of free-market policies, has kept quiet on Trump's reelection bid.

Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel, the most profitable of all time, raked in $8.1 billion in trading profits last year. Since then, Griffin, never one to leave money idle, has donated $50 million to the University of Miami, dropped $45 million on a Stegosaurus skeleton (a record price in the dinosaur auction business) and shelled out more than $90 million for an estate in Saint-Tropez, France.

In August, Schwarzman and his wife announced plans to open their Miramar estate in Newport, Rhode Island, to the public as a museum upon their deaths. They spent $27 million on the Gilded Age mansion in 2021 and have been restoring it ever since. In May, Schwarzman, the cofounder and CEO of $1 trillion (assets) investment firm Blackstone, announced he's backing Trump for president, two years after vowing to support someone else in 2024.

In August, their Mars Inc. announced it's gobbling up snack and cereal maker Kellanova (formerly Kellogg's) for $35.9 billion. The deal will put brands like Pringles, Pop-Tarts and Froot Loops under the Mars umbrella alongside Snickers, M&M's and Kind bars. It's the company's biggest acquisition since it bought Wrigley in 2008 for $23 billion. The Mars siblings own an estimated two-thirds of the $50 billion (2023 revenue) business but have no role in daily operations.

Yass' fortune nearly doubled after Forbes revalued his trading firm, Susquehanna International Group -- and Yass' share of profits -- based on tax returns leaked to ProPublica. With a potential TikTok ban threatening Susquehanna's estimated 15% stake in the social media app, Yass has made nearly $70 million of federal political contributions during the 2024 election cycle, including $20.5 million to the Club for Growth Action, a conservative super PAC that has publicly opposed the TikTok ban (but denies having been influenced by Yass).

In June, Koch Industries became Koch, Inc., as Charles rebranded the increasingly tech-focused $125 billion (revenue) conglomerate for the first time since taking over the family firm after his father's 1967 death. Julia Koch, the widow of his brother David (d. 2019), and her three children paid nearly $700 million that same month for 15% of BSE Global, which owns the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and the WNBA's New York Liberty and operates the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

Rob Walton retired from Walmart's board in June after more than four decades as a director of the firm his father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962. He and his siblings' estimated 35% stake in the retail giant is worth more than ever as shoppers flock to Walmart's ""Every Day Low Price"" strategy to escape high inflation, driving both its revenue and shares to all-time highs. Jim still chairs the family's $26 billion (assets) Arvest Bank Group. Alice, the richest woman in America for the ninth time in 10 years, reclaimed the title of the world's wealthiest woman in early September from L'Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of France for the first time since May 2022.

Dell scored his biggest payday ever in November, when semiconductor giant Broadcom acquired his cloud computing spinoff VMware; Dell swapped his 39% stake for an estimated $33 billion in cash and Broadcom shares. Around that time, he put $3.6 billion in cash and stock into his family's charitable foundation and pumped at least $500 million into a donor-advised fund. Dell's net worth is up 40% this year, thanks to 90% and 64% jumps in Broadcom and Dell Technologies share prices, respectively.

Huang keeps climbing into rarer air: He has added $63.3 billion to his fortune, pushing him up six more notches on The Forbes 400 (he jumped 31 spots last year), on the back of a 162% rise in Nvidia shares. As his wealth grows, so does his celebrity: Paparazzi followed his every move on a trip to his native Taiwan this summer -- a phenomenon termed ""Jensanity."" Huang cofounded Nvidia, which designs and sells more chips used for artificial intelligence systems than any other company, in 1993 and has served as CEO and president since.

The former mayor of New York City and cofounder of financial-data and media firm Bloomberg LP was awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Biden in May. Over the next three months, Bloomberg announced $1.6 billion of gifts to the medical schools of his alma mater, Johns Hopkins, and four historically Black colleges.

The Microsoft cofounder's rank is lower than it has been in 34 years, due mostly to a new Forbes estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement. In September, Netflix released a five-episode series called What's Next? The Future with Bill Gates, which tackles topics including AI and income inequality. In February 2025, he's set to publish a memoir, Source Code. TerraPower, the next-generation nuclear power company he cofounded in 2008, broke ground on a demonstration plant in Wyoming in June. That same month, his ex-wife, Melinda, resigned as co-chair of the couple's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and walked away with $12.5 billion for her own philanthropy.

""Damn, I'm fired up!"" exclaimed Ballmer in August at the grand opening of his Los Angeles Clippers' new 18,000-seat Intuit Dome stadium, which boasts a 38,000-square-foot circular scoreboard. He bought the Clippers a decade ago for a then-record $2 billion after running Microsoft as CEO for 14 years, and spent $2 billion of his own money on the new stadium; Forbes now values the team at more than $4.6 billion.

Net worth: $136 billion | Source of wealth: Google | Age: 51

A federal judge ruled in August that Page and Brin's Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, which is responsible for 57% of parent company Alphabet's sales. (The tech giant reportedly plans to appeal.) Shares hit an all-time high in July thanks to Google's continued push into generative AI and cloud services, including a partnership with Oracle, before slipping in recent months.

More than seven decades in, the investing legend is staying plenty busy. In August, Berkshire Hathaway became America's first non-tech company to hit $1 trillion in market capitalization. In June, Buffett -- the nation's greatest philanthropist, with some $60 billion in lifetime giving -- donated $5.3 billion of Berkshire stock, with a twist: He clarified that the vast majority of his remaining fortune will go to a charitable trust run by his three children, instead of the Gates Foundation, as was previously assumed.

It was another banner year for the Oracle cofounder, chief technology officer and more than 40% shareholder, with the software firm's shares up 12% to record highs. He's spending accordingly: Ellison splashed out nearly $300 million on a Florida resort in August, adding to his $2 billion-plus real estate portfolio. He also plans to invest a reported $6 billion into the on-again-off-again merger between Paramount Global and Skydance, his son David's media production company.

No one got richer over the past year, in sheer dollar terms, than Zuck. He's $75 billion wealthier, and ranks five spots higher, following a 75% runup in Meta Platforms stock. Revenue has been growing more than 20% per quarter, and the social media giant repurchased $31 billion of its shares over the past year. Zuckerberg, who turned 40 in May, has taken on a new look, sporting a gold chain, letting his wavy hair grow out and ditching his uniform hoodie for a shearling jacket. He also surprised his wife, Priscilla, with a seven-foot-tall statue in her likeness.

Since last summer, Bezos has snapped up three homes on Miami's ""billionaire bunker"" island for $234 million. He has the cash: Since moving to tax-friendly Florida last November, the Amazon founder has offloaded more than $8 billion (pretax) of his shares; he still owns 9% of the e-commerce Leviathan, whose stock is up 29%. The Bezos Earth Fund, through which he has given $2 billion of a $10 billion pledge, will hand out up to $100 million to winners of an AI for Climate and Nature challenge beginning later this year.

Tesla's self-proclaimed ""technoking"" tops The Forbes 400 for the third straight year, despite losing $7 billion as shares of his electric vehicle maker fell 14% and a Delaware judge voided $56 billion of his stock options in January. In May, Musk's new AI startup, xAI, raised $6 billion at a $24 billion valuation. A month later, his rocket maker, SpaceX, launched a tender offer valuing the company at around $210 billion, up from nearly $180 billion. In an X post seen by 220 million, Musk endorsed Donald Trump within an hour of the assassination attempt on the former president. Trump now vows to name Musk to a new government efficiency commission if elected."
From Climate Purist To Climate Pragmatist: The Case Of Kamala Harris,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/prakashdolsak/2024/09/30/from-climate-purist-to-climate-pragmatist-the-case-of-kamala-harris/,2024-10-01T03:25:01Z,"How should we assess whether a politician is pro-climate, anti-climate, or somewhere in between? We probably look at what they say and what they do. If so, we might be witnessing a climate policy convergence between Democrats and Republicans, much more than what is typically acknowledged. This means that some liberals are no longer climate purists and some conservatives are no longer climate skeptics. They are becoming climate pragmatists.

The rise of climate pragmatism is visible in different forms. Some liberals recognize the tension between decarbonization on the one hand and jobs, inflation, and energy security on the other. Consequently, they have softened the rhetoric on ending reliance on fossil fuels. At the same time, conservatives recognize the inevitable shift away from fossil fuels because solar and wind are economically competitive. Seeing the writing on the wall, they are supporting climate-friendly industries.

While climate pragmatism might reflect political opportunism, we view it as a positive development that negates ""litmus test politics,"" and facilitates policy progress. Kamala Harris of 2024, in a sharp deviation from Kamala Harris of 2016-20, epitomizes the emerging climate pragmatism.

Kamala Harris' Evolving Climate Positions

In 2016, California's Attorney General Kamala Harris sued the Obama administration over permitting hydraulic fracturing. In 2019, Senator Harris co-sponsored the Green New Deal resolution. In the 2020 Presidential primaries, Candidate Harris said, ""I'm committed to passing a Green New Deal, creating clean jobs and finally putting an end to fracking once and for all.""

Fast forward to September 2024. In the TV debate with Trump, she supported fracking and even took credit for the largest increase in oil production in history: ""I will not ban fracking. I have not banned fracking as Vice President of the United States. And, in fact, I was the tie-breaking vote on the Inflation Reduction Act, which opened new leases for fracking ... We have had the largest increase in domestic oil production in history...""

Now consider another policy issue: Electric Vehicles (EVs.) In 2019, Senator Harris co-sponsored the Zero-Emission Vehicles Act, which required ""the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to establish a zero-emission passenger vehicle standard. Specifically, the bill sets a schedule for increasing the percentage of zero-emission vehicles a manufacturer delivers for sale, culminating in a requirement to sell only zero-emission vehicles from 2040 on."" In 2024, she does not support the EV mandate.

Critics might call this opportunism. Instead, we suggest that she is a climate pragmatist who is not bound by ideological litmus tests, and who is open to changing policy positions in response to political imperatives and economic opportunities. She is a politician, not an ideologue -- and this is a good quality if we want policy progress in a polarized world.

Harris is not alone in evolving into a climate pragmatist; she is joined by a growing cadre of Republicans and Democrats.

Republicans and Climate Skepticism

Republicans are supposed to be an anti-climate party. Historically, many have questioned climate science -- and a handful probably continue to do so. They support investments in fossil fuel exploration, extraction, refining, and pipelines. Trump is a vocal supporter of coal. Not a single House or Senate Republican voted for the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. In recent years, Republican Attorney Generals and Congressional leaders have pursued companies supporting the pro-climate ESG metric alleging that these companies are neglecting their fiduciary duties, or unlawfully colluding to impose liberal agendas.

And yet, Republican Governors are supporting renewable energy. Texas leads the country in utility-scale wind and solar. Indiana's Governor Holcomb is an outspoken champion of renewable energy. Republican Governors (but for South Dakota's Governor Noem) are actively courting EV, solar, and wind manufacturing industries which have received generous federal subsidies under the Inflation Reduction Act.

Democrats and Fossil Fuels

Democrats are supposed to be the pro-environment party that seeks vigorous climate action. Many of them sponsored the Green New Deal Resolution in the U.S. House and the Senate. They enacted the Inflation Reduction Act, the largest infusion of federal monies in climate policy.

And yet, the Biden-Harris administration celebrates the rise of America as an energy superpower, driven primarily by fracking. It allowed Alaska's Willow Project despite vocal opposition from environmental groups and Biden's pledge of ""no more drilling on federal lands, no more drilling, including offshore, no ability for the oil industry to continue to drill, period."" It supports the massive investment in LNG pipelines and terminals for exporting fracked gas. Leading Pennsylvania Democrats, Governor Shapiro and Senators Casey and Fetterman do not support a fracking ban either. Alaska's lone House Member, Mary Pelota, a Democrat, claims credit for pressuring the Biden Administration to approve the Willow project. Ohio's Democratic Senator Sherrod Brown wants to overturn the EPA rule that limits greenhouse gas emissions from power plants as well as the vehicle tailpipe emissions rule.

In sum, ideological purity might have become less salient in driving climate policy. Instead, politicians are responding to local/state-level factors, a good development because it bridges the democracy deficit. Democrats from fracking states support fossil fuels. Republicans from a state with wind and solar potential support renewable energy. Hopefully, voters will reward climate pragmatism and policy evolution. They will assess politicians not by what they said in the past, but by what they say now and importantly, what they do. With this yardstick, Democrats and Republicans will have additional incentives to embrace climate pragmatism and work together on climate issues."
"The ""Saving Grace"" Of Today's Community Colleges",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brunomanno/2024/09/30/the-saving-grace-of-todays-community-colleges/,2024-10-01T01:42:00Z,"""Community colleges may prove the saving grace of college-level learning in America,"" wrote historian Sean Trainor in a 2015 article in TIME magazine.

Today, almost a decade later, two recent reports echo this notion in their call for community colleges to up their game and make a major contribution to improving the futures of young people and working-class Americans who don't have college degrees.

Both reports describe the role these institutions should play in expanding America's workforce education and training efforts, especially by greatly increasing the number of employer-connected apprenticeships and creating a new learning campus that combines paid work and education.

The first report from a group of economists is Toward a Potential Grand Bargain for the Nation, commissioned by the Center for Collaborative Democracy and published by the Bipartisan Policy Center. Its chapter on ""Growth and Mobility"" describes five strategies to improve economic growth and upward economic mobility. It includes a proposal for creating a more highly skilled workforce that involves community colleges and apprenticeships.

The approach described in the Grand Bargain has its complement in a report from Apprenticeships for America on How Community Colleges Can Help Scale U.S. Apprenticeships. It is written by four experts on community colleges and apprenticeships.

Both reports fit into a larger conversation in America on how young people and workers can be better prepared for careers and social and economic mobility. Vice President Kamala Harris has described this larger context as ""an opportunity economy where everyone has the chance to compete and the chance to succeed.""

She also has defined the problem we face doing this and a practical solution: ""For far too long, our nation has encouraged only one path to success: a four-year college degree. Our nation needs to recognize the value of other paths -- additional paths, such as apprenticeships and technical programs.""

I call this approach to creating additional paths to success opportunity pluralism. Creating more earn-and-learn apprenticeships through community colleges is a pivotal way to realize an opportunity economy where opportunity pluralism flourishes.

The federal government's authority over apprenticeship programs began in 1937 with the National Apprenticeship Act. It also gave states the option to register and oversee programs. Today, about half the states exercise that option.

These registered apprenticeships provide individuals with on-the-job training, pay for work and classroom instruction, and a nationally recognized credential when the program is complete. This approach has received bipartisan political backing at the federal level from Democratic and Republican administrations and in states as diverse politically as California, Colorado, Tennessee, and Texas.

Today, 27,000 registered programs enroll around 600,000 individuals, with roughly 70% in construction trades. That's only 0.3% of the U.S. workforce, the bottom of apprenticeship enrollment among developed countries.

Federal financial support is growing for apprenticeships and other workforce training programs. But it's far short of the billions of federal dollars spent on postsecondary education and training. A Progressive Policy Institute analysis of fiscal year 2022 shows that out of $139.5 billion allocated for federal postsecondary education and training, only $28.2 billion, or 20%, was spent on workforce development.

The Grand Bargain proposal for investing in workers' education and training through community colleges calls for expanding work-based learning, especially through apprenticeships. It also would expand other employer and occupational-connected training like sectoral programs. Doing this requires two elements: more education and training partnerships between community colleges and employers and additional federal and state financial support.

Financial support could come in the form of employer tax credits for training and federal and state program funding that is linked to pay for performance in achieving outcomes like program completion and job placement. While not often the case with economists, they add a word of caution: ""Economists do not have a good understanding of how to 'scale-up' these programs, so we recommend additional experimentation with rigorous evaluations.""

The Apprenticeships for America report argues that community colleges are uniquely positioned to experiment, scale up apprenticeship programs, and work with analysts to evaluate how these programs are working. It describes a four-part framework that community colleges should use to expand apprenticeships that includes:

1. Working with employers to design and deliver related technical instruction or RTI, which is made-to-order classroom instruction for apprentices.

2. Adding value to RTI by, for example, offering structured apprenticeship degree pathway programs or including the college's career guidance and support services in apprenticeship programs.

3. Sponsoring federally registered apprenticeship programs, relieving employers of the application process.

4. Creating apprenticeships across industries and occupations, reducing costs to employers.

The report includes other recommendations.

For example, rules for federal Pell Grants to students should allow them to use financial aid to pay for quality short-term workforce training programs not now eligible for support. Additionally, federal and state programs that fund apprenticeships should change from one-off grant programs to recurring formula grant programs. These would support a larger array of occupations and industries and use a pay-for-performance contracting model, similar to recommendations found in Grand Bargain.

Vice President Harris's idea of an opportunity economy for all Americans has earn-and-learn apprenticeship pathways as central to that economy's education and training agenda. Both reports recommend that community colleges play a major in creating these earn-and-learn apprenticeships. They assume a viewpoint that fosters opportunity pluralism, an education and workforce training approach that creates multiple pathways to jobs and human flourishing rather than a singular, preferred college degree pathway.

This opportunity program is built on an opportunity equation with three related elements that form the basis for individuals pursuing pathways to opportunity: Knowledge or what individuals know + Relationships or whom they know + Identity or who they are = Opportunity.

Community colleges can be that saving grace where apprenticeships make the workplace the new learning campus for young people and working-class Americans."
"Harris' ""Opportunity Economy""  Closes The Economic Gap With Trump",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/richardmcgahey/2024/09/30/harris-opportunity-economy--closes-the-economic-gap-with-trump/,2024-10-01T01:18:25Z,"With just over 30 days left until the presidential election, Kamala Harris is emphasizing an ""Opportunity Economy"" as a centerpiece of her campaign. Although Donald Trump held a substantial polling lead over Joe Biden on economic issues, Harris is now virtually even with Trump on economics. What's in her program that's closing the gap?

Harris' economic vision continually emphasizes the middle class -- not the poor, or minorities, or immigrants. They aren't central to her message and policies. Her campaign website says ""she will make it a top priority to bring down costs and increase economic security for all Americans."" And the ""Issues"" page on her website leads, in big bold letters, with ""Build An Opportunity Economy and Lower Costs For Families.""

Why ""lower costs for families?"" Because the biggest economic problem faced by Joe Biden -- and still faced by Harris -- is inflation. An August CBS News poll found that ""76% of registered voters said it (inflation) was a major factor in their choice for president."" And in May, an ABC News poll found Trump trusted over Biden on inflation ""by a margin of 14 percentage points.""

Inflation was driven by the Covid-19 pandemic's ""supply shock,"" with disruption to supply chains, the economy, and prices. The inflation rate has been trending downward, with the current rate of 2.5% the lowest since February of 2021. But consumers remain heavily scarred by the pandemic inflation, which reached an annual rate of 9.1% in June of 2022, a rate not seen since the oil shock inflation of the early 1980s.

Harris doesn't duck away from inflation. Her program calls for bringing down housing costs by building more, but also for ""legislation to outlaw new form of price fixing by corporate landlords."" Another major provision would ""take down bad actors and bring down costs,"" calling for the ""first-ever federal ban on corporate price gouging on food and groceries.""

Economists are skeptical about these policies. Yes, investors buy many homes to rent them out. But the vast majority of housing investors are small local landlords, not big corporations.

And even some Democratic economists don't endorse the attack on price gouging. Jason Furman, chair of President Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, says ""this is not sensible policy...there's no upside here, and there is some downside."" But economists like Isabella Weber at the University of Massachusetts argue that large and powerful firms took advantage of the pandemic shock to raise prices and generate profits beyond covering their costs -- what she calls ""sellers' inflation.""

Of course, Harris is running for president, not leading an economics seminar. And her attacks on price gouging are very popular. A new poll for The Guardian did a blind test of Harris' and Trump's economic ideas, and found Harris had ""four of the top five most popular proposals."" The most popular of twelve policies tested in the poll? A ""federal ban on price-gouging food and groceries.""

That's one reason Harris' has closed the ""trust gap"" with Trump on the economy. A recent Morning Consult poll found Harris and Trump were equally trusted on the economy, a major gain for the Democrats compared with Biden's double-digit polling gaps with Trump.

Harris' economic plan goes well beyond managing prices. She promises to continue (and perhaps expand) Biden's support for US manufacturing, using trade policy (including tariffs) and subsidies to support critical industries like semiconductors, electric vehicles, and clean energy. She ties these to other specific policies to lower energy costs and help with the climate crisis.

Although Harris endorses strategic, limited tariffs, she opposes Trump's plan to raise tariffs on all imports by 10 to 20%, and on imports from China by 60% or more. She calls this a ""tax"" on American households, and economists agree with her. Economists at Goldman Sachs, the Peterson Institute, the Tax Foundation, and the Tax Policy Foundation all find Trump's draconian tariffs would slow the economy, penalize households, and cause higher inflation.

Harris also want to focus on care work, both for children and for the elderly, as important for the economy. Better care would help workers -- the vast majority of them women -- better balance care responsibilities and their careers. And it would help the women workers who provide paid care work while suffering inadequate wages and working conditions.

Although commentators criticize Harris for not providing enough detail on her economic policies, her proposals are a model of clarity compared with what Trump offers. The New York Times reports Harris has distributed an 82-page booklet on her proposals, compared to Trump who has ""coughed up a string of four- or five-word slogans promising tax cuts, some of which his advisers cannot fully explain."" '

Harris also is battling complex economic views held by voters. In spite of continued job creation, rising real wages, slowing inflation, and continued GDP growth, consumer confidence is sending mixed signals. September's Survey of Consumers from the University of Michigan rose 3% above August, ""as consumers' expectations for the economy brighten."" But the Conference Board's consumer confidence index suffered its largest drop ""since August 2021"" between August and September.

We're in the home stretch of the election, so don't expect significantly more policy details from Harris. Rather, she will continue emphasizing economic security and opportunity for the middle class, contrasting her optimistic vision against a bleaker and less coherent approach from Donald Trump. So far, that's working in her favor."
