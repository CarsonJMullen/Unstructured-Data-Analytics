Some Indian American Democrats see themselves in Harris. Others see the limits,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5131223/some-indian-american-democrats-see-themselves-in-harris-others-see-the-limits,2024-10-08T21:57:10Z,"In the warm Georgia heat, Kannan Udayarajan is sipping chai and talking politics at an Indian restaurant in a small strip mall in suburban Atlanta.

There used to be only one Indian restaurant here, Udayarajan says, in this corner of adjoining suburbs at the edge of Forsyth County.

""Now in a 10 mile radius we probably have 40 to 50 at a minimum.""

The exponential rise in Indian restaurants follows a wave of Desi immigrants here. Desi is a term many people from the South Asian diaspora use to describe themselves. These immigrants are no longer primarily landing in traditional South Asian strongholds, like California and New York, but are also reshaping states like Texas and Georgia, helping transform metropolitan suburbs into some of the most diverse spaces in American life. Indian Americans now make up the second largest immigrant population in the United States.

Udayarajan says he's been a political junkie ever since he came to America for work in 2007. He hadn't planned to stay, but he got married and had kids, and in 2018 he became a citizen. Still, he didn't get involved in local politics until 2020, when former President Donald Trump was running for his second term. Udayarajan organized in his own community, helping register Indian Americans to vote, sometimes teaching them about American democracy.

""Joe Biden won Georgia by 11,780 votes,"" he says. ""And Forsyth County polled16,000 brand new Democratic votes in that election. So we made an impact.""

South Asians are one of the most progressive Asian American communities, a realignment that dates back to 9/11 and the policies and racial animus that followed. A recent Pew Research Center study found that 68 percent of Indian registered voters identify as Democrats or Democratic-leaning.

Two years ago, Udayarajan became the head of the Forsyth County Democratic Party. He says this year, he believes Desis could again make the difference in a battleground state like Georgia.

Udayarajan is joined at the restaurant by Ashwin Ramaswami, a 25-year-old who was born and raised just a few blocks away in Johns Creek. Udayarajan asks Ramaswami if he thinks the South Asians here are excited about Vice President Kamala Harris' nomination for president.

""I see a huge amount of excitement,"" Ramaswami tells him. Udayarajan asks if it's more among the immigrant community or among folks who were born here?

""I think everyone,"" Ramaswami says. ""It's so different to have a presidential nominee called Kamala, right? Kamala is a Sanskrit word.""

A meme circulating on messaging apps and other social media has been hard to miss. The meme goes that in Sanskrit, Kamala means ""lotus,"" but in America Kamala means POTUS -- President of the United States.

""The ticket's been supercharged for the Desi community,"" Ramaswami says. He points out a personal overlap: Harris' mother is from the same village as his mother in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu.

""People can see the connections, they can see their own stories in her, because politics -- a lot of it is about the policy, but it's also about can you trust the person you're going to be electing.""

Ramaswami left John's Creek to go off to school, and then work. Now he's returned and is making a run for Georgia state Senate. He's part of another growing group -- young South Asian Americans running for office.

At the Democratic National Convention in Chicago this past summer, South Asians gathered everywhere: Delegate meetups and happy hours and networking lunches.

""For all the years that I've been involved in politics, I've been part of the broader Asian American community,"" says Ann Lata Kalayil, co-founder of the South Asian American Policy and Research Institute. ""But more recently, we've started talking about South Asian Americans."" She points out the number of times she heard ""Indian American"" mentioned on the DNC stage and in the media to describe Harris. ""There's a real sense of pride, you know?""

Deep Singh Badhesha grew up in predominantly white Colorado Springs, Colo.

""I was the only South Asian there,"" he says. ""I was always trying to find my identity, but it was hard,"" he says, because no one at school looked like him. He describes experiencing a classic Asian American childhood experience -- the lunchbox moment. ""Your mother will make you a deliciously cooked Indian dish"" Badhesha explains, ""and you'll bring it to school and you open it up and everyone's like, oh, what the hell is that gross food?""

He says when it happened to him he felt like an outsider, so he broke off parts of himself to fit in.

""I used to actually be a super Republican and libertarian person because I used to look for folks like Bobby Jindal or Nikki Haley. And I'm like -- 'oh this is where South Asians look like they're having acceptance, right?'""

Then he went to college and met South Asian peers.

""They instilled a lot more pride in who I was,"" he says.

Badhesha believes things are different now.

""Being in this moment and seeing a lot of young folks in particular who see themselves in the Democratic Party -- who see themselves in Ro Khanna or Pramila Jayapal -- and of course Kamala Harris at the top of the ticket, you know, it's like a huge moment for South Asians.""

Back in the Atlanta suburbs, another group of South Asians are meeting to talk politics, but there is no celebration over Harris' nomination.

""It stings, right?"" says Anjali Enjeti. ""I mean, boy, would I love to celebrate a Black, Jamaican, Indian woman.""

Enjeti says she cannot support Harris because of the Democratic party's political, military and financial support for Israel, and what is happening in Gaza and in other parts of the Middle East.

""It feels like a betrayal that when we finally get somebody who we can relate to in some way, to have them support and enforce a genocide is -- it's just devastating.""

Israel stands accused of war crimes and genocide in front of the International Criminal Court, whose preliminary finding is that it is plausible Israel has violated the convention against genocide. Israel and the Biden administration strongly deny the charges.

Enjeti and Harris are both half Indian, and they can each trace their roots back to southern India. Enjeti says that is where the similarities to Harris end.

""I think identity politics is a trap,"" she says. ""It is a trap to think that somebody's shared demographics or community has anything to do with your values.""

Enjeti is sitting with Farhana Rahman, remembering 2020. They registered voters and knocked on doors and drove people to the polls.

""We were screamed at,"" Enjeti says. ""We faced very real physical threats. We risked it all for Biden to win in Georgia.""

""That same me has done nothing this election cycle,"" Rahman adds.

Rahman says as an Indian American Muslim, she believes another Trump presidency is a ""existential threat to democracy,"" even potentially to her own safety. But she says she doesn't feel safe now. She says she's afraid to speak out against the conflict in Gaza and she's reluctant to tell colleagues and acquaintances that she is Muslim.

""I feel like I have to hide my identity,"" she says. ""It's unfortunate, but the level of Islamophobia, just making it so prevalent -- people can say horrible things to Muslims, and it's completely okay.""

She believes she has faced more Islamophobia and repression in the past year than she did after 9/11.

""After October 7th, it has become extremely dividing to the point where being a Muslim automatically means you are pro-Hamas and [an] anti-Semite.""

Rahman says she still doesn't know who she will vote for on Election Day, but she says the options only fill her with sadness and fear."
The Power And Prescience Of Octavia Butler's 'Parable Of The Sower' : 1A,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/1210938285/1a-10-08-2024,2024-10-08T18:40:09Z,"It's 2024. Extreme weather events due to global warming have overwhelmed parts of the United States. Water is increasingly scarce. The mass migration of people in search of more livable conditions has caused political tension and border closures. A drug epidemic spreads across the country. And a candidate for president promises he can fix the country's problems with more religion and fewer regulations.

That's the premise of Octavia E. Butler's novel Parable of the Sower, which was published in 1993.

The novel contains a powerful and poignant vision of the United States of the future, one that rings scarily true in the present. The 2024 of Butler's 1993 work isn't so far away from the 2024 in which we'll all currently living. Butler published a sequel, Parable of the Talents, in 1998. Both feature a protagonist named Lauren Olamina, a young woman trying to survive and make a life for herself.

What can we learn from Butler's novel? What makes both Sower and Talents so enduring as a series of speculative science fiction? And what does it mean that our world more and more bears resemblance to works of apocalyptic fiction?"
LGBTQ+ women face disproportionate rates of mental health issues and barriers to care,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5131619/lgbtq-women-mental-health-care,2024-10-08T11:07:09Z,"LGTBQ+ women face high rates of trauma and other mental health problems, a new report finds. SDI Productions/E+/Getty Images hide caption

A leading national survey finds that 22% of LGBTQ+ women respondents have attempted suicide, and 66% reported seeking treatment for trauma.

""The trauma burden in this community is enormous,"" said Jaime Grant, one of the researchers who conducted the survey.

These findings are included in a report released Tuesday from the Urvashi Vaid National LGBTQ+ Women's Community Survey, named after the late lesbian activist. The report comes from analysis of a national survey of 5,000 LGBTQ+ respondents who previously or currently identify as a woman, conducted between June 2021 and June 2022.

The analysis finds that LGBTQ+ women experience substantial health disparities, mental illness and barriers to care.

These findings come more than a decade after Grant's earlier research found that transgender people had attempted suicide at a rate nine times higher than the national average. Grant, who also led the National Transgender Discrimination Survey in 2011, said those data helped improve medical treatment for transgender people. She hopes this report will do the same for LGBTQ+ women.

The survey found that respondents experience higher rates of mental illness than the general population. Nearly half of respondents live with anxiety (44%) or depression (51%). The National Association on Mental Illness reports 19% of U.S. adults have an anxiety disorder and the Center for Disease Control and Prevention reports 18% of U.S. adults have depression. The survey also found differences among race -- Black and indigenous women of color reported higher rates of disability and attempted suicide.

""It's distressing to see such high trauma rates, but it's consistent with what we've seen in the past,"" says Christina Dyar, an assistant professor at the Ohio State University who studies health disparities in LGBTQ+ communities and wasn't involved in this report.

The survey also sought to identify barriers to health care for LGBTQ+ women. Research shows that 77% of the U.S. population has a primary care physician, but just over half of LGBTQ+ women in the survey reported being under the care of one. Black and indigenous women of color were twice as likely to say they lacked access to quality health care.

Respondents cited cost and discrimination as the leading reasons for why they put off or didn't seek out medical care when they were sick or in need. Dyar says there's been limited research done to determine what exactly limits access to care for LGBTQ+ women. ""These numbers are great to have.""

""Historically, medical spaces have not been safe for us,"" says Savy Elahian, who led the data analysis for this report and serves as a program coordinator with the National LGBTQ Institute of Intimate Partner Violence.

""There's been experimentation [on people], there's been medical racism. It's important to understand the historical impacts, especially for LGBTQ+ people of color.""

Elahian says the medical field is behind on understanding how to fully serve LGBTQ+ people, which can leave patients feeling unaffirmed and uncomfortable. This discomfort can impact how likely it is they'll return to a provider when they're in need, which can be especially dangerous when thinking about preventative care.

According to the survey, 14% of respondents had never had a pap smear and all respondents were nearly twice as likely to have cervical cancer than women in the general U.S. population. A 2022 study found that nearly 1 in 3 lesbian, gay, and bisexual women were overdue on cervical cancer screenings.

""LGBTQ+ women and gender-diverse people are really missing out on preventative care and holistic wellness,"" says Elahian. While community-oriented care can help address certain health disparities, community centers and organizations can sometimes lack sufficient resources.

""[LGBTQ+ people] still need to operate in these larger health systems,"" they add. ""It's a bit inevitable.""

Report authors Grant and Elahian say they hope the medical field will learn from these findings.

""This is powerful data that people need to listen to,"" Elahian said, ""from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to doctor's offices to medical universities.""

Grant noted how the 2011 National Transgender Discrimination Survey and follow-up surveys helped to put numbers to suffering, reshape medical school curricula, and served as a model and resource for other researchers. She hopes the same thing will happen here.

While the Urvashi Vaid National LGBTQ+ Women's Community Survey has been led by community activists and researchers, it's moving to a more prominent organization in an effort to boost its reach and impact. The survey will now be housed at the National Center for Lesbian Rights, the group announced on Tuesday.

""This is enormous for us,"" says Imani Rupert-Gordon, the organization's president. ""We aren't able to fully advocate for our community if we don't know what's happening in our community.""

The Center, which serves as a litigation organization, will look to include the survey's findings in their policy recommendations.

Grant and her team want these findings to go beyond just the doctor's office and courtroom, though. ""This data needs to go to our own people, so they can know the current state of our health,"" says Elahian. To do that, they've made the findings free and accessible to all and hope to disseminate the research through LGBTQ+ community groups.

Dyar emphasizes community-led surveys are often more accessible and tend to reach more respondents. Academic health disparity research ""often ends up behind a paywall,"" she says. ""It can be really frustrating when our findings don't get out there.""

Elahian hopes that community education will foster people's ability to self-advocate in medical settings -- yet another example of how community support helps strengthen this resilient group."
'Fresh Kill' imagined a contaminated city. 30 years later it feels spot-on,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/08/nx-s1-5132641/fresh-kill-staten-island-shu-lea-cheang-film,2024-10-08T09:02:14Z,"Filmmaker Shu Lea Cheang, 70, had been on the road for about two weeks of a month-long road trip across the United States when she met a reporter in Ann Arbor before a screening of her 1994 experimental film Fresh Kill.

""When the film first came out, many people didn't quite get it,"" Cheang said. She wore bright orange trousers and her white hair was cropped close to her scalp.

Fresh Kill is neither a horror movie nor a documentary. It's an experimental film, taking its name from the Fresh Kills landfill on Staten Island that, at its peak, took in about 29,000 tons of garbage every day. The ginormous landfill is now a park.

The film has aged well. Its surreal, sci-fi inflected story of pollution and environmental inequality feels prescient, and the film's vision of a contaminated city is scathing, funny and surreal. Characters include concerned lesbian moms, eco-terrorists and wealthy business bros who snack on sushi that turns their skin glowing green.

Shu Lea Cheang is a leading new media and multimedia artist, who's exhibited at museums all over the country, including the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York and the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis. She was the first to create a web-based artwork for the Guggenheim Museum and won this year's LG Guggenheim Award.

Cheang joined New York's vibrant downtown theater scene in the 1980s after moving there from Taiwan. Fresh Kill is filled with many of its faces, including George C. Wolfe (former artistic director of the Public Theater), and National Book Award finalist Jessica Hagedorn, who also wrote Fresh Kill's screenplay. The soundtrack is by Vernon Reid, who founded the band Living Colour. New York rents have priced out Cheang, who now lives in Paris though she has been for decades an American citizen.

New York University, which holds Cheang's archives, recently restored the original 35mm film.

That's when Cheang decided to take her film on a road trip, to be screened across the country. ""I wrote to every cinema that had 35mm projection capacity,"" she said. ""So romantic, right?""

Jazz Jones, who is one of two young filmmakers traveling with Cheang, met her last year at a Florida film festival where he first saw her one of her movies.

""I was just like, this is freaking insane. I have to talk to this woman,"" he recalled. ""And she starts talking about this trip and I'm like, 'Can I be your driver?'""

Jean-Paul Jones, who is also accompanying Cheang, is a projectionist in addition to being a filmmaker, a useful skill on a trip when the film print is handed off and inspected at 21 theaters in 33 days. The theaters that have the capacity to screen the film tend to be among the most beautiful and eclectic in the country, including Chicago's Music Box Theatre, the Harris Theater in Pittsburgh and Cine Athens in Georgia.

As they travel, Jones and Franklin are filming their own documentary about the experience, which so far has included stops in Flint, Mich., to discuss the water crisis with people who live there, and a detour for lunch at a Haitian restaurant in Springfield, Ohio."

Gospel great Cissy Houston has died at the age of 91,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/1105956461/cissy-houston-has-died,2024-10-07T20:51:50Z,"Singer Cissy Houston performs onstage during the 2012 BET Awards in Los Angeles, California.

Cissy Houston, a singer whose career began in childhood and spanned generations and genres from gospel to pop, has died. As a child, Houston performed with her siblings, and she later sang backing vocals with Elvis Presley, Aretha Franklin, Van Morrison and more. She was also a renowned solo gospel artist and the mother of one of the biggest pop and R&B stars in the world, Whitney Houston. She was 91 years old.

Houston was born in 1933, as Emily Drinkard, in Newark, N.J., to a musically gifted family. As a child, she was expected to perform at local churches with her brothers and sisters.

""I was 5 years old and they had to put me on a stool in order to see me,"" she told WHYY's Fresh Air in 1998. ""Of course, at 5 years old, I wanted to be out playing with everyone else and it was difficult for me. There was no question. I didn't have a choice.""

Her family group, The Drinkard Singers, became one of the first groups to release a gospel album on a major record label. A Joyful Noise was released in 1959 by RCA Records.

In the 1960s, Houston decided she wanted to sing secular music and formed the group The Sweet Inspirations. Under Houston's leadership, it earned a reputation as one of the best background groups in the business, appearing on hundreds of songs and helping to shape classics ranging from Van Morrison's ""Brown Eyed Girl"" to Dusty Springfield's ""Son of A Preacher Man.""

The group's first album, the self-titled The Sweet Inspirations recorded in 1967, peaked at No. 12 on Billboard's Hot Soul Albums, and its crossover hit single ""Sweet Inspiration"" reached the top 20 of the Hot 100 singles chart.

Along with Sylvia Shemwell, Myrna Smith and Estelle Brown, Houston sang backup for Jimi Hendrix, Simon and Garfunkel, The Drifters, Wilson Pickett and Houston's niece Dionne Warwick, who was once part of the group with her sister Dee Dee Warwick, before each became a solo artist.

An innovative musician, Houston used four background voices rather than the standard three and doubled her top part to enrich the sound. She explained her process to Fresh Air using the song ""You Make Me Feel Like A Natural Woman"" by Aretha Franklin, as an example.

""'Natural Woman' was like ... you try to enhance what she's done. That's the gist of doing background,"" Houston said. ""A lot of times, backgrounds make songs and really sell them.""

Still, after spending a lot of time in the background, Houston was ready for the spotlight. ""I was becoming an artist in my own right and that's when I left The Sweet Inspirations and became a single artist,"" Houston said.

She was also torn between professional demands and being a mom. Long hours and touring across the country kept her from seeing her children as much as she desired. She had two sons, Gary Garland and Michael, and a daughter, Whitney, who would go on to be one of the biggest pop stars of all time.

Cissy and Whitney Houston were famously close. Their relationship was also one of mentor and protégé.

""She's my mom. She's my friend. She's my teacher,"" Whitney Houston explained on Entertainment Tonight in 1987. ""She's like a little gas station. When you need some strength, you just go to Mom, and she fills you.""

Whitney died when she was only 48, after years of battling addiction and a notoriously troubled marriage. In 2013, Cissy Houston wrote a book, Remembering Whitney: My Story of Love, Loss, and the Night the Music Stopped. The memoir upset her granddaughter, Bobbi Kristina Brown, who would later also die tragically at the age of 22. In a since-deleted tweet, Brown expressed her anger. ""I find it 2b disrespect2mymother & me being her daughter won't tolerate it,"" she wrote.

The memoir's treatment of rumors about Whitney Houston's closeted lesbian relationship also led to a memorable moment with Oprah Winfrey.

""Would it have bothered you if your daughter, Whitney, was gay?"" Winfrey asked Cissy Houston in a 2013 interview on OWN's Next Chapter.

Houston stayed true to her roots in other ways. For more than 50 years, through triumphs and tragedies, Cissy Houston led the Youth Inspiration Choir at her hometown Baptist church in Newark."
Will Ferrell & Harper Steele's Roadtrip Across America : Fresh Air,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/1210938272/will-and-harper,2024-10-07T19:59:30Z,"Will Ferrell & Harper Steele's Roadtrip Across America : Fresh Air Will Ferrell and his longtime friend and former SNL writing partner Harper Steele traveled from New York to California, talking along the way about Steele coming out as a trans woman. Their documentary, Will & Harper, is now streaming on Netflix.

Also, classical music critic Lloyd Schwartz reflects on ""maverick"" composer Charles Ives."
'Will & Harper' navigate transition and friendship in a cross-country road trip,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/nx-s1-5140106/will-ferrell-harper-steele-transition-road-trip,2024-10-07T17:33:32Z,"A few of years ago, Will Ferrell found out that his close friend and former Saturday Night Live writing partner was coming out as a trans woman named Harper Steele.

""It was a complete surprise, knowing Harper for as long as I did, ... I didn't see it coming,"" Ferrell says. ""And then you fall back on, What do I do? What's the right thing to say? How should I say it?""

The new Netflix documentary, Will & Harper, follows Ferrell and Steele as they drive from New York to California, talking about their friendship and Steele's transition. Along the way, they make various pit stops, including to a dive bar in Oklahoma, an Indiana Pacers basketball game and a steakhouse in Amarillo, Texas -- some places that Steele fears would be unsafe for her to visit alone as a trans woman.

""They're wonderful places where all kinds of humanity, all kinds of Americans exist, and I love 'em now as much as I did [prior to transitioning],"" Steele says. But, she adds, ""It's always a little bit more fraught [now]. And I don't know if it's because I'm a woman or if it's because I'm a trans woman. I can't quite discern that at this point.""

At the Texas steakhouse, a crowd gathered to photograph Ferrell, but the friends soon felt the energy in the room shift. Their discomfort was confirmed when they later saw hateful and transphobic social media posts from people at the restaurant.

""I just carried a little bit of the guilt and the burden of like, Why did we even go in there? There was no need to,"" Ferrell says. "" And yet I think it's a powerful part of the film. ... It turned out to be kind of valuable for me to feel that and to see that that kind of hate does exist out there for the trans community.""

For Steele, the film was less about the cross-country journey and more about her decades-long friendship with Ferrell and an exercise in vulnerability: ""I was just looking at [it as], this would be an interesting way to have a conversation about this subject with someone that I care about.""

On coming out as a trans woman later in life

Steele: It wasn't a decision about right timing. It was a decision about living in misery and not wanting to do that anymore. So it just took me a long time to finally give up -- and I do think of it as a giving up. I just collapsed into myself and found the other side and it's been so much better. ...

I've discovered that vulnerability is truly a really powerful superpower. I'm not calling that a feminine trait. ... For me personally, to walk out of my house in a dress was a very vulnerable and raw moment, and what became of that moment was pure joy. So trusting vulnerability more has been something that truly has been helpful to me.

On Ferrell's response to Steele's coming out

Ferrell: You get an email from a friend announcing this kind of dramatic news and I didn't really stop to think how much pain, how much anguish there was to get to that point, how much thought it took to write that email. ... This was something that obviously was a part of her this whole time, and the sadness of her kind of putting it aside, kind of squashing it down, but then the courage that it took to get to that point where she was like, ""Enough, I'm going to give up the fight."" I just learned how incredibly strong she is, how articulate she is. She's always made me laugh. ... And a lot of people have come up to us just saying, ""It's just nice to see friends stick up for each other."" I think that's what we're most proud of about this whole thing.

On correcting people who misgender her

Steele: When it comes to friends, I sort of feel out the situation, If people are misgendering me and it's annoying me, then I correct them. If it's friends, I correct them in my funny way. But I don't like my friends to feel on edge around me talking about my transition or talking about who I am now. I don't want them to feel that. So I'm not interested in nailing everyone around me.

Ferrell: What's happened with me, though, as I've become more comfortable with it and it's become second nature, I've found a certain vigilance when we're out together and someone by chance does misgender Harper, I'm like, ""Excuse me, no ... She. Her.""

On hugging

Steele: Will has pointed out many times that before I transitioned, hugging was not in the equation. Will would hug me knowing that I would go stiff as a board and just hate it and now I'm a hugger so I will accept all hugs from good friends between men and women, between anyone. ... It has meaning. It's touch, it's ""I care about you"" and that's wonderful.

On being aware of her face more now as a woman

Steele: Hollywood, in the business that I work in, we value faces. Somehow Will Ferrell slipped through.

Ferrell: Somehow. ... But I'm going to get some work done after this.

Steele: We value faces. And so I like the middle of the country because it's me. There's people out there, like real people.

Ferrell: You can be ugly. And we can look distinguished. ... I'm in comedy, so it's not critical for me to worry about that. But it's not my nature anyway. And, in fact, I remember doing a Q&A somewhere, and one of the questions from the audience was, ""Why are your eyebrows so white?"" I said, ""Because I have gray hair. It's called the aging process."" So I'm almost a poster child for not doing anything in that regard.

On not wanting to change her voice

Steele: I think it's important for me to tell people that I am first a human being and second, a trans person and third, a woman. So I'm not that overly concerned about passing. I like being gendered correctly, I do. But passing is something that a lot of trans people want and need and should have if that's what they want. But for me, it's not as important. I would love to be prettier, but I'm not sure I'm different than a lot of women in the world. And I wish I had been born with a different voice. But this is who I am. But these things are fluid, too. I could tomorrow start voice lessons. I doubt I will, but who knows? Your gender is a slippery thing for some people, and I'm happy about that."

And, key factors for Michigan voters",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/07/g-s1-26654/up-first-newsletter-october-7-anniversary-attack-israel-michigan-voters,2024-10-07T12:12:54Z,"Good morning. You're reading the Up First newsletter. Subscribe here to get it delivered to your inbox, and listen to the Up First podcast for all the news you need to start your day.

One year ago today, Hamas launched an ambush attack on Israel, killing around 1,200 people and taking hostages. This unleashed the deadliest war in Palestinian history. According to the Gaza health ministry, at least 41,000 people in Gaza have been killed by Israeli airstrikes and fire. Now, Israel is bombing Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Hear directly from people in Israel, Gaza and the West Bank as they describe how one year of this war has upended their lives. For more coverage marking this anniversary, check out NPR's special series page.

The war in the Middle East is personal in the swing state of Michigan. The GOP and Democrats are focused on the Arab and Muslim American voting bloc, and the state has the largest Lebanese American population in the country. Many in the state have families living in the areas of Lebanon that are being bombed right now.

A new report has found that both Harris' and Trump's economic plans would increase the national debt. According to the nonpartisan nonprofit Committee for Responsible Federal Budget, Trump's plan would add an estimated $7.5 trillion to the nation's debt over the next decade, while Harris' proposals would cost the government an estimated $3.5 trillion. The committee has cautioned that there could be a future fiscal crisis if politicians do not take more decisive action on the national debt. Let's take a closer look at the details of both economic plans.

NPR is visiting six key swing states that will likely decide this year's historic election. This week, Morning Edition is in Michigan to listen to voters about what matters to them and how that will affect their vote.

Michigan, a ""blue wall"" state, is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House. But the victory won't be easy. Harris and former President Donald Trump remain in a close battle. Here are key factors that could decide which way Michigan swings:

This essay was written by Daniel Estrin, NPR's international correspondent in Jerusalem.

""The day still keeps surprising us,"" my colleague Anas Baba in Gaza texted me last Oct. 7, close to midnight.

I was at a hospital in southern Israel. The waiting room was full of parents in a daze, waiting for word about their children who had come under attack at an outdoor techno rave near the Gaza border. In Gaza, our producer Anas was taking photos of families fleeing their homes as Israeli airstrikes rained down.

It was the deadliest day in Israeli history. It sparked the deadliest war in Palestinian history. One year later, it has grown into a regional war. Every day keeps surprising us.

A year later, I find myself thinking about where the survivors and witnesses of this war draw strength.

I think about Batya Ofir, a woman my colleague Itay Stern and I met the other day at Kibbutz Be'eri, the Israeli village that suffered the greatest loss -- 102 people there were killed. Her brother was killed along with his family. She felt survivor's guilt, and she told us she asked herself whether she wanted to keep on living.

""I really thought about it. And then I decided that I wanted to continue to live,"" she said. Today, she is learning how to kayak in the sea to help her face her fears. ""I do everything to give some meaning to life now that they're gone.""

Our colleague Anas Baba in Gaza has been reporting for NPR in Gaza all year. Again and again, he has videotaped bodies brought into the morgue after Israeli airstrikes. He always trains his camera on young children, sheltering near the morgue, standing alone and watching silently as bodies are laid out.

What gives him strength, he said, is collecting biscuits and fruit to give to the children he meets. ""I can help them survive,"" he told me.

He often meets a young girl named Habiba at the hospital in central Gaza. She's been colorblind since birth. One day, she told Anas she saw a man drowning with water coming out of his nose. It wasn't water; it was blood.

""This girl does not know the color of blood,"" Anas told me. ""I wish all the children in Gaza were colorblind now."""
The borderless music of Gabriela Ortiz,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5081260/the-borderless-music-of-gabriela-ortiz,2024-10-07T09:10:33Z,"Gabriela Ortiz is occupying the Composer's Chair at Carnegie Hall this season. Marta Arteaga hide caption

Composer Gabriela Ortiz has paid some dues -- and now she's collecting. Earlier in her career, she walked out on sexist professors, rebuffed condescending musicians and once waited hours to meet with a conductor in hopes of simply hearing her own music performed. In 2019, she underwent treatment for colon cancer, which is now in remission.

Today, the 59-year-old Mexico City native is enjoying some well-deserved recognition. Ortiz has just begun a year-long composer's residency at Carnegie Hall, where her music and her programming will be heard in a variety of contexts. She's serving in similar roles this season at the Curtis Institute of Music in Philadelphia and the Castilla y León Symphony in Spain.

She's also cultivated a crushing schedule. In the past four years, Ortiz has premiered at least 10 major orchestral works, half of them championed by the Los Angeles Philharmonic and its star conductor Gustavo Dudamel, who has called her one of the most talented composers in the world and who will lead Ortiz's new cello concerto, written for Alisa Weilerstein, at Carnegie Hall on Oct. 9. Revolución Diamantina, a recent album of her works performed with Dudamel and his orchestra, has earned glowing reviews for how deftly it combines an array of musical languages, from high European modernism to the roots of Latin American folk.

Music, and hard-won confidence, run in the Ortiz family. Her grandfather, a classical music enthusiast, moved to Mexico from Basque Country, Spain, and saw Gustav Mahler conduct in New York while living on the East Coast. Ortiz's parents co-founded Los Folkloristas, the celebrated band dedicated to Latin American folk music and research, and she learned to play instruments in the group's outreach learning center for children. With the piano as her primary instrument, Ortiz realized early on that the life of a concert pianist was perhaps beyond her reach -- but the idea of composing blossomed after an early encounter with Béla Bartók's music, and from there, nothing could stop her ambitions.

From her studio in Mexico City, Ortiz joined a video chat for a far-ranging conversation about the role folk music plays in her work, the importance of speaking your mind in your art, and what it really means to be a composer from Mexico.

This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

Tom Huizenga: I first heard your music in 1998 at a Kronos Quartet concert, where the group played Altar de Muertos. In the final movement of that piece, there's a reference to an Indigenous music culture from Mexico -- a Huichol folk melody from the state of Nayarit. That same melody has now appeared in at least two more of your pieces, including the recent Kauyumari. What attracted you to this folk tune?

Gabriela Ortiz: I first heard it on a Huichol recording. Normally I never use direct quotations, but in this case, because the melody was very attractive, I just had to use it. The [folk musicians] play a violin that only has two strings, so I harmonized that melody and developed it rhythmically. The melody repeats and repeats -- and for the Huichol people, repetition is very important, because it's music you play in peyote ceremonies where hallucinations are a way to contact ancestors.

Your parents were founding members of the band Los Folkloristas, which specialized in Latin American folk music; was the use of that melody influenced by your childhood experiences?

No, I never heard Los Folkloristas play Huichol music. Normally, the folk music that we hear in Mexico is a mixture between European, Indigenous and African -- those are the three main roots. This came later, when I got the recording from the Institute of Anthropology, and I just fell in love with it.

What was it like growing up in a household steeped in folk music?

It was fun, because some of the rehearsals took place in our house. My father was an architect, so we had a big house, and in the basement was a studio full of instruments -- guitars, a charango and drums and different instruments, not only from Mexico but from Latin America. They had rehearsals in the evenings, and of course my parents said, ""Go to bed!"" But I never went to bed; I stayed in the hall trying to listen to the music.

I also met important musicians, like Atahualpa Yupanqui and Mercedes Sosa, who came to our house. Also Victor Jara, the Chilean singer -- the only time he came to Mexico, he stayed in our house. During the dictatorship of Pinochet, they captured him and cut off his hands. I remember my father crying when someone called to tell him that Victor Jara had died; he was shouting, ""No, no!"" and I didn't know what was happening. So yes, it was important for me not only musically, but also politically.

Did you ever play in the group with your parents?

Not in the group. Los Folkloristas had a school for people who wanted to learn folk music, so I played guitar and charango in the children's section. Sometimes I sat in with them for fun, but never in a concert hall.

Were you hearing any classical music in those early days?

Absolutely. My mother played piano for 18 years; she was a very good sight reader. And I remember my father took me to see a concert with Eduardo Mata, the conductor who was one of our greatest directors in the history of music in Mexico. He was conducting the London Symphony, and I remember that they played Manuel de Falla's El sombrero de tres picos and I was like, ""Oh my God!"" I just loved it.

My father was an architect, but he wanted to be a classical composer. He couldn't do it because my mother died very young, and he got depressed and said, ""Well, I don't know if I'm going to be a composer, but my daughter could be a composer."" So, suddenly he put all of his thinking into my career.

Whose idea was it for you to become a composer?

I remember when I was 7 or 8 years old, my mother said, ""I'm seeing that you love music and you play the guitar. Why don't you start learning the piano, and learn how to read music?"" So I started piano lessons. When I was about 13 years old I changed to a new teacher, and this woman was like a Mexican version of Nadia Boulanger. She was a very good teacher of harmony and solfège, and she introduced me to Béla Bartók. At the time, I was playing Mozart, Bach and Schumann, but when I first heard Bartók's music I said, ""Wow, what is this?"" I immediately had a connection, probably because of the rhythm and the modal language. It was a totally different thing. I said, ""I want to write little pieces for piano like Bartók,"" so I started composing for the piano. Then I realized, I'm not going to be a concert pianist -- that's not my goal. I want to be a composer.

I feel like Mexico is still rather under the radar in terms of people knowing about its rich history in classical music. Carlos Chávez or possibly Silvestre Revueltas are the only composers many people know, even classical fans. Why is that?

There is no interest. When I was studying in England, they didn't know who Revueltas or Chávez was. They didn't care about what was happening in Latin America. Also, in Latin American institutions, you learn Western European music, basically. It's part of the canon in all the universities. German Romanticism is strongly emphasized -- Beethoven, Bach. But do we really know all of the contributions by Villa-Lobos or by Ginastera, or even by Revueltas?

Many young Latin American composers move to Europe, because they want their music to be played. They compromise their language because they are composing in a very European style. For me, that's one of the other problems. I mean, of course, if they want to compose like that, it's OK. But many of them compose in the spectralism style, like that of Tristan Murail or Helmut Lachenmann.

You teach at the National Autonomous University in Mexico City. Do your students choose to compose in that European style?

Some of them. Of course, if they want to compose like that, there is nothing that I can do -- I have to respect their freedom, and I can only speak for myself. That style doesn't work for me; I don't belong to that. I was not born in Germany, so why do I have to compose like Lachenmann or Wolfgang Rihm? I'm totally different.

This leads me to wonder: What does it mean to you to be a Mexican composer? I think it was Virgil Thomson who was once asked how you define American music, and he said: ""It's music made by someone with an American passport."" Is it that simple for you, or is there more to it?

This is the most important thing: When I do my music, I write what I have to say. I'm not thinking, ""Okay, this is going to sound really Mexican"" -- never. If I use a Huichol melody, it's because I really like it. But if I find a melody from Bali, maybe I will use it as well. What's important is what you do with that.

It's very difficult to define Mexico, because Mexico is huge. It's not the same in the North as in the South or the center. One of the main problems is that people try to put a specific label on Latin American music, and that's totally wrong because Latin America is so different -- Argentina from Mexico, or from Venezuela, or the Caribbean countries.

I feel like your music has a singular language, but there are influences as well. First and foremost, I hear Stravinsky -- those stabbing rhythms in your ballet Revolución Diamantina, also in Téenek and Clara. What draws you to Stravinsky?

Stravinsky is one of my favorite composers. He's a genius. I still believe that The Rite of Spring is one of the most important orchestral pieces in the 20th century. There is a strong pulse and an irregularity in Stravinsky that I really like; you're always feeling that it's changing and giving you something new. Latin American music can be very regular, but if you analyze my music, rhythmically speaking, it's very irregular.

You change meters a lot.

Yes, and this is something that I learned from Stravinsky. But you have to understand that we have the right to absorb those composers. The [perception] is, ""Oh, you're a Mexican, so you cannot address Beethoven."" But Beethoven is universal. He's as important to me as he is to the German people. I also come from this European tradition; the Spanish were here in Mexico. It's a big problem when you talk about borders in music. There are no borders. Mahler belongs to me. Why not?

And so do György Ligeti and Olivier Messiaen -- I hear little essences of those modernist composers in your ballet, and in the violin concerto Altar de Cuerda. You're agile at blending avant-garde and European classical traditions with Latin American folk styles. Do you have a sense of what your own music sounds like?

It's difficult to explain in a rational way, but it comes very natural. I'm absorbing everything. It's just there, it's part of who I am, and Debussy is as important as Perez Prado or mariachi music. If I need to have that kind of influence for a specific reason, I will use it. For example, in the fifth movement of my ballet -- the protest section -- there is a samba. But it's not there because I want to sound Latin American by using a Brazilian samba. There's a political reason to use it.

I find the element of rhythm is so strong in your music. In works like Kauyumari, Yanga, Téenek and especially the trumpet concerto Altar de Bronce, the beats make you want to shake your hips.

I like to work with rhythm; it comes naturally. And I like to dance. Probably, in my past life, I used to be a flamenco dancer.

How did some of these rhythms get to Mexico in the first place?

From Africa. People forget that in the 16th century, there was a very strong African influence in Mexico, and immediately the African slave population mixed with the Indigenous populations and with the Spanish. All these cultures mixed together was very strong in Mexico -- a melting pot. If you go to Vera Cruz, you dance danzón. There are so many things that stem from Africa.

So you have all of these Afro-Cuban and Indigenous Latin American rhythms in your music. How hard is it to get orchestral musicians, steeped in Brahms and Beethoven, to play those grooves with soul?

If the music is well-written, it's going to speak. I mean, you don't have to be Russian to play The Rite of Spring. You don't have to be Hungarian to play Bartók. I remember hearing Beethoven by [Venezuela's] Simon Bolivar Symphony, conducted by Dudamel -- and wow, what a version of Beethoven. Music is a universal language.

By my count, since 2020 you have had 10 major orchestral premieres -- half of them conducted by Gustavo Dudamel -- and that's not counting the world premiere of your cello concerto for Alisa Weilerstein, or your non-orchestral premieres. That's a lot of music. What does that say about your career?

It's very exciting. If you had asked me this question 20 years ago, I would never have imagined that I would be in this position, especially here in Mexico. I don't know how I did it, really. But I can tell you that I worked very, very hard. It was a unique opportunity when I wrote Téenek for Gustavo -- that was my first piece for him, and I put all my effort into writing a good piece, because I knew that it was going to be something that would either open the door or close it.

Are you at the peak of your career right now?

I don't know, but I'm very happy right now, and I'll tell you why: All composers need good performers to play their music. It is the only way we can learn, by listening to our music. That's why I talk to Gustavo about the need for a pan-Latin American initiative, because believe me, the opportunities here are 10 times harder than in other countries.

Why is that?

Because we don't have as many orchestras as you do in the U.S., or as many opportunities. When I was a student, I wrote my first orchestral work under the guidance of Mario Lavista. And I was desperate to hear my piece. There was no orchestra at the university, so that was not an option. But you know what I did? I went to the Mexico Philharmonic Orchestra -- a professional orchestra -- with my score in hand and I said, ""I want to speak to the maestro."" They said, ""Do you have an appointment?"" I said, ""No. I will wait.""

I stayed for two hours to speak with Herrera de la Fuente. We met in his office and I told him, ""I want to hear my piece. That's all I need. I'm a student, I want to become a composer, and I want to hear it desperately."" He looked at the score and said, ""We'll call you."" Three months later, I received a call: ""We are going to play your piece."" That was the only way I could hear my music.

For me, the three pieces on your recent album with Dudamel leading the LA Phil mark a high point in your career. There's the short orchestral show piece Kauyumari, the diverse and deeply considered violin concerto Altar de Cuerda, and the expansive, politically charged ballet Revolución Diamantina, which translates as ""Glitter Revolution"" in English.

This is why I love the LA Phil and Gustavo, because they asked me what I would like to write. [I said,] ""I want to write a ballet."" And Gustavo said, ""Why don't you write something including choir, because we want to pair your piece with Beethoven's Ninth."" I told them it was going to have a very political theme, that I needed to express the femicide situation that is unbearable here in Mexico. And they said, ""Yes, do it.""

In the notes for the album, you mention that writing the ballet forced you to reach ""beyond the aesthetic languages I know, by experimenting with new tools."" Can you say more about the strategies you had to learn in order to write this piece?

I was exploring things like whispering and amplified voices, not just singing -- making noises, protesting and shouting slogans. Shouting things like, ""Con ropa o sin ropa, mi cuerpo no se toca"" [""With or without clothes, my body is not touched""]. It was totally out of my comfort zone; I never wrote music based on a street protest.

For example, the fourth movement -- it's very Stravinskian in some sections, but in others is the depiction of domestic violence. And I was trying to see how I could make the violence stronger and stronger in the music by raising the level of sound until you get to ""pa, tu, pa, ta,"" which represents the fighting. I was experimenting with the voices in a percussive way -- very different in the context of orchestral music, and in the context of a ballet.

The themes of gender inequality in the ballet make me think of your orchestral work Clara, inspired by the pianist-composer Clara Schumann, the overshadowed wife of composer Robert Schumann. You've said about this piece: ""Throughout history, women have had to overcome major obstacles marked by gender differences. There are many of us who have rebelled against these evident forms of injustice and struggled to gain recognition and a place in society."" That makes me wonder if you, yourself, have had to overcome similar obstacles as a woman composer?

Yes, sometimes. I remember I was very young, presenting a clarinet piece to a composition teacher, and the guy saw the score and he said, ""Think about Clara Schumann and Robert Schumann. Robert is better. Think about Fanny and Felix Mendelssohn. Felix is much better. Think about Alma Mahler and Gustav Mahler. Gustav is better. Don't you think women compose like they're cooking a recipe?"" When he said that, I took my score and I left the room and never came back.

Almost every woman composer I've talked to has a story. Kaija Saariaho told me about professors who didn't want to teach her because she was pretty and would get married and have children. Meredith Monk recalled men who made her feel like there was something wrong with her because she had a vision of what she wanted to do. But both of them also said there was no way anyone could stop them.

That's correct. I mean, I was very angry, but he didn't stop me from writing music. I always face the problem of being a woman composer, but also a Latin American composer. I remember when I was in Darmstadt, Germany [a hotbed of experimental music], one performer came to me and said, condescendingly, ""Oh, you're from Mexico -- so you're the kind of Mexican composer who works with melody and rhythm and harmony."" And I said, ""Yes. Is there a problem with that?"" I like music. And music is about melody, rhythm, harmony, chords -- not only about texture and noise.

You must feel a certain sense of pride, and responsibility, now that you're taking on the position of Composer's Chair at Carnegie Hall this season. What kind of freedom does this residency offer?

A lot of freedom. I proposed a series of concerts and they allowed me to collaborate with different ensembles, like the Ensemble Connect -- that concert will feature Latin American music. If I can help promote these incredible composers, I will do that. We're also doing an interdisciplinary project called Can We Know the Sound of Forgiveness, a collaboration with visual artist James Drake; the writer Benjamin Alires Sáenz from El Paso, Texas; Alejandro Escuer, the Mexican flutist; and The Crossing choir. I was able to propose that project, which was well received by the institution.

What kind of advice are you giving your students at the National Autonomous University in Mexico City who want to have a career as a composer?

I always tell them they have to work very hard and have a lot of discipline. Talent is important, of course, but it's not only about talent. You have to put all of your soul into your work. Every single piece has to be a winner, no matter if it's for solo clarinet or for orchestra. Another important thing is, they have to live their lives very intensely, because that's the fuel for your creativity, for life itself.

I have to tell you, I feel I made the right decision to stay in this country. When I finished my PhD in London, I was thinking maybe I should stay there because of the opportunities. I was also offered to teach at Indiana University and other places in the U.S. [But] I always thought that it was important for me to be here in Mexico. Because the Autonomous University is a free university -- it's tough to get in, but once you're in, you don't pay a single peso -- so people come from many different economic levels. For me, it's important, because I feel that I'm making a contribution to my country and to my own people. I feel like I'm putting a seed in each of them.

What kind of advice are you giving to yourself these days, given how busy you are writing music and navigating your rising reputation?

Sometimes I think: ""Why didn't this happen years ago? It's happening when I'm turning 60?"" So I have to be very wise with my time. I have to take care of myself. I exercise -- I'm wearing pants right now because I came from the gym. I have to live my life as well, every second. I have to enjoy the simple things. If I'm seeing a friend, I have to enjoy that moment. If I'm reading a book, I have to enjoy that.

Also, be sensitive about what's happening. Perhaps 10 years ago, I would have been more careful about the things I talk about, but not now. I'm in a position that if I need to talk about feminism, I will do it. If I need to talk about climate change, I will do it, because that matters to me. It's all a part of our life."
It's a close race for Michigan. These factors could decide it for Harris or Trump,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/06/nx-s1-5130163/michigan-2024-election-harris-trump,2024-10-07T09:06:21Z,"A Trump and Harris sign side-by-side in a neighborhood on Oct. 3, 2024 in Hillsdale, Mich. Sylvia Jarrus for NPR hide caption

Michigan is part of Vice President Harris' clearest path to the White House.

The state is part of the ""blue wall,"" along with Wisconsin and Pennsylvania, that she and Democrats need to hold to avoid a second Donald Trump presidency.

It's home to some of the key demographics that both parties are courting this election, from white voters without college degrees to the largest Black-majority city, Detroit, and one of the nation's largest Arab American populations.

But the path to victory is not easy this year. Harris and Trump remain in a close battle, as his populist message continues to resonate with white voters and union and blue-collar workers, particularly on the economy.

Dave Dulio, a professor of political science and director of the Center for Civic Engagement at Oakland University, says ""in places like Macomb County, with many blue-collar voters and union workers, Trump made inroads by pledging to get the U.S. out of bad trade deals and renegotiate NAFTA, which he did.""

""I think they still give him credit for that,"" he added.

Dulio underscores the state's significance by noting that small shifts could lead to substantial changes for candidates: ""If you take a small shift among the Arab American community and a small shift among union workers, those multiple small shifts could drive a very different result.""

Both candidates have heaped attention recently on the Wolverine State. On Oct 4, Harris visited a Redford Charter Township firehouse near Detroit, meeting union representatives. She met with Arab American and Muslim leaders then appeared with United Auto Workers union President Shawn Fain in Flint and vowed support for Michigan's auto industry. Trump held campaign events twice in September and took his presidential campaign to Saginaw Valley State University in Kochville Township on Oct. 3.

Michigan also plays to the strengths of the vice presidential nominees, who hail from the Midwest. Both Ohio Sen. JD Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz have stumped in the state in the last month.

To better understand the key issues shaping voters' decisions -- from the economy and immigration to abortion and U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East -- we are in Michigan this week hearing directly from voters and political observers as part of our ""We, The Voters"" series.

A September poll by The New York Times and Siena College found that Michigan voters cared most about the economy, followed by abortion and immigration.

Economy

Michigan's unemployment rate is historically low, according to state data, but it has slowly ticked up in recent months. Meanwhile, inflation has eased, but high costs of living remain a concern.

The state continues to suffer from the decades-long decline of automobile manufacturing, and high interest rates have constricted sales of cars, according to a September study from the University of Michigan.

Both parties are trying to put focus on the economy. GOP attack ads argue that Biden and Harris are responsible for inflation, while the vice president's messaging focuses on plans to uplift the middle class and paint Trump-era tax cuts as benefiting the wealthy.

Meghan Wilson, an expert in public policy and urban development, said Harris could expand the Democratic position on economics by appealing to Black business owners and holders of student debt.

""African Americans in Detroit have a lot of small businesses, and so we're looking for capital for those kinds of small businesses. I think Kamala Harris is doing a great job of bringing the small businesses into the conversation,"" Wilson explained.

Organized labor plays a key role in Michigan's economy. Both parties are making a play for Michigan's union members, who accounted for 13% of workers in the state last year. Exit polls in 2020 showed Michigan's union voters favoring President Biden over Trump, and Biden pledged to be ""the most pro-union president"" in U.S. history, which he backed up with a visit to UAW workers striking in Wayne, Mich.

Michigan pollster Bernie Porn said Biden's visit to striking workers helped him bump up his union support, but his policies to advance electric vehicles with tax credits were unpopular with Independent and Republican voters.

""You have Harris leading among union members with 63% which is almost where Biden was in 2020 with 65%, so she's improving her lot among union members, but still, the EVs are a problem,"" he said.

Still, one encouraging sign for the Harris campaign could be Michigan's local Teamsters union backing her candidacy, breaking with the national union that declined to endorse any candidate for U.S. president, after they had supported every Democratic candidate for president since Bill Clinton.

Abortion

Two years ago, Michigan voters approved a landmark amendment to the state constitution, securing the right to abortion and other reproductive health services.

Democrats won control of all three branches of Michigan's governments since making abortion a central voting issue.

But that success may have made it a less influential issue in the 2024 election. A KFF poll in June found that women in Michigan saw abortion as ""decided"" and they were more concerned about inflation and the rising cost of living.

""The Democrats are putting an awful lot of their eggs in the basket of abortion,"" the pollster Porn said.

Dulio pointed out that Trump's main weakness stems from what has driven Democratic success in every election -- and not necessarily abortion since it's already decided in the state: ""His character remains a key weakness. He's deeply unpopular because of the Jan. 6 spectacle and doubling down on his claims that the 2020 election was stolen. That just turns off persuadable voters,"" he said.

Michigan is home to one of the largest Black populations in the nation, ahead of Louisiana, Alabama and South Carolina, and the largest Black-majority city, Detroit.

Harris would herself be the nation's first Black woman president, but some Black voters may not be as motivated to vote as they were in 2020.

""The main challenge is the enthusiasm gap,"" said Ronald Brown, a political scientist at Wayne State University. He said among Black voters in Michigan, those who were in the ""black leadership class"" -- meaning serving in government, churches, Black fraternities and sororities -- were highly likely to vote for Harris. However, those without deep connections to the party, especially working-class and poor Detroit residents, were susceptible to sitting out elections. In particular, he pointed to Detroit's recent voter turnout -- higher in 2020 than it was in 2016 -- as a key factor explaining the state's pick for Biden after it went for Trump four years earlier.

""What could occur is that among working class and poor Black voters, lack of interest could lead to fatigue and this may drive those voters not to vote. And in Michigan, you don't need many. You need enough,"" he said.

Democratic state Sen. Sarah Anthony has a different perspective. She had seen an encouraging gain among young people to help shore up Harris' base.

""The Biden coalition included many working-class white men, a group Vice President Harris has struggled to win over. While there may have been losses there, the data I've seen shows significant gains due to increased enthusiasm among young people and people of color,"" she said.

U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East

The Detroit Metropolitan area has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the U.S. Dearborn, often called the Capital of Arab America, is home to a majority of Lebanese residents who maintain strong ties to southern Lebanon.

Arab and Muslim voters here were largely supportive of Biden in 2020. However, many have since been alienated by his handling of Israel's deadly war in Gaza and the administration's ongoing military aid to Israel. Many now are similarly concerned about Israel's continuing bombardment of Beirut and ground invasion along the countries' shared border.

Abbas Alawieh, a Dearborn Democratic strategist and one of the co-founders of the ""uncommitted movement,"" backed Biden in 2020. But earlier this year, he and other organizers successfully secured more than 100,000 ""uncommitted"" votes in the Michigan primary to protest Biden's handling of the war in Gaza.

Alawieh, who had advocated for a Gaza ceasefire, told Morning Edition host Leila Fadel that he feels more despair now as the conflict spreads to his family's homeland, Lebanon.

""This is a grieving community. So, for us to give guidance to vote for Kamala Harris, when she is part of the administration that's actively killing their family members, it's like giving a campaign speech at a funeral.""

Professor Dubio said the uncommitted movement has the potential to ""have a huge impact,"" and while he believes many of them will ultimately vote for Harris, he added, ""it can't and shouldn't be ignored.""

Abbas mentioned sending letters to Vice President Harris's team, including her national security advisor, requesting meetings with those directly affected by the wars in Gaza and Lebanon. ""So far, the answer is still no.""

He added that Donald Trump visited the community, took photos with leaders, and invited them to his campaign rally.

Saeed Khan, an associate professor of Near Eastern and Asian Studies at Wayne State University, said Muslim and Arab voters were drifting toward Trump in 2016, and some continue to do so today, not only because of a push away from Democrats, but also a pull toward the Republican party's values. Many Arabs and Muslims, immigrant Muslims, voted for the Republican ticket at least until September 11 and then started to move toward the Democratic Party.

""The Republican message of self-reliance, smaller government or less government intrusion, lower taxes, social conservatism really appealed to many, especially immigrant Muslims and Arabs, because it epitomized the American Dream that they had internalized,"" Khan said."
A controversial but effective treatment for meth addiction gains ground,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5140166/meth-cocaine-addiction-treatment-contingency-management,2024-10-05T11:04:00Z,"Bernard Groves has spent five years trying to quit methamphetamine.

He lost his job. He lost his car. He nearly lost his apartment. Worse than that, he says, his addiction has hurt his family.

""I went [to lunch] with my auntie and I saw such sadness in her eyes,"" Groves said.

The 35-year-old checked himself into several rehab programs in San Diego and San Francisco hoping ""to be that Bernard I used to be for the people that I love.""

But each time, Groves felt the progress he made in therapy morphed into people talking at him, telling him what to do. Eventually, he would always return to meth.

""My best friend was like, 'I don't get it, Bernard. You put your mind to something, you've always been able to achieve it. Why can't you get over this meth?' "" Groves said. ""I don't know why. And it feels awful.""

Unlike opioid addiction, there are no FDA-approved medications for the more than 3 million Americans addicted to stimulants like meth and cocaine. Instead, the most effective treatment is low-tech -- and more controversial: Give people retail gift cards usually worth less than $30 in exchange for negative drug tests. Research shows that it works, and after more than three decades of resistance, policymakers are finally giving that strategy a chance.

Offering people small rewards for not using drugs -- known as contingency management -- dates back to the 1980s. Patients are tested for drugs regularly over several months. They receive a gift card for every negative result, and payouts grow with each test.

The treatment is based on a well-established concept that positive reinforcement is an effective motivator. Animals pull levers when rewarded with food. Students' behavior improves by letting them watch TV after class. Compared to traditional counseling, researchers have found people are twice as likely to stop using meth or cocaine if they receive gift cards.

Studies suggest the immediate excitement of getting a gift card after a negative test replaces the dopamine rush people get from using drugs. Scientists hypothesize this activity effectively rewires our brains.

But the approach has failed to catch on in spite of the evidence.

Rick Rawson, a professor emeritus of psychology at UCLA and early proponent of contingency management, says many addiction care providers historically dismissed the treatment as a form of bribery.

""You would hear things like, this isn't treatment, this is just paying people not to use drugs,"" Rawson said. ""It wasn't a medicine. It wasn't talk therapy. It was this sort of transactional thing.""

Concerns of fraud have also stymied contingency management's growth. Rawson persuaded California health officials to fund a pilot program in 2005. But the work stopped abruptly after federal health officials warned participating clinics that the project ran afoul of rules designed to prevent doctors from luring patients into their offices and then charging Medicaid for care they never provided.

""I'd pretty much given up,"" Rawson said after Medicaid shut down the pilot. ""I figured this just isn't going to happen.""

Outside of the Department of Veterans Affairs, which has offered contingency management since 2011, the treatment lay dormant for nearly a decade. But attitudes began to shift after the synthetic opioid fentanyl fueled a rise in overdose deaths in the U.S., Rawson said.

""People started to recognize that a lot of these people are buying cocaine or methamphetamine and dying of fentanyl overdoses because fentanyl is mixed into the drug supply,"" said Rawson.

In the last four years, some states have relied on federal grants or court rulings against opioid manufacturers to fund their contingency management programs. In California -- where overdose deaths involving meth have skyrocketed -- health officials asked the federal government to allow the state to become the first in the nation to pay for contingency management with Medicaid dollars.

The Biden administration greenlit the plan along with a broader package of non-traditional health care services California is testing called CalAIM. Under the state's contingency management program, which launched last year, gift cards after each stimulant-free urine test start at $10 and climb up to $26.50. A patient who tests negative every time over six months can earn up to $599, which can be paid out individually or in a lump sum.

It's unclear if that is enough money to persuade people to quit. Most studies show contingency management works best when patients can make upward of $1,000. California picked a lower amount to avoid triggering tax problems for patients or compromising their eligibility for other public benefits like food assistance.

The value of the gift cards have worked for Bernard Groves. He's been off meth since the first week of July, one of his longest stretches since he started trying to shake the habit.

He's used the gift cards to buy exercise weights at Walmart and food for his pet bird London at Petco. He's also used the money to pick up donuts or a movie night with his mom, sister and grandma.

""Being able to treat my family and do things for them is special,"" Groves said. ""It brought some joy back in my life.""

He's surprised at how much pleasure he's gotten from the program.

""Like, how could you say you're excited to pee in a cup? But I was, every week.""

Groves hopes this approach will help him finally kick his meth use. Recent studies have found people are more likely to stay off stimulants for up to a year after these programs, compared to counseling and 12-step programs.

Nearly 4,000 people have participated in California's new program as of September 2024. Researchers at UCLA say at least 75% of urine samples submitted by patients in the program have been negative for stimulants, and clinics say many of their patients have gotten into housing, gone back to work and reconnected with their families.

But California has an estimated 210,000 people on Medicaid who are addicted to meth or cocaine. Medicaid in California generally only covers addiction treatment through specialty addiction clinics, so most people who get their treatment from primary care doctors, community health clinics or hospitals are unable to access contingency management.

Ayesha Appa is an addiction specialist who runs an HIV clinic at San Francisco General Hospital, where most of her patients are homeless, using meth and on Medicaid. She offered contingency management through a private grant until funding ran out in June, and she's ineligible to offer it through CalAIM.

""It feels both incredibly frustrating and just heartbreaking as a provider,"" Appa said, to know a powerful treatment exists that she can't offer. ""It feels like I have a patient living with diabetes, and instead of being able to offer them insulin, all I can do is talk with them about diet and exercise, even though I know there's a better option out there.""

She thinks often of one patient, a 45-year-old woman, who ""desperately wanted to stop using"" meth, but who struggled to quit. Appa urged her to visit a CalAIM clinic to get contingency management treatment, but the woman didn't trust other doctors. Ultimately, the woman overdosed and died.

""What if we could have offered her contingency management in the clinic that she was coming into already?"" Appa said. ""When I think about her, it's an equal mix of guilt and regret because it truly felt like we could have done more.""

California Medicaid Director Tyler Sadwith believes in the power of this treatment, but has taken a careful approach as the state attempts to scale this work because of the stigma contingency management still has among some health providers and lawmakers.

Sadwith said he appreciates that more people could benefit right now, but starting small gives proponents their best chance of convincing state and federal leaders to extend and expand the program beyond its current end date of 2026.

""We need to prove that this works and that this works well,"" Sadwith said. ""We feel the importance and the weight of getting this right"" as the first state in the nation to cover this sort of treatment under Medicaid.

To make sure programs deliver the treatment effectively and minimize the chance of fraud, California requires clinics go through extra training and inspections, and makes clinicians enter their results into a central database. Clinics also have to dedicate three staffers to the program, a workforce requirement that has forced some providers to delay starting the treatment or not participate at all.

So far, state officials have set aside $5.6 million to help clinics stand up their programs, and Sadwith is eager to reach more patients.

""We want to use this opportunity to prove to the public, to the field, to our federal partners, and to other states that this works,"" Sadwith said. ""People get better, and there is a role for contingency management in Medicaid.""

At least three other states -- Montana, Washington and Delaware -- are now running their own programs through Medicaid, and four others are seeking federal approval."
This horror genre is scary as folk - and perfect October viewing,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5138373/folk-horror-movies-the-wicker-man-midsommar-hereditary,2024-10-05T11:01:43Z,"It's October. Some of your neighbors will spend this, the official first weekend of spooky season, going all-out with inflatable yard skeletons and ghosts. They will embark upon the annual attempt to make candy corn, aka high-fructose ear wax, a thing. They'll adorn their front porches with those cotton spider webs that look nothing like real spider webs and instead just make it look like they went and ritually murdered a white sweater so they could hang its dismembered corpse across their doorway as a grisly warning to all other knitwear.

For me, it's a more simple, elemental formula: Hot cider, cider donuts, folk horror.

The appeal of cider and donuts is universal, but folk horror might need some defining. Essentially, it's horror set in remote, isolated areas where nature still holds sway. Well, nature paired with the superstitious beliefs of the locals, who tend to treat unwary outsiders with suspicion (if the outsiders are lucky) or malice (if they're not).

The classic example is 1973's The Wicker Man, in which an uptight, devout, and veddy veddy British policeman (Edward Woodward) visits a remote Scottish island to investigate the disappearance of a young girl. Turns out the locals have embraced a form of Celtic paganism, which doesn't sit right with him. He says as much to the island's aristocratic leader, a mysterious and charismatic sort played by Christopher Lee. Things don't end well for our poor British bobby - though presumably the island will enjoy a bountiful harvest, so, you know: Big picture, it's still a win.

Other founding classics of the genre include 1968's The Witchfinder General and 1971's The Blood on Satan's Claw, which of the three films has the least going for it, apart from its title, which is, all reasonable people can agree, metal AF.

I love me some folk horror, and am never happier than when I can while away a damp, foggy (and thus obligingly atmospheric) October afternoon mainlining new and old examples of the form like Kill List, You Won't Be Alone, Viy, The Ritual, Häxan, The Medium, Apostle, Midsommar, The Witch, Hereditary, Night of the Demon, A Field in England, Robin Redbreast, and Men. (Looking for more examples? Check out the documentary Woodlands Dark and Days Bewitched: A History of Folk Horror.)

Some folk horror involves supernatural elements, but I confess a particular fondness for those stories that don't - stories where it's the folk themselves (read: the locals, and their beliefs) who are the true and only source of the horror. (I won't spoil which of the above films traffic in human vs. supernatural evil, in case you haven't seen them.)

The Wicker Man was the first folk horror film I saw as a kid, which is maybe why I harbor a deep love of folk horror set in '70s Britain, a time and place when an interest in the occult became faddish, inspiring a wave of folk horror specifically inflected with Satanic panic. Many of these films were set in the past, but those like The Wicker Man were set in the then-present, a time when men wore wavy hair and tight bell bottoms. Christopher Lee's Lord Summerisle, for example, sported a kicky tweed leisure suit topped off by a burnt-orange sweater.

It's why I think of this very specific subgenre of '70s folk horror as Talismans and Turtlenecks.

I just came across a new-to-me example of T & T last Sunday afternoon, which was suitably cold and wet and misty: 1970's The Dunwich Horror. A stiff-haired Sandra Dee, desperately attempting to shake her goody-goody image, plays a woman who falls under the sway of a young and hilariously intense, wide-eyed Dean Stockwell. (Seriously, you keep waiting for his character to blink, but instead he just keeps goggling fixedly at the world around him. At one point he makes a pot of tea, staring at it so fiercely through every stage of the process you start to wonder if he's trying to convince it to hop into bed with him.)

Don't get me wrong: It's a cheesy film, filled with crummy dialogue and hammy acting and cheap sets and one fight scene so wildly inept that has to be seen to be disbelieved. I won't reveal if the threat hanging over the film is human or supernatural (though the fact that it's based on an H.P. Lovecraft short story should tip you off). But I will say that Stockwell sports a thick, curly hairdo, a cravat, two count-em two pinky rings, and a huge mustache that curls under itself at either end, in the process effectively turning my guy's mouth into a parenthetical statement.

You can watch it for free, with commercials, on Pluto TV, which I swear is a real streaming service and not something I made up. The Dunwich Horror is not remotely scary, but it does have something to say, I suppose, about the madness of crowds and what, back in grad school, we used to call ""othering."" (The Stockwell character is the scion of an eccentric family that the local community has shunned for generations, you see.)

And that, of course, is the abiding appeal of folk horror: It takes those universal feelings of alienation and isolation that make us all feel like outsiders in our own communities and gives them flesh. When the supernatural is involved, sometimes that flesh pulses and oozes. Sometimes it's furry and clawed.

But whenever the story is about our collective tendency to cling to belief in the supernatural, the flesh involved is all too human, and probably gets stabbed with a sacrificial dagger in the final reel. Happy spooky season, y'all."
A coal power plant demolition serves as a poignant historical moment for the Navajo,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/05/nx-s1-5076973/coal-power-plant-demolition-navajo-new-mexico,2024-10-05T09:04:15Z,"In a small plane flying west out of Farmington, N.M., America's energy transition appeared to be proceeding in an orderly fashion -- a sea change measurable in megawatts, acreage and emission particle parts per million.

Mike Eisenfeld of San Juan Citizens Alliance was our tour guide, his voice crackling over the intercom.

""We're heading toward the San Juan Solar Project,"" he said. ""It's the biggest project going right now, economically.""

Rows and rows of black rectangles planted in bone-dry earth stretched out below us.

Then the plane headed south, where two enormous coal-fired power plants crouched on the landscape.

""At one point San Juan Generating Station and the Four Corners Power Plant, according to Los Alamos National Lab, were the largest source of point-source pollution in the United States,"" Eisenfeld said.

But on this day, the San Juan Generating Station sat dark and inert -- it shut down two years ago. As we flew over the Four Corners Power Plant, puffs of white smoke told us it was still producing energy.

""This is the last coal plant up here,"" Eisenfeld said of Four Corners. ""All the others have been retired. Gone.""

When Eisenfeld first moved to the area nearly 20 years ago, coal mining and coal power were on the rise in northwest New Mexico. Today, several large-scale solar projects are in the works.

He'd scheduled these tours with EcoFlight on Aug. 24 to showcase these big changes but also to witness the demolition of the San Juan Generating Station. That was the day its long, slender smokestacks collapsed into dust.

From the air, the coal and solar power facilities look like pieces like a gameboard. On the ground, the emotional weight of the energy transition is heavy and the complexities are palpable. Public Service Company of New Mexico, signaled years ago that it would decommission San Juan Generating Station; the plant burned its last load of coal in 2022. But the smokestacks are visible from hundreds of miles away. They have been a monumental presence on this landscape since the 1970s, and they've become powerful symbols to the people who live in the region -- especially Navajo people.

The Aug. 24 demolition was a poignant moment in the Navajo Nation's long and complex history with energy development. Over seven decades, coal and the energy made from it have become entwined with the Navajo's cultural beliefs, community life and the Navajo Nation economy.

On the morning of the demolition, employees of Public Utility of New Mexico transported visitors in a passenger van to a dirt lot on site. We drove past the massive concrete block of a building, weaving between heaps of scrap metal slated to be recycled.

There was a whiff of post-apocalypse in the air.

Dozens of contract laborers arrived in trucks and cars to watch the industrial carnage. Elsewhere on site, where former plant employees and local elected officials were gathered, the mood was somber. Still more spectators -- those without an invitation -- parked on the road outside the gates.

For the demolition team, a California contracting company called Integrated Demolition and Remediation, which has demolished dozens of smokestacks at coal power plants all over the U.S., this was business as usual.

""I'm going to do a loud '10, 9, 8, 7, 6,' "" said Rodrigo Roman, an explosives expert with the demolition team. ""Then I'll do a silent, '5, 4, 3, 2, 1.' He's gonna yell, 'Fire in the hole.' You're gonna hear a click. And then it's game on.""

Another member of the crew instructed me to lean back against one of the trucks.

""You're going to feel a shock wave,"" he said. ""It'll push you back a bit.""

Everyone gazed up at the 400 concrete cylinders, bathed in yellow morning sunlight for the last time.

But for at least one Navajo woman, the moment was too heavy to bear.

""I didn't attend the demolition because I'd probably cry,"" Christina Aspaas told me when I met with her in the nearby town of Kirtland, N.M. ""Knowing all that I know of how many jobs lost, the impacts that I'm seeing as a school board member to our district. Going to this demolition? I don't think that would have been good for my whole being.""

Aspaas' family history is embedded in the coal economy here. Her earliest memories of San Juan Generating Station date back to when she was a child.

""It was just some place we dropped my dad off at work,"" she said. ""He was a welder, but he helped build that power plant.""

Grandfathers, uncles and aunts worked at power plants and coal mines across the region, and eventually, Aspaas joined them as a utility worker in one of the mines.

""I worked two jobs before,"" she said. ""Both those checks put together, did not even come near the first check I got as a utility worker. And when they told me how much I was making, I thought I was rich.""

Decades later, she's a journeyman electrician at Navajo Mine and a union member. Her income supports dozens of family members.

""It provided for me and my daughter,"" she said. ""And I'm connected to four different clans and my wealth is not accumulated to myself. When I hear of ceremony or other things going, I help with food, groceries, cash.""

In the span of a decade, thousands of middle-class Navajo people have lost jobs connected to the coal economy; many have moved out of state. When utilities decommissioned the Navajo Generating Station near Page, Ariz., in 2019, the Navajo Nation lost more than $40 million in revenue. New Mexico labor data shows that displaced energy workers are making nearly $30,000 less a year on average since the San Juan power plant closed in 2022.

As a school board member, Aspaas is concerned that in five years, student enrollment has dropped 25% and student homelessness has tripled.

""What industry do we bring in here immediately to make up the tax revenue that's lost?"" she asked.

On the morning of the demolition, Elouise Brown drove more than an hour to park her car outside the gates of the San Juan Generating Station.

""I wanted to witness this with my own eyes,"" she said. ""We've been working on this for a long, long time, and I was very, very excited to see this.

Brown also has memories of the plant from childhood, driving in the car with her grandparents.

""It looked like a huge stove,"" she recalled. ""When my grandma said they burn coal, I was thinking, 'Jeez, how much coal would you burn to make all that smoke come out of those smokestacks?' ""

As an adult, she became concerned about the haze of air pollution all over the reservation.

""It didn't look safe!"" she said. ""How could you have a healthy life if you have a lot of smoke?""

Brown became an anti-coal activist in December 2006, after she learned that former Navajo Nation President Joe Shirley was backing a new coal-fired power plant in the region. The so-called Desert Rock project would have put a third coal plant within a few miles of the other two.

Brown sleuthed around online and discovered that construction was already underway. She drove to the site and started ripping out survey flags. When a semitruck hauling construction materials arrived, she maneuvered her car to block the driver.

""I went off the road, and I went right in front of him,"" she said. ""He had to stop, he had no choice.""

It was the beginning of her journey as an activist.

""He was a huge guy,"" Brown said of the driver. ""He was looking at me and just yelling at me. And I said, 'I don't care what the Navajo Nation president told you. He has no right to do what he did without informing us. So you're not coming through.' ""

Later, Brown blockaded the road with other activists. She picketed in the New Mexico Capitol building in Santa Fe for 60 days straight, and she fought the project until it fizzled in 2009.

""In our Navajo way of life, you don't mess with Mother Earth. You don't mess with the resources inside,"" she said.

For more than 75 years, Navajo people, who call themselves Diné, have forged a complex relationship with coal. Since the 1960s, utilities have burned coal on or near Navajo land, sending electricity to Los Angeles, Las Vegas, Phoenix, San Diego and Albuquerque.

For some Navajo people, this story is simply a modern kind of colonialism, according to Diné sociologist and historian Andrew Curley.

""How these non-Native communities, especially white communities prey upon Diné people and resources, replicating a pattern of colonial marginalization and dispossession that goes back more than a hundred years,"" Curley said.

Curley's book Carbon Sovereignty explores the Navajo relationship with coal. Many Diné workers he interviewed said their labor in the coal industry was intrinsically and even culturally meaningful.

""[Coal work] became a form of empowerment,"" he said. ""It was a form of identity-building between workers at a site.""

In the 1970s, with the rise of the Red Power movement, Navajo workers and elected officials began to leverage their sovereignty.

""Our tribal leaders started to negotiate royalty rates with extractive companies operating in Indian Country to give more money back to the tribe and give more rights to Diné laborers,"" Curley said.

As coal declines and new resources power the grid, those replacement industries are not supporting Navajo workers the way coal did.

""Oil, gas, solar, wind -- we're not seeing the same type of benefit to workers within any other kind of energy,"" Curley said. ""And they're not getting that social mobility through coal work that we in the social sciences were able to demonstrate existed.""

On the morning of Aug. 24, as the clock ran down, the demolition team shouted out a five-minute warning, then a one-minute warning, followed by the shrill sound of a siren.

For activist Elouise Brown, the demolition was a long time coming.

""I felt chills come down my whole body,"" she said. ""I was telling my family, what a great way to start your morning. What a blessing.""

Coal mine electrician Christina Aspaas watched a video of the implosion later that day on social media.

""It just brought back memories,"" she said, as she wiped away tears. ""My childhood, my dad, my mom.""

Aspaas posted a few words online to honor the generations of Navajo workers who have labored in coal.

""We took them for granted,"" she said. ""I just wanted them to know that I remember you.""

The detonation and shock wave pushed spectators backward, and then, in slow motion, the columns seemed to fall, concrete dissolving into air.

It takes less than a minute to demolish smokestacks.

It will take years, maybe decades, for Navajo communities to come to terms with what they've gained and what's been lost."
Garth Brooks is accused of rape and sexual assault in a lawsuit,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/04/nx-s1-5139950/garth-brooks-sexual-assault-accusation-lawsuit,2024-10-04T09:13:40Z,"Country music star Garth Brooks is being accused of rape and sexual assault in lawsuit filed Thursday.

An unnamed woman says she was repeatedly harassed by Brooks while working as his makeup artist and in 2019 was raped, adding that he tried to paint himself as a victim when he filed his own lawsuit against her last month.

In a statement provided late Thursday, Brooks denied the allegations. ""I have been hassled to no end with threats, lies, and tragic tales of what my future would be if I did not write a check for many millions of dollars. It has been like having a loaded gun waved in my face.""

According to the lawsuit filed by the woman's attorneys in a California Superior Court, the woman, identified only as Jane Roe, had been contracted to do makeup for Brooks' wife, Trisha Yearwood, since 1999. She began experiencing financial difficulties in 2019, and she says Brooks helped by offering her more work.

The woman claims Brooks took advantage of her need for work. She says later in 2019 Brooks exposed his genitals to her. In another instance, Brooks allegedly raped her in a Los Angeles hotel suite while Brooks was preparing for a Grammy tribute.

""With cold disregard for Ms. Roe, when Brooks was finished, it was business as usual,"" the complaint says. ""Ms. Roe worked quickly to style his hair and do his make-up for the event so he was on time.""

The woman says Brooks claimed to get a cryptic text message after the alleged rape that said Brooks ""ruined his life.""

At that point, she had not worked for Brooks for several months, leading Brooks to suspect the woman's husband may have sent the text, the complaint says.

Brooks allegedly told the woman, ""That's what I thought. Oh crap! So, I was trying to seek you out to come talk ... or whatever I needed to do, but just, uh, I don't want to hurt anybody, man. And just ... I just felt bad.""

Throughout her time working for Brooks, from 2017 to 2021, the woman claims he additionally sent her sexually explicit text messages, frequently changed clothes in front of her and groped her regularly while she worked on his hair and makeup.

She is suing for sexual battery and assault, and is requesting monetary and punitive damages, attorney's fees and a jury trial.

Brooks filed a federal lawsuit against the woman last month, claiming she is trying to extort him for money and defame his character, in response to him not making her a salaried employee or paying for medical benefits.

He says the woman sent him a letter in July claiming she was sexually assaulted and that Brooks was plotting to kill her, according to his lawsuit.

Brooks claims he received another letter the next month, in which the woman said she would not go public with her filing if he paid her millions of dollars.

In his statement, Brooks said, ""Hush money, no matter how much or how little, is still hush money. In my mind, that means I am admitting to behavior I am incapable of -- ugly acts no human should ever do to another.""

He is also requesting monetary and punitive damages, attorney's fees and a jury trial, as well as a declaration from the court that the woman's claims are false.

""I trust the system, I do not fear the truth, and I am not the man they have painted me to be,"" he said."
"In excerpt from new memoir, Melania Trump says women have the 'right to choose' abortion",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/g-s1-26134/melania-trump-memoir-donald-trump-abortion-position,2024-10-03T13:23:45Z,"""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?"" Melania Trump asks in her new memoir, according to an early excerpt published by The Guardian. The former first lady is seen here alongside her husband, former President Donald Trump, in cardboard cutouts at a campaign rally in Johnstown, Pa. Chip Somodevilla/Getty hide caption

Former first lady Melania Trump says in a self-titled memoir set to be released next week that she supports women's autonomy and the right to control their own bodies -- including abortion, if they choose, according to a report Thursday.

Her stance adds another jolt to a presidential campaign season rife with dramatic events, with Melania Trump weighing in on a topic that is a central issue in her husband's bid for reelection.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy"" when deciding when and whether to have children, Melania Trump writes in the book, according to an excerpt cited by The Guardian. The newspaper says it obtained an early copy of the book.

Those decisions, she said, should be based on women's personal convictions, not on ""intervention or pressure from the government,"" according to the excerpt.

According to the The Guardian Melania Trump also writes:

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

NPR has reached out to the Trump campaign for comment about Melania Trump's writings, and is seeking independent verification of the excerpt from the book's publisher.

Abortion has long been a key issue in U.S. political campaigns, but the 2024 race comes two years after the Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v Jackson that found there is no constitutional right to abortion.

Democrats have used that controversial ruling as a rallying call, emphasizing that pivotal votes on the high court's decision came from justices nominated by then-President Donald Trump.

The former president's position on abortion has been closely analyzed as he seeks to regain the White House.

""After 50 years of failure, with nobody coming even close, I was able to kill Roe v. Wade, much to the 'shock' of everyone,"" Trump said last year on his Truth Social platform.

But this year, Trump has seemingly sought to portray a more nuanced position on abortion, including saying that abortion laws should be left for states to decide.

As NPR's Sarah McCammon reported after the 2022 midterm election:

""Advocates for bans on most abortions - including a wave of state laws passed in recent years that prohibit the procedure within the first several weeks - are at odds with public opinion, according to many years of polling. While most Americans support some restrictions on abortion, most support access earlier in pregnancy.""

Melania Trump's memoir, titled Melania, has a release date of Oct. 8, by Skyhorse Publishing, with distribution by Simon & Schuster.

In its summary of the book, the publisher said of the former first lady: ""She shares behind-the-scenes stories from her time in the White House, shedding light on her advocacy work and the causes close to her heart.""

The former first lady was born in Slovenia in 1970, three years before the landmark Roe v. Wade decision. She moved to the U.S. in 1996 and became a U.S. citizen in 2006."
Birders argue over plan to change dozens of bird names,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5137123/birders-argue-plan-change-birds-named-people,2024-10-03T11:09:26Z,"Say goodbye to Bachman's Sparrow, Scott's Oriole and Townsend's Warbler. Those three birds are among a half-dozen that will get renamed first under a plan by the American Ornithological Society to do away with common bird names that honor people.

But whether or not the society will keep going after that, and get rid of all eponymous bird names, remains to be seen.

Last year, the society announced a plan to do just that. The goal was to rename over a hundred North and South American birds, to purge bird names of links to racism and colonialism without having to engage in contentious and time-consuming debates about the morality of every historical figure that had ever been honored in a bird's common name.

The sweeping move, however, surprised and upset many birders and ornithologists.

This week, opponents and proponents will get to have their say at the society's annual meeting in Colorado, which features a forum on Thursday to discuss the bird renaming plan.

""I cannot predict what is going to happen there,"" says Kenn Kaufman, an author of field guides and a fellow of the society.

He's seen his fair share of birding controversies, like when birders debated whether they had to actually see a bird or just hear its call in order to add it to their birding life list.

This controversy, though, is in its own league, says Kaufman.

""Something at this scale, I don't think has ever happened before,"" he says. ""The decision was put out there, there was a very strong reaction in some quarters, and so the initial decision might wind up being altered.""

On May 25, 2020, George Floyd was killed on the same day that a white woman called the police on Christian Cooper, a Black man out birding in New York, heightening awareness of social justice issues in society more generally and in birding specifically.

That year, the American Ornithological Society took action on a proposal to rename a bird that had previously been named after a high-ranking Confederate officer. McCown's Longspur suddenly became the Thick-billed Longspur.

This renaming proposal had been rejected a couple years earlier, but times had changed. Confederate statues and monuments were coming down in cities and towns.

And a group called Bird Names For Birds was urging the society to do more to address problematic bird names, likening eponymous common names to ""verbal statues.""

After forming an ad hoc committee to study the issue and make recommendations, the society announced its plan to rename all birds named after people, along with changing any other names deemed offensive.

The birds would get new names selected to highlight each bird's key features.

""Names have power and power can be for the good or it can be for the bad,"" society president Colleen Handel told NPR at the time. ""We want these names to be powerful in a really good way.""

Kaufman says to him, the arguments for just renaming all of these birds made a lot of sense.

Consider Clark's nutcracker, he says, which is named for William Clark of the Lewis and Clark expedition. Some consider Clark to be a great American hero, says Kaufman, but he also kept a man named York in slavery and refused his pleas for freedom.

""The arguments about whether or not he deserves to have a bird named for him,"" says Kaufman, ""could get to be pretty dicey.""

Canceling heroes

But this spring, over six thousand people signed a petition urging the society to reconsider its plan, saying it should use a case-by-case method.

This was followed by a resolution signed by over two hundred of the society's own fellows. These ornithologists said that while the society could do a pilot project to change clearly offensive bird names, it should hold off on moving beyond that until it had better consulted with its members, with measures such as an opinion poll.

""An important point here is that changing bird names sends a stronger message if the names are restricted to offensive names rather than replacing all eponymous names,"" says Steven Beissinger, professor emeritus with the University of California, Berkeley, who helped organize the resolution.

A lot of important ornithology history is embedded in names, he says, noting that Henslow's sparrow honors John Stevens Henslow, a mentor of Charles Darwin and a committed abolitionist. The Blackburnian warbler, meanwhile, is named after Anna Blackburne, a pioneering female scientist of the 18th century.

""This decision to get rid of eponyms also extends to Central and South American birds,"" says Beissinger. ""It might offend many Latin American ornithologists by canceling their heroes for whom birds have been named.""

He points out that Juan Gundlach, considered to be the father of Cuban ornithology, has a hawk named after him, and there's a flycatcher named after Chico Mendes, a conservationist who was murdered because of his work to preserve the Amazonian rainforest.

A positive process

In May, when the society announced that it had chosen six birds to rename in a pilot project, ""it felt like exciting progress,"" a co-founder of Bird Names for Birds, Jordan Rutter, told NPR in a July email. ""There was a lot of community support around it.""

But few details beyond the six birds had been provided, Rutter noted.

Handel, the society president, says that after the discussion held this week at the annual meeting, ""we will be incorporating ideas and suggestions from our members into the plans for the pilot project.""

""Our members have expressed strong support for the pilot project,"" Handel added. ""With everyone's help, it can serve as an enriching experience for all those who participate in it. The results of the project will then provide guideposts for our next steps.""

The six birds chosen for the pilot project seem to be ones that almost everyone could agree should be changed, says Robert Driver of Duke University.

""People who have birds named after them that are well-documented white supremacists, or grave robbers of Native American skulls, and things like this,"" says Driver.

To him, selecting these six birds seems like a way for the society ""to actually walk back a little bit and change some high-priority ones first and then reassess what the feeling is after these major ones are gone.""

Driver was behind that proposal to change the bird named after Confederate major general John McCown, and he says he's come to appreciate the process the proposal went through, despite the initial rejection and all the time it took.

""To me it was a positive process, overall, and the community really got to learn about John P. McCown,"" he says.

He says changing every single honorific name, in contrast, would mean that ornithologists would not be forced to confront the past in the same way.

""We don't have to worry about what Scott did or Townsend did or Bachman did or Audubon did or whoever,"" says Driver. ""We're changing them all. They're all going.""

That's why, even though he knows the society didn't want to argue over every individual bird species, he personally thinks there would be some benefits if this effort ends up going bird by bird, ""slowly un-turning every stone, and finding out all this history, and really diving into it."""
"It's harder to pay and travel for abortion care, but support funds are struggling",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/03/nx-s1-5131573/abortion-fund-travel-state-bans-ballot-measures-national-federation-budget-cuts-repro-rights,2024-10-03T09:02:12Z,"Bree Wallace works for the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund. The group uses donations to help people pay for abortion care in Florida, and to travel to other states, but has struggled financially to keep up with the demand.

Getting an abortion can cost hundreds, if not thousands of dollars, especially if a patient must leave a state with a strict abortion ban.

But the organizations that provide financial support, sometimes known as abortion funds, are struggling financially and slashing their budgets, unable to meet the needs of the growing number of people asking for help.

Planned Parenthood of New England is warning of a projected $8.6 million deficit. Funds in Ohio, Chicago, Arizona and Florida don't have enough money to meet demand.

Even the National Abortion Federation, which runs a national hotline that helps cover procedure costs, was forced to cut its monthly budget in half, due to fewer donations.

Previously, the Federation had covered up to 50 percent of an eligible patient's costs in most locations. In July, it dropped that coverage to 30 percent.

""We're in the midst of an abortion funding crisis,"" says Oriaku Njoku, the executive director of the National Network of Abortion Funds, which provides an online search tool for patients to find a local or regional assistance fund.

Njoku and others at these funds point to intersecting pressures: increased demand for financial assistance for abortions, additional expenses due to some patients having to travel across state lines, and a decline in donor interest.

The initial wave of ""rage donations"" that flowed into the national and regional funds, after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022, has subsided.

""It's weird to see the divestment like, don't you see the crisis anymore?"" says Jenice Fountain, executive director of the Yellowhammer Fund in Alabama.

""We're absolutely, very much still in crisis, potentially even worse crisis than when the ban first happened.""

The Yellowhammer Fund supports pregnancy and prenatal care, and is involved in a lawsuit against Alabama's Attorney General, after he threatened to prosecute groups like Yellowhammer for helping patients travel out of state for abortion care.

""People ask 'Why should we donate if Alabama doesn't have an abortion clinic?'"" Fountain says.

""And it's like, well, that's a reason to double down on support in Alabama. We're fighting the thing. We have to exist the whole time that we fight the thing.""

But abortion hasn't faded from the news, or become less politically potent. In fact, reproductive rights have become a prominent issue in this year's presidential election.

Ten states will put ballot measures on abortion rights before voters in November, and many Democratic candidates have made it a central issue to their campaign.

The cumulative effect has been to divert donations away from the funds that support patients directly -- and towards specific candidates and ballot initiatives.

In August, more than 30 local abortion funds across the U.S. signed an op-ed criticizing national reproductive rights organizations for focusing too much on advocacy rather than patient care.

""I think there's this false hope and illusion with putting the right president in place, or winning this ballot initiative,"" says Eloisa Lopez, executive director of the Abortion Fund of Arizona.

""None of that is actually funding abortion care,"" Lopez says. ""You can have all those things in place and people are still not going to be able to get their care.""

Even after the election ends, Lopez fears that donors will continue to assume that grassroots abortion funds like hers don't need as much support -- especially if voters approve state-level ballot initiatives that affirm reproductive rights.

""I think when people see progress is being made, it's translating into people's minds, like 'We're not going to have struggles trying to get abortion anymore.'""

But advocates say that the struggles to pay out-of-pocket for abortion care, or travel elsewhere for care, will continue in all states.

Bree Wallace, an employee at the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund, typically spends her days glued to her laptop, messaging back-and-forth with pregnant clients who need help paying abortion care -- and fast, if they want to comply with Florida's six-week ban.

One afternoon in July, a woman texted the fund from the waiting room of a clinic. She needed an abortion, but couldn't pay.

The National Abortion Hotline had pledged to cover 30 percent, leaving her with a fee of $490.

""It can be pretty hefty for people,"" says Wallace, 27, the fund's director of case management.

Within minutes, Wallace committed to help. All the woman had to do was share her first name and last initial. The clinic would directly charge the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund for the balance, and the woman could move forward with her appointment.

In Florida, an abortion can cost between $600 to $800, during the first trimester. Florida law requires a mandatory in-person consultation and an ultrasound, followed by a 24-hour waiting period.

Since 1977, the Hyde Amendment has severely restricted the use of federal funds for abortion care. In practice, that means Medicaid doesn't cover it -- unless individual states cover the entire cost with state funds.

Florida Medicaid does not cover abortion care, and state law also bans coverage by insurance plans sold on the Affordable Care Act marketplace.

Many patients must therefore pay for the entire cost, and have little time to gather the funds under the state's six-week ban.

Bree explained that many women don't even know they're pregnant by six weeks. But if they do, they often have just days to act.

""Especially with six weeks right now you're kind of working against time, you don't even have time to even get that money,"" Wallace says.

Before Florida's six-week ban went into effect last spring, some patients could have saved up their own money. But now they need the fund's help, says Wallace.

At the Abortion Fund of Arizona, declining donations have forced spending cuts. In September, the Fund spent about $18,000 assisting patients -- half of what the Fund spent in July.

Often, that monthly allotment is gone in just two weeks, and staffers must turn down requests for aid, or tell patients to try again next month.

""It's a really terrible position where we're having to give people ideas about how to raise money on their own,"" says executive director Eloisa Lopez.

""'Can you ask your family or friends? Do you have a credit card? Could you take out a line of credit? Do you have items in your home you can sell?'""

Since most states near Florida also ban abortion, patients past the state's six-week mark are traveling to places like Washington, D.C. or Illinois for care.

Between last-minute airfare and hotel stays, that can push the price up another $1,000.

""There's also taking off work. That can be hard for a lot of people, finding childcare,"" Wallace says. ""Sometimes this is the first time people have ever been on a plane, ever left Florida...it can be really confusing and stressful.""

Earlier this year, the Tampa Bay Abortion Fund decided it could spend fifty thousand dollars a month helping pay for procedures and travel. But since May, it's regularly blown past that limit.

The fund doesn't want to turn down someone who really needs help, Wallace says. She read out loud a grateful text she recently received from a client.

""'Thank you,' with a million exclamation points,"" Wallace reads from the screen. ""'Thank you so much,' with even more exclamation points. 'I appreciate you for what you do, you just helped me more than you know.'""

The Tampa fund hopes to do more fund-raising this fall. But if future donations don't keep up with spending, it will completely run out of money in 3-6 months, according to Wallace.

Because of the federal Hyde Amendment, abortion funds must turn to private donations from individuals, community groups or foundations.

But in many states, federal and state funds are used to support crisis pregnancy centers that oppose abortion and often try to dissuade people from getting an abortion. In the last 5 years, about $400 million dollars in federal money flowed to crisis pregnancy centers across the country."
Harris and Biden surveyed damage wrought by Hurricane Helene in 2 swing states,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5136749/kamala-harris-joe-biden-hurricane-helene-north-carolina-georgia,2024-10-02T23:26:55Z,"AUGUSTA, Ga. -- Vice President Harris took a pause from the campaign trail on Wednesday to visit a neighborhood ravaged by Hurricane Helene where more than half of residents don't have power and many don't have running water, consoling a woman who she said had lost her husband.

""There is real pain and trauma that has resulted because of this hurricane,"" Harris said.

Meanwhile, President Biden spent about an hour flying over Asheville, N.C., by helicopter. ""You can see homes that are moved, clearly, from one side of the river, down the river to another side,"" he said. ""Communities like Chimney Rock are reduced to piles of wood and debris.""

Biden and Harris are trying to reassure residents hurt by the massive storm that the federal government will help the region recover. Making good on that promise is a critical test for the administration in this election year, particularly in the swing states of North Carolina and Georgia, where Biden and Harris visited.

But Biden said it wasn't about politics. ""At a moment like this, we put politics aside -- at least, we should put it all aside, and we have, here,"" Biden said at a briefing at an emergency operations center in Raleigh, N.C.

""There are no Democrats, Republicans -- only Americans -- and our job is to help as many people as we can, as quickly as we can, and as thoroughly as we can,"" he said.

Biden announced that the federal government would cover 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for six months for North Carolina, as requested by its Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper.

He also directed up to 1,000 active-duty soldiers to be deployed to help the North Carolina National Guard deliver food, water and medicine.

In Georgia, Harris said the federal government would cover 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for three months for the state, as requested by its Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Kemp was not with her for the tour.

The White House also announced that Biden had authorized 100% of the costs of debris removal and emergency protective measures for three months for Florida -- a state he plans to visit on Thursday.

Biden will also make a stop on Thursday in Valdosta, Ga. That's where former President Donald Trump was on Monday, where he, too, said that disasters transcend politics.

""As you know, our country is in the final weeks of a hard-fought national election. But in a time like this, when a crisis hits, when our fellow citizens cry out in need, none of that matters. We're not talking about politics now. We have to all get together and get this solved,"" Trump said.

But during his stop, Trump falsely said Gov. Kemp had not been able to reach Biden. ""He's been calling the president, hasn't been able to get him. But they'll come through, I'm sure,"" Trump said. Biden later that day angrily criticized Trump.

""He's lying, and the governor told him he was lying,"" Biden said, noting he had spoken with Kemp. ""I don't know why he [Trump] does this. And the reason I get so angry about it -- I don't care about what he says about me, but I care what he communicates to the people that are in need. He implies that we're not doing everything possible. We are,"" Biden said."
This disabled woman built a career. A federal program that helped now penalizes her,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25453/social-security-ssi-disabilities-work-outdated,2024-10-02T16:25:32Z,"Tabi Haly defied expectations. She's a woman with spinal muscular atrophy -- also, a software engineer and a vice president at JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase hide caption

Tabi Haly defies expectations. She's a woman with a progressive muscular illness; she can't move her body and she needs round-the-clock care from aides. She wasn't expected to go to college, or to get a job -- much less become a vice president at the banking giant JPMorgan Chase.

Even staying alive and healthy defied expectations. ""People with spinal muscular atrophy like myself, living to my age already is a huge win,"" says Haly, who is 40.

Haly's success as a software engineer in New York City was made possible by a government program called Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. It gives Haly access to crucial medical coverage.

But now that same program is threatening to bring her success crashing down.

In July, Haly got a letter that shocked her. The Social Security Administration, the agency that runs the federal benefits program, wrote that she was not eligible for SSI, even though she'd relied upon SSI for almost 19 years.

By losing SSI, she would also lose Medicaid, her health insurance. Medicaid provides medical care -- from round-the-clock personal care aides to an expensive medicine -- that keeps her healthy and allows her to build a career.

""It's like my foundation's falling apart,"" says Haly. She appealed the decision to end her SSI. But she worries that without it, the career she's achieved will end. Even with a high-paying job, she says she can't pay for 24-hour aides and other high-cost medical care on her own.

She faces a big fall -- from a successful career to needing full-time care from family or, more likely she fears, moving into a nursing home.

SSI exists to provide a minimum income, and often health insurance, to people with significant disabilities. But an NPR investigation found that SSI often fails people with disabilities because its rules are long out of date and overly complex.

As a result, recipients like Haly run into decisions that seem bureaucratic and inconsistent but that threaten their ability to stay out of poverty, live independently and keep access to medical care.

Debora Wagner at Cornell University's Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability says Haly's frustration is not uncommon and shows the need to modernize SSI. ""My question is 'Who benefits in this situation? What's the benefit for us as a society of making it impossible for people with disabilities to work?'""

Haly is a software engineer and a team leader on development and coding projects for JPMorgan Chase & Co..

On an early morning this summer at her apartment in Manhattan, Haly, in her motorized wheelchair, prepared to lead back-to-back meetings on a new software project. Her personal care aide, Palone Ruddock, spent about 10 minutes getting Haly positioned in front of her computer.

Haly can't move her body. She needs an aide to help her move her arms and legs.

But with Haly's fingers placed on a large trackpad, she can control the computer and run her meeting.

Some of her work colleagues on the call know she's disabled. None, she says, have any idea of how disabled she is. Nor did any of the outside consultants this day at a second meeting, where she presented the coding project.

Haly needs assistance from personal care aides 24 hours a day. ""That's who gets me into my wheelchair,"" she says. ""They're my hands and feet.""

Those aides move her body several times an hour so she doesn't get painful bedsores. They suction the secretions out of her weakened lungs to keep her healthy.

Haly says those aides, seven days a week, cost about $300,000 a year.

Only Medicaid, the state and federal insurance for people with limited income that Haly gets through SSI, will pay for them.

Her company's health insurance wouldn't. The insurance that people get through their jobs doesn't cover long-term, in-home aides. Nor does Medicare, the government insurance for older people and some younger people with disabilities.

As a vice president at JPMorgan Chase, Haly makes a good salary. But even with a six-figure paycheck, she says she can't afford the health care that she needs.

In addition to the aides, Haly ticks off a list of her other medical expenses. Medicaid pays for a new, breakthrough medication for spinal muscular atrophy. She says that medicine alone, which she must keep cooled in the refrigerator, costs about $350,000 a year.

If she went on her employer's health insurance, a company spokesperson says it might pay for some or all of the medicine.

But there are other big expenses an employer's health insurance won't pay at all, like Haly's customized power wheelchair. At $35,000, it's as expensive as a small car.

In addition, Medicaid pays for wheelchair repairs and tens of thousands of dollars a year in physical, occupational and speech therapy.

""I would have to be a multimillionaire to pay for all this stuff myself,"" Haly says.

Ari Ne'eman, an assistant professor at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard who researches disability income programs, says: ""If you lose access to SSI, you lose access to the Medicaid services that keep you alive and thriving in the community. It's a question of life and death.""

SSI was created in 1972 to provide monthly benefit checks for millions of impoverished disabled and elderly Americans. In 2024, the monthly benefit is capped at $943 for one person and $1,415 for a couple. In addition, most who are eligible for SSI then qualify for health insurance through state Medicaid programs.

Today, SSI is a key benefit to 7.5 million people.

But SSI was created before the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 protected people with disabilities from discrimination in public places and at work. It was created before the 1975 law -- the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act -- that, for the first time, gave a right to a public school education for children with disabilities. Before then, some 1 million children with disabilities, the last group to get the right to schooling guaranteed, were excluded from many schools.

As the experiences and expectations for disabled Americans changed, SSI failed to keep up.

SSI was started with the assumption that recipients couldn't or wouldn't work in jobs where they could support themselves.

As a result, its out-of-date rules discourage work. Today, fewer than 10% of people on SSI do work, although many say they'd like to work and many would like to make enough to get off SSI.

Very few, like Haly, manage to build a career.

The rules make it hard to take even a part-time job. One rule says you can own only $2,000 in assets -- like bank savings or property. That limit hasn't changed since 1989.

For a couple, the asset limit is $3,000, creating a ""marriage penalty"" that forces many on SSI to avoid marriage or to try to hide it when they marry.

As a result of the cap on accruing assets, Haly, for example, is unable to contribute part of her salary or take her employer's match in the company 401(k) plan. Those retirement plans, which are now used by 70 million Americans, didn't exist when SSI and the asset limit were first created.

Over the years, Social Security and the Internal Revenue Service have set up programs where people on SSI can shield part of their income from the asset limit. But these programs -- ABLE accounts, Ticket to Work, PASS accounts -- are often complicated to set up and limited in their scope. The result: Only a tiny fraction of people on SSI use them.

In recent months, the Social Security Administration has simplified some rules about counting income, like excluding the government assistance someone on SSI receives for food and rent. But Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley noted to NPR that only Congress can make the most significant reform to SSI.

There's a fix to the asset limit that's been proposed, but stalled, on Capitol Hill. The SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act would raise the asset limit to $10,000 for an individual and $20,000 for a couple, in line with what the thresholds would be if they had kept up with inflation.

The bill has bipartisan co-sponsors in Congress and has been endorsed by business leaders, including Jamie Dimon, chairman and CEO of JPMorgan Chase. But the bill wouldn't address other outdated SSI rules.

One rule says that someone on SSI can't earn more than $65 a month. After that, a recipient loses $1 of benefits for every $2 they earn -- in effect, a tax of 50%.

""That's a higher tax rate than anyone faces on their federal income tax,"" says Ne'eman of Harvard. ""But when it comes to the most impoverished disabled Americans, that is the level of taxation functionally that people are facing when they try and enter the workforce.""

That $65 limit is the same as it was first set in 1972.

When Microsoft in 2020 decided to raise the minimum wage for its lowest paid employees to $25 an hour, the company was surprised to find that disabled workers -- largely ones with intellectual disabilities working in the cafeteria, as administrative assistants and other low-level jobs -- suddenly faced losing their SSI benefits.

Microsoft hired private benefit managers to advise every employee on SSI, according to Rylin Rogers, the company's disability policy director.

Many of those workers thought they'd need to ""step away from those jobs, good jobs that they had had for a very long time, which would have been a shame,"" says Dan Rutten with the Washington Initiative for Supported Employment, the nonprofit benefits advisory firm that was called in to help. Most of those disabled employees, guided by the advisers, found waiver programs or cut their work hours to balance their salary increases with SSI's rules.

Fifty years ago, when SSI started, making $65 a month got a person close to the poverty limit. ""It was already inadequate in 1972, but it wasn't laughable,"" says Ne'eman. ""Today we have a situation where the income offset really is frankly insulting.""

People on SSI who ""are having the greatest success working"" are the ones who run into the most problems with SSI's rules, says Jack Smalligan, who studies income benefits for the Urban Institute. ""So the message to beneficiaries is, essentially, that working doesn't pay.""

Haly makes too much to take a monthly SSI benefit check. She's one of a tiny number of beneficiaries who need to qualify solely to keep her Medicaid.

But this summer, Haly learned that she was about to lose that health insurance.

At first, Haly thought it was a simple clerical error.

Every year, she gets recertified for Medicaid. Haly says a caseworker for New York state comes to her home and asks a series of questions to determine that she is still disabled. Haly considers the process ""intrusive,"" given that she has a progressive neuromuscular condition that is incurable.

Usually, the process is automatic. But this spring, when the notice of her coverage renewal arrived, the line that she expected to say that her insurance would last until 2025 said 2024 instead.

The state of New York wasn't extending her Medicaid coverage, even though Haly was currently on SSI, which qualified her for that health insurance.

(A spokesperson for New York's Medicaid agency said rules around confidentiality limited its ability to discuss Haly's case. A spokesperson for Social Security noted confidentiality rules, too.)

Haly went to the Social Security office to straighten it out.

""They had no idea what I was talking about,"" she says. ""Zero.""

She says they offered to help her stop working and sign up for a separate benefit program, Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), for people who can no longer work because of a disability.

She recalls: ""The person said, 'I can make you an appointment for SSDI, do you want to claim disability?' I said, 'No, I do not want to collect SSDI.'""

It took several weeks, she says, until she got an appointment to talk over her problem with a Social Security caseworker. Haly says he advised her that she needed to reapply for SSI.

She was reluctant to apply for a benefit that she already held, and had without question, for years. But the staffer was insistent, so she did.

Shortly after, she got a letter from Social Security with a short denial. It said she made too much money to qualify.

SSI's regulations are complex and confusing. Often, recipients find it necessary to hire a lawyer or a benefits manager with specialized expertise to negotiate the rules to stay eligible.

""The rules are so complicated that even the most educated, professional people cannot understand and follow the rules. It's heartbreaking,"" says attorney Wagner at Cornell.

For years, Social Security said Haly qualified for an exception to SSI's earnings limit, called a 1619(b) waiver. It refers to a part of the Social Security law that lets some disabled people earn money over the limit and still qualify for Medicaid.

Social Security's denial this summer turned all that upside down.

It ended her eligibility for SSI because of her growing income, which previously was excluded by the waiver. When she lost SSI, she lost the waiver that went with it. She can't use the waiver now or even reapply for it because the waiver is available only to people who Social Security says are eligible for SSI.

""It's a catch-22,"" says Haly, frustrated.

To be eligible again, Haly would need to impoverish herself and give up the aides and medical care she is unlikely to afford on her own, especially if she can no longer work.

Even then, to reapply for SSI and maybe get the waiver again could take months or even years.

So she's asked Social Security to reverse itself and return to what had been the status quo for years and allow her to stay on SSI, to keep her Medicaid and to keep working.

""My medical expenses are so much, hundreds of thousands a year,"" says Haly. ""Do you not want me to work then? Because I can be a VP at JPMorgan Chase. I pay a lot of taxes being a VP at JPMorgan Chase. Or I can just not work and collect.""

While Haly waits for a decision on her appeal, her Medicaid insurance is in place -- for now.

For a few days in early summer, without Medicaid, everything stopped. Her medicine was delayed. When her medical providers saw her insurance was halted, they canceled her physical therapy sessions and her wheelchair repair.

There would be few options, Haly says, if she loses her appeal to the Social Security Administration. She could stop working and apply for Social Security Disability Insurance. That comes with Medicare. But it would take at least two years to get it.

""Someone like me,"" she says, ""who is a person with a disability who needs full-time care, the only way to get that is in a nursing home.""

For businesses, there's a growing recognition of the value of hiring more workers with disabilities. One trend: The creation of cafes, coffee shops and other small businesses as places where disabled people can be hired to work alongside others without disabilities.

In St. Paul, Minn., attorney Shamus O'Meara opened a specialty popcorn business this year with his 26-year-old son Conor, who is autistic.

Conor O'Meara makes the popcorn and greets customers when they come in.

""When they see Conor,"" his father says, ""it's like, 'Conor, how are you!' It's a true joy to have him here. Everyone knows him. They call him the Mayor of St. Paul.""

The goal of Highland Popcorn (motto: ""Popcorn with Personality"") is to create a place where disabled people can find work.

But Shamus O'Meara says they quickly ran into barriers with SSI. Because of the $65 limit on monthly earnings and the $2,000 limit on assets, many of their employees, including Conor, need to limit their work to just a few hours, a few days a week.

That required Shamus, who hires both disabled and nondisabled workers, to find many extra employees to cover all the shifts.

Work is important to Conor, for social interaction and for the money he can earn.

He takes the bus to two other part-time jobs. At a nearby bowling alley, he cleans the scoring screens and sweeps up the cigarette butts outside. At a pizza restaurant, he buses dishes and wraps silverware in napkins. In addition, he volunteers at a community radio station and hosts a show where he talks about his life and about Minnesota's professional sports teams.

Conor says he'd like to work even more. ""I think Social Security should end that one limiting how many hours you work.""

Tabi Haly's bosses, too, are confounded by SSI's complex and stale rules -- and by the idea that a valued worker would go from a company vice president to having her career ended and possibly needing to move to a nursing home.

""Tabi contributes to our business in a very meaningful way. She's top talent,"" says Bryan Gill, who runs JPMorgan's office of disability inclusion. ""And I want more of Tabi's time contributing to our business.""

Gill says the financial services company makes an effort to hire people with disabilities because it's a way to find talented workers in a tight labor market.

""We do a lot of charity,"" he says. ""We have a lot of philanthropic efforts. This is not one of them. This is a business strategy imperative to the long-term success of this company.""

Haly also writes songs and has recorded two CDs. She started singing as a form of speech therapy to strengthen her weakened lungs.

In the lyrics to one song, ""Waiting in the Wings,"" she asks: ""Do they judge me by my talent? ...Treat me less than a human being? Is that what our life's meant to be?""

""Waiting in the wings means we're waiting backstage,"" she says, waiting for rights. ""What that means here in the States is that we have the liberty to pursue our dreams and live them. And not feel like there are all these barriers to get there.""

Haly says she only wants the chance to keep working and to keep her independence. But she needs to keep her SSI and Medicaid to make that remain her reality."
This disabled woman built a career. A federal program that helped now penalizes her for her success.,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/g-s1-25453/social-security-ssi-disabilities-work-outdated,2024-10-02T16:08:55Z,"Tabi Haly defied expectations. She's a woman with spinal muscular atrophy. Also, a software engineer and a vice president at JPMorgan Chase. JPMorgan Chase hide caption

Tabi Haly defies expectations. She's a woman with a progressive muscular illness; she can't move her body and she needs round-the-clock care from aides. She wasn't expected to go to college, or to get a job-much less become a vice president at the banking giant JPMorgan Chase.

Even staying alive and healthy defied expectations. ""People with spinal muscular atrophy like myself, living to my age already is a huge win,"" says Haly, who is 40.

Haly's success as a software engineer in New York City was made possible by a government program called Supplemental Security Income, or SSI. It gives Haly access to crucial medical coverage.

But now that same program is threatening to bring her success crashing down.

In July, Haly got a letter that shocked her. The Social Security Administration, the agency that runs the federal benefits program, wrote that she was not eligible for SSI, even though she'd relied upon SSI for almost 19 years.

By losing SSI, she would also lose Medicaid, her health insurance. Medicaid provides medical care-from round-the-clock personal care aides to an expensive medicine-that keeps her healthy and allows her to build a career.

""It's like my foundation's falling apart,"" says Haly. She appealed the decision to end her SSI. But she worries that without it, the successful career she's achieved will end. Even with a high-paying job, she says she can't pay for 24-hour aides and other high-cost medical care on her own.

She faces a big fall: From a successful career to needing full-time care from family or, more likely she fears, moving into a nursing home.

SSI exists to provide a minimum income and often health insurance to people with significant disabilities. But an NPR investigation found that SSI often fails people with disabilities because its rules are long out of date and overly complex.

As a result, it's common for recipients like Haly to run into decisions that seem bureaucratic and inconsistent--but that threaten their ability to stay out of poverty, live independently and keep access to medical care.

Debora Wagner at Cornell University's Yang-Tan Institute on Employment and Disability says Haly's frustration is not uncommon and shows the need to modernize SSI. ""My question is: Who benefits in this situation? What's the benefit for us as a society of making it impossible for people with disabilities to work?""

Even her coworkers don't know

Haly is a software engineer and a team leader on development and coding projects for JPMorgan Chase & Co..

On an early morning this summer at her apartment in Manhattan, Haly, in her motorized wheelchair, prepared to lead back-to-back meetings on a new software project. Her personal care aide, Palone Ruddock, spent about 10 minutes getting Haly positioned in front of her computer.

Haly can't move her body -- she needs an aide to help her move her arms and legs.

But with Haly's fingers placed on a large trackpad, she can control the computer and run her meeting.

Some of her work colleagues on the call know she's disabled. None, she says, have any idea of how disabled she is. Nor did any of the outside consultants this day at a second meeting, where she presented the coding project.

Haly needs assistance from personal care aides 24 hours a day. ""That's who gets me into my wheelchair,"" she says. ""They're my hands and feet.""

Those aides move her body several times an hour, so she doesn't get painful bedsores. They suction the secretions out of her weakened lungs to keep her healthy.

Haly says those aides, seven days a week, cost about $300,000 a year.

Only Medicaid, the state and federal insurance for people with limited income that Haly gets through SSI, will pay for them.

Her company's health insurance wouldn't. The insurance that people get through their jobs doesn't cover long-term, in-home aides. Nor does Medicare, the government insurance for older people and some younger people with disabilities.

As a vice president at JPMorgan Chase, Haly makes a good salary. But even with a six-figure paycheck, she says she can't afford the health care that she needs.

In addition to the aides, Haly ticks off a list of her other medical expenses. Medicaid pays for a new, breakthrough medication for spinal muscular atrophy. She says that medicine alone, which she must keep cooled in the refrigerator, costs about $350,000 a year.

If she went on her employer's health insurance, a company spokesperson says it might pay for some or all of the medicine.

But there are other big expenses an employer's health insurance won't pay at all, like Haly's customized power wheelchair. At $35,000, it's as expensive as a small car.

In addition, Medicaid pays for wheelchair repairs and tens of thousands of dollars a year in physical, occupational and speech therapy.

""I would have to be a multi-millionaire to pay for all this stuff myself,"" Haly says.

Says Ari Ne'eman, an assistant professor at the T.H. Chan School of Public Health at Harvard who researches disability income programs: ""If you lose access to SSI, you lose access to the Medicaid services that keep you alive and thriving in the community. It's a question of life and death.""

People with significant disabilities weren't expected to work

SSI was created in 1972 to provide monthly benefit checks for millions of impoverished disabled and elderly Americans. In 2024, the monthly benefit is capped at $943 for one person and $1,415 for a couple. In addition, most who are eligible for SSI then qualify for health insurance through state Medicaid programs.

Today, SSI is a key benefit to 7.5 million people.

But SSI was created before the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 protected people with disabilities from discrimination in public places and at work. It was created before the 1975 law-the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act--that, for the first time, gave a right to a public school education for children with disabilities. Before then, some one million children with disabilities-the last group to get the right to schooling guaranteed-were excluded from many schools.

As the experiences and expectations for disabled Americans changed, SSI failed to keep up.

SSI was started with the assumption that recipients couldn't or wouldn't work in jobs where they could support themselves.

As a result, its out-of-date rules discourage work. Today, fewer than 10 percent of people on SSI do work, although many say they'd like to work, and many would like to make enough to get off of SSI.

Very few, like Haly, manage to build a career.

The rules make it hard to take even a part-time job. One rule says you can own only $2,000 in assets -- like bank savings or property. That limit hasn't changed since 1989.

For a couple, the asset limit is $3,000, creating a ""marriage penalty"" that forces many on SSI to avoid marriage or to try to hide it when they do marry.

As a result of the cap on accruing assets, Haly, for example, is unable to contribute part of her salary or take her employer's match in the company 401(k) plan. Those retirement plans, which are now used by 70 million Americans, didn't exist when SSI and the asset limit were first created.

Over the years, Social Security and the Internal Revenue Service have set up programs where people on SSI can shield part of their income from the asset limit. But these programs-ABLE accounts, Ticket to Work, PASS accounts-are often complicated to set up and limited in their scope. The result: Only a tiny fraction of people on SSI use them.

In recent months, the Social Security Administration has simplified some rules about counting income, like excluding the government assistance someone on SSI receives for food and rent. But Social Security Commissioner Martin O'Malley noted to NPR that only Congress can make the most significant reform to SSI.

There's a fix to the asset limit that's been proposed, but stalled, on Capitol Hill. The SSI Savings Penalty Elimination Act would raise the asset limit to $10,000 for an individual and $20,000 for a couple, in line with what the thresholds would be if they had kept up with inflation.

The bill has bipartisan co-sponsors in Congress and has been endorsed by business leaders, including Jamie Dimon, Chairman and CEO of JPMorgan. But the bill wouldn't address other out-dated SSI rules.

One rule says that someone on SSI can't earn more than $65 a month. After that, a recipient loses one dollar of benefits for every two dollars they earn - in effect, a tax of 50 percent.

""That's a higher tax rate than anyone faces on their federal income tax,"" says Ne'eman of Harvard. ""But when it comes to the most impoverished disabled Americans, that is the level of taxation functionally that people are facing when they try and enter the workforce.""

That $65 limit is the same as it was first set in 1972.

When Microsoft in 2020 decided to raise the minimum wage for its lowest paid employees to $25 an hour, the company was surprised to find that disabled workers-largely ones with intellectual disabilities working in the cafeteria, as administrative assistants and other low-level jobs-suddenly faced losing their SSI benefits.

Microsoft hired private benefit managers to advise every employee on SSI, according to Rylin Rogers, the company's disability policy director.

Many of those workers thought they'd need to ""step away from those jobs, good jobs that they had had for a very long time, which would have been a shame,"" says Dan Rutten with the Washington Initiative for Supported Employment, the nonprofit benefits advisory firm that was called in to help. Most of those disabled employees, guided by the advisors, found waiver programs or cut their work hours to balance their salary increases with SSI's rules.

Fifty years ago, when SSI started, making $65 a month got a person close to the poverty limit. ""It was already inadequate in 1972, but it wasn't laughable,"" says Ne'eman. ""Today we have a situation where the income offset really is frankly insulting.""

People on SSI who ""are having the greatest success working"" are the ones who run into the most problems with SSI's rules, says Jack Smalligan who studies income benefits for the Urban Institute. ""So the message to beneficiaries is, essentially, that working doesn't pay.""

A Catch-22

Haly makes too much to take a monthly SSI benefit check. She's one of a tiny number of beneficiaries who need to qualify solely to keep her Medicaid.

But this summer, Haly learned that she was about to lose that health insurance.

At first, Haly thought it was a simple clerical error.

Every year, she gets recertified for Medicaid. Haly says a caseworker for New York state comes to her home and asks a series of questions to determine that she is still disabled. Haly considers the process ""intrusive"", given that she has a progressive neuromuscular condition that is incurable.

Usually, the process is automatic. But this spring, when the notice of her coverage renewal arrived, the line she expected to say her insurance would last until 2025 said 2024 instead.

The state of New York wasn't extending her Medicaid coverage, even though Haly was currently on SSI, which qualified her for that health insurance.

(A spokesperson for New York's Medicaid agency said rules around confidentiality limited its ability to discuss Haly's case. A spokesperson for Social Security noted confidentiality rules, too.)

Haly went to the Social Security office to straighten it out.

""They had no idea what I was talking about,"" she says. ""Zero.""

She says they offered to help her stop working and sign up for a separate benefit program, Social Security Disability Insurance, SSDI, for people who can't work because of a disability.

She recalls: ""The person said: 'I can make you an appointment for SSDI, Do you want to claim disability?' I said, 'No, I do not want to collect SSDI.'""

It took several weeks, she says, until she got an appointment to talk over her problem with a Social Security caseworker. Haly says he advised her that she needed to reapply for SSI.

She was reluctant to apply for a benefit that she already held, and had without question, for years. But the staffer was insistent, so she did.

Shortly after, she got a letter from Social Security-with a short denial. It said she made too much money to qualify.

SSI's regulations are complex and confusing. Often, recipients find it necessary to hire a lawyer or a benefits manager with specialized expertise to negotiate the rules to stay eligible.

""The rules are so complicated that even the most educated, professional people cannot understand and follow the rules. It's heartbreaking,"" says attorney Wagner at Cornell.

For years, Social Security said Haly qualified for an exception to SSI's earnings limit, called a 1619(b) waiver. It refers to a part of the Social Security law that lets some disabled people earn money over the limit and still qualify for Medicaid.

Social Security's denial this summer turned all that upside down.

It ended her eligibility for SSI because of her growing income-which before was excluded by the waiver. When she lost SSI, she lost the waiver that went with it. She can't use the waiver now or even reapply for it because the waiver is only available to people who Social Security says are eligible for SSI.

""It's a Catch-22,"" says Haly, frustrated.

To be eligible again, Haly would need to impoverish herself and give up the aides and medical care she is unlikely to afford on her own-especially if she can no longer work.

Even then, to reapply for SSI and maybe get the waiver again could take months or even years.

So she's asked Social Security to reverse itself and return to what had been the status quo for years and allow her to stay on SSI, to keep her Medicaid and to keep working.

""My medical expenses are so much, hundreds of thousands a year,"" says Haly. ""Do you not want me to work then? Because I can be a VP at JPMorgan Chase. I pay a lot of taxes being a VP at JPMorgan Chase. Or I can just not work and collect.""

While Haly waits for a decision on her appeal, her Medicaid insurance is in place-for now.

For a few days in early summer, without Medicaid, everything stopped. Her medicine was delayed. When her medical providers saw her insurance was halted, they canceled her physical therapy sessions and her wheelchair repair.

There would be few options, Haly says, if she loses her appeal to the Social Security Administration. She could stop working and apply for Social Security Disability Insurance. That comes with Medicare. But it would take at least two years to get it.

""Someone like me,"" she says, ""who is a person with a disability who needs full time care, the only way to get that is in a nursing home.""

Popcorn with a personality-and a work limit

For businesses, there's a growing recognition of the value of hiring more workers with disabilities. One trend: The creation of cafes, coffee shops and other small businesses as places where disabled people can be hired to work alongside others without disabilities.

In St. Paul Minnesota, attorney Shamus O'Meara opened a specialty popcorn business this year with his 26-year-old son Conor, who is autistic.

Conor O'Meara makes the popcorn and greets customers when they come in.

""When they see Connor,"" his father says, ""it's like, 'Connor, how are you!' It's a true joy to have him here. Everyone knows him. They call him the Mayor of St. Paul.""

The goal of Highland Popcorn (motto: ""Popcorn with Personality"") is to create a place where disabled people can find work.

But Shamus O'Meara says they quickly ran into barriers with SSI. Because of the $65 limit on monthly earnings and the $2,000 limit on assets, many of their employees, including Conor, need to limit their work to just a few hours, a few days a week.

That required Shamus, who hires both disabled and non-disabled workers, to find many extra employees to cover all the shifts.

Work is important to Conor, for social interaction and for the money he can earn.

He takes the bus to two other part-time jobs. At a nearby bowling alley, he cleans the scoring screens and sweeps up the cigarette butts outside. At a pizza restaurant, he buses dishes and wraps silverware in napkins. In addition, he volunteers at a community radio station and hosts a show where he talks about his life and about Minnesota's professional sports teams.

Conor says he'd like to work even more. ""I think Social Security should end that one limiting how many hours you work.""

A workforce issue, not charity

Tabi Haly's bosses, too, are confounded by SSI's complex and stale rules - and by the idea that a valued worker would go from a company vice president to having her career ended and possibly needing to move to a nursing home.

""Tabi contributes to our business in a very meaningful way. She's top talent,"" says Bryan Gill, who runs JPMorgan's office of disability inclusion. ""And I want more of Tabi's time contributing to our business.""

Gill says the financial services company makes an effort to hire people with disabilities because it's a way to find talented workers in a tight labor market.

""We do a lot of charity,"" he says. ""We have a lot of philanthropic efforts. This is not one of them. This is a business strategy imperative to the long-term success of this company.""

Haly also writes songs and has recorded two CDs. She started singing as a form of speech therapy to strengthen her weakened lungs.

In the lyrics to one song, ""Waiting in the Wings,"" she asks: ""Do they judge me by my talent? ...Treat me less than a human being? Is that what our life's meant to be?""

""Waiting in the wings means we're waiting backstage,"" she says, waiting for rights. ""What that means here in the States is that we have the liberty to pursue our dreams and live them. And not feel like there are all these barriers to get there.""

Haly says she only wants the chance to keep working and to keep her independence. But she needs to keep her SSI and Medicaid to make that remain her reality."
Future has dropped three chart-topping albums in just six months,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5134015/pop-charts-future-tops-album-chart-again,2024-10-02T14:49:49Z,"This week's Billboard Hot 100 singles chart offers more of the same -- Shaboozey's ""A Bar Song (Tipsy)"" holds at No. 1 for a whopping 12th nonconsecutive week -- but there's major volatility atop the albums chart. Last week's No. 1 album disappears from the Billboard 200 entirely, making room for rapper Future, whose new Mixtape Pluto debuts atop the chart, making it his third new album to top the Billboard 200 this year.

On last week's Billboard 200 albums chart, Travis Scott's 2014 mixtape Days Before Rodeo raced from No. 106 to No. 1 on the strength of its long-awaited vinyl release. This week, without the benefit of that vinyl surge, it plunges again -- dropping from No. 1 out of the Billboard 200 altogether -- while another rapper, Future, takes his place at No. 1.

Mixtape Pluto is Future's third album of 2024, following We Don't Trust You and We Still Don't Trust You. Those two collaborations with Metro Boomin each debuted at No. 1 just three weeks apart back in April; the former record's song ""Like That"" actually kicked off this year's ramped-up beef between Kendrick Lamar and Drake. Naturally, three chart-topping records in six months puts Future in select company: Only two acts have duplicated that feat in the last 60 years, namely The Beatles (in 1965-66) and... the cast of Glee, which pulled it off in the span of just two months back in 2010.

While we're talking milestones, Mixtape Pluto is Future's 11th No. 1 album, which ties him for fifth place all-time with Eminem, Bruce Springsteen, Barbra Streisand and the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. (Drake has 13 No. 1s, Taylor Swift and Jay-Z each have 14 and the aforementioned Beatles hold the record with 19.)

This week, Future's success comes at the expense of pop star Chappell Roan, who'd made a serious bid for No. 1 in conjunction with the one-year anniversary of The Rise and Fall of a Midwest Princess' release. The album received four new variant editions on vinyl -- and one on cassette -- in a push to goose its sales. The bid worked up to a point, as she sold roughly 50,000 vinyl copies, but it was only enough to lift her from No. 3 to her prior chart peak of No. 2, a position she held for two weeks in August, behind Taylor Swift and then Post Malone.

Rounding out the top five are Sabrina Carpenter's Short n' Sweet (swapping spots with Midwest Princess to land at No. 3), Post Malone's F-1 Trillion (holding at No. 4) and Morgan Wallen's One Thing at a Time (holding at No. 5). There are two chart debuts in the bottom half of the top 10 -- Katy Perry's 143 at No. 6 and Lil Tecca's Plan A at No. 9 -- while three old reliables round out the list: Taylor Swift's The Tortured Poets Department (from No. 6 to No. 7), Billie Eilish's Hit Me Hard and Soft (holding at No. 8) and Noah Kahan's Stick Season (from No. 9 to No. 10).

There've been lots of recent weeks with little movement on the Hot 100 singles chart, but this is getting ridiculous: This week's top 10 appears perfectly identical to last week's top 10 at first glance, except when you notice that two of Sabrina Carpenter's three hit singles (""Please Please Please"" and ""Taste"") swap places at No. 8 and No. 9, respectively. That's it!

Sure, there are minor, iterative milestones to discuss. Shaboozey's ""A Bar Song (Tipsy),"" which holds at No. 1 for a 12th nonconsecutive week, is now tied for third-most weeks at No. 1 for any song this decade. Morgan Wallen's ""Last Night"" was No. 1 for 16 weeks just last year, while Harry Styles' ""As It Was"" topped the chart for 15 weeks in 2022. As for the song whose run of weeks atop the chart this decade ties ""A Bar Song (Tipsy),"" here's a hint: It may well hit No. 1 again, starting later this year. (Okay, here's another hint: It's Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas Is You."" That song has actually been No. 1 for 14 weeks in all, but only 12 of them took place during this decade.)

Carpenter has hit a fresh milestone of her own: She's now the only solo woman ever to land three songs in the top 10 simultaneously for five consecutive weeks. (Cardi B once did it four weeks in a row.) In addition to ""Please Please Please"" and ""Taste,"" ""Espresso"" holds at No. 3.

The rest of the top 10 is the same as it ever was -- and, near as I can tell, ever shall be: Post Malone's ""I Had Some Help,"" featuring Morgan Wallen, is No. 2; Chappell Roan's ""Good Luck, Babe!"" holds at No. 4; and Bruno Mars and Lady Gaga's ""Die With a Smile"" sits at No. 5 yet again. Speaking of ""yet again,"" Billie Eilish's ""Birds of a Feather"" (No. 6), Teddy Swims' ""Lose Control"" (No. 7) and Kendrick Lamar's ""Not Like Us"" (No. 10) are also sedentary this week.

Also, though none of its songs hit the top 10, Future's Mixtape Pluto makes its presence felt across this week's Hot 100: Every one of its 17 songs has crashed the chart, ranging from No. 21 to No. 85.

Here we are, 19 weeks later, and eight of those 10 songs are still in the top 13. ""Beautiful Things,"" ""Million Dollar Baby"" and ""Too Sweet"" have been hovering between 11 and 13 for weeks. And, while ""Lunch"" and ""Fortnight"" have slid considerably farther, the albums that spawned them remain in the top 10; those tracks have merely been overshadowed by subsequent singles (""Birds of a Feather"" and ""I Can Do It With a Broken Heart,"" respectively).

Consider this: Since that June 1 chart, only eight songs have entered the top 10 for the first time. Zach Bryan's ""Pink Skies"" had a brief top-10 run in June, peaking at No. 6. Eminem's ""Houdini"" bounced on and off the chart starting in June, peaking at No. 2. Morgan Wallen's ""Lies Lies Lies"" had a one-week cameo in the top 10 in July, peaking at No. 7. The remaining five tracks -- ""Birds of a Feather,"" ""Please Please Please,"" ""Die With a Smile,"" ""Taste"" and ""Good Luck, Babe!"" -- are still there. That... is not a lot of chart movement in four months.

For those who seek something fresh and innovative -- something never-before-heard -- at the top of the pop charts, take solace: If last year's charts are any indication, we're just eight short weeks from the triumphant return of Brenda Lee's ""Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree."""
A Texas man is executed for fatally stabbing twin teenage girls in 1989,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/02/nx-s1-5136517/texas-man-executed-fatally-stabbing-twins-1989,2024-10-02T05:39:21Z,"HUNTSVILLE, Texas -- A Texas man convicted of fatally stabbing twin 16-year-old girls more than three decades ago was executed on Tuesday evening.

Garcia Glenn White was pronounced dead at 6:56 p.m. CDT following a chemical injection at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. He was condemned for the December 1989 killings of Annette and Bernette Edwards. The bodies of the twin girls and their mother, Bonita Edwards, were found in their Houston apartment.

White, 61, was the sixth inmate put to death in the U.S. in the last 11 days. His execution took place shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court, without comment, rejected three last-ditch appeals.

Asked by a warden if he had any statement, White repeatedly apologized in his final words to witnesses looking on.

""I would like to apologize for all the wrong I have done, and for the pain I've caused,"" he said from the death chamber, shortly before the lethal dose of the sedative pentobarbital began flowing into his arms.

He said he took responsibility for the slayings, regretted his actions and was praying for prison officials, officers and ""for my brothers and sisters behind these walls.""

In a loud and strong voice he began singing a hymn, ""I Trust in God,"" singing several verses with the refrain: ""I trust in God, my savior of the world, the one who never failed."" Then he urged family and friends to to ""just keep pushing forward, keep loving one another,"" and ended by thanking prison officials and officers ""for treating us like human beings.""

As the drugs began taking effect, he exhaled softly several times then began sounds like snores, several of them loud. He burped, snored quietly once and gulped. Seventeen minutes later he was pronounced dead.

Testimony showed that White went to the girls' Houston home to smoke crack with their mother, Bonita, who also was fatally stabbed. When the girls came out of their room to see what happened, White attacked them. Evidence showed White broke down the locked door of the girls' bedroom. Authorities said he was later tied to the deaths of a grocery store owner and another woman.

Harris County District Attorney Kim Ogg, who witnessed White's death, lamented that it took some 30 years to carry out the jury's death verdict as multiple appeals in White's case worked through the courts.

""The suffering of surviving (victims') family members is just unspeakable,"" she said. ""At least it's over.""

White's lawyers had unsuccessfully appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court to stop the execution after lower courts previously rejected petitions for a stay. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Friday denied White's request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty or to grant him a 30-day reprieve.

His lawyers argued that Texas' top criminal appeals court has refused ""to accept medical evidence and strong factual backing"" showing White is intellectually disabled.

The Supreme Court in 2002 barred the execution of intellectually disabled people. But it has given states some discretion in deciding how to determine such disabilities. Justices have wrestled with how much discretion to allow.

White's lawyers also accused the Texas appeals court of not allowing his defense team to present evidence that could spare him a death sentence, including DNA evidence that another man also was at the crime scene and scientific evidence that would show White was ""likely suffering from a cocaine induced psychotic break during his actions.""

White's lawyers also argued he is entitled to a new review of his death sentence, alleging the Texas appeals court has created a new scheme for sentencing in capital punishment cases after a recent Supreme Court ruling in another Texas death row case.

Patrick McCann, one of White's attorneys, said Tuesday that his client has spent his entire time in prison ""working to be a better human being.""

The deaths of the twin girls and their mother went unsolved for about six years until White confessed to the killings after he was arrested in connection with the July 1995 death of grocery store owner Hai Van Pham, who was fatally beaten during a robbery at his business. Police said White also confessed to fatally beating another woman, Greta Williams, in 1989."
VP debate: JD Vance and Tim Walz face off tonight. Here's how to watch and when,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/live-updates/jd-vance-tim-walz-debate-2024,2024-10-01T21:58:31Z,"One question likely on the minds of many people watching tonight's faceoff: Who is this for?

National polls show a tight race between Trump and Harris, suggesting the race will come down to voters in a handful of swing states -- depending on who they vote for or whether they vote at all.

And as NPR's Domenico Montanaro reports, only a ""tiny slice"" of the electorate -- from 6% to the low teens -- is considered persuadable.

In NPR's own polling, there have been nearly four dozen undecided voters in the last four months who gave their permission to be contacted.

Montanaro spoke with 10 of them in the days after the Harris-Trump debate, and detailed their reflections here.

""The debate was important for Harris. Most who watched said she performed better than Trump. They were not all moved to vote for her as a result, but four who seemed to need a degree of reassurance about Harris are now voting for her or leaning Harris' direction after the debate.

And while undecided voters often have unique reasons for what influences their votes, there was a clear gender divide. All four who say they are now voting for or leaning toward Harris are women. That also reflects the wide gender gap seen in polls between the candidates.

The other six -- one woman and five men -- were a mix. Five said they likely won't be voting for Harris, most citing the economy or immigration as reasons. One other said he is still truly undecided, but said prices are a major concern.

Two are leaning toward Trump; another said she aligns more with Robert F. Kennedy Jr.; a self-described progressive said he doesn't like Harris' stance on the war in Gaza; and one other, a conservative, said he might not vote at all.""

They're so scorned that they were for centuries known as ""untouchables."" And even though modern India is changing, caste discrimination refuses to go away.

Paik faced prejudice both as a Dalit and a woman. She credits her parents, especially her father, for helping her (and her three sisters) defy the prejudices they faced as Dalits and as women. He made sure they got an education.

For Paik, schooling was a path to teaching history in the U.S., writing books about the untold plight of the Dalits -- and now being dubbed a genius.

She's one of 22 recipients of the 2024 MacArthur fellowship, one of the most prestigious awards for creative and intellectual achievement -- informally known as ""the genius grant.""

MacArthur fellows receive $800,000 over five years to spend however they want -- one of the few no-strings attached grants. The fellows do not apply nor are they officially interviewed for it. The call informing them of the fellowship comes out of the blue.

A research professor of history at the University of Cincinnati, Paik is not a public figure as some recipients are. She has documented the deep social inequity rising from India's repressive caste system that she is a part of. Her focus is the plight of Dalit women like herself.

In a video interview with NPR, Paik, age 50, shares key findings from her years of research -- and why this achievement is such a milestone. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

When you received the news that you'd won the MacArthur grant, what was that moment like?

The call came around 5 p.m. I was resting after a full day of classes. I was tired and couldn't really believe what I was hearing. The Foundation congratulated me, explained the details of the award and how it related to my work. It was such an exhilarating, ecstatic moment.

How does it feel to be called a genius? Growing up, did you ever think that this kind of recognition would be yours?

I've worked very hard all my life against odds, and while every success I've had has been appreciated and celebrated by parents, friends, and extended family, I've never been called a ""genius"" before. It's overwhelming, but when I think of how I got here -- an often rocky journey -- I'm going to embrace it with gratitude.

Tell us about those early years.

Growing up, I had to fight hard to survive. I was born in Pohegaon, a small village in [the western Indian state of] Maharashtra.

My family moved to Pune, the nearest city [four hours away by road] in the 1960s, where I grew up. We lived in a one-room house in a slum area in Yerawada, on the Ahmednagar highway, which made it easier for my father to make trips to our native village so he could keep in touch with his family. Our house was about 20 by 20 feet, and we didn't have access to toilets.

The neighborhood where we lived in was a densely populated, underserved area, full of underprivileged people, some labeled disruptive or dangerous. I have three sisters and if it weren't for our father, who was determined to give us an education, these opportunities wouldn't have been ours. My mother, educated until grade 6, introduced me to the English alphabet. She worked very hard at domestic drudgery to enable me and my sisters to devote ourselves to our education. She protected us and taught us to protect ourselves. She has been a model of fortitude, standing by me, teaching me to pursue my interests singlemindedly and believing in my endeavors.

My father struggled for an education himself. He attended what we call night school and worked during the day, waiting tables and cleaning at restaurants. He put up pandals [temporary scaffolding, used for weddings or religious events] and learnt to play [pre-recorded] music during events. In this way, somehow, he educated himself -- and got a bachelor's degree in Agricultural Sciences, the first Dalit man from his village to do so.

Did his emphasis on education encourage you to pursue a career in academia?

Dalits have been excluded from education and seeking out knowledge for centuries. I mention this in my first book, Dalit Women's Education in Modern India, Double Discrimination. Women faced double discrimination -- for being Dalits and because of their gender.

So that became an important motivation for me too. To escape the slum, I had to get education and employment -- it was key to living a better life.

It became especially important after my father's death in 1996, because I had to support my family -- my mother and sisters .

Soon after, in the same year, I got my masters' degree from the Savitribai Phule university in Pune. I started out as a lecturer teaching history in Mumbai. The Ford Foundation fellowship provided me support to pursue a doctoral degree in Warwick University in the U.K. I arrived in the U.S. in 2005 after securing a fellowship from Emory University.

For people encountering your work in South Asian history for the first time, what can they expect?

My work explores the role of power and identity. It shines a light on the fundamental inequalities in our lives that make some people more equal than others.

Broadly speaking, it documents the inequalities that we inherit. My teaching and research focuses on systemic mechanisms of stigmatization and exploitation.

Those who are privileged elites have pushed the burden of [making amends for prejudices like] caste onto Dalits, of race to Black people and of gender to women, thus holding the oppressed responsible for fighting for their rights and addressing their difficulties on their own. My work shows that everyone -- the oppressed and oppressors -- need to work together to fight for liberation.

Through the course of your career, you've championed the cause of Tamasha women, dancing artists from the Western Indian state of Maharashtra -- some of whom are Dalits. What drew you to their stories?

Tamasha brings together drama, dance, mime, song, and it is considered a traditional art performed predominantly by women from the Dalit community. However, it was often branded ashleel or vulgar by the larger society. The performance and the performers were regarded as loud, pretentious, showy and considered indecent, rude, dishonest.

So growing up, I've watched these performances in both my village and the city and I understood how intensely these women performers were stigmatized. I found literary evidence that dates back to the 10th century calling the art vulgar and saying that no one should be engaging in it or watching it.

When I began the fieldwork for my Ph.D. dissertation in 2002 and 2003, I interviewed about 180 women from different social backgrounds -- from middle-class apartments and slums, from different castes and different Dalit castes. Among these interviewees were many Tamasha women.

Little was known about the caste prejudice and violence that Tamasha girls face.

It amazed me how their voice was so completely erased after being branded as vulgar, and so I set about creating an archive, filled with newspaper clips, magazines, pamphlets, films, music and fieldwork that centered on the experiences of Tamasha women.

So this topic has been on my mind for the last 20 years and became the subject of my second book, The Vulgarity of Caste: Dalits, Sexuality and Humanity in Modern India.

In your book, you discuss the vicious cycle that Tamasha women must endure. Many despise their own line of work because of the bawdry, sensual nature of the dance. They know others don't respect them for it and worse, it leaves them vulnerable to sexual assault -- seen by society as sex workers even though that is not the case. Yet they cannot stop performing, because discrimination against them will not allow them to take on other jobs or switch careers. You call this the sex, gender and caste complex. Could you elaborate?

In the caste system, women are rigidly regulated in terms of their sexuality -- it is used as a means of controlling and branding them. Gender and sexuality are used to deny Dalit women dignity.

For instance, the sex-gender-caste complex very cunningly labels a range of dancers, singers and Tamasha women as prostitutes [as a result of their low caste status].

In my book, Mangalatai Bansode, a well-known Tamasha artist who continues to dance to this day, has discussed the ways the sex-gender-caste complex created so many difficulties for her. She recalled an incident that happened to her as a 16-year-old. She was forced to dance in an ox cart by the people in her village. She was the lead dancer, and she and other women were crammed into an ox cart and had to dance as it made its way around her village. A wild crowd gathered, and men danced and cheered around the ox cart, trying to grab at her and pull at her saree. You can imagine how frightening this experience would have been for a 16-year-old, and yet she could not refuse because she would have to face violence if she did.

In recent years, have things changed? Have modern Tamasha girls found a way out of this cycle of suppression and violence?

As I show in my book the sex-gender-caste complex exploited Dalit Tamasha women, but some women like Bansode have made it work. She created business opportunities and propelled social mobility for herself, her family members and her troupe. Her granddaughter is now a medical doctor.

Tamasha women have also pursued different opportunities in terms of recording CDs, uploading YouTube videos, reels, entering films -- but still these numbers are very small.

Many Tamasha women continue to live in poverty, do not get the pensions promised by the government, do not get support from local authorities and continue to struggle. COVID was particularly challenging for many.

Though it isn't easy, is there any way to build a more equitable society for people who still endure caste prejudice?

It's a centuries-old discrimination so certainly not easy. There are a number of ways we can work on fighting this discrimination and the system. But primarily, we need to acknowledge that caste divisions and prejudice exist.

This is something that especially high-caste elite liberals do not want to talk about. Some [Indians] are quick to talk about the racial discrimination that they face but do not want to talk about the caste discrimination that they perpetuate.

So we should talk about it and stop pretending that there is no caste, in India and elsewhere. There are very intense conversations taking place in the U.S. today, especially [around] caste and race.

The MacArthur grant comes with $800,000 disbursed over five years. Is there a beach chair with your name on it? How does it factor in your future plans?

(Laughs). To be honest, it's going to take some time to sink in.

But I do know that it will help me conduct my research and write on historical inequities and social barriers with greater ease and to expose my students to these different perspectives.

You know -- history isn't a dead subject. Our attitude to the past shapes how we think about the present and how we build our future.

What do you think the fellowship means to other Dalits?

This fellowship is a celebration of the enormous contributions of Dalits -- their ideas, actions, history and fight for human rights -- as much as it is of me as a Dalit woman scholar. I am indebted to the Dalit women who shared their lives with me and I hope this achievement will strengthen the fight of both Dalits and non-Dalits against caste discrimination, in and beyond South Asia.

Zelda is the hero in this one. 'Echoes of Wisdom' flips roles in iconic franchise,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/25/nx-s1-5119337/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-video-game-hero-analysis,2024-10-01T14:16:26Z,"<iframe src=""https://www.npr.org/player/embed/nx-s1-5119337/nx-s1-97324d52-258a-4b66-801a-0200a134416b"" width=""100%"" height=""290"" frameborder=""0"" scrolling=""no"" title=""NPR embedded audio player"">

The Zelda series has been around for nearly four decades, and until now, the protagonist of the mainline series has always been Link - the master sword wielding, green hat-wearing boy or man (depending on the game) who saves the world from the forces of evil and usually rescues Princess Zelda in the process.

But in the newest addition to the series, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, Princess Zelda is the protagonist in a main Zelda game. Link gets trapped in a rift, so Zelda takes the lead and goes on her own adventure to save him. She uses a wand that duplicates objects instead of Link's sword and shield.

Morning Edition host Leila Fadel talked to Amanda Cote, Director of the Serious Games Certificate in the Department of Media and Information at Michigan State University and author of Gaming Sexism: Gender and Identity in the Era of Casual Video Games about the significance of Zelda being the main character for the first time.

Becoming a first-time protagonist

Cote said in the earliest games, Zelda represents a classic damsel in distress. Link is usually the one taking action within the games, protecting Zelda from the villain Ganon/Ganondorf. In past games she had times where she had agency, but Echoes of Wisdom brings it to a new level.

""But there are some moments where Zelda has taken action in the past. In Ocarina of Time, she also has her alter ego of Sheik. Where she shows up and helps Link progress through the story, helps teach him new songs and abilities, and then of course turns out to be the princess at the end,"" Cote said.

She adds that in The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, you meet Zelda first as the Pirate Queen, Tetra, and then later she's revealed to be Princess Zelda.

""Even though Zelda has been somewhat active in previous Zelda titles, in the end she always returns to this more passive princess damsel in distress entity. So she takes action, but then goes back to being the goal rather than the agent,"" said Cote. ""And so having a game where she is an active agent throughout the whole game is really amping up those moments of promise that we saw in earlier titles.""

""I'm optimistic to see what this does for her... does she get to be a whole person? I hope we get to learn things about her that aren't just her role in this story, but also those little quirky bits that make characters feel like people,"" said Carly Kocurek, director of the Game Design and Experience All Media program at Illinois Institute of Technology and author of Coin-Operated Americans: Rebooting Boyhood at the Video Game Arcade.

While Cote doesn't think we'll ever get rid of the damsel in distress entirely because they're the table of some very long running series, like The Legend of Zelda and Super Mario Brothers, she thinks games are starting to be more ironic about the trope.

For example, she said, at the end of Super Mario Odyssey, Princess Peach was rescued by Mario, but decides she's over the fight between Mario and Bowser and wants to be her own woman for a while.

""So the damsel in distress trope is still there, but I think we're about to see more interesting takes on it,"" Cote said.

Is this part of a shift in the gaming industry?

Cote says Zelda being the main character is a continuation of a trend that Nintendo kicked off in the early 2000s.

""Nintendo was not competing particularly well against the PlayStation or against the Microsoft Xbox, and so they instituted what they call their blue ocean strategy. So rather than fighting over the traditional gamer market, what they called the Red Ocean, they deliberately decided to try and reach less targeted audiences... and so they started targeting women, older players, and even younger children,""

Cote said that strategy was really successful, and that Nintendo has said about half of its audience is female so they're continuing to capitalize on that.

And there has been a shift in the video game industry over the past 20 years, Kocurek said, in there being more games with female protagonists. She said the percentage of women in the industry has more than doubled in the past couple of decades, and there's a lot more women in senior roles in the gaming industry who have decision making authority.

""I think companies would be foolish at this point to think you can ignore more than half of the marketplace. Women spend more money on entertainment. Teen girls tend to spend more money on entertainment,"" said Kocurek.

Even though Nintendo instituted its ""blue ocean"" strategy so long ago, Cote said, we're only seeing Zelda as the main character now because The Legend of Zelda is a long running, extremely successful series.

""So there's always the thought of if it ain't broke, don't fix it,"" said Cote. ""Video games are a very risk averse industry... and so the thought of changing a long running successful series is a difficult one. Because what if you kill the goose that lays the golden egg?""

While we have been seeing a long term trend of more female protagonists in video games, Cote says what is changing is that we're seeing female characters introduced in a lot more genres of games.

""One of the things that women gamers have to push against is the stereotype that they are only interested in casual games - puzzle games like Candy Crush or things that have cute characters like Animal Crossing. So seeing female characters added across more genres, like GTA 6, moves us away from that stereotype and shows that diverse game audiences matter across genres and not just in these casual games,"" said Cote."
"Justice Department No. 3 official pledges to fight hate crimes, fueled by personal story",NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/09/30/g-s1-25489/justice-department-hate-crimes-ben-mizer,2024-10-01T09:17:21Z,"Benjamin Mizer, with Attorney General Merrick Garland (left), speaks during a press conference announcing an antitrust lawsuit against Apple in March 2024. Mandel Ngan/AFP via Getty Images hide caption

When the Justice Department's third-in-command announced nearly $30 million in new federal funds to fight the rise in hate crimes last week, he paused to share a personal reflection.

Ben Mizer told the audience he was ""almost exactly the same age"" as Matthew Shepard would have been, another young gay man living in a small college town in the late 1990s. Attackers beat Shepard, tied him to a fence and left him to die in 1998, striking fear and horror across the nation. The law named after him -- and passed more than a decade later -- gave the federal government new tools to prosecute people who are fueled by hate.

""What I would say to members of the LGBTQ community is that the Justice Department is working day and day out on their behalf to ensure that their rights and dignity are protected,"" Mizer said in a recent interview. ""And I'm proud to be a member of that community and at a senior level of the department.""

The FBI reported more than 11,000 hate crimes in 2023, including a steep increase in anti-Jewish and anti-Black incidents. Mizer and other Justice Department leaders have been targeting those and other crime problems with a two-pronged approach: prosecuting offenders and making financial investments in public safety. The Justice Department administers billions in federal grants. Its Office of Justice Programs has already invested more than $70 million into fighting hate crimes over the past several years.

Mizer, 47, oversees an enormous portfolio at the DOJ, from antitrust and the environment to civil rights. In recent weeks, he's helped launch a lawsuit against the operators of a ship that brought down Baltimore's Francis Scott Key Bridge; announce a settlement over the Norfolk Southern train carrying toxic chemicals that derailed in East Palestine, Ohio, not far from where he spent his childhood; and bring blockbuster antitrust cases against Apple, Ticketmaster and Visa.

""I think economic justice means ensuring that everyone has a fair shake, that the playing field is level and that corporations are not using their power in unfair ways to harm competition or to harm consumers,"" Mizer said.

The son of two union workers, Mizer said he went to law school at the University of Michigan to ""help the little guy."" Since then, Mizer has served as solicitor general in his home state of Ohio, and had two separate stints at the Justice Department in Washington.

In the Obama years, Mizer helped implement a U.S. Supreme Court decision that invalidated the Defense of Marriage Act, a law that defined marriage as between one man and one woman. He sat in on the oral argument at the high court for another case, Obergefell v. Hodges, that ultimately legalized same-sex marriage.

""My husband and I enjoy the benefits of the tremendous advances that were made with respect to gay rights during the Obama era,"" Mizer said. ""But that is not to say that those battles are completely won.""

Mizer said he's proud of the work the DOJ has done to challenge state laws that could deprive transgender people of gender-affirming care -- and to protect women's rights to travel to secure health care including abortion services.

It's not clear whether Mizer will stick around at Justice, in the event Vice President Harris wins the White House. But he said working at DOJ has been ""the honor of a lifetime."""
Tim Walz's state became a 'trans refuge.' Here's what that means and how it happened,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/sections/shots-health-news/2024/10/01/nx-s1-5103113/minnesota-trans-refuge-walz-vance-transgender-rights,2024-10-01T09:07:05Z,"MINNEAPOLIS -- As Gov. Tim Walz prepares to debate Sen. JD Vance Tuesday night, Minnesota's status as a ""trans refuge"" state will likely be in the spotlight.

""He's very heavy into transgender, anything transgender he thinks is great,"" former President Trump said on Fox the day after Walz was announced as Vice President Kamala Harris' running mate. (Trump has pledged, if elected, to end gender-affirming care for youth nationally.)

In Arizona earlier this month, Vance falsely claimed the ""trans refuge"" law Walz signed allows the state to ""take children away from their parents if their parents don't want to do sex changes."" He added, ""that is not small government, that is disgusting, and he should be ashamed of himself.""

Here's what the ""trans refuge"" law in Minnesota is, how it's working, and how involved Walz was in getting the law passed.

The first thing to understand about how politically purple Minnesota came to pass this law, is that in 2022, voters elected Democratic majorities in both houses of the legislature and the governorship. It was the first Democratic trifecta in a decade, and lawmakers came in with a list of priorities.

Making the state a ""trans refuge"" wasn't on that list. But freshman Rep. Leigh Finke, the first transgender member of Minnesota's state legislature, made sure it was added.

""I knew that we had to do something because the national, coordinated anti-trans wave was building steam,"" Finke says. In 2023, between January and May, 15 states across the country enacted laws banning gender-affirming care for youth, including Minnesota's neighboring states of Iowa, North Dakota and South Dakota.

""The dominoes fell in 2023,"" Finke says. ""The self-evident urgency became clear to the members of the Minnesota legislature.""

Walz, from the governor's mansion, was an active ally in the effort to protect transgender people in the state and not a newcomer to the issues, Finke says. ""Walz is a teacher and his history includes being the Gay Straight Alliance advisor at Mankato West [high school],"" she points out. ""People who are around young people and have seen what it means to deny people their authentic fullness -- they understand it.""

He was ""clear eyed in his support for this all along,"" Finke says, and quickly signed an executive order to put some protections in place in case the bill didn't get through the legislature. Because her party had only a very slim majority, Finke says she spoke to ""every single Democrat in the legislature -- and some of them for hours and hours,"" about the bill and its importance.

The day of the vote in the House, protestors arguing for and against the bill filled the state house. Debate on the floor was contentious and many hours long. ""We voted at 5:45 in the morning in the House -- it was a filibuster situation -- and everybody stayed up and made it happen,"" she said. In the end, the bill passed in both the house and the senate, and only two Democrats across the legislature voted against it, she says. ""I feel incredibly proud and grateful.""

Walz signed the bill in front of cameras. As he signed, he said ""Love wins,"" and handed one pen to preteen Hildie Edwards, who had testified in support of the law, and another to Rep. Finke.

The text of the law protects the privacy of both patients and clinicians when it comes to gender-affirming care in Minnesota.

""If you are trying to access health care for transition-related reasons, you can access that care in the state of Minnesota no matter where you live, and while you are in the state of Minnesota, our laws will protect you,"" Finke explains.

The law also protects medical providers from out-of-state subpoenas. Finke points to how Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton tried to get medical records for transgender Texans from Seattle Children's Hospital. ""Under our bill, the attorney general is tasked with protecting people in Minnesota to receive gender-affirming care,"" she says, so hospitals and doctors in the state don't need to worry about that kind of effort.

The law does not regulate the care itself -- it was already legal in Minnesota, and the details of a patient's treatment are governed by standards of care, and by an individual's choices, made in consultation with their family and doctor.

One provision of the law concerns custody cases, which Vance pointed to when he claimed the state of Minnesota could kidnap kids. ""There's nothing like that anywhere around this law -- it's a made up lie,"" Finke says. The bill allows certain custody cases to be heard in family court in Minnesota and judges to issue temporary orders, but it does not determine which parent gets custody or hand custody to the state. ""The state cannot claim jurisdiction or custody of a child,"" she says. ""Of course it can't.""

Since Minnesota's trans refuge law was in response to anti-trans legislation in states across the country, the circumstances are ""much more tragic than celebratory,"" Finke says.

Many trans people and their families living in states with bans feel like they're being driven out. ""Hundreds of people and families within the first six months moved to Minnesota -- I'm sure that's a major undercount,"" Finke says. ""And I know as the election comes, we're getting more and more."" She says trans people and their families are worried about what another Trump presidency could mean for their rights, not just in relation to health care access, but also military service, housing and employment discrimination, among other issues.

Since Minnesota's law took effect last spring, it has affected health care providers in the state. Children's Minnesota, which runs a gender program for youth, has seen an increase of about 30% in calls from patients in neighboring states. The hospital tells NPR their waitlist is about a year long for new patients, and they have hired new clinicians to keep up with demand. Family Tree Clinic, a Minneapolis provider of gender-affirming care, has begun a program to help train more physicians on this kind of care around the state.

Some families who can't relocate end up driving hundreds of miles to see gender-affirming care providers in Minnesota. One Minneapolis doctor told NPR he currently has 15 patients who do so.

On the presidential campaign trail, Walz isn't shy about his support for LGBTQ+ rights.

He headlined the recent Human Rights Campaign annual dinner and proudly enumerated the ways that both he and Harris have supported LGBTQ+ rights through their careers. He told the crowd, as he has said many times on the campaign trail, that there's a saying in Minnesota: ""Everything works better if you just mind your own damn business and I'll mind mine.""

""That's truly a long standing Minnesota value here,"" says Finke, who was born and raised in the state. ""People don't necessarily want to get involved, for better or worse, in their neighbors' lives, and that has allowed us to do a lot of good progressive work.""

""Some of the earliest trans action for civil rights was done here,"" she adds. ""In 1978, there was a case argued by the ACLU for a trans woman in the Army to be able to stay and keep her job. We were the first state to protect trans people in our Human Rights Act. It's always just been a part of the fabric here.""

Rep. Leigh Finke has faced fierce opposition to her trans legislative work -- including threats and harassment. In a way, that has helped fuel her own political rise. ""I'm a little bit famous in the Midwest,"" she grins.

""There were some viral moments from the House floor from conservatives going on tirades against me and against trans people, and it provided an opportunity for us to be able to stand strong, to be able to say, 'Here we are, queer forever, you can't just yell at us and have us go away,'"" she says.

She's had positive attention, too. Last year, she was named the USA Today ""Woman of the Year"" for Minnesota, and she was recognized as a ""Health Hero"" by Children's Minnesota.

And she is happy that there is more representation of trans people in public life than when she was growing up in the 80s and 90s in suburban Minnesota. ""You can't be what you can't see,"" she says, noting that she didn't come out as trans until adulthood. ""And I'm so grateful that I did. And I'm so grateful that I get to be in a position now where other people can see not just that there are trans people, but that we're succeeding.""

But when she knocks on doors for her re-election bid this fall, Finke says trans issues are not what voters are concerned about. ""I think that, in general, people don't want to be talking about trans kids, they would rather just let us live our lives.""

She's happy to talk about her other political priorities, like housing and the arts and urban tree policy, instead."

It features stories of people whose kindness left a lasting impression on someone else.

One day in 2001, Nora Durkin decided she had to tell someone about a secret she'd been carrying for more than a decade. When she was a child, Durkin says, she was sexually abused.

She picked up the phone and called 311, the nonemergency number in many communities across the U.S.

""And I am anticipating that the person on the other end is going to have the most negative, underdeveloped response, because that's what I was used to,"" Durkin said.

Instead, when she told the operator her story, the woman gave her the affirmation she had needed for years.

""Her response right away was, 'Oh honey, that's horrible. Tell me what happened,'"" Durkin recalled.

""And then I'm like, 'Yeah, this is terrible. This was terrible. You're right.' So it was like validation just pouring from the other end.""

As they talked, Durkin asked the woman what she should do next. The operator told her to file a police report, which she did. The statute of limitations had run out on her claim, but she says that being able to take action brought her a measure of peace.

Today, Durkin is a therapist -- a profession, she says, that allows her to use her traumatic experience to help others.

""I get to be for them who this woman was for me,"" said Durkin. ""And it's really incredible to take that suffering and turn it into something so meaningful.""

If that operator could hear her now, Durkin would thank her for believing her when no one else would.

""I have held onto her in my memory for over 20 years. And I am eternally grateful for this gift that she gave me that day.""

Claudia Sheinbaum to be sworn in as the 1st female president of Mexico,NPR,,https://www.npr.org/2024/10/01/g-s1-25648/claudia-sheinbaum-female-president-mexico,2024-10-01T06:38:50Z,"MEXICO CITY -- Claudia Sheinbaum will take the oath of office Tuesday as Mexico's first female president in more than 200 years of independence, promising to protect an expanded social safety net and fight for the poor like her predecessor, but facing pressing problems.

The 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician will receive a country with a number of immediate challenges, foremost among them stubbornly high levels of violence, a sluggish economy and hurricane-battered Acapulco.

Sheinbaum romped to victory in June with nearly 60% of the vote, propelled largely by the sustained popularity of her political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

He took office six years ago declaring ""For the good of all, first the poor,"" and promising historical change from the neoliberal economic policies of his predecessors. Sheinbaum promised continuity from his popular social policies to controversial constitutional reforms to the judiciary and National Guard rammed through during his final days in office.

Despite her pledge of continuity, she is a very different personality.

""López Obrador was a tremendously charismatic president and many times that charisma allowed him to cover up some political errors that Claudia Sheinbaum will not have that possibility of doing,"" said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico's Center for Economic Research and Teaching. ""So, where López Obrador was charismatic, Claudia Sheinbaum will have to be effective.""

He is not leaving her an easy situation.

Her first trip as president will be to the flood-stricken Pacific coast resort of Acapulco.

Hurricane John, which struck as a Category 3 hurricane last week and then reemerged into the ocean and struck again as a tropical storm, caused four days of incredibly heavy rain that killed at least 17 people along the coast around Acapulco. Acapulco was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, and had not recovered from that blow when John hit.

Sheinbaum must also deal with raging violence in the cartel-dominated northern city of Culiacan, where factional fighting within the Sinaloa cartel broke out after drug lords Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after they flew there in a small plane on July 25.

López Obrador has long sought to avoid confronting Mexico's drug cartels and has openly appealed to the gangs to keep the peace among themselves, but the limitations of that strategy have become glaringly apparent in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, where gun battles have raged on the city's streets. Local authorities and even the army -- which López Obrador has relied on for everything -- have essentially admitted that the fighting will only end when the cartel bosses decide to end it.

But that's only the latest hotspot.

Drug-related violence is surging from Tijuana in the north to Chiapas in the south, displacing thousands.

While Sheinbaum inherits a huge budget deficit, unfinished construction projects and a burgeoning bill for her party's cash hand-out programs -- all of which could send financial markets tumbling -- perhaps her biggest looming concern is the possibility of a victory for Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.

Trump has already vowed to slap 100% tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico. Though that would likely violate the current U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, there are other things Trump could do to make life difficult for Sheinbaum, including his pledge of massive deportations.

Things with its northern neighbor were already tense after López Obrador said he was putting relations with the U.S. embassy ""on pause"" after public criticism of the proposed judicial overhaul.

First lady Jill Biden struck an optimistic tone for relations with the incoming Sheinbaum administration saying at a reception Monday that, ""Under Dr. Sheinbaum's presidency I know we will continue to build a more prosperous, safe and democratic region -- and take the steps in our U.S.-Mexico partnership.""

There are areas where Sheinbaum could try to take Mexico in a new direction. For example, she has a Ph.D. in energy engineering and has spoken of the need to address climate change. López Obrador built a massive new oil refinery and poured money into the state-owned oil company. But his budget commitments do not leave her much room to maneuver.

Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the Royal Holloway University of London who has studied Latin America for decades, said Mexico electing its first female leader is important because it will show girls they can do it too, but it can also create unrealistic expectations.

""Woman firsts are powerful symbols, but they do not gain magic power,"" she said. ""Especially when the governance challenges are so large, expecting magic solutions overnight can also generate outsized disappointment."""
How the Know Your Value contest helped this woman transform into a workplace leader,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/know-value-contest-helped-woman-transform-workplace-leader-rcna174426,2024-10-08T16:40:56Z,"Danielle Oceguera, 25, won Mika Brzezinski's Grow Your Value contest in 2018.Miller Hawkins

In 2018, a colleague encouraged 25-year-old Danielle Oceguera to apply for Mika Brzezinski's Know Your Value bonus competition -- a contest that awards $25,000 to the woman who can best articulate her value in a 60-second pitch to the Morning Joe co-host. At the time, the master's degree student had a few doubts.

Oceguera, and Oakland native, had just transitioned into a coordinator role in the talent department at Stanford University, and was hesitant to put herself on stage, in front of a national audience.

""I would never describe myself as a confident person or someone that was willing to freely express their ideas or see value in their ideas,"" she recently told Know Your Value.

Despite her initial lack of self-confidence, Oceguera was accepted as a contestant to Know Your Value's San Francisco event, and went on to win the live pitch competition and claim the cash prize. But she admitted the biggest reward wasn't the money -- it was the personal change that the contest sparked in her.

""When I went into the Know Your Value [conference], it was quite literally such a life-changing experience, because I was, I was just a different person,"" she said. ""I'm a friendly person, but I didn't talk in meetings. I didn't speak up to my supervisors. I didn't want to engage in those types of conversations, or even higher-level thinking conversations, because I just thought I wasn't smart enough, or I wasn't articulate enough.""

Oceguera spoke about her difficulties asserting herself. ""I'd be in meetings and I'd see a problem, or I'd see something that we should be anticipating, but I would literally not say anything at all, just because I didn't think that it would add value.""

Growing up as a third-generation Latina, respecting authority and ""keeping her head down"" were cultural traits that subconsciously followed her into the workplace. ""I was the youngest person in the office,"" she recalled. ""It doesn't come natural for me to speak up ... you don't want to be contradictory, because you should be grateful for the job that you have.""

As one of the only Latinas in her workplace, Oceguera struggled to envision her own progression in leadership. ""It just felt like something very far away, like I didn't really see myself as a leader at Stanford,"" she said. ""And the Know Your Value experience gave me a lot of vocabulary around what my value really was.""

Learning her value helped her earn the $25,000 grand prize, which she used, in part, to pay for her education. ""That whole experience was really pivotal for me,"" Oceguera said.

She received body language training from behavior expert Janine Driver, confidence development skills from communications expert Chris Ulrich, and personal style tips Gravitas founder and CEO Lisa Sun. Oceguera and two other finalists were given a crash course to prepare for their live pitch competition.

Ultimately, the confidence she honed during that time led her to become a better advocate at work. ""If anyone asked about the number one characteristic to describe me, it would probably have been 'helpful,'"" she said. ""So my value was in helping others, but I didn't do very much to help myself at the time. Post the Know Your Value [conference] ... I learned a lot about myself.""

During her winning pitch -- in front of Brzezinski and 600 conference attendees -- Oceguera advocated for ""the voiceless and underrepresented communities.""

Almost six years later, she has done just that. She now focuses on growing middle management at Stanford, helping staff climb the ladder, get promoted and gain key leadership skills. Oceguera was part of the university's talent development team that spearheaded an important DEI initiative to create more inclusion and a sense of belonging for underrepresented communities at the elite institution.

Reflecting back on all the work she's done to help university staff find their own voice and grow their value, she credits her 2018 experience the most. Now, when she talks to young people -- especially from immigrant backgrounds like hers -- she shares the same lessons she learned from the Know Your Value conference.

""I let them know that the reason they're here is because they deserve to be here, and I encourage them to speak up in meetings [and not to be afraid],"" she said. ""What you have is important for us to learn, and your experience is important."""
DeSantis administration warns local TV stations to remove ads about abortion ballot measure,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/desantis-abortion-rights-florida-amendment-4-caroline-ad-rcna174387,2024-10-08T10:47:32Z,"The Republican administration is pressuring Florida stations to take down an ad that promotes a ""yes"" vote on Amendment 4, which would enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution.

Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration had already tried to put its thumb on the scale against Amendment 4, a statewide measure that could enshrine abortion rights in the state constitution. And now the admin has added to that disturbing trend.

Florida's six-week abortion ban is one of the strictest in the country. The DeSantis administration recently had its election police unit investigate people who had signed a petition to get Amendment 4 on the ballot. Then the administration used taxpayer money to launch an anti-abortion website. The administration also used state money to air Orwellian television ads proclaiming that ""Florida cares about women and families.""

Now the DeSantis administration appears to be trying to intimidate people who have run an ad that promotes a ""yes"" vote on Amendment 4.

""The doctors knew if I did not end my pregnancy, I would lose my baby, I would lose my life, and my daughter would lose her mom,"" a woman says in the ad, titled ""Caroline.""

""Florida has now banned abortion even in cases like mine,"" she says.

Investigative journalist Jason Garcia published a letter from the Florida Department of Health's general counsel to the general manager of WFLA-TV, the NBC affiliate in the Tampa Bay area. The letter, dated Oct. 3, argues that the ad contains a ""categorically false"" claim about abortion in Florida -- and warns that the ad is in violation of state law.

""The advertisement is not only false; it is dangerous,"" the letter reads. ""Women faced with pregnancy complications posing a serious risk of death or substantial or irreversible physical impairment may and should seek medical treatment in Florida.""

In practice, Florida's law hasn't been so clear. Even though the law includes exceptions for rape and incest in certain cases, the law has confused doctors and caused a chilling effect among providers. The problem has been so glaring that the DeSantis administration has threatened doctors who don't provide emergency care in these confusing scenarios, which are only occurring because of the law Republicans put in place.

In another letter Garcia posted online, lawyers for the group sponsoring Amendment 4 defended the ad as true and urged a Florida TV station to continue carrying it.

The Florida Department of Health's letter ""is a flagrant abuse of power and must be rejected,"" the lawyers wrote.

The DeSantis administration sure seems like it's attempting to hide the dangerous impacts of Florida's abortion laws from public view."
The unexpected joys of being single in your 50s,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/health-mindset/unexpected-joys-single-50s-rcna174128,2024-10-07T14:11:49Z,"Pattie Eshsaei - an attorney and financial services expert - uses her TikTok platform to teach financial literacy, social and workplace decorum, along with a focus on empowering women.Greg Crowder

As I approached my 50s, I found myself unexpectedly single. I was 46, with no prospects on the horizon, and wondering what was wrong with me. A year earlier, I had broken up with the man I thought I would marry, and here I was, single again.

One day, while visiting my cousin, her neighbor came over to pick up her kids. She casually asked, ""Why are you single?""

Within seconds, I was in the fetal position on the sofa, crying uncontrollably. You know, the ""ugly cry.""

My cousin and her neighbor rushed to comfort me, but their attempts felt feeble. For 15 minutes I cried, convinced I was cursed, destined to be deprived of love for eternity.

Eventually, I peeled myself off the sofa and rushed to my car, desperate to be alone in my misery. But as I glanced in the rearview mirror, I saw a reflection that stopped me in my tracks: a middle-aged woman with dark mascara streaks running down her face. It was a pathetic sight -- scary, sad and sickening.

At that moment, I realized what I had become: a desperate woman whose self-worth was entirely dependent on being chosen by a man. Without that validation, I felt like I was nothing and had nothing.

It didn't matter that I was healthy and attractive. It didn't matter that I had a fantastic career, great friends, a wonderful family, a packed social calendar, and more money than I could spend. None of it mattered if I didn't have a ""man."" And that realization disgusted me.

I despised what I had become and, in that moment, decided to choose differently. Instead of focusing on what was missing -- a man -- I resolved to embrace the benefits of not having one.

For some, this might seem like a daunting reality, but for me, it was the most empowering and liberating chapter of my life. I learned that being single in your 50s is often misunderstood. People may assume loneliness or loss, but what they don't see is the immense joy, freedom, and self-discovery that comes with it. Although I am in a relationship now, that time was, without a doubt, one of the biggest blessings I could have ever imagined.

Here's why:

In your 50s, you're more self-assured and confident than ever before. This period of your life has brought a deeper understanding of who you are and what you want. You no longer feel the need to compromise or adjust yourself for the sake of anyone else's expectations. You can live for yourself, fully and authentically. Because of this, you're less likely to put up with people who don't bring you joy or disturb your peace.

You also have the freedom to make decisions based solely on your desires, needs, and aspirations. Whether it's traveling on a whim, diving into a new hobby, or embracing quiet nights alone, you now have the autonomy to shape life on your own terms. There is a profound beauty in being the sole architect of your happiness. The freedom to prioritize myself has been one of the most empowering experiences of my 50s, and it's a gift that I deeply treasure.

One of the greatest misconceptions about being single later in life is that it must come with a sense of lack, as if being without a partner means missing out on something. But I don't see it that way. Instead, I now realize that the relationships I foster are those I truly want in my life, not those I need to fill a void or societal expectation.

You have the ability to develop deeper friendships. Connect with other women who share similar experiences and uplift each other in ways that feel genuine. It's been such a joy to spend time with like-minded women whose sole focus is not having a man or needing one. And should romantic love ever find you again, it will be on your terms. You won't settle for anything less than what you deserve, because you've learned that your happiness is not dependent on someone else. This self-reliance is both liberating and powerful.

Time has also become my greatest companion. In your 50s, being single means that you're no longer pulled in a dozen directions by the demands of a partner or children. Your time is yours to manage, and you get to decide where and how to invest it. This will allow you to nurture friendships, pursue passions and most importantly, invest in self-care. I've rediscovered the things that make me feel alive -- whether that's cycling, painting or volunteering -- and I now have the luxury of time to dive deeply into them.

This relationship with time will also allow you to reflect and grow. I've shed the insecurities of my 20s and 30s and embraced the wisdom that comes with life's experiences. In this quiet space, I was able to cultivate mindfulness and truly connect with myself, which made me a better person.

For decades, so many women pour themselves into others -- nurturing relationships, raising children or navigating the complexities of a marriage. Now, is the time to pour that same energy into yourself, and it feels incredible. Self-care isn't just a buzzword; it's a lifeline. You can finally put yourself first without guilt or the feeling that you're neglecting someone else's needs.

Time is about healing, too, whether that's physical, emotional or spiritual. I've learned to listen to my body, embrace my health and focus on what brings me peace, like my evening walks. I've curated a life that feels good to me, and that sense of well-being is the truest form of luxury.

You have the freedom to change course. Don't buy the delusion that you're past your prime or your best years are behind you. I reject that notion entirely. Being single at this stage allowed me to embrace change and growth with open arms. I was no longer afraid of reinvention or exploring new possibilities, and thus, started my TikTok channel at the age of 48, with almost 1 million followers today!

You have the freedom to pivot, whether that means shifting careers, moving to a new city, or simply reimagining what the next decade will look like. There is a tremendous sense of possibility in this freedom. You're not bound by the expectations of others or a relationship that defines you. Instead, you're constantly evolving, and that evolution is your own to navigate.

Ultimately, the greatest gift of being single in your 50s is the deep, unwavering love you will cultivate for yourself. For the first time, you don't look outside for validation. You don't seek approval from a partner or a society that tries to dictate who you should be. I have become my own best friend, my own cheerleader, and my own source of joy, because I understand that no one is coming to save me.

This self-love has been the foundation of my happiness. It allows me to wake up each day with a sense of peace and contentment, knowing that I am enough just as I am. This journey of self-discovery and empowerment is one that I would not trade for anything, and it is the ultimate blessing of being single in my 50s."
Latina Equal Pay Day is a reminder that we can't afford to be humble,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/latina-equal-pay-day-reminder-cant-afford-humble-rcna173928,2024-10-03T20:51:59Z,"Daniela Pierre-Bravo, author of ""The Other: How to Own Your Power at Work as a Woman of Color.""Anthony Scutro / MSNBC

As a Latina who reports on women in the workplace, I've learned gains for women do not happen equally. Despite Latinas being highly ambitious and part of the fastest growing demographic in the U.S., their lack of advancement in the workplace has remained stagnant and continue to be an incredible cause for concern.

Latinas are undervalued at work, and they come in dead last in terms of equal pay compared to other groups. In fact, Oct. 3 marks the day in the calendar year when Latinas finally catch up to what a non-Hispanic, white man earned last year. In 2024, Latinas working full time and part time, make -- on average -- 51 cents for every dollar paid to a white, non-Hispanic male (down from 52 cents last year).

This inequity starts early. Latinas enter their careers as the most underrepresented group in corporate America, and this year they faced the steepest drop in early career promotions compared to their male counterparts.

And according to new research from Lean In and McKinsey, for every 100 men who received their first promotion, only 65 Latina women did. This is what's called the ""broken rung,"" and Latinas face not one, but two of them. After being overlooked for management roles, they are again passed over for senior leadership roles. And then, by the time they reach the C-suite, they are the least represented (at just 1 percent), followed by Black women and Asian women (both at 3 percent). With a cumulative loss of over $1.2 million in lifetime earnings, the stakes have never been higher for Latinas.

The driving forces behind these inequalities are complex and multilayered.

We know by now that external factors like unconscious biases are to blame. Many of the Latinas I've interviewed said they've felt sidelined at work. They cited examples of being told by their managers that they are not a ""cultural fit,"" that they feel ""overlooked,"" or that they have ""mistaken for the secretary in meetings.""

Those biases by themselves can create harmful repercussions for Latinas and can further hinder their ability to self-advocate -- a key component in moving up the ladder.

In my book ""The Other,"" I share the stories of Latinas grappling with factors like guilt, a pressure to assimilate (therefore downplaying their identity), and being prone to risk aversion as they navigate their careers. Being a Latina immigrant myself, and having been the first in my family to go to college and earn a 401K, I relate to other Latinas who have cited feeling guilty when it comes to asking for more pay or advancement at work; worried we'll look ungrateful. As immigrants and children of immigrants we're acutely aware of the sacrifices that afforded us a chance at the American Dream. In turn, that self-imposed accountability can leave us ""playing it safe"" at work for fear of ruffling feathers and losing out on professional opportunities -- even when we are being undervalued. It can confine us into a loop of reactivity and keep us stuck in a ""customer service"" mentality.

I've heard time and time again from Latinas that they're reminded by their mothers and abuelitas of the importance of being humble. Yet the biggest fallacy we've assumed about corporate America is that our employers will notice our hard work when the time is right.

This is one of the many reasons Latinas need more career sponsors, not just mentors. We need more women, and yes men, advocating for Latinas in rooms they're not in, while helping provide access to spaces of power. We need more leaders to speak up and credit Latinas when ideas originate from them, and to be aware of conscious biases and push back on them in real time. Latinas also need pay transparency and allies who are committed to help grow their negotiating power by disclosing the real numbers behind the pay they deserve.

It's not only in the interest of Latinas to advance up the ladder, but also in the companies that hire them. Data shows that Latinas are highly committed to their growth -- Nearly 90 percent of Latinas say they're interested in getting promoted to the next level at work, compared with 78 percent of white women and 81 percent of women overall. It is a collective responsibility to lift up and change this bleak trajectory for Latinas. The time for commitment on advancement and sponsorship for Latina women is now."
Melania Trump reveals pro-abortion stance that's completely at odds with the GOP,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/melania-trump-abortion-rights-book-rcna173791,2024-10-03T16:37:17Z,"The former first lady's revelation is hard to square, given her husband's singular role in rolling back a right she calls essential to women ""from birth.""

In her forthcoming self-titled memoir, Melania Trump espouses an unflinching belief in abortion rights -- a view on one of the biggest issues of the election that is entirely antithetical to that of her husband and her political party.

In reviewing an early copy of her book, The Guardian reports that Melania Trump says it is ""imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy"" in deciding whether to have children, ""free from any intervention or pressure from the government.""

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body,"" she adds.

On Thursday morning, she also posted a video to social media that references her position on abortion rights. ""Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom,"" Melania Trump says in the video. ""What does 'my body, my choice' really mean?""

According to the Guardian, Melania Trump's book acknowledges the extreme circumstances in which some people make such decisions, including rape, incest or severe medical conditions in the fetus. But she also defends abortion access later in a pregnancy, which her husband has repeatedly demonized and misrepresented as a ""radical"" Democratic view.

She writes:

The former first lady's revelation is astonishing, given how out of step she is with her party, and in light of her husband's singular role in rolling back the right that she professes is essential to women ""from birth.""

And the timing of her declaration is no less circumspect: Melania Trump chose not reveal that she is pro-abortion when Roe v. Wade was overturned, or after Republican legislatures imposed draconian state abortion bans, which have caused preventable deaths and forced women to travel out of their states for the procedure. Rather, her apparently unwavering belief in abortion rights comes just ahead of a closely contested election in which Republicans are trying desperately to rebrand their extreme abortion views -- and in a memoir she is selling for upwards of $40."
Opinion | JD Vance tried to mansplain his way into the good graces of women. It didn't work.,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/jd-vance-vice-presidential-debate-fail-rcna173598,2024-10-02T23:54:23Z,"Vance admits Republicans have a problem when it comes to women's trust. That doesn't mean he has a plan.

Republican vice presidential nominee JD Vance arguably had one job going into Tuesday night's debate: convince the American public that he, and his party, don't hate women.

Even with that painfully low bar, I'd say he failed to do the job. The once anti-Trump senator did wear a pink tie, but did not face up to his past comments about menopausal women, ""childless cat ladies"" and a historically low favorability rate. Instead, he used most of his allotted speaking time to mansplain his views to the two women who were moderating, women who vote, and even his own wife.

During a question on immigration, Vance tried to talk over CBS moderators Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, after he regurgitated dangerous lies about Haitian immigrants living in Springfield, Ohio. To Vance's dismay, Brennan reminded the audience that the immigrants in Springfield are there legally.

""The rules that you were not going to fact-check,"" Vance quipped, referring to CBS' statement that it would leave it to Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz to fact check each other during the debate. ""And since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

Vance talked over and interrupted both O'Donnell and Brennan as they tried to move forward with the debate.

""Thank you, senator, for describing the legal process,"" Brennan said, before the network then muted Vance's mic.

""The audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get into. Thank you for explaining the legal process,"" she added, in a tone every woman sitting in a cubicle, boardroom or classroom knows deep in her bones.

Unlike his windmill-, shark- and Hannibal Lecter-obsessed running mate, Vance deftly wields a very specific type of misogyny that, while far less obvious, is just as insidious -- one that can come off as empathic, but is undeniably condescending as it normalizes the most draconian right-wing policies.

One example of this was Vance consistently referring to Brennan -- a woman he does not personally know -- by her first name rather than addressing her appropriately. The slight-of-hand misogynistic move may have been Vance's attempt to appear likable and down-to-earth, but many viewers saw it differently: condescending, patronizing and rude.

Vance himself admitted that the Republican Party has a problem when it comes to women's trust. He reminded women watching Tuesday that they do not trust Republicans when it comes to abortion and the human right to bodily autonomy -- yet failed to explain how he, his running mate and his fellow party members plan to address the problem.

""We've got to do so much better of a job at earning the American people's trust back on this issue where they, frankly, just don't trust us,"" Vance said, before claiming that is ""one of the things that Donald Trump and I are endeavoring to do.""

To demonstrate his party's commitment to earning that end, Vance lied about not supporting a nationwide abortion ban, the realities of abortion care later in pregnancy, and Minnesota's PRO Act, signed by his opponent, Gov. Tim Walz. Because nothing says ""trust me, I know what's best for you"" like holding an impromptu masterclass on gaslighting.

While Vance was able to appear far more level-headed than Trump in his fateful debate performance against Vice President Kamala Harris last month, it was Vance's faux praise of his wife while discussing the necessity of child care that truly embodied his very specific type of mansplaining and misogyny.

""I speak from this very personally because I'm married to a beautiful woman who is an incredible mother to our three beautiful kids, but is also a very, very brilliant corporate litigator, and I'm so proud of her,"" Vance began. ""But being a working mom, even for somebody with all of the advantages of my wife, is extraordinarily difficult.""

It's telling, when a man publicly laments the challenges his working wife faces, yet doesn't seem to face those same challenges as a working father. While appearing to appreciate all his wife does, Vance still chose to mansplain how hard it is to work outside the home while managing the majority of child care and household responsibilities without structural support -- the exact structural support Republicans have historically opposed.

For his bropropriating coup de grâce, Vance then pontificated on the importance of giving a ""family care model that makes choice possible.""

""The cultural pressure on young families, and especially young women, I think, makes it really hard for people to choose the family model they want,"" Vance said, ignoring how anti-abortion laws make it difficult, dangerous and in some cases impossible for women to choose when and how to start creating a ""family model"" in the first place.

Overall, it's true that during Tuesday's debate Vance succeeded in portraying himself as a level-headed, somewhat ordinary politician (if the definition of ""ordinary"" is calmly discussing the largest mass deportation effort in U.S. history). But that is perhaps what makes Vance far more Machiavellian than Trump even. And it's what should put us all on high alert as we prepare to head to the polls in November."
"MAGA abortion bans are an attack on men's freedom, too",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/the-reidout/reidout-blog/maga-abortion-bans-attack-mens-freedom-rcna173625,2024-10-02T19:49:35Z,"Men 4 Choice co-founder Oren Jacobson spoke with The ReidOut Blog about how his group is defying hypermasculine norms and tagging men into the fight for reproductive rights.

This post is the third in ""MAGA and Masculinity in 2024,"" an ongoing series examining the societal fallout from right-wing hypermasculinity -- and the people fighting its toxic messaging by positively redefining what it means to be a man. You can read the first post here and the second post here.

Oren Jacobson, co-founder of reproductive rights advocacy group Men 4 Choice, said he had an ""aha-slash-oh-s--- moment"" in 2015 that led him, a progressive organizer at the time, to shift his focus toward reproductive rights and bodily autonomy.

That was the year he became convinced of the real potential for Roe v. Wade to be overturned and for abortion to be criminalized, Jacobson told me on Tuesday. He cited Pew Research Center data that shows majorities of both men and women support abortion being legal in all or most cases. However, he argued, voices critical of abortion seem to dominate coverage of the issues.

""I was struck by the fact that the men who were speaking were the ones who were trying to criminalize abortion, while the six in 10 of us who thought that was bulls--- were saying nothing and doing nothing,"" Jacobson said. ""And that struck me as this really interesting puzzle.""

Men 4 Choice garnered national attention last year and earlier this year when second gentleman Dough Emhoff invited the group to participate in roundtables on ways to get male allies to help advocate for abortion rights. And the group's ads have drawn support from other prominent activists.

In my interview with Jacobson on Tuesday, we discussed hypermasculinity, men's role in the reproductive rights movement, and the powerful moments at the Democratic National Convention this year, when Josh Zurawski and Derek Cook took the stage as symbols of the righteous impact men can have on the fight reproductive rights.

This interview has been slightly edited for length and clarity.

Jah'han Jones: What are the lessons your work has taught you about men's views on abortion rights?

Oren Jacobson: Number one is that most men don't understand the harm abortion bans cause. It's a little easier now, after Dobbs, because you have Josh Zurawski speaking out or Derek and Anya Cook's story or the couple stories out of Georgia we've seen where women have actually died. So that harm is a little bit more front and center. But especially pre-Dobbs, and in ways that people don't even see still, it wasn't as obvious to many men how people are harmed by the denial of access to care, whether it's like care in an emergency situation or just like, ""Hey, when you start banning and criminalizing abortion, OB-GYNs leave your state and less people have access to all reproductive health care."" So the number one lesson is the need for men to understand harm. How does this actually hurt my family, my community, and my people?

OJ: Number two is that most men don't see this as their issue. It's a woman's issue in their mind. They think, ""It doesn't directly impact me. I'm not affected.""

The third is that most men don't see a natural entry point into this organizing work. Most of the organizations and organizing and messaging and communications and outreach is focused on women and pregnant people, which makes endless amounts of sense. But pick any population in the country and say, ""If you're not engaging them, what are the odds that they actually engage with you civically, right?""

And then the fourth is that men don't have a playbook. They just don't know what to do and don't know what to say. And so even if you get them through the first three pieces, you give them an entry point. You help them see the harm. You help them create ownership. You still need to tell them what to do and how to do it, because they know they're not experts, and they're worried that they're going to screw up.

JJ: What kind of messaging have you seen work in terms of getting men to better understand that abortion is their issue, too?

OJ: We tell men this isn't just about abortion. It's about freedom and power and control. Because no person can be free if they don't have the power to control their own body and reproductive decisions, right? Not if the government has the power to control you, or the power to control the most important decision you could ever make -- which is if, when and how to build a family. So we start in this place of grounding the question in these universal value frames that all of us understand. The word freedom is just such a part of our political and cultural discourse.

JJ: Absolutely.

OJ: The second piece of this is what I would call stakeholder messaging, which is different than allyship messaging and different than beneficiary messaging. Allyship means I stand up for you because you're hurt. Our message is actually different. It's about what men have to lose. It frames them as someone whose body may not be under attack, but someone whose rights are -- whose family is and whose freedom is.

We'll use a story like Josh's as a way to point that out: If the government has the power to control your wife's body, the government has the power to control your family. So your body may not be under attack, but your rights are, your family is, and your freedom. Josh and Derek almost lost everything because their partners were denied access to basic, essential reproductive health care.

JJ: I hear you.

OJ: I should say, men who are LGBTQ+ are quicker on the draw on this. They see the connection between the legal structure of their rights around privacy, around government, and the government attacking and controlling people. If you're a queer man in America and you live in a state that's banning abortion, you probably happen to also live in a state that's attacking your rights.

JJ: Sure, and in that case you might be better equipped with the language to fight back against things like attacks on bodily autonomy and what that means for pregnant people, too.

OJ: Yes, and that's why we focus on terms like freedom, power, control. It's finding a way to center men -- putting men into the center of the [abortion] story without making the story about men, if that makes sense.

JJ: It does. And I appreciate those efforts at a time when the MAGA movement is using those words to promote a toxic masculinity rooted in brutishness and bravado. I see your organization deploying them toward better ends.

OJ: A lot of young men in particular are susceptible to what that movement is doing because the world around them is changing. We're all socialized into ideas. Some of them are good. Some of them are bad. We think that -- not just until Election Day, but beyond this -- we need to build a plan and a movement to win on this question. To win and fight for young men."
Amber Thurman's family slams GOP on abortion again after Vance equivocates at debate,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/top-stories/latest/amber-thurman-abortion-republicans-vance-debate-rcna173630,2024-10-02T18:52:20Z,"""Amber Thurman should still be alive,"" Vance said, as he defended the very circumstances that led to her preventable death in 2022.

On the debate stage Tuesday night, Sen. JD Vance found himself agreeing with his opponent, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, that a woman who died from abortion complications in 2022 due to Georgia's draconian abortion ban should still be alive.

""Governor, I agree with you,"" the Republican vice presidential nominee said. ""Amber Thurman should still be alive -- and there are a lot of people who should still be alive -- and I certainly wish that she was.""

Vance's acknowledgement that Thurman's death was preventable and his expressed desire for the GOP to ""earn people's trust back"" on abortion doesn't square with Republican lawmakers actively restricting people's ability to make such choices for themselves. After the debate, Thurman's family issued a statement condemning the GOP for ""seek[ing] to further restrict women's access to necessary healthcare under the false guise of protection.""

""Amber's tragic death was a direct result of Georgia's archaic and dangerously restrictive abortion laws, which denied her the life-saving care she so desperately needed,"" Thurman's family said. ""We are grieving an unimaginable loss that no family should have to endure.""

In the debate, Vance said that the American people ""just don't trust"" Republicans when it comes to abortion, and that he wanted the GOP to become ""pro-family in the fullest sense of the word."" He also claimed that he has never supported a federal abortion ban (Vance did, however, say as recently as 2022 that he ""would like abortion to be illegal nationally"") and defended the overturning of Roe v. Wade.

After lamenting Thurman's death, Vance immediately went on to talk about ""partial birth abortion,"" a highly misleading political term that refers to an abortion that happens later in pregnancy. He also asserted that allowing states to impose their own abortion laws is the right thing to do, despite that being exactly the circumstance that led to Thurman's death."
How a cold-email led me to professionally photograph Taylor Swift,MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/know-your-value/career-growth/cold-email-led-professionally-photograph-taylor-swift-rcna173414,2024-10-02T15:16:11Z,"If you had told me 10 years ago that I would photograph Taylor Swift in concert not once, not twice, but over three different tours, and that I would be hosting a Taylor Swift-themed photography exhibit showcasing all those photos, I would have thought these statements were the stuff of fantastical dreams.

Taylor Swift? Front row, taking photos? Three tours? Hosting an exhibition? Impossible.

Because 10 years ago I was an unemployed production assistant lost in the swap of the Los Angeles entertainment industry, hoping for any bit of work to justify the life decisions I had made at that point: leaving Canada where I had grown up, putting aside my master's degree in journalism from Columbia University, and venturing out to the Wild West for a shot to be a part of creating culture that got exported around the world.

What saved me from a slow slide to abandoned dreams into a much more practical life path, was the ace up my sleeve of cold-emailing, and the ability I seemed to have via earnest paragraphs to somehow convince much more important people to take a shot on me and offer opportunities to try out this thing called photography, in particular behind-the-scenes photography on music video sets, where I first got my start assisting a music video director.

When one of those emails worked and an executive producer (shoutout to Joseph Uliano!) invited me to be the behind-the-scenes photographer on an upcoming Cage the Elephant music video, it started a nearly decade-long path of photographing live concerts that culminated in photographing Taylor Swift's Eras Tour, and displaying work from her three tours (including 1989 and Reputation) at Kimpton Epic Hotel Miami's artist-in-residence program.

Since that fated Cage the Elephant music video set (for their song ""Cigarette Daydreams""), I have photographed the aforementioned Taylor Swift tours as well as Ed Sheeran, Adele, Janelle Monae, Nicki Minaj, Olivia Rodrigo, The Killers, Maisie Peters, HAIM, Gracie Abrams, and SIA. I seem to have been destined to work at the heart of the celebrity-driven world even when I transitioned to working in the tech industry in San Francisco, where for six years I was producer then a creative director at the video-streaming platform MasterClass, joining as one of their earliest employees. At nights I would wander around San Francisco venues just experimenting and honing my photography and during the day, I was part of building a fast-growing once-in-a-lifetime startup that eventually led to me producing, directing, and interviewing more than 30 MasterClasses including with the likes of Hillary Clinton, Anna Wintour, Lewis Hamilton, and Shonda Rhimes.

If all this sounds like some sort of lucky dream version of a career come-up, it is, and I never take it for granted. But what's important to mention is that it was the combination of creating strategic opportunities to build a portfolio, doing what I call ""practicing serendipity,"" and having the fortitude to continually be bold and put myself out there that led to where I am today.

Let me explain each point.

Creating strategic opportunities to build a portfolio

One of the best things that I did during my assistant days in Los Angeles was being conscious about how to find and create things that I could put my name on to showcase what I did. The most obvious example was taking photographs on set. Here was something tangible that I could point to and say, ""I did that."" Even though I was an assistant for some exciting people on some exciting sets, people don't hire you into progressively higher responsibility positions because of tangential associations with cool projects or organizations. Those may offer credibility and help you pass an initial vetting process, but people hire you because you're able to offer a showcase of your skills and because of your ability to initiate and bring things from beginning to end, even if those projects are unsexy or small in scale.

One of the pieces of advice I offer to college students when I give talks is to find jobs that allow you to practice the skills you want to be known for right away. In other words, do the job that you want to do as soon as you can. It's my personal opinion that a job at a small unknown startup or organization that allows you to take ownership and do the skill-defining work, even if you are a junior employee, is a much better choice than a job at a large outfit or at a globally-known buzzy company where you are relegated to prolonged support work.

Of course this is not black and white, as nothing in life is. I've seen plenty of examples of people who start out at big companies, build a valuable network, and then move on to great success, progressively climbing the career ladder. And I've also seen people hang in long enough at a big company to be tossed opportunities to flex and grow and earn a valuable skill set and get their name on projects. But those paths often require a lot of luck and the good will of a generous manager invested in your growth. Perhaps you can create the best of both worlds, like I did, as you work to build a reputation and gain access to a network at one job (in this case, my assistant work around Los Angeles), while staying focused on building skill-set-driven work on your off time (my photography).

Case and point: My former manager and the co-founder of MasterClass, Aaron Rasmussen, recently informed me that it was my concert portfolio that stood out to him in my initial application for MasterClass. It showed initiative, and the ability to have the ""eye"", the latter of which was extremely crucial at MasterClass where we worked to create Netflix-quality online educational videos.

Focus on building a skills-showcasing portfolio, and if your current work is not allowing for those opportunities, create them on your own.

Practicing serendipity

Well I'm sure you're now asking, ""Jasmeet, how do I create these opportunities?"" The answer to that is what I've already referenced in this article through the cold-emailing anecdote, and it is what I called ""practicing serendipity."" What do I mean by that?

Practicing serendipity essentially means giving yourself as many shots as you can for wondrous opportunities to come your way. It's sending out cold emails, attending talks and conferences, posting on LinkedIn. In essence, it's making it easier for you to be on someone's mind when an opportunity comes up, or to spark the interest of a generous someone who remembers what it's like to be early in their career and offer a chat, an experience, or a referral.

I call this practicing serendipity because I've found that being in ""the right place at the right time"" involves a lot of intentional work to make something the right place or the right time. You have to continually put yourself and put yourself out there and make this a habitual part of your career development.

One of the best books I recently read that summarizes this theory well is Christian Busch's ""The Serendipity Mindset: The Art and Science of Creating Good Luck."" Busch discusses how some people are better at creating the conditions for coincidences to arise and taking advantage of them. These involve, as he explains, seeding triggers, giving out hooks, increasing exposure and connecting with influencers (used in the broadest sense).

What does this look like in practice? It means crafting the perfect cold email or DM, paying money to attend an industry conference, finally creating or cleaning up your website, and diligently talking about your accomplishments or work experiences on social media. Taking these actions increases your serendipity to life-changing opportunities and builds up your ""weak ties"", a theory from Stanford sociologist Mark Granovetter that shows that much of our important life-changing information (referrals to jobs, introductions to our future spouses) tend to come from casual acquaintances rather than our strongest relationships.

What did this mean in my lack-luster assistant days in Los Angeles? It meant that I shelled out $200 (an absolutely huge amount of money for me) to attend an industry conference on music videos, where I got to introduce myself to music video directors and producers, and where I met Joseph Uliano (who, as I mentioned, facilitated my first behind-the-scenes photo gig with Cage the Elephant). It meant I kept up with casual work acquaintances doing interesting things over many years, including the person who would eventually connect me to someone at MasterClass when they were hiring.

Some people absolutely get lucky in life and get plucked out of obscurity to the career of their dreams. For the rest of us, practicing serendipity allows us to tweak the strings of luck in our favor and to be ready to pounce on them when they do.

Fortitude

A note on creating and managing careers: It can and will be some of the most emotionally exhausting work of your life. I can't tell you the amount of tears that I have shed over real and harsh rejection, including some rejection that was pointedly personal. As a woman of color from a lower-income background in Canada with immigrant parents, it can be particularly exhausting to navigate privileged white and male spaces, as I've often had to do in my work at the very upper echelons in tech and entertainment from New York to Los Angeles to San Francisco.

Creating any career of meaning and impact is going to require high fortitude, especially if you're not in one of those aforementioned groups of privilege.

How I've learned to mentally deal with the harshness and the roller coaster of my chosen career and build that fortitude is to view everything like a video game. Some people are going to start the video game three levels ahead of you and with special boost-ups. You may be starting at Level 1 with no special powers (yet). While you may be envious that others have started a few levels ahead of you with special advantages, staying fixated on those people and their advantages is not doing anything to get you out of Level 1.

Sometimes you need to hit pause on the video game and take a break. That's OK. You may even realize this particular video game is not for you, and you want to try another game. That's OK! The point that I'm really trying to make with this overwrought video game analogy is that nothing should weigh so heavily on you as you're learning which video game to play and how. It's just a game, and it's up to you to figure out how to do the best you can at it.

And if you hit a dead end, simply reverse course and find a different way. Don't hate yourself if your princess is in another castle. Just take a pause and start again.

What I hope you take away from my story is that although so many things about your career are out of your control, there are so many things that are. I had no idea that cold emails sent ten years ago would lead to experiences and relationships that created the doors to my present career-defining opportunities, including photographing Taylor Swift. As Apple co-founder Steve Jobs once infamously said, you can't connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. Start to throw out those fish hooks today, and see where they will lead you in years to come."
"For Springfield, Ohio, the consequences of GOP lies still linger",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/springfield-ohio-consequences-gop-lies-still-linger-rcna173475,2024-10-01T17:04:48Z,"Nearly a month later, Donald Trump and JD Vance aren't done lying about Springfield, Ohio -- and local residents and officials are still feeling the effects.

House Majority Whip Tom Emmer appeared on ABC News' ""This Week"" a few days ago, and host Martha Raddatz asked a good question about the upcoming vice presidential debate: If debate moderators ask Sen. JD Vance about his baseless pet-eating-immigrants claims, should the Ohio Republican acknowledge the truth?

The Minnesota Republican refused to consider the premise of the question. ""The people in the mainstream media want to put up these shiny objects to distract people from what they see happen every day,"" Emmer concluded before changing the subject.

It was a laughable response, in large part because ""these shiny objects"" used to ""distract people"" have come from Emmer's party and its presidential ticket. It was Donald Trump and his running mate who pushed racist and false conspiracy theories about Springfield, Ohio, into the national conversation, and it was the former president and Vance who've continued to repeat their lies for weeks.

Indeed, these ugly efforts are ongoing. Trump continued his rhetorical assault against Springfield's Haitian immigrants on Thursday. And Friday. And Saturday. Two days later, the GOP candidate sat down with Kellyanne Conway for a Fox Nation interview in which -- you guessed it -- he once again said that Springfield ""is going to be destroyed"" by its immigrant population.

The consequences of the Republicans' misinformation and disinformation -- bomb threats, closed buildings, canceled events, et al. -- have been well documented. But they're also not going away. The New York Times reported:

McGregor, whose business makes parts for cars, trucks, and tractors, has spoken publicly about the valuable contributions his Haitian employees have made to his operation -- which in turn has led people to threaten to kill him. His children and his elderly mother have been targeted with hateful calls, too.

""I have struggled with the fact that now we're going to have firearms in our house -- like, what the hell?"" he told the Times.

McGregor is a lifelong Republican who voted for Trump twice. But he nevertheless told the truth about some of his employees, and now he fears for his family's safety.

He's not alone. The Washington Post published a striking letter to the editor from a local resident who's lived in Springfield for 35 years. ""Because Donald Trump and JD Vance have appropriated the town as a set for their racist falsehoods, Springfield lives under a pall of fear,"" the local woman wrote, adding, ""You know who is not afraid to go out and about in Springfield? Proud Boys. Neo-Nazis. People handing out Ku Klux Klan fliers. ... These far-right groups clearly feel as though they have not just permission, but encouragement, from the Republican candidates. It is unsettling to live in this menacing atmosphere.""

The author concluded, ""Mr. Trump and Mr. Vance hope to make every town Springfield, where the angry are emboldened by lies and the people they seek to punish live in fear. As someone who has lived through this transformation, trust me: You don't want to live in Trump's America.""

Meanwhile, Politico reported that Vance, who ostensibly represents Ohio in the U.S. Senate, still hasn't spoken to Springfield's mayor -- who also happens to be a Republican.

The same article quoted Mike DeWine, Ohio's Republican governor, who expressed dismay over the lies from his party's presidential ticket.

""Yeah, after a while, because it got cumulative, and then you keep thinking, 'Well, they're going to stop this,'"" the governor said. ""Well, they didn't stop this, they just keep going.""

The word ""disqualifying"" is often overused. Once in a while, though, it's applicable."
"Judge strikes down Georgia's abortion ban, but not quickly enough for some",MSNBC.com,,https://www.msnbc.com/rachel-maddow-show/maddowblog/judge-strikes-georgias-abortion-ban-not-quickly-enough-rcna173419,2024-10-01T14:31:15Z,"A court ruling striking down a Republican-imposed abortion ban in Georgia comes too late for Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller.

It's not every day when a judge references ""The Handmaid's Tale"" in a high-profile court ruling, but that's precisely what happened when a judge struck down Georgia's six-week abortion ban. NBC News reported:

As my colleague Lisa Rubin explained in a social media thread that's worth your time, it was quite a ruling from Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney, who concluded that the meaning of ""liberty"" in Georgia includes ""the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.""

McBurney added that the Republican-imposed ban was ""extreme"" in its ""narrowing of the window of time within which women have the legal ability to end a pregnancy from roughly twenty weeks (i.e., viability) down to a mere six weeks, a point at which many -- if not most -- women are completely unaware or at best unsure if they are pregnant.""

He went on to write that ""for many women, their pregnancy was unintended, unexpected, and often unknown until well after the embryonic heartbeat began. Yet that's too late under the LIFE Act's strictures: these women are now forbidden from undoing that life-altering change of circumstances -- before they even knew the change had occurred.""

""For these women, the liberty of privacy means that they alone should choose whether they serve as human incubators for the five months leading up to viability. It is not for a legislator, a judge, or a Commander from The Handmaid's Tale to tell these women what to do with their bodies during this period when the fetus cannot survive outside the womb any more so than society could -- or should -- force them to serve as a human tissue bank or to give up a kidney for the benefit of another,"" McBurney concluded.

With this in mind, women in Georgia can, for now, terminate unwanted and/or dangerous pregnancies up to 22 weeks.

But in the meantime, it's also worth emphasizing that McBurney's ruling, while heartening and progressive, comes too late for some -- because there's ample evidence to suggest that Georgia's poorly named LIFE Act was responsible for the deaths of at least two local women.

As my MSNBC colleague Sarah Posner recently explained, Amber Nicole Thurman died in 2022 after she failed to receive the medical care she needed -- because her physicians ""were terrified of committing a felony under the state's abortion ban.""

Soon after the public learned of the Thurman tragedy, we were confronted by a related story: Candi Miller also died in Georgia, and as ProPublica reported, maternal health experts have blamed Georgia Republicans' abortion ban.

GOP officials in the state have already vowed to appeal the latest ruling. Watch this space."
Georgia university leaders ask NCAA to ban transgender women from sports,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-universities-transgender-women-sports-ncaa-be0b8ba657ac39b025fffde6793178f3,2024-10-08T23:30:52Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- The regents who govern Georgia's 26 public universities and colleges voted on Tuesday to ask the NCAA and another college athletic federation to ban transgender women from participating in women's sports.

The unanimous vote came after Georgia Lt. Gov. Burt Jones, a Republican, vowed in August to pass legislation that would ban transgender women from athletic events at public colleges.

The regents asked the NCAA and the National Junior College Athletic Association to conform their policies with those of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics. That federation voted in April to all but ban transgender athletes from competing in women's sports at its 241 mostly small colleges.

Of the 25 schools governed by the regents that have sports programs, four are members of the National Junior College Athletic Association, five are members of the NAIA, and the remaining 16 are NCAA members. The University of Georgia and Georgia Tech are NCAA members.

All athletes are allowed to participate in NAIA-sponsored male sports. But the only athletes allowed to participate in women's sports are those whose biological sex assigned at birth is female and have not begun hormone therapy.

The much larger NCAA began in August to follow the standards of national and international governing bodies for each sport. Before that, the NCAA policy for transgender athlete participation in place since 2010, called for one year of testosterone suppression treatment and documented testosterone levels submitted before championship competitions.

Board of Regents Secretary Chris McGraw said that the junior college federation allows some transgender students to participate in women's athletics in some circumstances.

Of the 25 schools governed by the board that have intercollegiate sports programs, five are NAIA members, four are members of the junior college federation and 16 are members of various NCAA divisions.

""Those are three very different sets of rules that our institutions' athletic programs are governed by at this point,"" said McGraw, also the board's chief lawyer, who briefly presented the resolution before it was approved with no debate. Kristina Torres, a spokesperson, said board members and Chancellor Sonny Perdue had no further comment. Perdue is a former Republican governor while board members have been appointed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp.

The NCAA didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment on Tuesday.

Opponents say those seeking bans on transgender participation in women's and girls' sports are seeking political gain.

Jeff Graham, the executive director of LGBTQ+ rights group Georgia Equality, said the university system ""should recognize the importance of diversity at many levels and should be there to care about the educational experience of all of their students regardless of their gender or gender identity.""

""I'm certainly disappointed to see the Board of Regents of the University System of Georgia is spending its time passing resolutions that only serve to stigmatize transgender students and perpetuate misinformation about the reality of what is happening within athletic competitions involving transgender athletes,"" Graham told The Associated Press in a phone interview.

Jones, a possible Republican contender for governor in 2026, thanked the regents for their vote in a Tuesday statement. Senate Republicans showcased the issue in August when they heard from five former college swimmers who are suing the NCAA and Georgia Tech over a transgender woman's participation in the 2022 NCAA women's swimming championships at the Atlanta university.

""The work female athletes put into competing should be protected at all cost, no matter the age,"" Jones said. ""This action brings us one step closer toward achieving that ultimate goal.""

Transgender participation in women's sports roiled Georgia's General Assembly in 2022, when lawmakers passed a law letting the Georgia High School Association regulate transgender women's participation in sports. The association, mostly made up of public high schools, then banned participation by transgender women in sports events it sponsors.

That law didn't address colleges. According to the Movement Advancement Project, a group that lobbies for LGBTQ+ rights, 23 states have banned transgender students from participating in college sports, although a court ruled that Montana's ban was unconstitutional in 2022.

The August state Senate hearing focused on the participation in the 2022 NCAA swimming championships by Lia Thomas, a transgender woman who swam for the University of Pennsylvania and won the 500-meter freestyle. The witnesses and senators also took aim at Georgia Tech, arguing that the host of the event shared blame for allowing Thomas to participate and share a locker room with other swimmers.

Georgia Tech and the university system have denied in court papers that they had any role in deciding whether Thomas would participate or what locker room she would use."
Not all elections look the same. Here are some of the different ways states run their voting,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/ranked-choice-voting-nebraska-california-615e9fbdf7b086dce4227dff01c0df68,2024-10-08T19:44:46Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. general election on Nov. 5 will decide the country's direction, but it is far from a nationally administered contest. The 50 states and the District of Columbia run their own elections, and each does things a little differently.

Here's a look at some notable variations in the 2024 election:

To win the presidency outright, a candidate must receive at least 270 of the 538 votes in the Electoral College. In 48 states, the statewide winner gets all of that state's electoral votes, and that's also the case in the nation's capital.

In Maine and Nebraska, the candidate who receives the most votes in each congressional district wins one electoral vote from that district. The candidate who wins the statewide vote receives another two.

In 2020, Democrat Joe Biden received three of Maine's four electoral votes because he won the popular vote in the state and its 1st Congressional District. Republican Donald Trump received one electoral vote from the 2nd Congressional District. Trump won four of Nebraska's five votes for winning the popular vote in the state as well as its 1st and 3rd Congressional Districts; Biden received one electoral vote for winning the 2nd Congressional District.

In ranked choice voting, voters rank candidates for an office in order of preference on the ballot. If no candidate is the first choice for more than 50% of voters, the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. Voters who chose that candidate as their top pick have their votes redistributed to their next choice. This continues, with the candidate with the fewest votes getting eliminated, until someone emerges with a majority of votes.

Maine uses ranked choice voting in state-level primaries and for federal offices in the general election. That means Maine voters can rank presidential, Senate and House candidates on ballots that include the Democrat and the Republican who advanced out of their respective party primaries, plus third-party and independent candidates who qualify.

The presidential ballot will include Trump and Democrat Kamala Harris, plus three other candidates. In the six years since implementing ranked choice voting, the state has used it twice in races for Congress in its 2nd Congressional District. The 2020 presidential race did not advance to ranked choice voting, with the winners of the state and in each congressional district exceeding 52% of the vote.

Alaska holds open primaries for statewide offices and sends the top four vote-getters, regardless of party, to the general election, where the winner is decided using ranked choice voting. In all legislative and statewide executive offices, Alaskans can rank up to four names that can include multiple candidates from the same party.

The exception is the presidency, which is eligible for ranked choice voting in Alaska for the first time. This year, there will be eight presidential tickets on the ballot, and Alaskans can rank all candidates if they choose to. The last time the winner of the presidential contest in Alaska failed to surpass 50% of the vote was in 1992, when third-party candidate Ross Perot won almost 20% of the national popular vote.

But in 2022, both Democratic Rep. Mary Peltola and Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski won their elections after both went to ranked choice voting.

Another wrinkle this year? In Alaska, where ranked choice voting was implemented by ballot measure in 2020, there's a voter initiative on the ballot this fall to repeal it.

California and Washington hold open primaries in which all candidates run on the same ballot and the two top vote-getters advance to the general election, regardless of party. This year, there are two House races in Washington that include candidates of the same party, one with two Republicans and one with two Democrats. There are four in California: three with only Democrats and one with only Republicans.

The winning party in those six districts will be reflected in The Associated Press' online graphic showing the balance of power in the House at poll close, rather than once a winner is declared because the party of the winner is a foregone conclusion.

Louisiana holds what it refers to as its ""open primaries"" on the same day the rest of the country holds its general election. In Louisiana, all candidates run on the same open primary ballot. Any candidate who earns more than 50% of the vote in the primary wins the seat outright.

If no candidate exceeds 50% of the vote, the top two vote-getters advance to a head-to-head runoff, which can end up pitting two Republicans or two Democrats against each other. Louisiana refers to these contests as its ""general election.""

That will change for elections for the U.S. House starting in 2026 when congressional races will have earlier primaries that are open only to registered members of a party. Certain state races will continue to hold open primaries in November, but the change will prevent future members of Congress from waiting until December -- a month later than the rest of the country -- to know whether they are headed to Washington.

In Nebraska, any measure that receives approximately 123,000 valid signatures qualifies for the ballot. This year, two measures relating to abortion met this threshold.

One would enshrine in the Nebraska Constitution the right to have an abortion until fetal viability or later, to protect the health of the pregnant woman. The other would write into the constitution the current 12-week ban, with exceptions for rape, incest and to save the life of the pregnant woman.

This marks the first time since the 2022 Supreme Court decision overturning Roe v. Wade that a state has measures that seek to roll back abortion rights and protect abortion rights on the ballot at the same time.

It's possible voters could end up approving both measures. But because they're competing and therefore cannot both be enshrined in the constitution, the measure with the most ""for"" votes will be the one adopted, according to the Nebraska secretary of state.

In primary elections, a handful of states, mostly in the South, go to runoffs if no candidate receives at least 50% of the vote. In races with more than two candidates, runoffs in those states are common. Several states held primary runoffs this year.

Georgia uses the same rules in general elections. The last three Senate races there went to runoffs because a third-party candidate won enough of the vote to prevent the Republican or Democratic nominee from exceeding 50% of the vote.

But this year, runoff possibilities may be confined to downballot races such as state legislature. There's no Senate race there this year, and the U.S. House races have only two candidates on the ballot.

This is common in states that span multiple time zones. In most states, polls close at the same time in each time zone.

The AP will not call the winner of a race before all the polls in a jurisdiction are scheduled to close, even if votes already reported before that time make clear who will win the race. So if there is a statewide race in a state where polls close at 8 p.m. local time, but some of the state is in the Eastern time zone and some of the state is in Central time zone, the earliest the AP can call the winner is 8 p.m. CST/9 p.m. EST.

The AP will still show the results as they arrive from counties with closed polls.

Some of the biggest states with split poll close times are Florida, Michigan, Texas and Oregon. Tennessee is an exception, as even though the state is in both the Eastern and the Central time zones, all counties coordinate their voting to conclude at the same time.

"AP Elections Top 25: The people, places, races, dates and things to know about Election Day",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/associated-press-elections-top-25-people-places-races-dates-f323fe3dd459c54860a3ad39657e1fca,2024-10-08T19:26:14Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Americans will cast roughly 160 million ballots by the time Election Day comes to a close -- in several different ways, including many submitted a few weeks before polls even open.

They will choose a president, members of Congress and thousands of state lawmakers, city council members, attorneys general, secretaries of state -- and in Texas, a railroad commissioner who has nothing to do with the trains.

This year's election also comes at a moment in the nation's history when the very basics of how America votes are being challenged as never before by disinformation and distrust.

It can be tough to make sense of it all. To help better understand the way America picks its president and its leaders -- all the way down the ballot -- The Associated Press offers the following thoughts on the Top 25 people, places, races, dates and things to know about Election Day. A guidebook, of sorts, to American democracy as it nears its 250th birthday.

It's said that every presidential election makes history. Perhaps. But while some are destined to be included in the history books, others become the subject of books all of their own. Put 2024 down to get a whole shelf at the library. Will Americans choose to return Donald Trump to the White House, electing a former president to a new term for only the second time -- and picking for the first time a convicted felon to sit behind the Resolute Desk? Or will voters decide Kamala Harris ought to be the nation's first woman to take up office in the Oval Office, a candidate who didn't win a single primary yet landed at the top of her party's ticket by acclamation. No list of the Top 25 things to know about this year's general election can begin without an acknowledgment that no matter who America chooses, Trump and Harris will make history this Election Day. (Or a few days later.)

There might not be anyone as all-in on returning Trump to the White House as Elon Musk, the world's richest person. ""President Trump must win to preserve the Constitution. He must win to preserve democracy in America,"" the founder of SpaceX and Tesla told a rally crowd in early October when Trump returned to the site of his first attempted assassination in Pennsylvania. Along with his unfathomable personal wealth, Musk's ownership of X, formally known as Twitter, gives him an unprecedented ability to try and convince voters of his belief that electing Trump is a ""must-win situation."" Musk is spending heavily on get-out-the-vote efforts and using his perch as X's CEO to amplify misinformation and push into millions of timelines his argument that the country will not survive should Kamala Harris win the White House. It's a foreboding message that seems to get bleaker by the day - and Musk knows it. ""As you can see, I am not just MAGA,"" he told Trump's backers from the rally stage. ""I am Dark MAGA.""

The founder of Win With Black Women, Jotaka Eaddy has for the past four years hosted Sunday evening video conferences on Zoom to chat politics. On July 21, she couldn't get into her own meeting. Earlier that day, Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential race and endorsed Kamala Harris as his replacement to be the Democratic nominee, and once Zoom changed some settings, 44,000 people were online and ready to talk about it. It was a pep talk and a telethon. People prayed and sang. About an hour after the Zoom started, Star Jones shared a donation link and by early the next morning they had raised more than $1 million. The meeting spawned a domino effect as Eaddy turned a tool made essential by the coronavirus pandemic into an essential place for Harris' supporters to gather. Soon, Black men and white women and white dudes and Taylor Swift fans were logging on. ""It has allowed us to organize in a way to bring people together that otherwise would not connect,"" Eaddy said.

Now that how a ballot is cast is as much of a red/blue choice as the candidate getting the vote, figuring out who will win a close election often depends on knowing the kind of ballots left to be counted. Garrett Archer, a former analyst at the Arizona Secretary of State's office who is now a data journalist, was one of the first of Twitter's election seers to understand how nit-picky those details can be. Were the advance votes still to be counted cast in person, mailed or left at a drop box? How soon before Election Day did those mail ballots arrive? Or might those mail votes actually be ""late earlies"" dropped off at a polling place? Archer goes deep into those details in his job with ABC's Phoenix affiliate, but most of us will get his analysis of Arizona's election results online, as we wait every afternoon after Election Day for his trademark Tweet that begins: ""Maricopa incoming...""

About a week after Election Day, Maine Secretary of State Shenna Bellows is likely to star in a livestream via laptop webcam to announce results of ranked choice voting. The instant-runoff system, used when no candidate initially wins an outright majority, might be a downballot novelty if not for the state's 2nd Congressional District. Behind by about 2,000 votes in 2018, Democrat Jared Golden emerged the winner and ousted the GOP incumbent once the ranked choice process awarded him the votes of two trailing independents. Maine also awards two of its Electoral College votes by congressional district, and while it may be unlikely, the road to 270 electoral votes could theoretically end with ranked choice results in Maine's 2nd District. In that case, should Golden's come-from-behind win of 2018 repeat itself, it would fall to Bellows to announce that ranked choice voting had put a second place finisher into the White House.

On an Aleutian island closer to the Russian border than mainland Alaska and more than 4,000 miles from the White House, the question isn't who wins on Election Day. It's who will be the very last American to vote. ""People have a little bit of fun on that day, because, I mean, realistically everybody knows the election's decided way before we're closed,"" said Layton Lockett, the city manager in Adak, Alaska. The country's last polling place to close is the only one still open from midnight ET to 1 a.m., when things wrap up on the island and former World War II military base. The honor of being the last voter was Mary Nelson's in 2012, when the community of a few hundred people did away with early voting in favor of casting ballots in person. She was a poll worker that Election Day, too, meaning her historic moment was short lived. ""When I opened the curtain to come back out, the city manager took my picture ... and they were waiting for us in Nome to call with our vote count,"" she said.

Out of more than 500 counties in the seven battleground states in this year's election, only 10 voted for Trump in 2016 before flipping to Biden in 2020. The first to complete its count this Election Day ought to be North Carolina's Nash County, which by 10 p.m. ET could provide an early indication of which candidate is performing best among the swing voters likely to decide a closely contested White House. That's especially true should there be a decisive winner in the community northeast of Raleigh, unaffected by Hurricane Helene. Two decades have passed since any presidential candidate won Nash by more than a point. Confirmation won't come for hours (or days), but more intelligence will arrive about a half hour later when North Carolina's other Trump-Biden county -- New Hanover on the state's Atlantic Coast -- should wrap up its count. The other eight counties to watch: Erie and Northhampton in Pennsylvania; Maricopa in Arizona; Kent, Saginaw and Leelanau in Michigan and Sauk and Door in Wisconsin.

There's more to Arizona than Maricopa County. Seriously! Yes, it's true that Biden eked out a win in 2020 among the more than 60% of Arizona voters who live in the sprawling home of Phoenix and its suburbs. But Biden may not have won Arizona and its 11 electoral votes without his win in Apache County, where he beat Trump by 11,851 votes out of roughly 35,000 cast. His statewide margin? Just 10,457. Apache County is far from the typical Democratic urban stronghold. Much of the rural county is part of the Navajo Nation, and it also includes lands belonging to the Apache people who gave the county its name. In all, more than 70% of people living there are Native American. America's indigenous population is often overlooked in presidential elections: the states with the largest percentages of Native people - Alaska, New Mexico, Oklahoma and South Dakota - are not often competitive. Arizona's emergence as a battleground makes the voters in Apache County -- and the roughly 5% of Arizonans who are Native American -- a potential factor in this year's election.

Trump won Wisconsin by about 20,000 votes in 2016 - and he and the country had to wait on Milwaukee County to know which way that margin would fall. The state's largest county and Democratic stronghold is one of a handful in Wisconsin that releases results of mail ballots all at once, rather than combining them with other ballots counted at precinct polling places. In 2016, confirmation there weren't enough mail votes left to count in the City of Milwaukee to flip the race from Trump to Hillary Clinton allowed AP to declare the Republican the winner of the state - and the White House. In the 2022 midterms, it was only when AP confirmed there were no ballots remaining to be counted in Milwaukee and Dane County, Wisconsin's other largest source of Democratic votes, that it was able to say incumbent Republican Ron Johnson would return to the Senate. Milwaukee might not be among the final counties in Wisconsin to report its results this year, but don't count out its chances to be the decisive county once it does in this crucial battleground state.

Election officials nationwide found no cases of fraud, vandalism or theft related to the use of drop boxes that that could have affected the outcome of the 2020 presidential election. And yet no place in this year's election may face more scrutiny than the drop box - a tool designed to make voting easier that's become the source of conspiracy theories that they played a role ( they didn't ) in stealing the election from Trump ( it wasn't ). Several states have enacted laws restricting their use since 2020, while in others they remain the subject of fascination. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed itself in July and dumped a ruling that limited drop boxes to only election clerks' offices. Prosecutors are currently investigating allegations that the mayor of Wausau removed the city's drop box last month without consulting with the city clerk. Election officials typically have detailed processes to ensure the security of ballots left in drop boxes, which are often monitored remotely by camera. Still, drop boxes remain a place where opponents wrongly believe their vote is neither safe nor secure.

There are 538 electoral votes to win from the 50 states and the District of Columbia, but the Trump and Harris campaigns are seriously contesting only seven states this year as battlegrounds: Arizona and Nevada out West, North Carolina and Georgia in the South, Michigan and Wisconsin amid the Great Lakes and Pennsylvania as the final boss. Eight years ago, Pennsylvania was the last state called for Trump before he won election by winning in Wisconsin in the early morning hours after Election Day. Four years ago, Biden's win there four days after polls close -- by roughly 80,000 votes out of more than 6.8 million cast -- was the difference. Both presidential hopefuls can get to the 270 electoral votes need to win White House without the Keystone State, but their path to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue gets a whole lot easier if they grab Pennsylvania's 19 electoral votes along the way.

Supporters of abortion rights are 7-for-7 in statewide votes since the U.S. Supreme Court "" returned to the people and their elected representatives "" the ability to decide on the legality of abortion. Come Election Day, voters in nine more states will get the chance via ballot measure to do the same. The states range from the reliably blue (Colorado, Maryland) to the resolutely red (South Dakota, Missouri, Nebraska), with a few presidential battlegrounds and/or states with key races for U.S. Senate - Arizona, Nevada and Montana - in between. And then there's Florida, a state Hillary Clinton hoped would provide her with a powerful push into the White House. Instead, the Sunshine State was in 2016 (and again in 2020) a cornerstone of Trump's Electoral College count. A Trump loss in Florida would undoubtedly sink his bid to return to the White House, but it's hardly clear that the chance to vote on social issues - even one as potent as abortion - can sway enough voters to truly affect an outcome at the top of the ticket.

Republicans can likely hold the U.S. House of Representatives even if they lose a couple of seats in New York, where a messy redistricting process two years ago helped the GOP win six districts carried by Biden. But if those losses include freshman Rep. Marc Molinaro in the state's 19th District, it will make for an uncomfortable election night for House Speaker Mike Johnson. Molinaro has styled himself as a pragmatist as he seeks reelection for the first time, avoiding the circus of former GOP Rep. George Santos in New York's 3rd District - a seat his party has already lost - and the inconveniently timed headlines of rising party star and 17th District Rep. Mike Lawler. Democrat Josh Riley, who nearly won the district in 2022, has raised more money than Molinaro ahead of their November rematch, as Democrats run candidates nationwide who came up just short in the 2022 midterms. If that's a winning strategy in New York's 19th District and elsewhere, the celebrations might be the most raucous in Brooklyn at the election night party of New York 8th District Rep. Hakeem Jefferies: the Democratic leader and House Speaker-in-waiting.

Pay enough attention to politics and you'll have heard the bit about Democrats being one election away from winning in Texas. Then Election Day arrives and Republicans have the cattle while Democrats are once again holding their hat. Is this the year that changes? Democrats say they're investing serious cash into the state with the hope that an unpopular incumbent (Sen. Ted Cruz) is at risk to a rising star (former NFL player and current Rep. Colin Allred). Sound familiar? Six years ago, Cruz was an unpopular incumbent running against a rising Democratic star from the U.S. House named Beto O'Rourke. Some say O'Rourke ran the perfect campaign...and Cruz won by a comfortable 2.6 points. It's been 30 years since a Democrat won statewide in Texas, so maybe the odds are better for Democrats in Florida? They're spending money there, too, to try and take down incumbent Sen. Rick Scott. Ask the GOP what to make of these moves and they'll tell you Democrats need that kind of dramatic upset to keep control of the Senate.

John Duarte might be in one of the closest races of the cycle - and possibly faces the longest waiting time to find out if he's returning to Congress. The California Republican won his 2022 race by 564 votes in a race that was so close that the AP needed until the first week of December to declare Duarte the winner. Now he has to do it all again: He faces a rematch in the state's 13th Congressional District against former state Assemblyman Adam Gray. California's count takes so long in large part because the state conducts its elections entirely by mail. In the 13th, there are also no major cities - no L.A., no Bakersfield, not even Fresno - that would provide enough votes at the beginning of the night to make clear who has won. If the House majority comes down to Duarte's race, the nation's attention will focus on a long count in five counties of California's agricultural Central Valley.

The first Tuesday after the first Monday in November is Election Day, established in 1875 under 2 U.S. Code § 7 for the election ""in each of the States and Territories of the United States, of Representatives and Delegates to the Congress."" In modern U.S. elections, Election Day is perhaps best thought of as the LAST day of the general election: it's the final chance for voters to cast ballots in person, for mail ballots to arrive and be counted, or, in some states, the day by which mail ballots must be postmarked.

Three weeks later comes the last day a mail ballot can arrive in Washington state and still be counted -- Nov. 25 is the latest deadline of any state that accepts votes cast by mail to arrive with an Election Day postmark. In all, 17 states and the District of Columbia allow mail ballots to arrive after Election Day, while 32 others require they be in the ballot box on Election Day. Only Louisiana requires mail ballots to arrive early in order to be counted -- the deadline there for mail ballots is the day before Election Day.

After supporters of Trump stormed the Capitol on Jan. 6, 2021, in an insurrection that aimed to overturn his loss to then-President-elect Joe Biden, Congress updated the Electoral Count Act to, among other things, establish the date by which every state's governor must certify the results of the presidential election and submit their slate of electors. Any legal challenges should then be completed by Dec. 16, because those members of the Electoral College will vote the next day.

Wait, there's another election day? Indeed! The Constitution says it's not the people who pick a president, but rather a group of ""electors"" as selected by each state for the job. But the founders also wrote that states get to decide how to pick their members of the Electoral College, and almost all require they vote for the winner of their state's popular vote (Maine and Nebraska do it just a little differently). This ritual takes place about a week before Christmas, the deadline for the electors' cast ballots to arrive in Washington.

More ceremony in early January as the members of the 119th Congress, having taken office a few days earlier, count those Electoral College ballots under the rules of the updated Electoral Count Act. Objections are still possible, but much harder to raise, and the revised law makes plain the vice president is there only to announce the results as president of the Senate. Once the electoral votes are officially cast and counted, the final step of the election comes at the new president's inauguration on Jan. 20, 2025.

Almost all of the roughly 160 million ballots that will be cast in this year's election will be made of paper. And almost all will be counted by machine. Election officials say without such machines, counting those ballots by hand would take much longer, cost taxpayers far more and result in errors that would then take even more time and money to fix. ""Human beings are really bad at tedious things, and counting ballots is among the most tedious things we could do,"" said Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Charles Stewart. ""Computers are very good at tedious things. They can count very quickly and very accurately."" Still, the desire to have humans involved in the process lingers. Officials in Georgia remain at odds over a recent directive from the state's election board requiring poll workers to count the total number of ballots by hand.

At The Associated Press, a race is ""too early to call"" if election officials are still tabulating votes and there is no clear winner. Regardless of how tight the margin may be between the leading candidates, AP won't say a race is ""too close to call"" unless election officials have tallied all outstanding ballots -- save for provisional ballots and late-arriving mail and absentee votes -- and the winner still remains unclear. In those cases, it's likely AP won't be able to say who has won until election officials certify the results -- a process that may take up to several weeks after Election Day. By the way, elections headed to a recount aren't automatically ""too close to call."" In fact, depending on how many votes separate the trailing candidates from the leader, AP may declare a winner even if a recount is possible.

Here's the thing about recounts: They might be required by law, they might be requested by a candidate, they might be ordered by a court. But they're not very likely to do anything but drag out the inevitable. ""Recounts are shifting a very small number of votes,"" said Deb Otis of the nonpartisan organization Fair Vote. ""We're going to see recounts in 2024 that are not going to change the outcome."" They almost never do. In the 36 recounts of a statewide general election since America's most famous recount in 2000, none moved the margin by more than a few hundred votes. The average change? Just 0.03 percentage points. The biggest? A move of 0.11 points in the 2006 race for Vermont state auditor - a rare race that did flip as a 137-vote lead in the initial count for Republican Randy Brock became a 102-vote recount win by Democrat Thomas Salmon. ""The count is pretty accurate because the machines work,"" said former Arizona election official Tammy Patrick. ""We have recounts ... to make sure we got it right."" As hopeful trailing candidates will soon learn, the first count almost always is.

Looking for ""precincts reporting"" when watching as results are reported in this year's election? Chances are, you'll find an estimate of ""expected vote"" instead. The Associated Press and other news organizations have moved away from precincts reporting as a measure of election turnout for several reasons - the fact that well more than half of voters no longer cast their ballot in person at a neighborhood ""precinct"" on Election Day chief among them. Instead, AP will estimate how much of the vote election officials have counted - and how many ballots they have left to count - based on a number of data points, including details on advance ballots cast, registration statistics and turnout in recent elections. Those estimates will change as votes are counted and more information about the exact number of ballots cast becomes available. AP's estimates of ballots cast won't reach 100% until election results are certified as final and complete.

More often than not, in a nation as evenly divided as the United States, not on Election Day -- or, at the least, not on Election Day on the East Coast. Since it took 36 days for George W. Bush's win in the 2000 presidential race to play out in Florida and before the Supreme Court, only in Barack Obama's two victories has AP declared a White House winner before midnight Eastern Time. Trump didn't win until 2:29 a.m. ET in 2016 and he didn't lose in 2020 until the Saturday morning after Election Day -- that's how long it took for Biden to claim 270 electoral votes by emerging as the clear winner in Pennsylvania. Meanwhile, the sheer number of U.S. Representatives from California -- a state where officials will be counting mail ballots for weeks -- could make for a long wait to know which party will control the House. The election for Speaker? That's a whole other matter.

The AP Elections Top 25 was reported by Leah Askarinam, Christina A. Cassidy, Christine Fernando, Meg Kinnard, Chris Megerian, Geoff Mulvihill, Stephen Ohlemacher, Emily Swanson, Mark Thiessen and Robert Yoon.

"Yes, voter fraud happens. But it's rare and election offices have safeguards to catch it",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/election-2024-voter-fraud-trump-harris-a3b4c2db17217311770259193c115b80,2024-10-08T19:14:46Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- You've heard the horror stories: Someone casting multiple ballots, people voting in the name of dead relatives, mail-in ballots being intercepted.

Voter fraud does happen occasionally. When it does, we tend to hear a lot about it. It also gets caught and prosecuted.

The nation's multilayered election processes provide many safeguards that keep voter fraud generally detectable and rare, according to current and former election administrators of both parties.

America's elections are decentralized, with thousands of independent voting jurisdictions. That makes it virtually impossible to pull off a large-scale vote-rigging operation that could tip a presidential race -- or most any other race.

""You're probably not going to have a perfect election system,"" said Republican Trey Grayson, a former Kentucky secretary of state and the advisory board chair of the Secure Elections Project. ""But if you're looking for one that you should have confidence in, you should feel good about that here in America.""

Voting more than once, tampering with ballots, lying about your residence to vote somewhere else or casting someone else's ballot are crimes that can be punished with hefty fines and prison time. Non-U.S. citizens who break election laws can be deported.

For anyone still motivated to cheat, election systems in the United States are designed with multiple layers of protection and transparency intended to stand in the way.

For in-person voting, most states either require or request voters provide some sort of ID at the polls. Others require voters to verify who they are in another way, such as stating their name and address, signing a poll book or signing an affidavit.

People who try to vote in the name of a recently deceased friend or family member can be caught when election officials update voter lists with death records and obituaries, said Gail Pellerin, a Democratic in the California Assembly who ran elections in Santa Cruz County for more than 27 years.

Those who try to impersonate someone else run the risk that someone at the polls knows that person or that the person will later try to cast their own ballot, she said.

For absentee voting, different states have different ballot verification protocols. All states require a voter's signature. Many states have further precautions, such as having bipartisan teams compare the signature with other signatures on file, requiring the signature to be notarized or requiring a witness to sign.

That means even if a ballot is erroneously sent to someone's past address and the current resident mails it in, there are checks to alert election workers to the foul play.

A growing number of states offer online or text-based ballot tracking tools as an extra layer of protection, allowing voters to see when their ballot has been sent out, returned and counted.

Federal law requires voter list maintenance, and election officials do that through a variety of methods, from checking state and federal databases to collaborating with other states to track voters who have moved.

Ballot drop boxes have security protocols, too, said Tammy Patrick, chief executive officer for programs at the National Association of Election Officials.

She explained the boxes are often designed to stop hands from stealing ballots and are surveilled by camera, bolted to the ground and constructed with fire-retardant chambers, so if someone threw in a lit match, it wouldn't destroy the ballots inside.

After the 2020 election, social media surged with claims of dead people casting ballots, double voting or destroyed piles of ballots on the side of the road.

Former President Donald Trump promoted and has continued to amplify these claims. But the vast majority of them were found to be untrue.

An Associated Press investigation that explored every potential case of voter fraud in the six battleground states disputed by Trump found there were fewer than 475 out of millions of votes cast. That was not nearly enough to tip the outcome. Democrat Joe Biden won the six states by a combined 311,257 votes.

The review also showed no collusion intended to rig the voting. Virtually every case was based on an individual acting alone to cast additional ballots. In one case, a man mistakenly thought he could vote while on parole. In another, a woman was suspected of sending in a ballot for her dead mother.

Former election officials say that even more often, allegations of voter fraud turn out to result from a clerical error or a misunderstanding.

Pellerin said she remembered when a political candidate in her county raised suspicion about many people being registered to vote at the same address. It turned out the voters were nuns who all lived in the same home.

Patrick said that when she worked in elections in Maricopa County, Arizona, mismatched signatures were sometimes explained by a broken arm or a recent stroke. In other cases, an elderly person tried to vote twice because they forgot they had already submitted a mail ballot.

""You really have to think about the intent of the voter,"" Patrick said. ""It isn't always intuitive.""

It would be wrong to suggest that voter fraud never happens.

With millions of votes cast in an election year, it's almost guaranteed there will be a few cases of someone trying to game the system. There also have been more insidious efforts, such as a vote-buying scheme in 2006 in Kentucky.

In that case, Grayson said, voters complained and an investigation ensued. Then participants admitted what they had done.

He said the example shows how important it is for election officials to stay vigilant and constantly improve security in order to help voters feel confident.

But, he said, it would be hard to make any such scheme work on a larger scale. Fraudsters would have to navigate onerous nuances in each county's election system. They also would have to keep a large number of people quiet about a crime that could be caught at any moment by officials or observers.

""This decentralized nature of the elections is itself a deterrent,"" Grayson said.

Georgia WR Colbie Young arrested on charges of battery and assault on an unborn child,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-colbie-young-arrest-a7c7a5b9d73624a747fb7dff7f70400c,2024-10-08T18:14:58Z,"Get the poll delivered straight to your inbox with AP Top 25 Poll Alerts. Sign up here.

Georgia wide receiver Colbie Young was arrested Tuesday on charges of battery and assault on an unborn child.

Athens-Clarke County jail records show Young was booked at 4:18 a.m. on the misdemeanor charges. A police report obtained by The Associated Press said his arrest followed an altercation with a 20-year-old woman who described herself to police as Young's ex-girlfriend and told officers she went to Young's apartment ""to speak about their relationship.""

She said the discussion became heated ""after she found out he was on the phone with another woman."" The woman told police Young ""physically pulled her out of his room"" and also ""grabbed her from behind"" and ""picked her up and began to squeeze her torso and abdomen very hard.""

The woman told police she believed Young ""was trying to harm her."" The arresting officer said Young denied being responsible for a bruise, discoloration and redness the officer found on the woman and denied grabbing her.

Young's attorney, Kim Stephens, told the AP in a statement Young did not harm the woman.

""Colbie Young was arrested last night after he asked his ex-girlfriend to leave his apartment,"" Stephens said. ""He did not make any physical contact with her in any way that could ever be considered a crime. I expect Mr. Young to be fully exonerated once our investigation is complete and the truth revealed.""

Young, a senior from Binghamton, New York, transferred to Georgia following two seasons at Miami. Young has 11 receptions for 149 yards and two touchdowns in five games for No. 5 Georgia, including two starts. Young had three catches for a team-leading 51 yards in last week's 31-13 win over Auburn.

Georgia coach Kirby Smart did not have an immediate statement on the arrest. Smart was expected to speak with reporters later Tuesday following practice for Saturday's game against Mississippi State.

Georgia spokesman Steven Drummond said in a statement, ""This is a pending legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time.""

Young remained in jail as of early Tuesday afternoon.

Smart dismissed wide receiver Rara Thomas from the team before the season after Thomas was charged with cruelty to children and battery. It was the second arrest in two years for Thomas, a transfer from Mississippi State.

Georgia players have been involved in at least two dozen driving-related violations such as DUI, reckless driving or speeding, The Atlanta-Journal Constitution has reported. On Sept. 12, cornerback Daniel Harris was arrested on a reckless driving charge after police said he was driving 106 mph.

Smart has acknowledged struggling to get his players to drive safely -- an issue that took on heightened importance since a crash that killed a player and a recruiting staffer in January 2023, shortly after the team celebrated its second straight national championship. Offensive lineman Devin Willock and recruiting analyst Chandler LeCroy were killed in the car crash on Jan. 15, 2023, just days after the Bulldogs won the national title game."
Colorado's Supreme Court dismisses suit against baker who wouldn't make a cake for transgender woman,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/colorado-baker-transgender-cake-lawsuit-dismissed-248cd8903edd14b1c601291bd5a49c1e,2024-10-08T17:15:45Z,"Colorado's Supreme Court on Tuesday dismissed on procedural grounds a lawsuit against a Christian baker who refused to bake a cake for a transgender woman. Justices declined to weigh in on the free speech issues that brought the case to national attention.

Baker Jack Phillips was sued by attorney Autumn Scardina in 2017 after his Denver-area bakery refused to make a pink cake with blue frosting to celebrate her gender transition.

Justices said in the 6-3 majority opinion that Scardina had not exhausted her options to seek redress through another court before filing her lawsuit.

The case was among several in Colorado pitting LGBTQ+ civil rights against First Amendment rights. In 2018, Phillips scored a partial victory before the U.S. Supreme Court after refusing to bake a cake for a gay couple's wedding.

Scardina attempted to order her cake the same day the U.S. Supreme Court announced it would hear Phillips' appeal in the wedding cake case. Scardina said she wanted to challenge Phillips' claims that he would serve LGBTQ+ customers and denied her attempt to get the cake was a set up for litigation.

Before filing her lawsuit, Scardina first filed a complaint against Phillips with the state and the Colorado Civil Rights Commission, which found probable cause he discriminated against her.

In March 2019, lawyers for the state and Phillips agreed to drop both cases under a settlement Scardina was not involved in. She pursued the lawsuit against Phillips and Masterpiece Cakeshop on her own.

That's when the case took a wrong turn, justices said in Tuesday's ruling. Scardina should have challenged the state's settlement with Phillips directly to the state's court of appeals, they said.

Instead, it went to a state judge, who ruled in 2021 that Phillips had violated the state's anti-discrimination law for refusing to bake the cake for Scardina. The judge said the case was about refusing to sell a product, and not compelled speech.

The Colorado Court of Appeals also sided with Scardina, ruling that the pink-and-blue cake -- on which Scardina did not request any writing -- was not speech protected by the First Amendment.

Phillips' attorney had argued before Colorado's high court that his cakes were protected free speech and that whatever Scardina said she was going to do with the cake mattered for his rights.

Representatives for the two sides said they were reviewing the ruling and did not have an immediate response."
Courts keep weighing in on abortion. Next month's elections could mean even bigger changes,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-supreme-court-ruling-texas-georgia-5c5d73c45274f90d40f7a4a07f00a27a,2024-10-08T16:18:22Z,"Two court rulings Monday bolstered abortion opponents, with the U.S. Supreme Court ruling that Texas could ban emergency abortions if they violate state law and Georgia's top court allowing enforcement of the abortion ban in that state.

The rulings are the latest in a legal saga that's been playing out a few rulings at a time across the U.S. for the past two years -- since the nation's top court overturned Roe v. Wade, ended the nationwide right to abortion, and opened the door to bans and restrictions, as well as the new legal fights that followed.

Meanwhile, abortion is also a top concern for voters ahead of next month's elections, including in nine states where it's on the ballot directly in the form of state constitutional amendments.

Here are five key things to know about the latest abortion developments across the country.

In the fallout of the 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization, President Joe Biden's administration told hospitals that federal law required them to provide abortion services when the life of the pregnant person was at risk.

Texas sued over the policy, saying the federal government could not mandate the right to abortions that would violate the state's ban at all stages of pregnancy, with exceptions to protect the health and life of the woman.

On Monday, the U.S. Supreme Court let that ruling stand. The justices did not detail their reasoning.

A weeks after a Georgia judge blocked the state's ban on abortion after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy, the state Supreme Court on Monday put it back into place -- at least for now.

The state's top court said the ban on abortion once cardiac activity can be detected, generally about six weeks into pregnancy and often before women realize they're pregnant, can be enforced while it considers the state's appeal of the September ruling.

It's not clear how many abortions were provided in the state that could not have been under the ban during the week the rules were relaxed. Some clinics said they were willing to provide abortions after six weeks, though.

The ruling meant that four states again bar abortion in most cases after about six weeks of pregnancy.

In another late-September development, a North Dakota ruling from earlier in the month striking down that state's abortion ban became official.

That means that 13 states are now enforcing bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy, instead of 14.

But the impact of the ruling in North Dakota is limited to hospitals in the nation's second-least populous state.

The only clinic that provided abortions in the state moved from Fargo to nearby Moorhead, Minnesota, after the Dobbs ruling was made and North Dakota's ban took effect.

Court rulings are not the only place where abortion policy decisions are being made.

Voters in nine states are determining whether to add the right to abortion to their state constitutions.

In Missouri and South Dakota, the measures would undo current bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy. In Florida, it would lift a ban that kicks in after six weeks.

Nebraska has competing measures on the ballot. One would create the right to abortion until fetal viability, generally considered to be around 23 or 24 weeks into pregnancy. The other would enshrine the current ban that kicks in after 12 weeks.

In Arizona, Colorado, Maryland and Montana, it would enshrine, and in some cases expand, abortion rights. Nevada's vote would, too, but to take effect, the measure would have to pass a second time, in 2026.

Additionally, New York voters will decide on an amendment that would bar discrimination on the basis of pregnancy status, though it does not mention abortion by name.

Abortion is a major issue in elections for office, too -- including the presidential race.

Vice President Kamala Harris has been focusing on abortion rights in her presidential campaign. She says she wants to ""reinstate the protections of Roe"". She talked about it on the ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast this week and in a speech last month in Georgia.

Former President Donald Trump, the GOP nominee, has taken credit for nominating Supreme Court justices who overturned Roe. He says that the issue should be up to the states and, recently, that he would veto a nationwide abortion ban if Congress passed one. He has also said he would vote against the Florida ballot measure, though he has also criticized it as too restrictive."
Qantas Airways apologizes after R-rated film reportedly airs on every screen during flight,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/qantas-daddio-movie-flight-customers-complain-1cb74cf8c401cc25aeb443b00c2dcaec,2024-10-08T15:18:27Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Qantas Airways has drawn up a stir after broadcasting a slightly-racy movie across an entire flight. And the Australian carrier now is apologizing to customers.

There were technical issues with the in-flight entertainment for a trip from Sydney to Haneda last week, Qantas confirmed to The Associated Press -- making individual movie selection unavailable. As a result, the crew chose one movie to play across all screens ""based on the request from a number of passengers,"" the company said.

Qantas did not identify the movie by name, but several media outlets have reported that it was ""Daddio,"" an R-rated film that hit theaters earlier this year.

""Daddio"" follows a woman (Dakota Johnson) who takes a cab from JFK airport and strikes up an extended conversation with her driver (Sean Penn) on her way back home to Manhattan -- as the two discuss anything from what it takes to be a New Yorker to relationships and infidelity, notably her current affair with a married man. The film carries an R rating for ""language throughout, sexual material and brief graphic nudity.""

Social media posts from users who claim they were on the Qantas flight said they were uncomfortable by nudity and sexting featured in the film -- particularly for families and children who were on board. Two users on Reddit said that it was also impossible for individual passengers to turn off the movie.

After determining that the movie was not appropriate for all ages, the Qantas crew attempted to fix screens for travelers who did not want to watch it -- but later found that this was not possible and changed course.

""The movie was clearly not suitable to play for the whole flight and we sincerely apologise to customers for this experience,"" a Qantas spokesperson said in a statement. ""All screens were changed to a family friendly movie for the rest of the flight, which is our standard practice for the rare cases where individual movie selection isn't possible.""

The spokesperson added that Qantas is ""reviewing how the (inital) movie was selected.""

In the days following the incident, the airline has taken some flack online -- including from travel rivals."
Golijov's Flamenco-tinged opera about slain Spanish playwright Lorca comes to the Met,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/osvaldo-golijov-ainadamar-opera-interview-d8fb22b2882c5ba3c3afdd2c770df64b,2024-10-08T13:45:34Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Osvaldo Golijov was running out of time.

The Argentine-born composer had been commissioned by the Tanglewood Music Center for a chamber opera to be performed in the summer of 2003. And with the deadline just months away, his original idea wasn't panning out.

""It didn't go anywhere. I had nothing,"" he recalled in an interview.

Happily, a friend introduced him to playwright David Henry Hwang, and they agreed to collaborate on a piece about a historical figure they both admired: Federico Garcia Lorca, the leftist Spanish dramatist and poet who was killed by fascist forces at the start of the Spanish Civil War.

Of necessity, the collaboration proceeded fast and furiously. ""I was so pressed for time that he started faxing me pages, one by one,"" Golijov said. ""I didn't even know how the thing was going to end or anything."" Hwang wrote the libretto in English and Golijov translated it into Spanish.

Somehow the result, ""Ainadamar,"" premiered on schedule. It was restaged in revised form two years later at the Santa Fe Opera, and is now coming to the Metropolitan Opera in a production by Brazilian director and choreographer Deborah Colker that runs for nine performances beginning Oct. 15.

The title is an Arabic word that translates as ""fountain of tears"" and refers to a spring in the hills above the city of Granada -- the site where Lorca was assassinated in 1936.

Hwang said he and Golijov were ""moved by the fact that Lorca had to some extent predicted his own murder through his work."" His early play, ""Mariana Pineda"" tells of a Spanish heroine of the 19th century liberal movement who was executed for refusing to betray her comrades.

Margarita Xirgu, who starred in that play, became Lorca's muse, and when she fled to Cuba she tried unsuccessfully to persuade him to join her.

Early on, Hwang decided to have Xirgu, rather than Lorca, be the main character in the opera.

""I liked the idea of creating Lorca through the memories of Margarita,"" Hwang said. ""I feel in general that when you're dealing with an iconic figure, it's interesting to see them refracted through the perceptions of those who had some sort of intimate relationship with them.""

An unexpected wrinkle arose when Golijov realized that Tanglewood had already assembled a cast for the opera he didn't write -- and it was all women.

""And there was one who had this extraordinary dark voice,"" he said. ""I got goosebumps. I told David, how about we make Lorca a woman.""

So what many critics have seen as a nod to a time-honored operatic tradition of having a woman portray a young man in a ""trousers role"" actually came about as a matter of necessity.

At the Met, the role of Lorca will be sung by mezzo Daniela Mack. Soprano Angel Blue is Margarita (with Gabriella Reyes substituting on Oct. 30.) Soprano Elena Villalón portrays Margarita's protege Nuria, Flamenco singer Alfredo Tejada is the politician who arranged Lorca's execution, and the conductor is Miguel Harth-Bedoya. The 90-minute opera is performed without intermission.

When the production premiered in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2022, Rowena Smith in The Guardian described Golijov's score as ""a collage of influences, shifting fluidly from Flamenco and electronic music to the classical language of 19th-century opera.""

""In this production the musical language finds a mirror in Deborah Colker's striking staging,"" she added.

Colker, who had never directed an opera, said she approached the staging as a choreographer, with singers and chorus members joining in the continual flow of dance rhythms. She enlisted a Flamenco choreographer, Antonio Najarro, to assist her.

""I want constant movement,"" Colker said. ""I want the audience not to recognize who is dancing, who is singing. Everybody is moving the sets, building the barricades, the tabletops where people dance in Spanish bars.""

Golijov himself said he found Colker's work revelatory.

""I've seen dozens of productions and this is the one that actually made me discover things in the piece that I hadn't discovered,"" he said. ""She got the tectonic movements, the very slow geological movements that are in the structure of the opera, so when she creates a climax, it's 10 more times explosive because she knows how to build it.""

Yuval Sharon, artistic director of the Detroit Opera, said that when his company staged the production, ""it set our audience on fire. They had never seen anything like it before.""

For Golijov, having his opera performed at the Met is especially sweet given his troubled history with the company. He had been commissioned to compose a new piece for the 2018-19 season. But in 20016, the Met canceled the commission, citing the composer's lack of progress.

""I had a few years of bad depression,"" Golijov acknowledges. ""I wrote much less, and I think they got scared that I would never finish the opera.""

In recent years, he has again become productive, composing a song cycle, ""Falling Out of Time,"" a violin concerto, and other pieces. He also wrote the score for Francis Ford's Coppola's new movie, ""Megalopolis.""

And he's beginning work on a new opera, inspired by what he calls a lifelong fascination with Laika, the Soviet dog who became the first living creature to orbit the Earth.

Does he hope it also might eventually see a production at the Met?

Golijov said that after the earlier disappointment, ""I think they love me, but they don't trust me.

""It's OK,"" he added, ""because if it's good enough, it will end up there."""
"These police officers had red flags in their past, then used force in a case that ended in death",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/police-lethal-restraint-red-flags-ca2ba3bc1d31d6831e7287e595433286,2024-10-08T12:38:23Z,"PHOENIX (AP) -- Sometimes second chances can prove deadly.

A police officer in Minnesota was suspended for threatening to shoot a passenger in the head after an unauthorized high-speed chase. In Paterson, New Jersey, an officer threw a handcuffed woman to the ground and strangled her. And in Little Rock, Arkansas, a patrol officer was allowed to rack up 36 sustained misconduct allegations and at least 65 days of suspension.

Each officer went on to be involved in a deadly encounter with the public. Not in shootings, but in cases where the force - whether physical restraints, blows or weapons such as a Taser - is referred to as less lethal.

Experts believe there are certain past actions -- multiple excessive use-of-force cases, domestic violence, mental health concerns among them -- that agencies should not overlook when hiring or retaining officers. However, national disciplinary standards are haphazard and disparate, and early-warning systems meant to identify troubled officers often fail.

The Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism, in collaboration with The Associated Press, obtained and examined officers' personnel and disciplinary records, citizen complaints, and training and departmental commendations through thousands of public records requests across the United States. These officers were involved in using physical force on a person who later died from 2012 through 2021.

Because disciplinary systems vary greatly from department to department, and not all records are publicly available, true statistical analysis is not possible. But a review of more than 350 officers involved in some 165 deaths during that decade revealed nearly three dozen examples of officers who had previously been disciplined for violent, criminal, or dangerously negligent offenses.

Officers who were disciplined for using stun guns on children, or threatening, strangling or beating handcuffed prisoners. Officers who had committed domestic and sexual assault, and were found to have engaged in police cover-ups. Officers who had been previously disciplined for their involvement in other in-custody deaths. Rather than losing their badges, these officers returned to duty, with deadly consequences.

Reporters emailed every police department and officer named in this story, seeking an interview, but in most cases received no response. Two officers responded initially but decided not to speak.

""If you look at the Derek Chauvins of the world, and you look at their history, you will see that there were certain alerts that should have been triggered long before they got to the point where they were using deadly force,"" said Vernon Herron, director of officer safety and wellness for the Baltimore Police Department.

Herron was referring to the former Minnesota police officer convicted of killing George Floyd, who died from the same kind of force this investigation studied.

Flagging troubled officers

Geoff Alpert, a professor of Criminology and Criminal Justice at the University of South Carolina, is an internationally recognized criminal justice expert who has studied high-risk police activities for more than three decades. He said the use of early-warning systems - also referred to as early-intervention systems - could discourage bad behavior.

""You don't want to give someone a gun, a badge, and a car and send them out there and hope they'll be alright,"" Alpert said.

Early-warning systems establish a process for tracking and reviewing performance indicators and incidents of risk. The U.S. Department of Justice and the International Association of Chiefs of Police both recommend their use to identify potential red flags in officer behavior.

Policing experts say such systems should be used as supervisory tools to support struggling officers, rather than for punishment. A 2021 study in the journal Criminology & Public Policy found the systems were most effective with ""rigorous oversight and genuine accountability"" and when designed as a deterrent for future behavior, rather than to remove officers with previously documented misconduct.

But while evaluating officer performance is a fundamental part of improving policing, oversight varies. The lack of mandatory national standards for accreditation or performance evaluation makes it a challenge to hold agencies and individual officers accountable. Many departments also fear that documented police errors could be used against them in litigation.

Paul Schultz, a retired police chief and former director of the Colorado Peace Officer Standards and Training unit, spent years educating smaller agencies on how to implement a warning system based on 18 different categories, including use of force incidents and allegations of misconduct. But, he said, there's ""no universal policy"" that departments must follow, adding, ""Many departments today will actually shred an officer's personnel file after three years.""

Difficult decisions, recruiting crisis

With staff shortages and struggles to find new recruits, some departments may be more willing to risk hiring officers with a troubling record, officials said.

Jerry Burns was hired as a deputy in 2016 by the Blount County Sheriff's Office in eastern Tennessee despite having violated a ""zero tolerance policy"" while working as a jailer in Kentucky in 2010, according to his personnel record, which does not further elaborate.

Four months after joining Blount County, he used force in a struggle with Anthony Edwards, slamming Edwards' head onto concrete pavement. The medical examiner ruled that Edwards' death was a homicide due to blunt force trauma, and his family sued for $25 million. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount.

Burns' partner in the struggle with Edwards, James Patty Jr., was fired by Blount County in 2007 for reasons related to his conduct, including insubordination, his personnel records show. Although he was deemed ineligible for rehire, he was rehired in 2011. He was fired again in 2016 after being charged with solicitation of a minor and was sentenced in 2018 to nine years in prison for those charges.

Brandon Spillman was hired in 2017 by the Avoyelles Parish Sheriff's office in Louisiana after previously being fired by the New Roads Police Department for reasons not specified in documents reporters obtained and reviewed. Spillman later used force in what was ruled a homicide due to respiratory compromise after he attempted to place Armando Frank in a choke hold during a struggle, according to court documents. Frank's brothers sued for damages, but the court dismissed the case in June 2022, ruling the officers had immunity from prosecution.

In Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, Officer Alan Salvosa received a two-day suspension for joining a pursuit outside of his jurisdiction, running a red light while driving 70 mph, then pointing a rifle at a passenger, saying, ""Don't move or I'll blow your head off.""

The unauthorized pursuit in 2016 occurred just 15 miles from where Floyd was murdered four years later. In 2021, Salvosa used his Taser on a man holding a crowbar who fell due to the jolt of electricity and cracked his head, later dying as a result of the blow.

In Paterson, New Jersey, Officer Michael Avila received a 90-day suspension and pleaded guilty to conduct unbecoming a public employee for his role in a 2011 incident in which he was processing a woman he had arrested. She was handcuffed to a bench when he grabbed her by the neck, strangled her and then threw her to the ground, according to records.

In 2019, Avila and another officer rode in an ambulance with Jameek Lowery, who had showed up at police headquarters amid a mental breakdown. When Lowery arrived at the hospital, he was unconscious and handcuffed to a gurney. He died two days later. Lowery's family hired a former chief medical examiner for New York City who concluded that Lowery suffered ""traumatic blunt force"" injuries in the ambulance. The state medical examiner said Lowery's death had been a cardiac arrest while under the influence of bath salts, a psychoactive stimulant.

Officer David Green of the Little Rock Police Department in Arkansas had been previously suspended 10 times for incidents including domestic violence and neglect of duty. In 2011, he bashed a handcuffed suspect's face into the ground multiple times, according to his internal affairs file obtained by the Howard Center.

""I can't, you know, count for accidents or something, but this type of incident will never happen again,"" Green said, according to the file.

A week after Green returned from suspension for the 2011 incident, he struggled with and pepper sprayed a man in his house in July 2012; the man died and medical officials said the physical restraint and pepper spray contributed. Ultimately, Green was fired in 2015 - records say for damaging a police station wall by throwing his cell phone after an upsetting conversation with his wife.

How Tucson police handled a death like George Floyd's when leaders thought it would never happen,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lethal-restraint-tucson-police-deaths-transparency-texts-7087a4f1637596d7d66afa92358b811b,2024-10-08T12:14:50Z,"TUCSON, Ariz. (AP) -- Leaders of the Tucson Police Department had heard a little about the video. Now, for the first time, they would judge for themselves how grim it was.

As the top brass gathered in a conference room at headquarters, Tucson was, like much of America, protesting the killing of George Floyd. It was June 2020. This body-camera footage could be the tipping point.

The video started. It was nighttime. Three officers strode up to a modest home. A 66-year-old grandmother had called 911 after her 27-year-old grandson became aggressive.

Carlos Adrian Ingram Lopez was naked and high on cocaine when the officers confronted him in the house's cramped, unlit garage. One officer told him to get on the ground and he did, a flashlight briefly showing him on all fours.

In the darkness on screen, the sound popped out. Ingram Lopez wailed, pleaded, apologized as officers cuffed his hands behind his back.

There was a heaviness in the conference room. The body language around the table was bad, the reluctance to talk telling.

The footage was not done, but the chief and his team didn't need to see any more, not right then. They all knew how this ended.

The meeting broke and the reckoning began.

Well before Floyd's murder in May 2020, Tucson was among America's big-city departments to embrace ""progressive policing."" Members of the same leadership in that conference room had launched programs to get nonviolent drug dealers and homeless people services, rather than incarcerate them, and new training to teach officers to de-escalate difficult and dangerous situations.

Then-Chief Chris Magnus was a leader within progressive policing who had, as chief in Richmond, California, appeared in uniform at a protest holding a Black Lives Matter sign. Two weeks before watching the Ingram Lopez video for the first time, he reflected on Floyd's death in a newspaper column.

Progressive police departments, Magnus wrote in the Arizona Daily Star, work hard to prevent such deaths through training, supervision, accountability and transparency. Tucson, he wrote, was ""ahead of the curve"" in these areas.

Now, Magnus' department had a death that involved not just rapid escalation to force but also - like Floyd - a person telling officers ""I can't breathe"" as they held him face down.

An Associated Press reconstruction of what followed, based on text messages and internal investigative files, shows how a department's attempts to limit force don't always filter down to the street, and how internal culture can shape what a department tells the public.

""We were sitting here going -- when George Floyd broke -- thinking, man, that can never happen here,"" Chad Kasmar, the No. 2 under Magnus who took over when the chief left in 2021 to lead U.S. Customs and Border Protection, told AP of this Democratic-leaning city of 542,000 people. ""And what we hadn't recognized is we had a very similar incident that people were going to connect.""

In the early morning of April 21, 2020, police came to the house of Ingram Lopez's grandmother after she reported that her grandson was naked, under the influence of drugs and acting erratically.

Ingram Lopez had struggled with substance abuse, was unemployed and hadn't gotten much sleep in his last days. Inside the home, he was hallucinating. His grandmother tried to leave, but he blocked and pushed her. Frightened, she called 911.

A dispatcher told responding officers Ingram Lopez had a domestic violence arrest warrant. Two days earlier, the mother of his young daughter reported that he pushed her in the chest during a dispute over her laptop. Ingram Lopez was staying with his grandmother because the woman had kicked him out.

None of the first officers to arrive discussed a plan -- a basic best practice that would later be emphasized in the department's training. Aside from telling Ingram Lopez to relax, they did little to calm the encounter, even when he soon started cooperating.

Officers cuffed Ingram Lopez's hands behind his back and kept him for 12 minutes on his stomach, a position known as prone restraint that can dangerously restrict breathing. During the handcuffing, two of them put knees on his back, while a third held his legs, according to internal interviews of the officers. The officers would later be found to have violated several departmental policies, including for their use of force.

One who believed Ingram Lopez remained a danger didn't turn him from his stomach onto his side so his airway could remain clear. Officers ignored Ingram Lopez's complaint that he couldn't breathe and his 21 pleas for water.

Due to concerns about an emerging virus called COVID-19, officers placed a spit sock over Ingram Lopez's face. Blankets draped over his head and naked torso made it harder to monitor breathing. One of the officers had previously worked as an EMT but had not requested paramedics.

Ingram Lopez was dying, yet nearly two minutes passed from when he made his last sound to when officers turned him off his stomach at the request of an arriving supervisor.

The supervisor pulled up the spit mask, and he and another officer started CPR. Within about half an hour, Ingram Lopez was pronounced dead. In an autopsy, a medical examiner concluded Ingram Lopez died from ""sudden cardiac arrest in the setting of acute cocaine intoxication and physical restraint"" and that his enlarged heart was a contributing condition.

He was one of more than 1,000 people who died over a decade after police subdued them using force that is not supposed to be lethal, an investigation led by The Associated Press found. In hundreds of those encounters, officers violated long-established safety practices. The investigation was done in collaboration with The Howard Center for Investigative Journalism programs at Arizona State University and the University of Maryland, and FRONTLINE (PBS).

In Tucson, Ingram Lopez's grandmother blamed herself, family would tell an officer investigating the death. ""She should have just taken a beating"" is how family members summarized her anguish.

Jolting as it was, the video raised a deeper question: Why did it take nearly eight weeks for the department's leaders to see it?

The department immediately opened an internal affairs investigation into Ingram Lopez's death -- a standard practice to determine whether officers broke any rules.

A series of texts the AP obtained under a public records act request shows how the internal affairs commander responsible for that investigation downplayed the full range of failures. The text conversation was between Lt. Jennifer Pegnato, the commander who was investigating the death, and her boss, Assistant Chief Michael Silva.

In the overnight hours after the encounter, Pegnato reported to Silva that investigators found white powder at the grandmother's house, that Ingram Lopez had been acting bizarrely, and that a few minutes had passed between when he was detained and when a supervising sergeant arrived.

She also referred to the officers' body-worn camera video. Based on her initial assessment, the officers could have rolled him from his stomach to his side sooner.

""But,"" she wrote, ""no force was used.""

The next day, Silva texted to check on interviews of the officers, who had worked for the department between 18 months and five years.

""Nothing earth shattering thus far,"" Pegnato replied.

She texted again a bit later. ""I think this is a case of several young inexperienced officers,"" she continued. ""They will likely need some additional training. Some poor tactics were utilized and no one really had a plan.""

Silva then asked Pegnato if she wanted to bring any investigators from her staff to an initial briefing for the brass.

The two sergeants helping Pegnato with the investigation were split. Like her, one of them believed no force had been used -- but the video shocked the other sergeant, who considered it among the worst he had seen, records show.

""I'll cover it,"" Pegnato wrote Silva of the meeting. ""I think I'm well versed. And hoping with just me I can help keep it brief. :)""

The pandemic was unfolding and people were scattered, so Pegnato scheduled a remote meeting on the Microsoft collaboration platform Teams for two days after Ingram Lopez's death.

During the meeting, Pegnato didn't show the video. She later said Teams was new to her and that posed challenges. She would recount that she thought she described some of what she saw on the video, and said a lot could have gone better.

Seven weeks later, on June 15, the leadership finally saw for itself.

The internal affairs investigator who was shocked by the video but wasn't invited to the first meeting made sure to go this time, even though it was his typical day off. Several attendees recalled how the bosses' faces showed that they hadn't previously understood the gravity of the encounter.

They described Chief Magnus as displeased, disappointed and appalled. Magnus did not grant an interview request.

Department leaders understood immediately that people would see parallels between Ingram Lopez and Floyd. And that the public would suspect a cover-up, since the public hadn't yet been told and the officers were back on duty within three days.

""It was a heavy meeting where everything's flooding against you,"" then-Deputy Chief Kasmar recalled.

The department wasn't ready to go public.

Magnus would later say they waited to reveal the death until after Ingram Lopez's family could watch the video. But eight days after leadership saw the video, local news media broke the story of the death.

The next day, June 24, Magnus addressed the public.

Stepping to news conference microphones, flanked by the mayor and a sign language interpreter, Magnus removed the mask covering his face. He began by saying he and others at the department were troubled and were committed to accountability and transparency.

Magnus then summarized the encounter. Ingram Lopez faced domestic violence allegations, had been restrained face down for about 12 minutes and went into cardiac arrest. He was on cocaine and had a preexisting heart condition. Although Ingram Lopez started out acting erratically, he soon became compliant.

Magnus said the three officers didn't have malicious intent but had violated department policy and would have been fired had they not already quit.

The video began on a large screen and ended 22 minutes later, with officers and firefighters trying to revive Ingram Lopez.

""This is now the 18th time I've watched it,"" Magnus said, ""and it frankly never gets any easier.""

Magnus then acknowledged he and other top managers should have watched the video sooner. The public should have been notified earlier, too, but he didn't think there had been a calculated cover-up.

""I realize that, given the times we are in, any mistakes of this kind are viewed with great suspicion,"" Magnus said.

Even as he promised transparency during the news conference, Magnus didn't disclose something else: Just a month before Ingram Lopez's death, another Hispanic man died after Tucson officers restrained him.

Damien Alvarado ran from a car crash in March 2020. A man and his son who had witnessed the immediate aftermath of the wreck spotted the 29-year-old in a bush behind a church. The man and an officer who had just arrived had grabbed Alvarado's legs as he tried to climb over a cinderblock wall.

The officer brought him to the ground and punched Alvarado, whose hands, the officer said, were moving toward his gun. More officers arrived. Alvarado resisted handcuffs and threatened them. Police shocked him several times with a Taser and used two devices to restrain his legs.

During the four minutes they held him down, an officer put a knee on Alvarado's back. Both officers and paramedics put a spit mask over his face. When Alvarado complained he couldn't breathe, one officer profanely told Alvarado to shut his mouth.

Paramedics were preparing to leave but were called back when his breathing became labored, then stopped. Officers began CPR and paramedics brought him to a hospital, where he was pronounced dead.

Alvarado's mother Irene remembers Damien as a skilled carpenter with a zest for life. Like Ingram Lopez, Alvarado left behind a young child. ""He didn't deserve to die,"" Irene Alvarado said in an interview as she wept.

The Pima County Medical Examiner's Office concluded the death was an accident caused by ""cardiac arrest in the setting of acute methamphetamine intoxication and restraint."" All officers were cleared for their use of force, but two were disciplined for foul language.

Two weeks after Magnus' news conference and more than three months after Alvarado's death, the department revealed the encounter to the public -- through a news release.

At the news conference, Magnus had offered to resign. The city manager declined the next day, citing his community policing efforts and talent for changing the department's culture.

Those efforts would be tested, as the Ingram Lopez death galvanized protesters.

Still deputy chief, Kasmar reviewed the department's internal investigation and leveled a withering critique. Pegnato should have realized the officers' failures far exceeded ""re-training opportunities,"" Kasmar wrote, and she failed to grasp the city's legal liability when the officers kept holding Ingram Lopez down despite his medical distress.

Kasmar also criticized the department's executive leadership team, which he said should have asked to see the video. AP sought to speak with Silva but he did not respond to interview requests. Pegnato, whose last name is now Pegnato Moss, declined to be interviewed.

Police leaders undertook a new kind of accountability called a sentinel event review board, a public investigation typically used in the hospital and airline industries to learn from mistakes. Departments tend to avoid them because the findings can become fodder in wrongful death lawsuits.

In the end, the review board offered dozens of recommendations. Months after the inquiry, the department detailed changes it made.

In response to the lack of planning and rapid escalation with Ingram Lopez, the department gave sworn officers new training in November 2020. There were also trainings on recognizing medical distress, calling EMS and monitoring breathing - courses that are continuing today, according to Kasmar.

Parallel reforms required quicker action. Two chiefs and the chief of police now review body-worn camera footage within two days of a death, and footage must be made public within three days. All restraint deaths get the same level of review as officer-involved shootings.

Other changes included dispatching the fire department with police on narcotics calls to administer aid quickly. The department discontinued use of spit socks, and each new internal affairs staffer would get a training program and a mentor sergeant.

Michael Scott, a criminal justice professor at Arizona State University and former police chief in Florida, helped conduct the Tucson review board's investigation. He's long pushed departments to adopt these kinds of boards to build transparency and trust.

""Doing nothing, changing nothing is not really an option,"" Scott said in an interview.

The department takes learning from critical incidents like Ingram Lopez's death seriously, Kasmar said. The question becomes how well officers embrace those lessons.

""Culture,"" he said, ""eats policy for breakfast.""

Tucson has picked most of its chiefs from within and Kasmar is a third-generation Tucsonan ""raising a fourth."" Kasmar attended his hometown's University of Arizona, earning a fine arts degree. The year after he joined in 2000, people rioted after the school lost the men's college basketball title game. Officers fired beanbags and wooden dowels at them, striking 40 people, including a student who lost an eye.

Kasmar worked his way up, including stints as a patrol officer and commander of internal affairs. Now in charge, Kasmar believes change can come, even if slowly. Getting the department's 1,200 people to follow along takes time, he said - and persistence.

""Across this country we have these, you know, expectations for these immediate shifts in culture,"" Kasmar said. ""But what we don't have any grace for is the fact that human beings in general are difficult or resistant to change.""

Under Kasmar, the department has paid an anthropologist to examine its training and culture. Some review board members were concerned systemic racism might have influenced officers' responses with both Latino men.

Victor Braitberg, a University of Arizona cultural anthropologist, began working as a private consultant for the department in January 2021, conducting a yearlong examination. He has since done other paid work for the department.

Braitberg said officers earnestly believed that racism and bias were not a problem in their ranks. He also found a division between officers and leadership on the role bias was perceived to play in the two deaths. The rank and file didn't feel the brass had their back.

That view began to change, Braitberg said, with Kasmar, whose approach included running with recruits and checking in with detectives. Braitberg said he thinks the department's culture is improving and that officers and leadership are more aligned.

Kasmar said his department's not perfect and has been working to rebuild trust.

""I think we're doing everything in our power to be a transparent police department and set a tone for other organizations in the country to follow,"" he said.

One indicator of cultural change in the department, he said, was that for the first time in five years, the agency began the year with a handful more officers than it had in the previous year - a reversal of a trend after the deaths of Floyd and Ingram Lopez. He pointed to a program that helps officers deal with trauma and recognize ""it's OK to be human - it's OK to show emotion,"" Kasmar said.

Hard skeptics question whether Tucson police can change. Paul Gattone, an attorney representing Alvarado's family, said officers see civilians as a potential threat rather than people who need their protection. ""They are a product of what we've allowed the police to become,"" Gattone said.

Tucson is fighting the Alvarado lawsuit, arguing that officers acted reasonably. On the other hand, the city paid $2.9 million to settle legal claims over Ingram Lopez's death.

It's not only the police department's culture that would have to change to improve police-community relations, according to Caroline Isaacs, a longtime Tucson activist with Just Communities Arizona.

Internal reforms can be hard because criminal justice often presents itself as adversarial, and there's not great communication between those in the system.

""It's always us against them,"" she said. ""There's so little dialogue on both sides, and that creates no room for -- you know - accountability.""

A series of deaths and the 'Big Fight': Uncovering police force in one Midwestern city,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/police-use-of-force-deaths-evansville-lethal-restraint-4d4b8e5c590938b22f4b59ee34fac3d9,2024-10-08T11:09:36Z,"EVANSVILLE, Ind. (AP) -- It was the day of the ""Big Fight"" at the police academy, and rookie sheriff's deputy Asson Hacker groaned as the hulking instructor pressed down on his chest.

Playing the role of a combative suspect, the trainer challenged Hacker to battle like his life was on the line. He punched Hacker, wrapped him in headlocks and tossed him against a padded gym wall.

""C'mon, you got to go home!"" another instructor yelled. The message: Hacker needed to fight harder to survive violent encounters on the street.

After seven exhausting minutes, Hacker managed to snap a handcuff on the trainer. Instructors and recruits ringing the gym clapped. Hacker toppled from his knees onto his back.

Within hours, the 33-year-old father of four young sons was dead. A classmate who fought the same instructor shortly after was himself rushed to the hospital with a disabling injury. The public would not be told the full story of that March 2023 day, which authorities described as routine training in which Hacker died of exertion tied to a genetic condition.

The Big Fight at the Southwest Indiana Law Enforcement Academy underscores a culture of aggression that persists at some police departments, where officers are taught to view virtually everyone they encounter as a potentially deadly threat. That mindset can lead officers to resort quickly to physical force and weapons on patrol.

A few years before the academy tragedy, four people died over just 14 months on Evansville's streets after officers used tactics that are not intended to kill - yet have contributed to the deaths of civilians across the nation, an Associated Press investigation found.

That cluster stood out for a mid-sized city among the more than 1,000 deaths AP documented after force such as Tasers and holds. At the same time, the deaths echoed encounters elsewhere in which officers misused force during difficult behavioral and medical emergencies.

AP found a pattern after the fatal incidents involving civilians and at the academy the Evansville Police Department runs: Authorities downplayed the violence, the county coroner who worked 25 years in law enforcement ruled that force did not contribute to the deaths, and no officer was criminally charged.

Video and records that AP unearthed show official narratives omitted key details of the force or mockery officers directed at those who would die. Operating with little independent oversight, Evansville police have been able to shield themselves from criticism, but not always liability. The city paid the parents of one deceased man nearly $1 million to drop their lawsuit and keep quiet.

City officials declined interview requests and didn't answer a list of questions. A city lawyer said force by Evansville officers has ""overwhelmingly been deemed lawful"" when challenged in court.

Evansville was among the departments where AP found use-of-force training, tactics and oversight that was similar to practices in cities where the U.S. Department of Justice has raised concerns over the past decade. In June, for example, the DOJ faulted Phoenix police for training and oversight deficiencies that contribute to escalation and force.

Hacker's relatives feel abandoned and suspicious that the law enforcement family he wanted to join is covering up the role the Big Fight played in his death.

""If they can't get it right with one of their own,"" said Asson's younger brother, Lij Hacker, ""then they're definitely not going to get it right with the public.""

While Asson Hacker was thrilled to be a rookie deputy, he confided to his brother he was dreading the Big Fight, the culmination of a grueling week of training that already had given him a bruised face and sore ribs.

Hacker had been recruited to join the Vanderburgh County Sheriff's Office by a deputy who lived next door. A 6-foot-3-inch, 230-pound former college basketball player who became a competitive bodybuilder, Hacker told relatives he felt a calling to help people. As a Black man born in New York City, he would bring diversity to an overwhelmingly white department on Indiana's border with Kentucky.

Hacker shaved the beard he wore as a coal miner and proudly showed off his uniform to family. He thought wearing the badge would make him a role model for his boys -- all under age 12.

First, Hacker had to complete four months at the academy.

For fight day, he was paired with Mike Fisher, a sheriff's major from a nearby county. A longtime instructor, Fisher had pummeled recruits during a boxing drill two days earlier in what one described as a ""beatdown.""

Police academies have long held fight days or similar drills to toughen up rookies before they hit streets, where one misstep could be deadly. Evansville's was based on a real-world scenario in which an officer ran up the stairs of an apartment building to apprehend two combative suspects.

Hacker paced a hallway before the drill, holding his ribs. When his turn came, he ran up the two-story building's stairs, punched a bag, ran across the gym and kneed another bag. Then he lay down on the mat so the fight could begin.

A little more than halfway in, video obtained by AP under Indiana's open records law shows, Hacker wobbled like a fighter in danger of being counted out. He continued listlessly for three more minutes as instructors urged him on and afterward slumped against the ropes of a nearby boxing ring.

About 15 minutes later, four instructors and recruits carried an unconscious Hacker across the gym as another fight continued. They anxiously waited for an ambulance before rushing Hacker to the hospital in the back of a police car.

Instructors told recruits that Hacker was probably just dehydrated or overheated. Among them was Tanner Corum, the Evansville Police rookie next up to face Fisher.

Before his fight, Corum gave a classmate his wife's number and said to call her if anything happened. He asked for a prayer.

Video shows Fisher sitting and laying on Corum's chest, holding him to the mat with an arm around his neck and punching him in the stomach as Corum fought to break free. Corum told Fisher he couldn't breathe, and one recruit later said the restraint ""appeared to be suffocating"" him. Fisher put him in a headlock and took him back to the mat.

Afterwards Corum couldn't move his head. His neck felt tight, his right arm trembled. He started walking to his truck to get Tylenol and collapsed.

Summoned to the gym, Corum's wife drove him to the hospital. As Corum checked in word spread that Hacker was dead.

Hospital doctors concluded that Hacker had rhabdomyolysis, a potentially life-threatening condition sometimes caused by excessive exercise or trauma in which muscles release chemicals that damage the kidneys. Corum had both rhabdomyolysis and a spinal injury in his neck that caused weakness in his limbs. He could not walk without help and was hospitalized for two weeks.

When dozens of uniformed officers gathered at an Evansville church for Hacker's funeral a week after he died, Corum was up front - in a wheelchair. Vanderburgh County Sheriff Noah Robinson told the crowd they could honor Hacker by committing themselves to the ""truth"" - a message, he acknowledged later to AP, intended to stop chatter about what caused Hacker's death.

Evansville police announced Hacker's death in a news release, saying he and an unidentified second recruit had suffered medical ailments during ""routine physical tactics training."" The department vowed to cooperate with an Indiana State Police investigation and pledged transparency.

Many departments around the U.S. face outside investigations into deaths involving officers, but for Evansville it was extraordinary. For decades the department had almost always itself investigated whether officers did anything criminally wrong during fatal encounters.

Even with outside scrutiny, records show some recruits worried the state investigation was influenced by efforts to protect the academy from liability. Investigators repeatedly asked about unfounded claims that steroid use could be to blame and questioned Hacker and Corum's diets and exercise habits. One recruit was concerned his interview could cause ""Hacker's family to not be compensated.""

Some of the rookie officers said they saw nothing wrong with the training. But others felt investigators ignored the physical force the men endured and a culture in which recruits were pushed to the point of injury. One complained they ""were being told a narrative"" that absolved the instructors.

A state police spokesperson said the agency conducted a thorough investigation.

Five experts interviewed by the AP said Evansville's training appeared similar to ""defensive tactics"" drills used elsewhere, including some that have been linked to deaths and serious injuries.

Spencer Fomby, a longtime use-of-force trainer, questioned the design of Evansville's scenario, saying police on patrol would very rarely -- if ever -- fight a larger person on top of them while exhausted without backup or weapons. He said recruits should be taught to avoid trading strikes or engaging in prolonged ground fights, and instead transition to Tasers or other options.

""We're not supposed to be training police officers to be MMA fighters,"" Fomby said.

Had academy instructors stopped when Hacker was clearly exhausted, he would have recovered, said Dr. Randy Eichner, a retired University of Oklahoma professor who has studied exertion-related deaths. While the instructor let up at the end, that was too late, he said: ""By then, Asson was fighting a different fight - fighting just to live.""

Determining Hacker's official cause and manner of death was the job of Vanderburgh County Coroner Steve Lockyear. He was elected after working 25 years at the sheriff's office that hired Hacker, including as a detective.

""We work very closely and we don't have any problems,"" Lockyear said in an interview of his office's relationship with local law enforcement.

A pathologist contracted by Lockyear's office conducted Hacker's autopsy. During the procedure, police officials showed him videos of the fights and said they reflected normal training, records show.

The coroner announced his ruling weeks later: Hacker died from ""exertional sickling due to sickle cell trait."" During exertional sickling, red blood cells become misshapen, causing a drop in blood flow.

Lockyear told AP that combat training had ""absolutely"" contributed to Hacker's death by causing him to strenuously exert himself. But he said he ruled the death natural - not a homicide, an accident or undetermined -- because Hacker had been born with sickle cell trait.

Sickle cell trait carriers generally have no symptoms, though in rare cases military recruits and athletes have died after suffering heat stroke and muscle breakdown when doing intense exercise. Asson Hacker had known since childhood that he carried the genetic characteristic, but his doctors said it was benign. Exertion had never been a problem for Hacker when he competed in football, basketball or bodybuilding, his brother Lij said.

Dr. Michael Baden, a former New York City medical examiner who has testified in dozens of police-involved deaths, reviewed Hacker's death for AP. He said several factors likely contributed, including exertion, body blows and dehydration.

He said sickle cell trait may have been a contributing factor but Hacker's medical records don't prove that. Testing at the hospital did not reveal any sickling -- that was only detected later, at the autopsy, when it would be expected after cells were deprived of oxygen.

""He died as a result of the rough training,"" Baden said. ""Here they had all these people looking around and nobody said, 'We ought to stop it.'""

The day the coroner announced his ruling, Sheriff Robinson said officials had been unaware Hacker carried sickle cell trait and his department would start testing recruits for it. Robinson told AP that he saw no misconduct by Fisher and defended the Big Fight.

""It can get violent out there and that violence oftentimes is perpetrated upon us,"" the sheriff said. ""We have to have the skills to protect ourselves and to protect others.""

Fisher, the academy instructor who is a major with the Knox County Sheriff's Office, declined an interview. He told investigators that he wanted to put Hacker and Corum into uncomfortable positions that would cause their hearts to race, but that he wasn't there to hurt anyone.

After the coroner's ruling, state police closed their investigation. A prosecutor wrote on a form: ""Evidence shows no crime was committed.""

""I have seen many fights on body camera and the exercise pales in comparison to the real fights that officers sometimes encounter in the field,"" County Prosecutor Diana Moers said later of her office's decision.

Evansville has not had an officer killed in nearly a century, but some have been seriously injured, including last December when two were attacked while responding to a domestic violence call. The city's violent crime rate has been higher than the national average, with the closing of manufacturing plants leading to population losses and concerns about poverty, drug use and mental illness.

As a prior recruit at the same academy Hacker attended, Trevor Koontz learned to expect violence. As a rookie on Evansville's streets, Koontz's field trainer drilled home that message.

Before patrol shifts, training Officer Matthew Taylor required Koontz to recite a saying out loud: ""Whoever I am dealing with may try and kill me. I will not make a mistake so that my wife is a widow."" Koontz, who had served stateside in the Army, would later describe it as a profound reminder of the dangers of his new job.

It was 2019, and Evansville officers had been using force more often than before, according to internal statistics. A longtime Evansville police supervisor blamed anti-police sentiment, saying in sworn testimony, ""They're resisting more than they have in the past. And if you resist more, you have more uses of force.""

Training records show Taylor believed Koontz remained too trusting, and needed to learn that even seemingly friendly people could be hiding a weapon. Taylor stressed to his trainee that Koontz must quickly handcuff and pat down people they encountered.

One September evening, a manager at a Honda dealership called 911, worried that an apparently intoxicated man looking for his truck would stumble into traffic. The man, Edward Snukis, a 55-year-old construction contractor and grandfather, was a 12-hour drive from home in St. Clair, Pennsylvania. He had no criminal history and was unarmed but, his son recalled, had started using methamphetamine after a painful divorce.

Taylor and Koontz found Snukis standing on a sidewalk, his shirt unbuttoned. Hopping out of the patrol car and striding toward Snukis, Koontz ordered him to put his hands on his head, body-camera video shows.

""Why?"" asked Snukis. ""Why, what's going on?""

Instead of answering, Koontz grabbed Snukis' arm and started to pull it behind his back for handcuffing. Koontz would later say he thought Snukis took a ""fighting stance,"" something that's not clear from the video.

A startled Snukis swung his arm to break free and hit Koontz, then ran. Taylor fired his Taser, and darts delivering a jolt of electricity caused Snukis to fall.

""Get on the ground or you'll get it again,"" Taylor yelled. Snukis was on the ground. Taylor shocked him a second time.

Snukis managed to get up and run about a block before tripping.

The officers piled on his back and held him face down under their weight, a position that police have long been warned can dangerously restrict breathing. They tried to pull Snukis' arms from under him. Taylor later said in his report that Snukis tried to grab his holster and groin, so he punched Snukis six times in the head to make him stop.

A backup officer arrived and put his knee on Snukis' shoulder near his neck as he secured handcuffs. Officers turned Snukis over. Dirt caked his face.

Four minutes after he'd encountered Koontz and two minutes after being held face down, Snukis wasn't breathing. Officers and paramedics could not revive him.

Witnesses were stunned. A woman told police that Snukis was just standing there before the officer grabbed his arm. ""I didn't see him do anything,"" she said.

Her son, Brentlee Spurlock, told police that officers stayed on Snukis too long while he was struggling to breathe. He reiterated that the force seemed excessive in an interview with AP.

Under the Evansville Police Department's practice of investigating itself, the job of examining the Snukis case fell to Detective Josey Lewis.

Lewis once worked on the department's bomb squad with training Officer Taylor and occasionally socialized with him outside work, records show.

Taylor and Koontz declined to speak with the detective and exercised their right to remain silent - something that doesn't happen everywhere after a death, but was routine in Evansville. With help from a lawyer provided by the police union, Taylor and Koontz wrote in their reports that Snukis caused the escalation.

Lewis would later say in a lawsuit deposition he didn't see anything remarkable in body-camera footage. He never learned Taylor required Koontz to recite the saying - which was not department-wide practice -- or that Taylor repeatedly punched Snukis. Lewis never talked to the backup officer who in deposition testimony questioned why officers didn't try to talk to Snukis first. Both Lewis and police union representatives did not respond to AP's requests for comment.

The department's investigation turned back on the deceased. Investigators concluded Snukis was aggressive and fought officers immediately - even though Koontz had put his hands on Snukis first.

Two police supervisors who evaluated the Snukis case concluded the force was reasonable. Taylor wrote that his trainee ""did a good job of maintaining control during a high-stress situation.""

The pathologist who examined Snukis was the same one who several years later would conduct Hacker's autopsy. The doctor pointed to methamphetamine in Snukis' system and an enlarged heart as the cause of death. He added that Snukis' behavior was consistent with ""excited delirium,"" a term coined to describe potentially fatal agitation that the medical community now disavows.

Coroner Lockyear ruled Snukis' death was an accident caused by meth. He acknowledged to AP that it is ""extremely dangerous"" for officers to pile on suspects who are face down but said that's not why Snukis died, saying Evansville has long been a ""meth capital"" and the drug causes aggression. Lockyear also said he would only rule a restraint death a homicide - a death at the hands of another - if officers acted recklessly or showed an intent to kill.

""You can't blame the police for everything,"" he said.

AP's investigation found that coroners or medical examiners elsewhere have blamed preexisting health conditions or drug use in many deaths that involved significant police force.

The police department cited the coroner's ruling in closing its investigation as ""non-criminal."" While local or state prosecutors in many places review police custody deaths for potential criminal charges and issue public rulings, the Snukis case was never forwarded for a legal examination.

Baden, the former New York City medical examiner, reviewed the Snukis records for AP and said he would have ruled the death a homicide caused by restraint asphyxia. Baden said the level of meth in Snukis was high, but would not normally be fatal. He said video shows Snukis stopped breathing soon after officers put pressure on his back.

The pathologist who conducted Snukis' official autopsy testified he could not rule out asphyxia as the cause, but added he could not tell since video didn't clearly show the force. He said if he'd been told that Taylor repeatedly punched Snukis' head, he would have examined the skull and brain more carefully.

Koontz acknowledged under oath that his body-camera video did not support his written claim that Snukis ""approached me yelling and throwing his hands in the air.""

A policing expert hired by the family and an outside expert contacted by AP both said that Koontz made a rookie mistake by quickly trying to handcuff Snukis, rapidly escalating a routine welfare check.

""He was not the aggressor,"" Snukis' son, Ed Jr., said in an interview. ""Yes, he was going through a hard time, but everybody goes through hard times. That's life. The cops had no sympathy for his life at all.""

Neither Koontz nor Taylor faced disciplinary action. But weeks later, at the end of his probationary period, Koontz resigned. Department officials had informed him that his attention to officer safety still fell short. Koontz did not return messages seeking comment.

Taylor, who also did not reply to requests for comment, testified he regretted ""that Mr. Snukis' decisions on that day have caused pain and suffering for his family.""

Earlier this year, a federal judge dismissed the Snukis family's lawsuit, finding the force was reasonable given Snukis' resistance. The family has appealed.

Snukis' death in September 2019 was followed by three other deaths involving Evansville police restraint, according to the AP investigation, done in collaboration with FRONTLINE (PBS) and the Howard Centers for Investigative Journalism.

In February 2020, 25-year-old Dean Smith fled after an Evansville officer pulled over his vehicle to arrest him on a warrant. A police dog caught Smith and bit his legs. Bleeding and handcuffed, Smith told officers he had asthma and couldn't breathe. An officer told Smith, who was Black, ""Boy, you're being overly dramatic."" Soon after medics arrived, Smith suffered cardiac arrest.

The next month, police responded to a motel where an agitated man had been scaring guests. After Steven Beasley resisted handcuffs, an officer threw him to the ground and his head struck a wall, bystander cellphone video showed. Another shocked Beasley with a Taser while he was handcuffed face down, saying he was kicking and trying to bite an officer. Several officers put pressure on his back and head, at times joking and laughing as Beasley, 37, became unresponsive.

The department said in a news release officers were ""attempting to save Mr. Beasley's life"" after a struggle, without mentioning the takedown, the Taser use or the prolonged restraint. Internal reports supported those uses of force.

In November 2020, officers chatted for several minutes while Evan Terhune, hands cuffed behind his back and his face covered by a spit hood, screamed and banged his head against metal in a police van parked outside a hospital. The 20-year-old was hallucinating on LSD, having been shocked with a Taser and arrested after becoming violent at a party and punching an officer.

""It's not a good day for this guy,"" an officer said of Terhune. By the time officers opened the van, he was unresponsive. In a previously unreported legal settlement that AP obtained under a records request, the city agreed earlier this year to pay Terhune's parents $987,600. Under the terms, the family must keep the amount confidential and never make any ""disparaging"" statements about Evansville police.

William Harmening, a retired law enforcement officer who wrote a book about officers using excessive force, reviewed all four Evansville deaths in AP's database. He found officers made mistakes in each, from misusing restraint tactics to delaying immediate medical help.

""You have a department that's poorly supervised,"" he said.

Billy Bolin, who was Evansville's chief at the time of all five deaths, didn't respond to interview requests. He left the department earlier this year and is now chief in nearby Henderson, Kentucky.

The coroner ruled that Smith died from complications of sickle cell trait, as he later would with Hacker. He ruled that Beasley's death was ""undetermined"" after an autopsy report said he had suffered extensive blunt force trauma to his head and body but also had excited delirium. And he found that Terhune died from self-inflicted head trauma. None of the rulings cited police force or restraint in the cause.

The department closed its investigations of the officers without finding fault, and the county prosecutor's office said it had no record of reviewing any of the four cases.

The fallout from the training tragedy continues.

Hacker's estate, represented by his widow, Kourtney Hacker, filed a lawsuit in September alleging the instructor used excessive force and impeded Hacker's breathing. The lawsuit said the Big Fight amounted to hazing, and the academy failed to have adequate medical personnel available. Another instructor was negligent by encouraging a distressed Hacker to keep fighting and failing to intervene, alleges the suit.

Sheriff Robinson said the lawsuit contained allegations that were ""either inaccurate or misleading"" and he expects the academy and its instructors to present a robust defense.

Corum notified the city that he may also file a lawsuit. He said he still suffers severe pain in his back, numbness on his left side and neck pain that causes frequent headaches. He resigned from a desk job in the records department he'd gotten because he could not patrol the streets, and a city board later approved his application for a disability pension.

""Everything's just been life-changing,"" said Corum, 29, who lamented how he can't pick up his young sons for long or run without pain or numbness.

Citing potential litigation, Keith Vonderahe, an outside lawyer representing the city, directed Evansville's mayor and police chief to cancel interviews with AP.

""We're not aware of any facts or evidence that our training procedures caused the tragic death of Mr. Hacker or Mr. Corum's injuries,"" Vonderahe said.

Lij Hacker, who once wanted to join his brother to fight crime in Evansville, has asked the FBI to investigate. He said he recently met with an agent but the status of any inquiry is unclear.

What Lij Hacker wants now is for people to see how his brother died, and for accountability and change within law enforcement in Evansville.

""If this slips through the cracks and no one is held accountable,"" he said, ""the justice system has failed us.""

German court acquits McCann suspect of unrelated sexual offense charges,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/germany-madeleine-mccann-suspect-brueckner-71c8fda21230943f80a8d4184747ca87,2024-10-08T09:07:41Z,"BRAUNSCHWEIG, Germany (AP) -- A German court on Tuesday acquitted a man who is also under investigation in the 2007 disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann in a trial on charges of unrelated sexual offenses.

The Braunschweig state court acquitted the 47-year-old German national, who has been identified by local media as Christian Brueckner, of two counts of rape and two of sexual abuse.

However, Brueckner will remain in prison another year because he is still serving a seven-year sentence for rape in a different case, German news agency dpa reported.

Brueckner had been on trial since February over offenses he is alleged to have committed in Portugal between 2000 and 2017. Defense lawyers had pointed to what they labeled a lack of evidence and witnesses who weren't credible, and suggested he might not have been charged if he hadn't also been a suspect in the McCann case.

Prosecutors had argued he should be given a 15-year prison sentence and kept in preventive detention once he has served it.

The verdict can be appealed, dpa reported.

Brueckner has not been charged in the McCann case, in which he is under investigation on suspicion of murder. He spent many years in Portugal, including in the resort of Praia da Luz around the time of Madeleine's disappearance there in 2007. He has denied any involvement in her disappearance.

He is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2019 by the Braunschweig court for the rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal in 2005.

The Braunschweig state court has jurisdiction because Brueckner had his last German residence in that city in Lower Saxony."
Netflix series explores women's dreams in the body-slamming world of Japanese pro wrestling,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/netflix-japan-wrestling-matsumoto-women-entertainment-ad6bc62a6bda08470b0d84381520d87c,2024-10-08T05:43:26Z,"TOKYO (AP) -- ""The Queen of Villains"" is a typical coming-of-age tale about a young woman's road to empowerment and self-discovery -- except it all takes place in the body-slamming, arm-twisting world of Japanese professional wrestling.

The Netflix series, which began airing last month, tells the story of Dump Matsumoto, a real-life wrestling legend from the 1980s who grew up poor with a father who was often absent or abusive.

Matsumoto grew up angry, she said, and went on to create in her wrestling persona a ferocious, almost camp villain character, known in the sport as a ""heel,"" complete with outlandish Kabuki-like facial makeup, chains, sticks and a grotesque scowl. She loomed large as a symbol of fearless and defiant womanhood.

""I gave it my all to be evil,"" Matsumoto said.

A hefty woman with a friendly smile, Matsumoto makes a point even now to adamantly deny that she was ever a nice person or acknowledge that many people in Japan, especially women, love her.

""I still beat people up in matches. I stuck forks in them and made them bleed,"" she said, adding, ""All the people who pretend to be good are the truly evil ones.""

""The Queen of Villains"" follows the friendship between Matsumoto and Chigusa Nagayo of the popular wrestling tag team known as the Crush Gals. Nagayo served as an adviser, trainer and choreographer for the series' dramatized wrestling scenes.

Japanese professional wrestling fans still talk about the matches between Matsumoto and the Crush Gals, including the ones they fought in the U.S.

The actresses in the series spent two years training for their roles. They gained weight and muscle, and learned techniques like the ""giant swing,"" in which a wrestler grabs her opponent's legs and moves in a dizzying circle, or the ""flying knee kick,"" which involves a jump and kick to the body while airborne.

The trick in professional wrestling is to execute the punches and body slams convincingly but in a controlled way to avoid serious injuries. A wrestler also must know how to fall properly.

One key fight scene took a month to film as the actors went over each move, again and again.

""Dump played a role to be hated by the entire nation,"" said Yuriyan Retriever, a professional comedian who stars as Matsumoto in the series.

""Previously, there was a limit, maybe even unintentionally, beyond which I couldn't go. But when I played Dump, all those emotions had to come out and be expressed,"" she said.

She felt like she was no longer playing a role, she said, but that she had become Dump Matsumoto.

""It's frightening to be hated, and I don't think anyone wants to be hated,"" Retriever said.

""When I finished a cut, I was crying. And my body was shaking. I can't express it in words, but I understood all the pressures Dump must have felt.""

The series not only presents a women-beating-the-odds story against a backdrop of sexism and abusive management but it also captures the postwar period of the Showa-era in a way that feels authentic. The scenes used thousands of extras, many of them serious wrestling fans.

Some viewers say the real-life wrestling was more intense than the dramatized version in the new series.

Rionne McAvoy, an Australian filmmaker who as a professional wrestler was hit with a stick by Matsumoto, said: ""The actors often fail to capture the intensity, grit and charisma required for these roles.""

But for most viewers, it's real enough and heartbreaking.

""This is an eternal but emotional story portraying ordinary girls who passionately pursued a dream, found friendship and also themselves,"" director Kazuya Shiraishi said.

""It gave me a chance to reflect on my own 15-year filmmaking career, what I truly want to be, what kind of films I want to make. I just wanted to tell their story, which is also everyone's story."""
Browns QB Deshaun Watson settles latest civil lawsuit brought by woman claiming sexual assault,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/deshaun-watson-browns-lawsuit-6a0b8080f26ca12da9bcc9c9fc1b58ca,2024-10-08T01:56:12Z,"CLEVELAND (AP) -- Cleveland Browns quarterback Deshaun Watson has resolved the latest civil lawsuit filed against him by a woman claiming sexual assault and battery.

The plaintiff's lawyer, Tony Buzbee, said in a text message to The Associated Press on Monday night that his client's claim against Watson has been settled confidentially.

Buzbee had threatened to have his client speak to the NFL, which had opened an investigation against Watson. It's not yet known if Watson will face any further discipline from the league.

A league spokesman declined comment in an email to AP.

The QB was suspended for the first 11 games in 2022 for violating the league's personal conduct policy after more than two dozen women accused him of sexual assault and inappropriate conduct during massage therapy sessions.

Watson was also fined $5 million and had to undergo mandatory evaluation before he was reinstated by the league.

The new lawsuit was filed on Sept. 9 in Harris County, Texas. The unidentified woman alleged Watson had sexually assaulted her in 2020 while on a dinner date in her apartment. She was seeking damages in excess of $1 million.

Watson, who in his third season with Cleveland after being acquired in a controversial trade from Houston, had strongly denied the allegations.

The 29-year-old has previously settled nearly two dozen civil lawsuits.

Watson's career with Cleveland has not gone like he or the team had hoped after the Browns signed him to a $230 million contract. He made just six starts last season before fracturing a bone in his right shoulder during a game and undergoing surgery.

He's struggled in the Browns' new offense this season to the point that coach Kevin Stefanski was asked after a loss on Sunday against Washington if he will bench Watson, who has yet to throw for 200 yards in a game this season.

Stefanski said he's sticking with the QB and reiterated that during a Zoom call on Monday."

David Paterson and his stepson, police said.

Paterson, 70, and his stepson, Anthony Sliwa, 20, were attacked around 8:30 p.m. Friday while they were walking in Manhattan's Upper East Side. They were treated for minor injuries, police said.

The 40-year-old man arrested Monday was charged with gang assault and assault, a police spokesperson said, while the 34-year-old woman was charged with gang assault. It was not clear whether they had attorneys who could speak for them.

Their arrests came after two boys aged 12 and 13 were arrested Saturday on gang assault charges in the attack.

Describing the assault at a a news conference Saturday afternoon, Paterson said he and Sliwa had fought off a group of people after Sliwa quarreled with some of the attackers earlier in the evening.

""I got punched in the face a couple times and I got punched in the shoulder,"" Paterson said, according to the Daily News.

Paterson said he suffered bruises and some pain to his head. Sliwa, also battered and bruised, received a cut lip that required five stitches, Paterson said.

Paterson, a Democrat, served as governor from 2008 to 2010, assuming the post after Gov. Eliot Spitzer resigned in a scandal involving sex workers.

Paterson was New York's first and so far only Black governor.

It was unclear how many additional suspects were being sought Monday."

She was 91.

Houston died Monday morning in her New Jersey home while under hospice care for Alzheimer's disease, her daughter-in-law Pat Houston told The Associated Press. The acclaimed gospel singer was surrounded by her family.

""Our hearts are filled with pain and sadness. We loss the matriarch of our family,"" Pat Houston said in a statement. She said her mother-in-law's contributions to popular music and culture are ""unparalleled.""

""Mother Cissy has been a strong and towering figure in our lives. A woman of deep faith and conviction, who cared greatly about family, ministry, and community. Her more than seven-decade career in music and entertainment will remain at the forefront of our hearts.""

Houston was in the well-known vocal group, the Sweet Inspirations, with Doris Troy and her niece Dee Dee Warrick. The group sang backup for a variety of soul singers including Otis Redding, Lou Rawls, The Drifters and Dionne Warwick.

The Sweet Inspirations appeared on Van Morrison's ""Brown Eyed Girl"" and sang background vocals for The Jimi Hendrix Experience on the song ""Burning of the Midnight Lamp"" in 1967. In the same year, Houston worked on Franklin's classic ""Ain't No Way.""

Houston's last performance with the Sweet Inspirations came after the group hit the stage with Presley in a Las Vegas show in 1969. Her final recording session with the group turned into their biggest R&B hit ""(Gotta Find) A Brand New Lover"" a composition by the production team of Gamble & Huff, who appeared on the group's fifth album, ""Sweet Sweet Soul.""

During that time, the group occasionally performed live concert dates with Franklin. After the group's success and four albums together, Houston left The Sweet Inspirations to pursue a solo career where she flourished.

Houston became an in-demand session singer and recorded more than 600 songs in multiple genres throughout her career. Her vocals can heard on tracks alongside a wide range of artists including Chaka Khan, Donny Hathaway, Jimi Hendrix, Luther Vandross, Beyoncé, Paul Simon, Roberta Flack and her daughter.

In 1971, Houston's signature vocals were featured on Burt Bacharach's solo album, which includes ""Mexican Divorce,"" ""All Kinds of People"" and ""One Less Bell to Answer."" She performed various standards including Barbra Streisand's hit song, ""Evergreen.""

Houston won Grammys for her albums ""Face to Face"" in 1997 and ""He Leadeth Me"" the following year in the best traditional soul gospel album category.

Houston authored three books: ""He Leadeth Me,"" ""How Sweet The Sound: My Life with God and Gospel"" and ""Remembering Whitney: A Mother's Story of Life, Loss and The Night The Music Stopped.""

In 1938, Cissy Houston started her career when she joined her sister Anne and brothers Larry and Nicky to form the gospel group, The Drinkard Four, who recorded one album. She attended New Hope Baptist Church, where she later become Minister of Sacred Music.

Houston was the youngest of eight children.

""We are touched by your generous support, and your outpouring of love during our profound time of grief,"" Houston said on behalf of the family. ""We respectfully request our privacy during this difficult time."""
Thousands survived a brutal gang attack in Haiti that killed 70. Now they face an uncertain future,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/haiti-gang-attack-pontsonde-3611fcb55c88ec2b213ab8f8c5f4ec1b,2024-10-07T17:46:05Z,"PONT-SONDÉ, Haiti (AP) -- Under the cover of night, dozens of gang members crept toward the small town of Pont-Sondé in central Haiti armed with knives and assault rifles as families slept.

The gang had traveled from nearby Savien in vehicles they ditched halfway through the trip, climbing into canoes for the last stretch for a quiet approach.

Gunfire and screams woke the town. Those not shot dead were stabbed. Fires consumed homes.

""They tried to murder everyone,"" said Jina Joseph, who survived.

The Gran Grif gang killed babies and young mothers, older people and entire families, angry that a self-defense group had tried to limit gang activity in Pont-Sondé and prevent it from making money off a makeshift toll it had recently established on a nearby road.

The gang escaped by foot through nearby rice fields after Thursday's attack, leaving more than 70 bodies strewn through the town.

It was the biggest massacre that Haiti's once peaceful central region had seen in recent history. Thousands now face an uncertain future, stripped of their jobs, homes and families.

Jameson Fermilus, who had crouched in a corridor next to his house as smoke and gunfire filled the air, later joined more than 6,000 other survivors who walked for hours, seeking safety.

""We don't know what we are going to do,"" said another who joined them, 60-year-old Sonise Morino. ""We have nowhere to go.""

Thousands walked west to the coastal city of Saint-Marc. Days after the massacre, a crowd of men, women and children gathered around a Good Samaritan standing atop his car distributing food and drink.

The newly homeless crowded into a church, a school and a public plaza shaded by trees. Those lucky enough to receive food sat on a dusty curb and ate. At night, they curled up on concrete floors and tried to sleep.

""These deaths are unimaginable,"" Mayor Myriam Fièvre said as she met with survivors.

A majority of the 6,270 people left homeless have found temporary shelter with relatives who live nearby, according to the U.N.'s International Organization for Migration.

But more than 750 others have nowhere to go, joining the over 700,000 people already left homeless in recent years by gang violence across Haiti.

Inside the school serving as a temporary shelter, one mother leaned against a chalkboard, slowly patting the back of her sleeping baby as she stared into the distance.

Massacres of the Pont-Sondé magnitude were once unheard of in Haiti's central region despite a recent increase in gang violence. Such massacres had been reported only in the capital of Port-au-Prince, 80% of which is under gang control.

But things changed when former legislator Prophane Victor began arming young men nearly a decade ago to secure his election and control the area. That led to the creation of the Gran Grif gang, which controls Savien, Pont-Sondé and other places in the Artibonite region, according to the U.N.

Victor and the Gran Grif leader, Luckson Elan, were sanctioned by the U.S. last month. Elan also was sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council, which noted that Gran Grif ""is the largest and most powerful"" gang in Artibonite, committing nine mass kidnappings from October 2023 to January 2024, including that of 157 people.

During that time, Elan killed a woman for refusing to have sex with him, the U.N. said.

The gang, whose name means ""Big Claw,"" also has some of the highest levels of child recruitment in Haiti, according to the U.N.

Gran Grif is one of at least 20 criminal groups that operate in Artibonite, where much of Haiti's rice and other crops are produced. More than 22,000 people have been forced to flee in recent years as gunmen target farmers and steal crops and livestock, according to the U.N., which has called authorities' response ""inadequate and inconsistent.""

In an interview Monday, Romain Le Cour, senior expert on Haiti for the Global Initiative Against Transnational Organized Crime, said he worried about the effects last week's massacre might have on other gangs despite a new U.N.-backed mission operating in Haiti.

""It's a message sent: That they're more powerful than the others and that they're ready to use brutal force against the people to make sure that their territorial power and economic control remain untouched,"" he said.

Le Cour noted that Haitian National Police and the mission led by Kenyan police are struggling as they operate in Port-au-Prince alone.

""It's going to be even harder to open multiple battlefronts,"" he said. ""It's a massive challenge for the government right now.""

Since the massacre, Haiti's government has deployed armored vehicles, elite police officers and medical supplies to Pont-Sondé and Saint-Marc and Prime Minister Garry Conille visited the lone hospital, overwhelmed with injured patients.

On Monday morning, police were still trying to access areas of Pont-Sondé while members of the self-defense group who remained in the town declined to talk. The normally bustling main street remained largely empty. Gunfire rang out in the distance."
Georgia Supreme Court halts ruling striking down state's near-ban on abortions as the state appeals,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-abortion-ban-967ed4f8efe64d07e22213c47749df9a,2024-10-07T17:15:01Z,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- The Georgia Supreme Court on Monday halted a ruling striking down the state's near-ban on abortions while it considers the state's appeal.

The high court's order came a week after a judge found that Georgia unconstitutionally prohibits abortions beyond about six weeks of pregnancy, often before women realize they're pregnant. Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled Sept. 30 that privacy rights under Georgia's state constitution include the right to make personal healthcare decisions.

It was one of a wave of restrictive abortion laws passed in Republican-controlled states after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade in 2022 and ended a national right to abortion. It prohibited most abortions once a ""detectable human heartbeat"" was present. At around six weeks into a pregnancy, cardiac activity can be detected by ultrasound in an embryo's cells that will eventually become the heart.

Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed it in 2019, but it didn't take effect until Roe v. Wade fell.

McBurney wrote in his ruling that ""liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.""

""When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then -- and only then -- may society intervene,"" McBurney wrote.

The judge's decision rolled back abortion limits in Georgia to a prior law allowing abortions until viability, roughly 22 to 24 weeks into a pregnancy.

""Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge,"" Kemp said in a statement in response to McBurney's decision. ""Protecting the lives of the most vulnerable among us is one of our most sacred responsibilities, and Georgia will continue to be a place where we fight for the lives of the unborn.""

Abortion providers and advocates in Georgia had applauded McBurney's ruling, but expressed concern that it would soon be overturned."
Book Review: 'The Book of George' is a witty novel in lively episodes like a first-rate TV sitcom,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/george-book-kate-greathead-review-ab542390f617d2ab96095d8bcb3ff640,2024-10-07T17:08:09Z,"""The Book of George"" is a novel of many finely crafted, often funny moments that arrive episodically as the title character grows older. At first he's a millennial kid, then a college guy as the Twin Towers fall on 9/11.

In time George -- he's given no surname -- graduates and struggles over what to do with the rest of his life. Fate actually treats him pretty well. He's an attractive, smart New Yorker; his family has some money; and he's often quite lucky.

But you wouldn't know it from his clownish, sour, perplexed, defeatist attitude. He's self-absorbed and self-disparaging, lovable and devilish -- the list could go on.

The novel's author, Kate Greathead, is a gifted storyteller who reels off dialogue filled with wit and humor so well it makes page-turning a pleasure and ""The Book of George"" an easy read.

But just as the indecisive George doesn't know where he is going in life, the reader doesn't know where his story is going either. Getting there, in a way, is the point.

George groans inwardly at the vacuous ""sitcom-level banter"" that comes easily to him in conversation. Greathead is deft at dishing out such dialogue, too, and chapter after chapter, as George ages and a variety of crises large and small arise, this episodic novel seems a form of first-rate TV sitcom between covers.

George would be glad to call it ""the show about nothing,"" similar to ""Seinfeld."" Then he would cancel it.

Choosing philosophy as his college major, George writes his thesis on Arthur Schopenhauer, a 19th-century philosopher often seen as deeply pessimistic, much like George himself. Greathead, in the book's epigraph, quotes from an 1807 letter written by Johanna Schopenhauer to her 19-year-old son, Arthur, whom she says could be ""a credit to human society"" but is nevertheless ""irritating and unbearable.""

George's own mother, Ellen, couldn't have said it better.

After graduating, George eventually decides to become a writer. He starts a novel, but agonizes over the point of it. Early on, George says the book is ""about a boy who grows up to be a man who is disappointed by life."" The book shifts gears over time. It's title, finally, is ""All For Naught.""

George may be a doom-and-gloom sort, but that's not the case for Greathead's novel. Page after page, her writing is full of humor built around prickly sarcasm and woebegone twists in George's life.

There are serious, even sad, moments, plus plot turns that give the narrative depth. The reader may begin to feel an emotional tug. Jenny, a young woman who falls in love with George, lives with him for long, often agonizing stretches. They hit midlife as the pandemic hits the country, and Jenny brings real poignancy to the story."
Jury selection begins in murder trial of Minnesota man accused of killing his girlfriend,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/adam-fravel-madeline-kingsbury-murder-trial-missing-minnesota-woman-afbd472ac9bf8b63c080a1e1a7f5a09a,2024-10-07T16:33:18Z,"MANKATO, Minn. (AP) -- Jury selection begins Monday in the murder trial of the former boyfriend of a Minnesota woman whose body was found hidden in a rural area of the state in 2023.

Adam Fravel, 30, has been charged with first-degree murder. He was arrested in June, 2023, days after deputies found the body of Madeline Kingsbury in a wooded area a few miles away from a property owned by Fravel's parents. The 26-year-old Kingsbury vanished in March, 2023, after dropping off her and Fravel's two young children at day care in Winona, a southeastern Minnesota town of about 26,000 residents.

Kingsbury's disappearance garnered national attention and thousands of people joined in the search for her. Police said they investigated hundreds of tips and that digital evidence, including phone and computer records, helped lead to the discovery of the body. Fravel continues to maintain his innocence.

Prosecutors expect jury selection to last several days. Opening arguments could begin as soon as Oct. 14 if the jury selection doesn't take longer than expected. A judge granted a request from Fravel's attorneys to have the case moved out of Winona, where many members of community helped search for Kingsbury. The trial will instead take place in Mankato, about 136 miles (219 kilometers) from Winona.

A criminal complaint said that after a friend reported Kingsbury missing, Fravel told police that they had recently decided to separate and she was seeing someone else. Investigators believe Fravel had financially relied on Kingsbury and killed her after she told him she planned to move out of the home they shared. The complaint said a friend of Kingsbury had seen Fravel be violent with her.

Fravel's attorneys argue the case against him is circumstantial, citing no murder weapon or direct witness to the crime, according to the Minnesota Star Tribune. They've also argued much of the testimony against him is hearsay.

Authorities said Kingsbury's body was found in a gray fitted bed sheet that had been closed with black Gorilla tape. An autopsy report said Kingsbury died of ""homicidal violence,"" but it did not contain additional details."
"Guster, Avett Brothers and Florence Welch are helping bring alt-rock to the musical theater stage",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/alt-rock-broadway-guster-safety-not-guaranteed-fa373c914f03f76b024d9b2d5b6e6fe9,2024-10-07T15:14:18Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Ryan Miller, lead singer of alternative rock band Guster, has a new gig that even he's a little surprised about: Musical theater songwriter. He laughs that he's gone all Broadway.

""I just went full-into the ballpit -- just, like, face-first, take-me-wherever-this-is-going,"" he said before a recent rehearsal of his bright new musical ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" at Brooklyn Academy of Music.

Miller is part of a growing trend of alt-rockers bringing a new sound to the space carved out by giants like Stephen Sondheim and Andrew Lloyd Webber.

The Avett Brothers are about to have ""Swept Away"" land on Broadway, Florence + The Machine frontwoman Florence Welch is working on a musical about ""The Great Gatsby"" and Jack Antonoff is scoring ""Romeo & Juliet."" Radiohead's Thom Yorke is laboring on ""Hamlet Hail to the Thief,"" a mashup of Shakespeare's ""Hamlet"" and his band's music.

Arcade Fire's Will Butler is fresh off the success of the Tony-winning play ""Stereophonic,"" Sufjan Stevens songs found a place on Broadway last season with ""Illinoise"" and the folk-rock band Jamestown Revival is fueling the reigning best new musical, ""The Outsiders.""

""There seems to be a wave and we're kind of catching it at a good time,"" says Miller. ""It felt like there was already some soil that was being laid that I wouldn't have to break down.""

Tony Award-winning producer John Johnson, who is helping create that wave by backing the musicals ""Swept Away,"" ""Stereophonic"" and ""Safety Not Guaranteed,"" says the change reflects the rise of tastes of Millennials and Gen-X.

If, before the pandemic, the standard theatergoer was a suburban woman in her 60s, she's being replaced by folks in their 30s to 50s from chic neighborhoods in Manhattan and Brooklyn, as well as bedroom communities in New Jersey like Maplewood and South Orange.

""We're kind of following the path of the generational shift in the audience that's happening right now,"" Johnson says, adding that these new theater-goers ""are open to new stories, new voices, as well as the voices that they grew up with.""

Alt-rock has been heard on Broadway before, of course, with shows like Duncan Sheik's ""Spring Awakening,"" and Alanis Morissette's ""Jagged Little Pill,"" but rare is a cluster like theater is enjoying now.

Scott Avett, lead vocalist and multi-instrumentalist for the Avett Brothers, has watched as his 2004 album ""Mignonette"" -- based on a book about men adrift for days in the middle of the ocean -- finds a new life on stage.

""It's surreal, for sure,"" he says. ""The blooming of the story with the songs and the concept has been very surreal,"" adding: ""It feels like quite flattering and affirming.""

The songs have been wedded to a story by John Logan and the Avetts wrote one song specifically for the show, ""Lord Lay Your Hand On My Shoulder.""

The leap to Broadway, in one way, isn't that strange for the Americana band, who have always written narrative-driven and character-based songs.

""Show tunes are like the longing coming from somebody that then is exaggerated to the stage,"" says Avett. ""We grew up projecting that from a smaller place.""

If ""Swept Away"" began as a book that became an album, ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" started life as a 2012 sci-fi comedy starring Aubrey Plaza, who played one of a trio of journalists hunting whoever placed an intriguing classified ad: ""Wanted: Someone to go back in time with me. This is not a joke,"" it reads. ""Must bring your own weapons. Safety not guaranteed.""

Aside from the time-travel silliness, the film and musical is about the fading dreams of aspiring professionals in their 20s and 30s who see diminished opportunities and want to go back to the comfort of the past.

Miller initially had no intentions of making musical theater. When not touring with his four-piece band, he scores films, appears on podcasts and even starred in his own PBS series. Broadway or Broadway-adjacent didn't appeal.

Miller, who lives in Vermont, was simply turned off by the sheer amount of time it usually took: Fellow Vermont creators Anaïs Mitchell's ""Hadestown"" took 14 years and Trey Anastasio's ""Hands on a Hardbody"" took 10 years and closed after less than a month.

But Miller found himself gradually sucked in and enjoying a timeline that was accelerated. He was originally asked just to attend a workshop performance of ""Safety Not Guaranteed"" studded with Guster songs -- basically, a Guster jukebox -- and loved it. ""Have I just been like a closeted theater kid my whole life?"" he asked himself.

Soon he was writing original songs for it. He was a natural, since he had scored the film, knew the characters and the emotional beats. He wrote five new stage songs in a month and sent them to book writer Nick Blaemire.

""I remember after I finished that fifth song, I sent it to Nick, I was like, 'Man, really fell in love with this.' Like something happened and I'm going to be really bummed if I don't get to just see it once.'""

Miller then went on a writing tear, offering some 15 new songs in place of the Guster ones. ""This was the rule: I was like, 'Just let me beat it. If I don't beat it, we'll all know and that's it.'""

One new song -- ""I Wanna Go Back"" -- shows Miller clearly having fun, with the lyrics: ""We're losing our hair/It doesn't seem fair/All the best of our days are behind us and gone/Xbox/cheap buzz/tan lines/peach fuzz.""

Only three Guster songs -- including ""One Man Wrecking Machine"" -- made the cut. The rest are from Miller, who relished the storytellers' task of creating songs specifically tailored for the characters and moments.

""It's been like, one of the greatest thrills, I think, of my artistic career to have been brought/stumbled/actively weaseled my way into this world. And I'm totally smitten,"" he says.

More and more alt-rockers may follow, attracted by the chance to show their multi-hyphenate-ness and the constancy. No matter how successful a rock band is, life on the road means one or two nights in a city; a stage show, on the other hand, is more like a residency.

Miller says he's also embraced the narrowness of the role. When he's writing for Guster, the song can be about anything. When he wrote for ""Safety Not Guaranteed,"" the songs had clear guidelines.

""Having limitations actually really is a very compelling, very inspirational way because it can't just be everything. It's got to be within,"" he says. ""I call them sandboxes. I love a sandbox to play in and I love limitations."""
Supreme Court rejects appeal from Texas officer convicted in killing of woman through her window,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-atatiana-jefferson-police-fatal-shooting-4408f3f64ee2eda25fad89ac6145bf1c,2024-10-07T14:07:38Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court won't hear an appeal from a former Texas police officer convicted in the death of a woman who was shot through a window of her home.

Aaron Dean was convicted of manslaughter in Atatiana Jefferson's fatal shooting, and he was sentenced to nearly 12 years in prison. Dean was originally charged with murder. He argued on appeal that prosecutors should not have been allowed to ask the jury to consider the lesser charge at the end of the trial.

Dean, who is white, shot Jefferson, a 28-year-old Black woman, on Oct. 12, 2019, after a neighbor called a nonemergency police line to report that the front door to Jefferson's home was open.

It later emerged that Jefferson and her nephew had left the doors open to vent smoke after he had burned hamburgers, and the two were up late playing video games.

Dean's guilty verdict was a rare conviction of an officer for killing someone who was also armed with a gun.

During the trial, the primary dispute was whether Dean knew Jefferson was armed. Dean testified that he saw her weapon. Prosecutors said the evidence showed otherwise.

Body camera footage showed that Dean and a second officer who responded to the call did not identify themselves as police at the house. Dean and the other officer testified that they thought the house might have been burglarized and they quietly moved into the fenced-off backyard looking for signs of forced entry.

There, Dean, whose gun was drawn, fired a single shot through the window a moment after shouting at Jefferson, who was inside, to show her hands.

Jefferson' nephew testified that she took out her gun because she believed there was an intruder in the backyard."
Supreme Court lets stand a decision barring emergency abortions that violate Texas ban,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/supreme-court-emergency-abortion-texas-bf79fafceba4ab9df9df2489e5d43e72,2024-10-07T13:47:42Z,"Without detailing their reasoning, the justices kept in place a lower court order that said hospitals cannot be required to provide pregnancy terminations that would violate Texas law.

The Biden administration had asked the justices to throw out the lower court order, arguing that hospitals have to perform abortions in emergency situations under federal law. The administration pointed to the Supreme Court's action in a similar case from Idaho earlier this year in which the justices narrowly allowed emergency abortions to resume while a lawsuit continues.

The administration also cited a Texas Supreme Court ruling that said doctors do not have to wait until a woman's life is in immediate danger to provide an abortion legally. The administration said it brings Texas in line with federal law and means the lower court ruling is not necessary.

Texas asked the justices to leave the order in place, saying the state Supreme Court ruling meant Texas law, unlike Idaho's, does have an exception for the health of a pregnant patient and there's no conflict between federal and state law."
A woman goes on trial in Sweden for war crimes over allegedly abusing Yazidis in Syria,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/sweden-islamic-state-yazidi-women-5cd4321bb5f97d5d9d8dd5c7be7e25ed,2024-10-07T09:28:28Z,"COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) -- A 52-year-old woman associated with the Islamic State group went on trial on Monday in Sweden on charges of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes against Yazidi women and children in Syria.

Lina Laina Ishaq, who is a Swedish citizen, is accused of committing the crimes during the period from August 2014 to December 2016 in the Syrian city of Raqqa, which at the time was the seat of the militant group's self-proclaimed caliphate and home to about 300,000 people.

The trial marks the first time that IS attacks against the Yazidis, one of Iraq's oldest religious minorities, have been tried in Sweden. The hearings are expected to last about two months, most of them behind closed doors.

The crimes took place under IS rule in Raqqa, where Ishaq was living at the time.

Under IS rule, Yazidi women and children were ""regarded as property and subjected to being traded as slaves, sexual slavery, forced labor, deprivation of liberty and extrajudicial executions,"" prosecutor Reena Devgun said when the charges were made public last month.

The prosecution says that at her home in Raqqa, Ishaq abused Yazidis with the aim to ""completely or partially annihilate the Yazidi ethnic group,"" Devgun said as the trial opened at the Stockholm District Court, the Swedish TT news agency said.

The charge sheet, obtained by The Associated Press, says Ishaq is suspected of holding nine people, including children, for up to seven months, treated them as slaves and also abused several of those she held captive.

Ishaq, who denies wrongdoing, is also accused of having molested a baby, said to have been 1 month old at the time, by holding a hand over the child's mouth when he screamed to silence him. She is also suspected of having sold people to IS, knowing they risked being killed or subjected to serious sexual abuse.

The Islamic State group abducted Yazidi women and children and brought them to Syria in 2014, when IS militants stormed Yazidi towns and villages in Iraq's Sinjar region. Women were forced into sexual slavery, and boys were taken to be indoctrinated in jihadi ideology.

Three years later, when the Islamic State's reign began to collapse, Ishaq fled from Raqqa and was captured by Syrian Kurdish troops.

She managed to escape to Turkey where she was arrested with her son and two other children she had given birth to in the meantime with an IS foreign fighter from Tunisia. She was later extradited to Sweden.

Ishaq was earlier convicted in Sweden and sentenced to three years in prison for taking her 2-year-old son to Syria in 2014, to an area then controlled by IS. She had claimed that at the time, she had told the child's father that she and the boy were only going on a holiday to Turkey. However, once in Turkey, the two crossed into Syria and into IS-run territory.

Ishaq who already is in prison, was identified through information from a U.N. team investigating atrocities in Iraq, known as UNITAD."
Middle East latest: Palestinian militants in Gaza fire 4 rockets into Israel as mourners mark Oct 7,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hezbollah-hamas-latest-mideast-7-october-2024-d3d272d83e70d420ba547dbd7e09ef52,2024-10-07T05:58:18Z,"Palestinian militants in Gaza fired four rockets into Israel on Monday as mourners marked the anniversary of the Oct. 7 attack, without disrupting a nearby ceremony.

Hamas also said it attacked Israeli forces in different parts of Gaza.

The Israeli military said three rockets were intercepted and a fourth fell in an open area. There were no reports of casualties or damage.

The military said it launched a wave of artillery and airstrikes overnight and into Monday to thwart what it said was an imminent attack. It said it targeted Hamas launch posts and underground militant infrastructure.

The fighting on the anniversary underscored the militants' resilience in the face of a devastating Israeli offensive that has killed around 42,000 Palestinians, according to local medical officials. It has also destroyed large areas of Gaza and displaced around 90% of its population.

Hamas-led militants blew holes in Israel's security fence and stormed into nearby army bases and farming communities in a surprise attack one year ago, killing some 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and abducting another 250. They are still holding around 100 captives inside Gaza, a third of whom are believed to be dead.

Israel is now at war with Hamas in Gaza and its ally Hezbollah in Lebanon. It has also vowed to strike Iran in response to a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week.

Here is The Latest:

RE'IM, Israel -- Hundreds of families and friends of people killed at the Nova music festival gathered Monday at the site of the attack, where nearly 400 were gunned down during Hamas' Oct. 7 assault.

Families gathered around photos of their loved ones, which were arranged in a semicircle around what was the DJ stage. Many lit candles and added mementos or photos, crying and embracing. Overhead, army helicopters circled and constant booms echoed across the area, causing many to flinch.

""We can't understand how a year has passed,"" said Shimon Busika, whose son, Yarden, 25, was killed at the festival. ""It's the most natural place to be, to be here for this moment of silence,"" he said.

Busika said it took them a long time, piecing together testimony from other survivors, to understand what happened in Yarden's last moments. They now know he was killed around 9:20 near a yellow container at the festival where many others were killed, and they will hold a second minute of silence there at the moment he was killed.

The last sounds of the trance track that was playing at the Nova site on Oct. 7 one year ago stopped abruptly, as hundreds of family members and friends of the more than 300 victims stood in a moment of silence. One woman's piercing wail broke the silence as booms echoed from the fighting in Gaza, just a few kilometers (miles) away.

JAKARTA, Indonesia -- Twenty Indonesian nationals and a Lebanese evacuated from Lebanon arrived in Jakarta on a commercial flight early Monday and will likely be followed by 20 more in the afternoon, officials said.

President Joko Widodo has called to prioritize the evacuation of Indonesians in Lebanon as hostilities between Israel and Hezbollah escalate and fears of a wider regional war in the Middle East grow.

""I have directed the foreign affairs minister to take immediate action to ensure the safety and protection of our citizens and expedite their evacuation,"" Widodo said last week.

Indonesia's Embassy in Beirut had prepared evacuation procedures for citizens as part of its contingency planning since August. The Embassy evacuated 25 Indonesian citizens who returned safely to Indonesia last month, said Judha Nugraha, Director of Indonesian Citizen Protection at the Foreign Affairs Ministry.

There are 116 registered Indonesian citizens in Lebanon, most of them students, migrant workers and people married to Lebanese nationals. Many of them have chosen to remain there for various reasons, Nugraha said.

CANBERRA, Australia -- Australia's Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in a statement Monday that the day carried ""terrible pain"" and his government ""unequivocally"" condemned Hamas' attack on Israel a year ago.

Hamas militants stormed from the blockaded Gaza Strip into nearby Israeli towns on Oct. 7 a year ago, killing dozens and abducting others in an unprecedented surprise attack.

Albanese said that since the attack, Jewish Australians have ""felt the cold shadows of antisemitism reaching into the present day -- and as a nation we say never again.""

""We unequivocally condemn all prejudice and hatred. There is no place in Australia for discrimination against people of any faith,"" Albanese said.

He added that ""every innocent life matters"" and the number of civilians killed in the conflict was ""a devastating tragedy.""

""Today we reflect on the truth of our shared humanity, of the hope that peace is possible, and the belief that it belongs to all people,"" Albanese said.

BEIRUT -- A new round of airstrikes hit Beirut suburbs late Sunday as Israel intensified its bombardment of northern Gaza and southern Lebanon. Palestinian officials said a strike on a mosque in Gaza killed at least 19 people.

Rocket sirens and blasts were heard in Haifa in northern Israel late Sunday, and Hezbollah claimed the attack. Israel's military said at least five projectiles were identified coming from Lebanon and ""fallen projectiles"" were found in the area. The military showed what appeared to be rubble along a street. The Magen David Adom ambulance service said it was treating a teen with shrapnel injuries to the head and a man who fell from a window due to a blast.

A year after Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, Israel has opened a new front in Lebanon against Hezbollah, which has traded fire with Israel along the border since the war in Gaza began. Israel also has vowed to strike Iran after a ballistic missile attack on Israel last week."
South Korean woman sues government and adoption agency after her kidnapped daughter was sent abroad,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-adoption-lawsuit-children-holt-593945988001c509943e5c6266885878,2024-10-07T05:47:32Z,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- A 70-year-old South Korean woman sued her government, an adoption agency, and an orphanage Monday over the adoption of her daughter, who was sent to the United States in 1976, months after she was kidnapped at age 4.

The damage suit filed by Han Tae-soon, whose story was part of an Associated Press investigation published last month, could ignite further debate on the dubious child-gathering practices and widespread falsification of paperwork that tarnished South Korea's adoption program, which annually sent thousands of kids to the West during the 1970-80s.

It was the first known case of a Korean birth parent suing for damages against the government and an adoption agency over the wrongful adoption of their child, said Kim Soo-jung, one of the lawyers representing Han.

Han searched for her daughter, Laurie Bender, for more than 40 years before they reunited through DNA testing in 2019. Speaking to reporters in front of the Seoul Central District Court, Han argued that the South Korean government was responsible for failing to prevent the adoption of Bender.

Han had reported to police that her daughter was missing and desperately searched for her, frequently visiting police stations, government offices and adoption agencies and even going on Korean media. She had her daughter's picture displayed everywhere -- in subway stations, on lamp posts, on bags of snacks that advertised missing children, the Korean version of American milk cartons.

Han accuses Holt Children's Services, South Korea's biggest adoption agency, of facilitating Bender's adoption without checking her background. Her lawyers said the Jechon Children's Home made no effort to find the parents after Bender was placed at the facility by police in May 1975, a day after Han reported her as missing.

In her adoption papers, Bender, named Shin Gyeong-ha at birth, is described as an abandoned orphan with no known parents. Under a new Korean name made by the orphanage, Baik Kyong Hwa, she was sent to the United States in February 1976.

""For 44 years, I wandered and searched for my child, but the joy of meeting her was only momentary and now I am in so much pain because we can't communicate in the same language,"" Han said, fighting back tears.

""It turns out they didn't make an effort to find her clearly existing parents and instead disguised her as an orphan for adoption abroad. I want the government and Holt to explain to us how this happened.""

Kim, the lawyer, said the government is at fault for the botched child search that led to Bender's adoption, saying she could have easily been found if missing child information was properly shared between police stations or if officers had tried to search orphanages.

""While the state bears the large responsibility for not fulfilling its duty to help find missing children and reunite them with their families, we also believe that the (orphanage) and adoption agency cannot be spared from responsibility as well,"" Kim said.

""We suspect that these child protection institutions failed to carry out their ethical obligation to help find the child's parents, even when the child was saying (she) had a family and had parents.""

Jeon Min Kyeong, another lawyer representing Han, said she is seeking about 600 million won ($445,000) in damages. The lawsuit lists Han, her husband and two of her younger children as plaintiffs, but not Bender, Jeon said.

South Korea's Justice Ministry, which represents the government in lawsuits, and Holt didn't immediately comment on the suit.

In an earlier interview with AP, Bender said she was approached by a strange woman while playing near her home in the city of Cheongju. She remembers the woman saying her family didn't want her any more because Han had another baby. Distraught, Bender went with the woman, who, after taking her on a train ride, deserted her in Jechon, a city 50 miles away.

After failing to find her daughter for four decades, Han registered her DNA with a nonprofit group called 325 Kamra, which helps Korean adoptees reunite with their families through genetic information. In the United States, Bender took a DNA test because her own daughter was curious about their heritage and 325 Kamra connected them in 2019.

Just weeks after finding her mother, Bender and her daughter flew to Korea to meet Han. Recognizing Bender immediately, Han ran to her, screaming, moaning, running her fingers through Bender's hair.

""It's like a hole in your heart has been healed, you finally feel like a complete person,"" Bender said. ""It's like you've been living a fake life and everything you know is not true.""

The AP investigation, which was also documented by Frontline (PBS), described how the South Korean government, Western nations and adoption agencies worked in tandem to place around 200,000 Korean children in the United States and other Western nations, despite years of evidence that children were being procured through dubious or dishonest means. Western nations ignored these problems and sometimes pressured South Korea to keep the kids coming as they focused on satisfying their huge domestic demands for babies.

In 2019, Adam Crapser became the first Korean adoptee to sue the South Korean government and an adoption agency for damages, accusing them of mishandling his adoption to the United States, where he faced legal troubles after surviving an abusive childhood before being deported in 2016.

After four years of hearings, the Seoul Central District Court last year ordered Crapser's adoption agency, Holt, to pay him 100 million won ($74,000) in damages for failing to inform his adopters they needed to take separate steps to obtain his citizenship after his adoption was approved by a state court.

However, the court dismissed Crapser's accusations against the Korean government over alleged monitoring and due diligence failures. The case is now with the Seoul High Court after both Crapser and Holt appealed.

Tilda Swinton explores assisted suicide in Pedro Almodovar's 'The Room Next Door',AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/tilda-swinton-room-next-door-interview-abc0620a794b0a77c5f61b9b7f985c6f,2024-10-07T04:07:41Z,"TORONTO (AP) -- Although ""The Room Next Door"" is Pedro Almodóvar's first English-language feature, Tilda Swinton notes that he's never written in a language that anyone else truly speaks.

""He writes in Pedro language, and here he is making another film in another version of Pedro language, which just happens to sound a little bit like English,"" Swinton said.

Set in New York, Swinton stars as Martha, a terminally ill woman who chooses to end her life on her own terms. After reconnecting with her friend Ingrid, played by Julianne Moore, Martha persuades her to stay and keep her company before she goes through with her decision.

Beyond the film's narrative, Swinton said she believes individuals should have a say in their own living and dying. She acknowledges that she has personally witnessed a friend's compassionate departure.

""In my own life I had the great good fortune to be asked by someone in Martha's position to be his Ingrid (Julianne Moore),"" Swinton said.

She said that experience shaped her attitude about life and death: ""Not only my capacity to be witness to other people in that situation, but my own living and my own dying.""

Swinton spoke to The Associated Press about ""The Room Next Door,"" Almodóvar and he idea of letting people die on their own terms. Remarks have been edited for clarity and brevity.

SWINTON: I felt really blessed by the opportunity. So many of us have been in the situation Julianne Moore's character finds herself in, being asked to be the witness of someone who is dying. Whether that wanting to orchestrate their own dismount or not, to be in that position to be a witness is something that I've been privileged to experience many times in my life since I was quite young.

SWINTON: It's a really beautiful poem to a possibility of an attitude. I think (my character) Martha's attitude to her own living is really inspiring. I would like to think that this is a really generous proposal and that it might inspire people to just know that it's possible to face their own death with dignity, which is really what we're talking about.

It really is a fool's errand to think we can avoid thinking about death because it's not just unlucky people who get ill or who die. It's an inevitability. And so we might as well, you know, embrace it. And by the way, the more we embrace it, I would suggest the more we will enjoy our living.

SWINTON: There are many countries in the world where it is not criminal to assist somebody's active will to orchestrate their own dying. And in the United States, there are 10 states where it is not criminal, where it's possible for two doctors to assist in the active will of a patient to take charge of their own dying. And it's there are just other places where and New York State, which is where our film is set, is not one of those 10 states. And there are all sorts of people, very wise and very compassionate people, very educated and very enlightened people, in my view, who are actively campaigning to broaden this acceptance.

SWINTON: I'd had a taste of it with short film, ""The Human Voice."" We made it in the middle of COVID. We shot it in nine days. Super, super fast... And I thought that Pedro was working very fast because it was a short film and because we were in the middle of COVID. No, no, that is the way Pedro works. I now discover super, super fast two takes, if you're lucky.

SWINTON: I mean, it really helps always when you know the work of a filmmaker as well as it's possible to know Pedro's work. I've known it since I was a student, and I've loved it always. It's like a country. I love to go to the world of Almodóvar and it's not Spain, it's somewhere else. It's his environment. So, stepping into the frame of a filmmaker who creates that environment is always a bit of a trip.

SWINTON: It's still a bit of a shock to us. When you're in an audience, that's the first indication of whether the souffle has risen or not. Apparently 18-and-a-half minutes is a record when you're standing next to Pedro Almodóvar and you know that that is 18-and-a-half minutes of people really lovingly appreciating him. It pretty much doesn't get much better than that.

SWINTON: Not mine. To be honest, I'm ignorant really, of that in particular. I have other things on my mind. That's like the weather. It's like saying, do you have the weather in three months on your mind? Well, no. Let's wait and see. Let's keep it real. Let's keep it today."
Andy Kim and Curtis Bashaw clash over abortion and immigration in New Jersey Senate debate,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/new-jersey-senate-debate-kim-bashaw-57659eff4ca62c7e581978f0d91561cb,2024-10-07T02:57:18Z,"NUTLEY, N.J. (AP) -- Democratic Rep. Andy Kim and Republican Curtis Bashaw clashed over abortion and immigration Sunday in their first debate for New Jersey's Senate seat, open this year after Bob Menendez's conviction on bribery charges and resignation.

Kim, a three-term representative from the 3rd District, hammered Bashaw for his support of former President Donald Trump and expressed skepticism about Bashaw's position as an abortion rights supporter. Bashaw, a hotel developer from southern New Jersey and first-time candidate, sought to cast himself as a moderate and Kim as a Washington insider.

The debate was briefly derailed at the start when Bashaw stopped speaking mid-sentence and stared ahead, nonresponsive. He was helped from the stage and left the room for roughly 10 minutes.

""I got so worked up about this affordability issue that I realized I hadn't eaten so much food today,"" Bashaw said when he returned. ""So I appreciate your indulgence.""

Among the most pointed exchanges was over abortion. Both candidates support abortion rights, but Bashaw has said he supported the U.S. Supreme Court's decision that ended Roe v. Wade. New Jersey has enshrined abortion protections in state law.

""I just fundamentally have a problem with using the term 'pro-choice' to describe yourself when you have talked about the important of the Dobbs decision being correctly decided,"" Kim said.

He also hammered Bashaw for his support of Trump, who has twice lost New Jersey's electoral votes.

""The one endorsement that he has made is for Donald Trump to be president of the United States,"" Kim said. ""And I guess we get a sense of his judgment from that.""

Bashaw, who defeated a Trump-endorsed rival in the primary, didn't defend the former president explicitly.

""Elections are binary choices, and we all have to make a decision,"" he said.

He touted his own candidacy based on his credentials as a businessperson and resisted being typecast as a traditional Republican, pointing out that he backs abortion rights and is a married gay man.

""I am pro-choice, congressman. I am for freedom in the home,"" Bashaw said. ""I don't think government should tell me who I can marry. I don't think it should tell a woman what she can do with her reproductive health choices.""

Bashaw hammered on immigration repeatedly throughout, saying it's ""a crisis in New Jersey"" and is costing the state.

In a reflection of how Democratic-leaning New Jersey has been in Senate races, which Republicans haven't won in more than five decades, Bashaw addressed his closing statements to women and moms of New Jersey.

""I am a moderate, common-sense person that will work to be a voice for New Jersey,"" he said.

Kim declared his candidacy a day after Menendez's indictment last year, saying it was time for the state to turn the page on the longtime legislator. It looked as if the Democratic primary in a must-win state for the party would be contentious when first lady Tammy Murphy entered the race, winning support from influential party leaders.

But Kim challenged the state's unique ballot-drawing system widely viewed as favoring the candidates backed by party leaders. A federal judge sided with Kim in his legal challenge, putting the system on hold for this election. Murphy dropped out of the race, saying she wanted to avoid a divisive primary, leaving a clear path to Kim's nomination.

Kim first won office to the House in 2018, defeating Republican Rep. Tom MacArthur. He got national attention after the Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol insurrection when he was photographed picking up trash in the building.

Bashaw won a contested primary in June, defeating a Trump-backed opponent. The hotel developer from Cape May is running for office for the first time.

Menendez was convicted this summer on federal charges of accepting bribes of gold and cash from three New Jersey businesspeople and acting as an agent for the Egyptian government. He has vowed to appeal the conviction.

He resigned in August, capping a career in politics that spanned roughly five decades. Democratic Gov. Phil Murphy appointed George Helmy as interim senator. Helmy said he'll resign after the election is certified so Murphy can appoint whoever wins the election to the seat for the remainder of Menendez's term, which expires in January."
Advocacy groups suspend use of 'suicide capsule' pending Swiss criminal probe into its first use,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/switzerland-suicide-capsule-people-detained-e5c12c131f1a029db80d3b486bf592a4,2024-10-06T18:47:13Z,"Advocacy groups behind a so-called suicide capsule said Sunday they have suspended the process of taking applications to use it -- which numbered over 370 last month -- as a criminal investigation into its first use in Switzerland is completed.

The president of Switzerland-based The Last Resort, Florian Willet, is being held in pretrial detention, said the group and Exit International, an affiliate founded in Australia over a quarter century ago.

Swiss police arrested Willet and several other people following the death of an unidentified 64-year-old woman from the U.S. Midwest who on Sept. 23 became the first person to use the device, known as the ""Sarco,""in a forest in the northern Schaffhausen region near the German border.

Others initially detained were released from custody, authorities have said.

___ EDITOR'S NOTE -- This story includes discussion of suicide. If you or someone you know needs help, the national suicide and crisis lifeline in the U.S. is available by calling or texting 988. There is also an online chat at 988lifeline.org. The Swiss government refers queries about suicide prevention to a group called ""Dargebotene Hand,"" or The Offered Hand. ___

Switzerland has some of the most permissive laws in the world when it comes to assisted suicide, though the first use of the ""Sarco"" has prompted a debate among lawmakers.

Laws in the rich Alpine country permit assisted suicide so long as the person takes his or her life with no ""external assistance"" and those who help the person die do not do so for ""any self-serving motive.""

The advocacy groups said in a statement Sunday that 371 people were ""in the process of applying"" to use the Sarco in Switzerland as of Sept. 23 and applications were suspended after its first use.

Exit International, whose founder Dr. Philip Nitschke is based in the Netherlands, is behind the 3D-printed device that cost over $1 million to develop.

The ""Sarco"" capsule is designed to allow a person sitting in a reclining seat inside to push a button that injects nitrogen gas into the sealed chamber, allowing the person to fall asleep and die by suffocation in a few minutes.

Exit International has said Willet was the only person present during the woman's death, and described it as ""peaceful, fast and dignified."" Those claims could not be independently verified."
Walz says he'll 'own up' when he misspeaks as the Democratic ticket steps up media interviews,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/walz-harris-media-interview-presidential-campaign-83325184cd7f93ca505df590f7a27ede,2024-10-06T16:08:51Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Nearly a week after verbal stumbles in the only vice presidential debate, Democrat Tim Walz used his debut campaign appearance on a Sunday news show to try to fend off criticism of his stand on abortion rights and ""own up"" to past misstatements.

The interview on ""Fox News Sunday"" reflected a broader media blitz by presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her running mate as the Democrats seek to garner public attention in the final 30 days of the campaign against Republicans Donald Trump and JD Vance.

Harris has taped an interview with CBS' ""60 Minutes"" that will air Monday night. She is booked Tuesday on Howard Stern's satellite radio show, ABC's ""The View"" and ""The Late Show"" with Stephen Colbert on CBS. Her interview on the podcast ""Call Her Daddy"" is scheduled to be released later Sunday. Walz will be on Jimmy Kimmel's ABC show on Monday.

Walz's Fox appearance also touched on the turmoil in the Middle East, with anchor Shannon Bream pressing the Minnesota governor on whether Israel has a right to preemptively attack Iran's nuclear and oil facilities in response to Tehran's firing of missiles against Israel. It was a question that Walz did not fully answer during his debate this past week with Vance, an Ohio senator.

Walz said Sunday that ""specific operations will be dealt with at the time."" He said Israel has a right to defend itself and that Harris worked with Israel this past week to repel the Iranian attack. President Joe Biden said last week he would not support an Israeli strike on sites related to Tehran's nuclear program.

Walz defended a law that he signed as governor to ensure abortion protections, saying it ""puts this puts the decision with the woman and her health care providers."" He questioned the statement by Trump that he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

On the economy, Walz said Harris' proposals would make life more affordable for the middle class by helping with the construction of 3 million new homes and expanding tax credits for parents. He said tariffs floated by Trump could increase costs by an estimated $4,000 a year on a typical family.

Walz also faced questions in the interview about misstatements pertaining to his military service, drunken driving arrest, infertility treatment for his family and claims to have been in Hong Kong before the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre in China.

""I will own up when I misspeak,"" Walz said.

He said he believes voters are more concerned by the fact that Vance could not acknowledge during their debate that Trump lost the 2020 election to Biden and that there could restrictions on the infertility treatment of intrauterine insemination that his wife, Gwen, received.

""I think they're probably far more concerned with that than my wife and I used IUI to have our child and that Donald Trump would restrict that,"" Walz said. ""So I think folks know who I am.""

Bream noted that Trump has come out in support of fertility treatments, even as he has said that abortion questions should be decided by states."

More Black and Latina women are leading unions - and transforming how they work,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/labor-union-diversity-black-latina-women-leaders-0c186ea63ae8eebeaadb15e131b77a61,2024-10-06T12:04:59Z,"Women make up roughly half of U.S. labor union membership, but representation in top level union leadership positions has lagged, even in female-dominated industries and particularly for women of color.

But Black and Latina women are starting to gain ground, landing top positions at some of the biggest unions in the U.S. That has translated into wins at the bargaining table that focus more attention on family-friendly benefits like parental leave and health care coverage, as well as protections against sexual harassment.

Often when people think about unions, ""they think of a white guy in a hard hat. But in fact, studies show that about two-thirds of working people who are covered by a union contract are women and/or people of color,"" said Georgetown University labor historian Lane Windham.

Indeed, hospitality union UNITE HERE's membership is majority women and people of color. And last month, more than 12,000 of them across six states went on strike to push for wage increases, fair workloads and more affordable health care under the leadership of Gwen Mills, who in June became the first woman to be elected union president in its 130-year history.

Data from the U.S. Department of Labor shows that Black and Latina women experience a particularly wide gender pay gap. They also face intersectional headwinds of both racism and sexism in their careers, making them even more attuned to inequities in the workplace and motivating them to increasingly step up the fight as union leaders.

Black and Latina women are driving labor union growth in the U.S. amid a decades-long decline in membership. In 2023, Black women's union membership rate notched a slight bump from 10.3% to 10.5%, while Latinas went up from 8.5% to 8.8%. But that's still more than white men and women as well as Asian women, whose membership experienced a decrease during the same time period.

Momentum for Black and Latina women rising into labor union leadership has picked up in the last five years. But the work began long before that by ""our foremothers who laid this foundation and have been pushing and kicking those doors open for decades,"" according to Liz Shuler, who in June 2022 became the first woman in history to lead the AFL-CIO, a federation of 60 national and international labor unions.

""The #MeToo movement, I think, has really emboldened women across the board, including in labor, to say, you know what? I'm not going to be sitting on the sidelines,"" Shuler said. The pandemic also put a spotlight on essential workers such as nurses, service workers and care workers, who are predominantly women and minorities.

Today's examples of diverse union leaders include Becky Pringle, a Black woman who leads the National Education Association, the nation's largest union; Bonnie Castillo, the first Latina to serve as executive director of National Nurses United; and April Verrett, who in May became the first Black woman to lead the Service Employees International Union, which says about 60% of its service worker members are people of color, and two-thirds are women.

""If we want to build power on those who are perceived to have the least amount of power, then we've got to create space for our people of those identities to be able to lead,"" Verrett told The Associated Press.

But while female-dominated fields have made strides in union leadership diversity, ""there is still a long way to go"" for unions in male-dominated fields like building and manufacturing trades, said University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign labor historian Emily Twarog. Despite some gender diversity headway through DEI and apprenticeship programs, ""there hasn't been that kind of culture shift.""

Men continue to have a higher union membership rate than women -- 10.5% versus 9.5% respectively, according to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. And workplace sexual harassment and biases still run rampant in many places, including for Chicago-based Lisa Lujano, a journey-level carpenter and member of Carpenters Union Local 13.

Things might get better, she said, if more Black and Latina women held union leadership roles and were more aware of their memberships' needs, including safety gear that fits women's bodies, for example. Or parental leave, which Lujano does not have.

""I think we would get more respect out in the field,"" she said.

Here's a look at the impact women union leaders have had at the bargaining table:

Teachers' unions have in recent years begun to use their collective power to push for wraparound benefits to help their surrounding community in a method known as ""bargaining for the common good,"" which aims to go beyond wages and benefits at the bargaining table and tackle wider social issues. The Chicago Teachers Union, for example, included demands for affordable housing citywide during a strike in 2019 -- in part organized by then-vice president Stacy Davis Gates, who is now CTU president.

Some teachers' unions are also fighting for racial justice, including the United Teachers Los Angeles, which demanded that the school district stop subjugating students to random metal detector screenings and locker checks without cause, decrying the practice as disproportionately targeting Black and minority students.

""We need to address the inequities that are built into every single social system in this country that determine whether our students come to school ready to learn every day,"" Pringle said. ""It was our female leaders, particularly our leaders of color, who really leaned into that.""

Unionized hotel workers like Maria Mata have made strides toward fighting the rampant sexual harassment in their profession.

Mata, a Hispanic housekeeper and UNITE HERE union leader at the W San Francisco, helped lead a successful push at her hotel for workers to be equipped with panic buttons in 2018 to summon security help in an emergency, now implemented by several major hotel chains.

""We needed more protection,"" especially during night shifts spent cleaning entire floors alone, explained Mata, who has herself twice experienced sexual harassment on the job. ""It's very dangerous.""

It's also vital for the women doing the work to also sit at the bargaining table, ""because sometimes as women, we need something that the men don't know,"" said Mata, whose hotel is currently in bargaining for a new contract.

Keturah Johnson in 2022 became the first queer woman of color to serve as international vice president for flight attendant union AFA-CWA, which is led by Sara Nelson and represents over 50,000 flight attendants at 20 airlines.

People often think of a flight attendant as ""a white woman with hair put up in a bun,"" and Black flight attendants frequently face microaggressions from managers about their appearance, Johnson said. ""It's happened to me many times because of my natural hair.""

And for gender nonconforming flight attendants, being able to wear a uniform that reflects their gender identity is important, Johnson said. So she's leading the fight to update uniform standards to be gender inclusive and permit natural hairstyles, which has resulted in several airlines making changes.

United Airlines, for instance, updated its uniform standards to include gender neutral options in 2021, and Alaska Airlines management adopted gender neutral uniform and appearance standards in 2022, according to AFA. Frontier allowed natural hairstyles for flight attendants in 2021, and this year implemented standardized pricing for all uniforms regardless of size or gender.

""We're not just there to serve Diet Coke. And so it's our job to make sure that flight attendants are represented and seen just as they are,"" Johnson said. ""The world is changed now.""

A Tennessee nurse and his dog died trying to save a man from floods driven by Hurricane Helene,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-death-floodwaters-drowning-168984cf157d2992a5b2280991ed588f,2024-10-06T04:19:07Z,"As the Hurricane Helene-driven waters rose around the Nolichucky River in Tennessee, Boone McCrary, his girlfriend and his chocolate lab headed out on his fishing boat to search for a man who was stranded by floodwaters that had leveled his home. But the thick debris in the water jammed the boat's motor, and without power, it slammed into a bridge support and capsized.

McCrary and his dog Moss never made it out of the water alive.

Search teams found McCrary's boat and his dog's body two days later, but it took four days to find McCrary, an emergency room nurse whose passion was being on his boat in that river. His girlfriend, Santana Ray, held onto a branch for hours before rescuers reached her.

David Boutin, the man McCrary had set out to rescue, was distraught when he later learned McCrary had died trying to save him.

""I've never had anyone risk their life for me,"" Boutin told The Associated Press. ""From what I hear that was the way he always been. He's my guardian angel, that's for sure.""

The 46-year-old recalled how the force of the water swept him out his front door and ripped his dog Buddy -- ""My best friend, all I have"" -- from his arms. Boutin was rescued by another team after clinging to tree branches in the raging river for six hours. Buddy is still missing, and Boutin knows he couldn't have survived.

McCrary was one of 215 people killed by Hurricane Helene's raging waters and falling trees across six states -- Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee and Virginia -- and was among a group of first responders who perished while trying to save others. The hurricane caused significant damage in nearby Unicoi County, where flooding swept away 11 workers at an plastics factory and forced a rescue mission at an Erwin, Tennessee, hospital.

McCrary, an avid hunter and fisherman, spent his time cruising the waterways that snake around Greeneville, Tennessee. When the hurricane hit, the 32-year-old asked friends on Facebook if anyone needed help, said his sister, Laura Harville. That was how he learned about Boutin.

McCrary, his girlfriend and Moss the dog launched into a flooded neighborhood at about 7 p.m. on Sept. 27 and approached Boutin's location, but the debris-littered floodwaters clogged the boat's jet motor. Despite pushing and pulling the throttle, McCrary couldn't clear the junk and slammed into the bridge about two hours into the rescue attempt.

""I got the first phone call at 8:56 p.m. and I was a nervous wreck,"" Harville said. She headed to the bridge and started walking the banks.

Harville organized hundreds of volunteers who used drones, thermal cameras, binoculars and hunting dogs to scour the muddy banks, fending off copperhead snakes, trudging through knee-high muck and fighting through tangled branches. Harville collected items that carried McCrary's scent -- a pillowcase, sock and insoles from his nursing shoes -- and stuffed them into mason jars for the canines to sniff.

On Sunday, a drone operator spotted the boat. They found Moss dead nearby, but there was no sign of McCrary.

Searchers had no luck on Monday, ""but on Tuesday they noticed vultures flying,"" Harville said. That was how they found McCrary's body, about 21 river miles (33 kilometers) from the bridge where the boat capsized, she said.

The force of the floodwaters carried McCrary under two other bridges, under the highway and over the Nolichucky Dam, she said. The Tennessee Valley Authority said about 1.3 million gallons (4.9 million liters) of water per second was flowing over the dam on the night McCrary was swept away, more than double the flow rate of the dam's last regulated release nearly a half-century ago.

Boutin, 46, isn't sure where he will go next. He is staying with his son for a few days and then hopes to get a hotel voucher.

He didn't learn about McCrary's fate until the day after he was rescued.

""When the news hit, I didn't know how to take it,"" Boutin told the AP. ""I wish I could thank him for giving his life for me.""

Dozens of McCrary's coworkers at Greenville Community Hospital have posted tributes to him, recalling his kindness and compassion and desire to help others. He ""was adamant about living life to the fullest and making sure along the way that you didn't forget your fellow man or woman and that you helped each other,"" Harville said.

McCrary's last TikTok video posted before the hurricane shows him speeding along the surface of rushing muddy water to the tune, ""Wanted Dead or Alive."" He wrote a message along the bottom that read:

""Some people have asked if I had a 'death wish.' The truth is that I have a 'life wish.' I have a need for feeling the life running through my veins. One thing about me, I may be 'crazy,' Perhaps a little reckless at times, but when the time comes to put me in the ground, you can say I lived it all the way."""
Police: Former New York governor and stepson assaulted during evening walk,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/exgovernor-david-patterson-assault-f69353e9a1cb4c6647892a01651b2fc0,2024-10-05T21:14:46Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Former New York Gov. David Paterson and his stepson sustained minor injuries when they were assaulted on a Manhattan street by four men and a woman as they went for an evening walk, police said Saturday.

The 70-year-old former governor, a Democrat, and his 20-year-old stepson, Anthony Sliwa, were walking on an Upper East Side street about 8:30 p.m. Friday when they were attacked, the New York Police Department and a spokesperson for Paterson said.

Both were treated at a nearby hospital for minor injuries to the face and were released early Saturday, authorities said.

Paterson, who is legally blind, also sustained minor injuries to his body.

In a statement, police labeled the attack a ""gang assault"" and sought help from the public to learn more about the assault.

Paterson served as governor from 2008 to 2010, assuming the post after Gov. Eliot Spitzer resigned in a prostitution scandal.

Sean Darcy, a spokesperson for Paterson, said in a statement that the people involved in the assault apparently had a previous interaction with Sliwa.

Paterson and Sliwa were able to fight off their attackers, Darcy said.

Paterson and his wife, Mary, ""are thankful for the quick response time from the police and the outpouring of support they have received from people across all spectrums,"" Darcy said.

He added that Paterson's main concern Saturday was New York Mets pitcher Kodai Senga as he leads the Mets in their opening playoff game against the Philadelphia Phillies."
"Attempts to cross the English Channel on small boats leave 4 migrants, including a child, dead",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/migrants-channel-france-britain-deaths-64e2df909e06e13d4b47332983248372,2024-10-05T17:08:59Z,"PARIS (AP) -- French authorities said four migrants, including a 2-year-old child, died Saturday in two separate incidents as they attempted to cross the English Channel toward Britain.

France's Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau deplored a ""terrible tragedy"" on X, saying that the child ""was trampled to death in a boat.""

""The smugglers have the blood of these people on their hands,"" Retailleau added, saying his newly-appointed government is to ""intensify the fight against these mafias who make money from these deadly crossings.""

Saturday's deaths come as a series of shipwrecks made 2024 the deadliest in recent years on the English Channel. Last month, 12 people died after a boat carrying migrants ripped apart in the English Channel. About two weeks later, eight migrants died in a similar crossing attempt.

In a news conference, the prefect of the Pas-de-Calais, Jacques Billant, said rescuers found the 2-year-old child dead onboard a migrant boat that had called for assistance Saturday morning.

Fourteen other migrants picked up on board the recue boat were brought back to France to be interviewed by the border police and a 17-year-old was brought to a hospital in the port city of Boulogne-sur-Mer as he suffered from burns to his legs, Billant said.

Other people on the migrant boat who refused to be rescued continued their journey toward Britain, he said.

""To make money and with no regard for human life, networks of smugglers put people at ever greater risk,"" including families with children, ""literally leading them to accident and death,"" Billant said.

Boulogne-sur-Mer prosecutor Guirec Le Bras, said the child, who appears to have been crushed in a jostling on the boat, was born in Germany from a 24-year-old Somalian mother.

In a separate incident, Billant, the prefect, said rescuers found three migrants dead and saved several others as they fell off a small boat overloaded with 83 passengers amid ""panic and stampede.""

Those dead ""were probably crushed"" and ""have choked ... and drowned in the 40 centimeters (16 inches) of water at the bottom of the inflatable boat,"" he said.

They were two men and a woman, the three of them aged about 30, he said.

Migrants that rescuers took care of Saturday came from Eritrea, Vietnam, Afghanistan, Iran, Ethiopia, Libya, Syria, Egypt, Kuwait and Iraq, Billant listed.

The prosecutor said investigations have been open on both incidents.

Europe's increasingly strict asylum rules, growing xenophobia and hostile treatment of migrants have been pushing them north.

Before Saturday's events, French authorities said at least 46 migrants had died while trying to cross to the U.K. this year."
Inside a North Carolina mountain town that Hurricane Helene nearly wiped off the map,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-chimney-rock-north-carolina-da802219b70161816b73b24482b50684,2024-10-05T13:10:35Z,"CHIMNEY ROCK VILLAGE, N.C. (AP) -- The stone tower that gave this place its name was nearly a half billion years in the making -- heated and thrust upward from deep in the Earth, then carved and eroded by wind and water.

But in just a few minutes, nature undid most of what it has taken humans a century and a quarter to build in the North Carolina mountain town of Chimney Rock.

""It feels like I was deployed, like, overnight and woke up in ... a combat zone,"" Iraq War veteran Chris Canada said as a massive twin-propped Chinook helicopter passed over his adopted hometown. ""I don't think it's sunk in yet.""

Nearly 400 miles (644 kilometers) from where Hurricane Helene made landfall Sept. 26 along Florida's Big Bend, the hamlet of about 140 souls on the banks of the Broad River has been all but wiped from the map.

The backs of restaurants and gift shops that boasted riverfront balconies dangle ominously in mid-air. The Hickory Nut Brewery, opened when Rutherford County went ""wet"" and started serving alcohol about a decade ago, collapsed on Wednesday, nearly a week after the storm.

The buildings across Main Street, while still standing, are choked with several feet of reddish-brown muck. A sign on the Chimney Sweeps souvenir shop says, ""We are open during construction.""

In another section of town, the houses that weren't swept away perch precariously near the edge of a scoured riverbank. It is where the town's only suspected death -- an elderly woman who refused entreaties to evacuate -- occurred.

""Literally, this river has moved,"" village administrator Stephen Duncan said as he drove an Associated Press reporter through the dust-blown wreckage of Chimney Rock Village on Wednesday. ""We saw a 1,000-year event. A geological event.""

About eight hours after Helene made landfall in Florida, Chimney Rock volunteer firefighter John Payne was responding to a possible gas leak when he noticed water spilling over US 64/74, the main road into town. It was just after 7 a.m.

""The actual hurricane hadn't even come through and hit yet,"" he said.

Payne, 32, who's lived in this valley his entire life, aborted the call and rushed back up the hill to the fire station, which was moved to higher ground following a devastating 1996 flood. Former chief Joseph ""Buck"" Meliski, who worked that earlier flood, scoffed.

""There's no way it's hitting that early,"" Payne recalled the older man saying.

But when Payne showed him a video he'd just shot -- of water topping the bridge to the Hickory Nut Falls Family Campground -- the former chief's jaw dropped.

""We're in for it, boys,"" Meliski told Payne and the half dozen or so others gathered there.

Suddenly, the ground beneath them began shaking -- like the temblors that sometimes rock the valley, but much stronger. By then, muddy water was seeping under the back wall of the firehouse.

Payne looked down and saw what he estimated to be a 30-foot-high (nine-meter-high) wall of water, tossing car-sized boulders as it raced toward the town. It appeared as if the wave was devouring houses, then spitting them out.

""It's not water at that point,"" Payne said. ""It's mud, this thick concrete-like material, you know what I mean? And whatever it hits, it's taking.""

A house hit the bridge from which he'd been filming not 20 minutes earlier. The span just ""imploded."" Payne later found its steel beams ""bent in horseshoe shapes around boulders.""

At the firehouse, some business owners among the group being ""crying hysterically,"" Payne said. Others just stood in mute disbelief.

The volunteers lost communications during the storm. But when the winds finally began to quiet down around 11 a.m., Payne said, the radios began ""blowing up with calls.""

The pieces of what had been Chimney Rock Village were now on their way to the neighboring town of Lake Lure, which played a starring role as stand-in for a Catskills resort in the 1987 Patrick Swayze summer romance film, ""Dirty Dancing.""

Tracy Stevens, 55, a bartender at the Hickory Nut, took refuge at the Lake Lure Inn, where she also worked. She watched as the detritus from Chimney Rock and beyond came pouring into the marina, tossing aside boats and thrusting the metal sections of the floating Town Center Walkway upward like the folds of a map.

""It looked like a toilet bowl flushing,"" she said. ""I could see cars, tops of houses. It was the craziest.""

Some of the debris coalesced into a massive jam between the two bridges linking the towns -- a utilitarian concrete affair carrying Memorial Highway across the Broad River, and an elegant three-arched span known as the Flowering Bridge.

After 85 years carrying traffic into Chimney Rock, the 1925 viaduct was converted into a verdant walkway festooned with more than 2,000 species of plants. Now partially collapsed, the bridge's remains are draped in a tangled mass of vines, roots and tree branches.

Canada, 43, who co-owns a stage rental and event production company, was at a Charlotte music festival when the storm hit. Returning to uniformed troops and armored personnel carriers kicking up dust in the streets awakened memories of his three combat tours in the Middle East.

""I saw the whole war and I've been through many hurricanes,"" said Canada, an Army airborne veteran. ""I've never seen anything like this.""

Canada and his wife, Barbie, moved here with their two daughters in October 2021 from South Carolina, in part to get away from hurricanes. Barbie had vacationed here as a child, and it was close to the Veterans Administration hospital in Asheville.

As he walked the banks of the Broad on Wednesday, Chris Canada found himself sniffing at the warm air for the telltale odor of death.

And yet, all around are signs of hope.

Payne -- who climbs the rock in full gear each Sept. 11 to honor first responders who died in the Twin Towers attacks -- was heartened to see members of the New York City Fire Department in his town helping with door-to-door searches.

""We're more hard-headed than these rocks are,"" said Payne, whose day job is as a site coordinator for a fast-food chain. ""So, it's going to take more than this to scare us off and run us out. It'll be a while, but we'll be back. Don't count us out.""

Outside the Mountain Traders shop, someone has leaned a large wooden Sasquatch cutout against a utility pole, the words ""Chimney Rock Strong"" painted in bright blue.

When park employees cut their way to the top of the mountain and raised the American flag on Monday, Duncan says the people below cheered, and some wept.

""It was spectacular,"" he said.

The flag is flying at half staff. But Mayor Peter O'Leary said it's that spirit that will bring Chimney Rock Village back.

The town's legacy of hospitality and entrepreneurial spirit dates back to the late 1800s, when a local family began charging visitors 25 cents for a horseback ride up the mountain, according to brief online history by village resident R. J. Wald. It soon became one of North Carolina's first bona fide tourist attractions.

O'Leary came to town in 1990 to take a job as park manager, before it became part of the state parks system. Two years later, he and his wife opened Bubba O'Leary's General Store, named for their yellow Labrador retriever.

""Most of these people here, if you look around, almost all of them are from somewhere else,"" he said as he stood outside the firehouse, the waters of the 404-foot (123-meter) Hickory Nut Falls gushing forth from the ridge high above. ""Why'd they come here? They came here and fell in love with it. It gets ahold of you. ...

""It got ahold of me.""

The 1927 portion of the general store has caved in, but O'Leary believes the larger addition built in 2009 is salvageable. Duncan, who drafted the village charter back in 1990, sees this as an opportunity to ""take advantage of the new geography"" and build a better town.

But for some, like innkeeper and restaurateur Nick Sottile, 35, the path forward is hard to see.

When Helene hit, Sottile and wife Kristen were vacationing in the Turks and Caicos Islands -- their first break since October 2020, when they opened their Broad River Inn and Stagecoach Pizza Kitchen in what's believed to be the village's oldest building.

In photos taken from the street, things looked remarkably intact. But when Sottile returned home and walked around to the river side, his heart sank.

""The back of the building is, like, a whole section of it is gone,"" the South Florida native said Friday. ""It's not even safe to go in there right now.""

About all that's left of the adjacent Chimney Rock Adventure miniature golf course is the sign.

""You can't even rebuild,"" Sottile said. ""Because there's no land.""

Sottile has been hearing horror stories from fellow business owners about denied insurance claims. Without help, he said he has no money to rebuild.

But for now, he's just volunteering with the fire department and trying not to think too far into the future.

""This is a small town, but this is, this is HOME,"" he said. ""Everybody helps everybody, and I know we'll get through this. I know we'll rebuild. I'm just praying that we can rebuild with US here to see it.""

Don't fall for fake dentists offering veneers and other dental work on social media,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/veneers-dentist-teeth-whitening-scam-unlicensed-d0d9d57613a10f18bc9735dc5eca4b41,2024-10-05T13:08:43Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- If you have stained or chipped teeth, you might be considering veneers, customized teeth coverings that can restore a photogenic smile without more extensive dental work.

But dentists warn that these pricey cosmetic enhancements are at the center of a worrisome online trend: unlicensed practitioners without proper training or supervision offering low-cost veneers.

These self-described ""veneer techs"" often promote themselves on Instagram and TikTok, promising a full set of veneers for less than half of what dentists typically charge. Some also market their own training courses and certifications for people looking to get into the business.

It's misleading, health professionals warn -- and illegal. All states require dental work, including veneers, to be performed under the supervision of a licensed dentist.

On Thursday, Georgia law enforcement officials arrested Brandon Diller, who promoted himself to 158,000 Instagram followers as ""Atlanta's top veneer specialist and trainer."" Diller practiced dentistry without a license and sold ""training and certificates, which were worthless"" and ""provided no legitimate or legal credentials,"" according to an arrest warrant from Fulton County's District Attorney's office.

Here's what to know about veneers and how to avoid bogus providers and services:

Veneers are thin, custom-made dental coverings used to hide minor imperfections or to fill in gaps between teeth. Unlike crowns or more invasive dental implants, veneers are almost always considered cosmetic dentistry and generally aren't covered by insurance.

Dentists usually charge between $1,000 and $2,000 per tooth for veneers, with higher prices for those made from porcelain compared with lower-grade materials.

Placing veneers involves stripping some of the natural enamel from the tooth and bonding the new covering into place. Because of that process, getting veneers is considered an irreversible procedure, according to the American Dental Association. They are not permanent, and can be expected to last between 5 to 15 years before they degrade and need to be replaced.

In recent months the ADA has been stepping up warnings about the risks of veneer procedures done by unlicensed individuals.

""Quality control is lost without the involvement of a licensed dentist,"" said Dr. Ada Cooper, a New York-based dentist and ADA spokesperson. ""We undergo years of education and training and need to be licensed by various regulatory bodies before we can practice.""

Improper veneer procedures can cause a range of health problems, including severe pain, nerve damage and tooth loss.

Patients need to be anesthetized before the enamel is removed from their teeth.

""It could be incredibly painful if they're not anesthetized correctly,"" said Dr. Zach Truman, who runs an orthodontics practice in Las Vegas. ""You can also go too deep into the tooth and penetrate what's called the pulp chamber, which contains blood vessels and nerves.""

One of the biggest problems Truman sees with unregulated veneer work is that customers aren't getting screened for existing dental problems, such as gum disease and cavities.

""If you put a veneer on a tooth that has an active cavity, you're just going to seal it in there and eventually it's going to progress to tooth loss,"" Truman said.

Dental veneers aren't the only option for improving the appearance of teeth. Over-the-counter whitening kits can help with minor stains and discoloration. And dentists can sometimes use composite materials to reshape chipped or uneven teeth. But Truman says those fillings are prone to crack and won't last as long as veneers.

One clue: Many individuals performing unlicensed dental work promote themselves on social media as ""veneer technicians.""

Instead of working out of a dental office they often perform treatments at beauty salons, hotel rooms or private homes. Some advertise multi-city tours and encourage clients to message them to book an appointment in advance.

Much of the appeal of the services is in their pricing, with some offering a full set of veneers for a flat fee of $4,000 or $5,000. That's less than half of what patients can generally expect to pay at a dental office.

Performing dental work without an appropriate license is illegal, the ADA notes.

Dentists and hygienists are licensed by state governments, who also define the work dental assistants can perform. But in all cases, veneers and other dental procedures must be supervised by a licensed dentist.

Earlier this year, Illinois law enforcement officials arrested a woman running a business called the Veneer Experts after she posted videos of herself fitting braces, veneers and other dental products without a license. She was previously arrested in Nevada on similar allegations of practicing dentistry without a license.

The ADA maintains a website detailing the training and licensing requirements for dentists across the U.S. Most states also maintain websites where you can lookup and verify licensure information and find any past disciplinary actions for dentists and other health professionals.

""It's really critical to understand that dentistry is a regulated health care profession that requires formal educations and licensure,"" Cooper said.

Here are some of the top cases that will be argued in the coming months:

The Biden administration and families of transgender minors in Tennessee are challenging a federal appeals court ruling that upheld the state's ban on gender-affirming care for minors. Roughly half the states have enacted similar restrictions.

The administration is appealing a federal appeals court ruling striking down a regulation aimed at reducing the proliferation of hard-to-trace ghost guns, which lack serial numbers.

Oklahoma's Republican attorney general has joined with death row inmate Richard Glossip in calling for the high court to throw out Glossip's conviction and death sentence in a 1977 murder-for-hire scheme.

The adult entertainment industry is challenging a provision of Texas law, upheld by a federal appeals court, mandating that pornographic websites verify the age of their users.

Leading U.S. gun manufacturers want the Supreme Court to overturn an appellate ruling keeping alive a $10 billion lawsuit filed by Mexico against over allegations that the companies' practices are responsible for violence in Mexico.

The Nuclear Regulatory Commissions wants the court to restore licenses it issued for temporary nuclear waste storage facilities in rural New Mexico and Texas after a federal appeals court invalidated them.

A woman in Ohio is asking the court to revive her workplace discrimination lawsuit in which she claims she unfairly lost out on state jobs to LGBTQ people, in violation of federal law.

The Food and Drug Administration is asking the justices to overturn a decision that would allow the marketing of sweet e-cigarette products amid concern about a surge in youth vaping in recent years."
San Francisco's first Black female mayor is in a pricey battle for a second term,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/san-francisco-mayor-reelection-ba594461c1dd3863e350960fedcafb38,2024-10-05T04:13:25Z,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- When London Breed was elected as San Francisco's first Black woman mayor, it was a pinch-me moment for a poor girl from public housing whose ascension showed that no dream was impossible in the progressive, compassionate and equitable city.

But the honeymoon was short-lived as a COVID-19 pandemic shuttered stores and tech workers retreated to home offices. Tent encampments surged and so did public drug use.

Breed now finds herself in a pricey campaign as she battles for a second term.

The moderate Democrat faces four main challengers on the Nov. 5 ballot, all fellow Democrats, who say Breed has squandered her six years in office. They say she allowed San Francisco to descend into chaos and blamed others for her inability to rein in homelessness and erratic street behavior, all while burglarized businesses pleaded for help.

Her closest competitors appear to be Mark Farrell, a former interim mayor and venture capitalist who is the most conservative of the group, and Daniel Lurie, an anti-poverty nonprofit founder and an heir to the Levi Strauss fortune who has pumped at least $6 million of his own money into his first bid for mayor.

The other two are Aaron Peskin, president of the Board of Supervisors, the most liberal of the candidates, and Ahsha Safaí, a city supervisor and former labor organizer.

Streets have become cleaner and homeless tents much harder to find, but the daytime shooting in September of 49ers rookie Ricky Pearsall in a popular central shopping district reignited the public safety issue.

""Even though San Francisco is seen as this kind of West Coast liberal icon, the city has experienced a series of episodes that challenge that, and that puts voters into kind of a testy mood,"" said David McCuan, a political science professor at Sonoma State University.

McCuan added that he thinks Breed still has the advantage, but ""she's just got difficulties around her.""

The Nov. 5 vote in a presidential election year is happening amid a national debate on public safety and a statewide vote on a tough-on-crime proposition that would, if approved, reclassify some misdemeanor theft and drug crimes as felonies.

Voters concerned over crime ousted progressive San Francisco prosecutor Chesa Boudin in a rare recall in 2022, and across the bay this year, the Oakland mayor is facing a recall election due in part to crime concerns.

In an interview, Breed, 50, said San Francisco is turning a corner -- thanks to her hard work -- and voters she meets are upbeat.

She championed a pair of successful public safety ballot measures in the March primary to expand police powers and compel some people into drug treatment. She ordered a crackdown on homeless tent encampments following a U.S. Supreme Court decision that said bans on outdoor sleeping are allowed. Reported crime is down.

""We laid the groundwork, and now people are reaping the benefits of our infrastructure projects, the capacity we built and the technology we're using to combat crime,"" Breed said, adding that voters ""know that someone's in charge and making it happen.""

Farrell challenged that notion at a meeting with voters at a boisterous gastropub on a recent evening, saying Breed failed to maintain the streets he cleared of tents when he was interim mayor in 2018. Farrell, 50, was a city supervisor who served in the role for six months following the death of Mayor Ed Lee.

He envisions a San Francisco where police feel respected and older residents don't have to hire private security when the city has a $15 billion annual budget.

""San Franciscans, given the state of our city right now, want not only a change of leadership, but a sense of direction for the city,"" Farrell said in an interview this week.

Lurie, 47, says voters deserve a true public servant and that as a political outsider, he has the experience to overhaul corrupt government bureaucracy.

Voters are ""desperate, desperate for someone that is going to come in there and bring accountability,"" Lurie said.

As founder of the nonprofit Tipping Point Community, he says, he built tiny cabin shelters and permanent subsidized housing at a fraction of the cost and time that it would take City Hall.

Breed, Farrell and Lurie all have strong ties to wealthy business donors.

Lurie leads in fundraising with more than $13 million, including $1 million from his mother, businesswoman Miriam Haas, to an outside committee supporting his candidacy. Breed has collected more than $4.6 million, including $1.2 million from former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, while Farrell has raised $3.5 million.

All three candidates also carry baggage.

Breed is embroiled in an unfolding scandal over financial mismanagement in the Dream Keeper Initiative, her marquee racial equity program for Black communities. The mayor says the program does good work.

Farrell has been accused by opponents of dodging campaign contribution limits by pooling staff and office costs with a campaign he established in support of a ballot measure, which can accept unlimited donations. Farrell says he is following the law.

And critics of Lurie say the affordable housing project his nonprofit built cannot be replicated citywide because it used a construction method opposed by local labor unions and required massive private investment. Lurie says naysayers will naysay.

San Francisco elects its mayor using a ranked choice voting system that could yield a winner who did does get the most first-place votes. It also can encourage unusual alliances between rival candidates and, indeed, this week Farrell and Safaí agreed to ask their supporters to make the other their No. 2 pick.

Breed won election as mayor in June 2018 to serve out the remainder of Lee's term and was reelected in 2019 to a full term that has lasted five years instead of the typical four after voters changed the election calendar to line up with presidential contests."
Virginia man charged with defacing monument during Netanyahu protests in DC,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/netanyahu-protests-washington-congress-37861883e2db60606aaf434bf9ec83ad,2024-10-04T20:55:03Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Virginia man was arrested Friday on a charge that he spray-painted graffiti on a monument in the nation's capital during protests against Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's address to Congress in July.

Zaid Mohammed Mahdawi, 26, of Richmond, Va., was charged in a complaint with one count of destruction of federal property. He was among thousands of protesters who gathered in Washington, D.C., on July 24 to condemn Netanyahu's visit.

Some demonstrators who gathered outside Union Station that day removed American flags and hoisted Palestinian ones in their place. Others burned flags and sprayed graffiti on structures in Columbus Circle, in front of Union Station.

Videos posted on social media showed Mahdawi climbing the statue of Christopher Columbus in the middle of Columbus Circle and using red spray paint to write ""HAMAS IS COMIN"" on the monument, according to an FBI agent's affidavit. He also spray-painted an inverted red triangle above the slogan, the affidavit says.

The FBI later received a tip from a witness who knew Mahdawi from a Richmond gym and recognized his image in a police bulletin.

A group of protesters had a permit to demonstrate in front of Union Station, but the U.S. Park Police said it revoked the permit after it couldn't reach protest organizers that afternoon. The National Park Service estimated that it cost more than $11,000 to clean up and fix damage at the site.

""Politically motivated destruction or defacing of federal property is not protected speech, it is a crime,"" Matthew Graves, U.S. Attorney for the District of Columbia, said in a statement.

Mahdawi was expected to make his initial court appearance in Virginia on Friday.

A Maryland woman was arrested last month on a related charge. Isabella Giordano, 20, of Towson, is accused of using red spray paint to write ""Gaza"" on a fountain in front of Union Station and spray-painting the base of two of the flagpoles in Columbus Circle."

US--Los Angeles Police Chief Former county sheriff has been appointed to lead the Los Angeles police force SUMMARY: A former county sheriff has been named chief of the Los Angeles Police Department, taking charge of the nation's third-largest police force. Mayor Karen Bass announced Friday the appointment of Jim McDonnell and said her choice was based on making Los Angeles safer. The news follows the surprise retirement of Chief Michel Moore, whose tenure was marked by greater scrutiny into excessive force and police killings of civilians in the nation's second-largest city. A civilian board of Los Angeles police commissioners selected McDonnell out of three final candidates. He rose to second-in-command during his 29 years at the police department and also served as chief of the Long Beach Police Department.

U.S. ports from Maine to Texas had been closed due to the strike by the union representing about 45,000 dockworkers. The International Longshoremen's Association was demanding higher wages and a total ban on the automation of cranes, gates and trucks that are used in the loading or unloading of freight at 36 U.S. ports. Those ports handle roughly half of the nations' cargo from ships. A lengthy shutdown could have raised prices on goods around the country and potentially caused shortages.

CA--Stem Cell Clinics-Regulation Some California stem cell clinics use unproven therapies. A new court ruling cracks down SUMMARY: Stem cell clinics have popped up throughout California, but some are offering services that have not been approved by federal health regulators. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration last week gained a significant court win against stem cell clinics that promote and administer unproven therapies. A three-judge panel on the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the FDA can regulate two affiliated Southern California stem cell clinics and their treatments after a lower court had exempted them from regulation. Experts say the decision reasserts the FDA's authority over regenerative medicine at a time when clinics are booming. According to adverse reaction reports, unproven therapies have led to infections, disabilities and even death.

CA--Homeless Shelter Ban 'Beyond cruel': Newsom retaliates against this LA suburb for its ban on homeless shelters SUMMARY: The mayor of a middle-class Los Angeles County suburb said the city stands by its moratorium on homeless shelters and supportive housing even after facing state sanctions Thursday. California's housing department revoked approval of the state-mandated housing plan for Norwalk, a city of just over 100,000 people with a homeless population of at least 200 according to county data. The move is the latest escalation of Gov. Gavin Newsom's pressure campaign on cities to help solve the housing crisis. It means Norwalk could lose eligibility for state housing and homelessness grants, and be forced to approve affordable housing projects even if they conflict with city zoning.

BBO--Bye Week Blues Under MLB's new playoff format, a little rest isn't always the best SUMMARY: Shohei Ohtani has mashed 100 mph fastballs for homers, stolen bases against some of the game's best catchers and recently wrapped up one of the best regular seasons in Major League Baseball history. Now the Japanese superstar and his Los Angeles Dodgers have to face something that's arguably even more daunting. A five-day break. Since MLB's most recent playoff format took effect in 2022, five of the eight top seeds have lost in the Division Series, unable to capitalize on the supposed reward of earning a bye through the Wild Card Series. This year, the Dodgers, Phillies, Yankees and Guardians are dealing with the five-day break, trying to use it to their advantage.

A French judge in a shocking rape case allows the public to see some of the video evidence,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/france-rape-trial-gisele-pelicot-79c8973223e572e0f83bc06aba03ed05,2024-10-04T19:46:37Z,"PARIS (AP) -- A French judge in the trial of dozens of men accused of raping an unconscious woman whose now former husband had repeatedly drugged her so that he and others could assault her decided on Friday to allow the public to see some of the video recordings of the alleged rapes.

The decision by Judge Roger Arata in Avignon in southern France to allow journalists and members of the public attending the trial to see the recordings marks a stunning reversal in the case that has shaken France.

It comes after a two-week legal battle in which journalists following the trial and lawyers of Gisèle Pelicot -- who was allegedly raped over the course of a decade -- argued that the videos were crucial for a full understanding of the extraordinary trial.

Pelicot, 71, has become a symbol of the fight against sexual violence in France. She has insisted that the trial be public, against the court's suggestion that it be held behind closed doors.

Since the hearings started on Sept. 2, Pelicot has come face-to-face almost daily with her ex-husband Dominique Pelicot and 49 other alleged rapists. She has been praised for her courage and composure, admired for speaking in a calm and clear voice and allowing that her full name be published -- uncommon under French law for victims in rape trials.

Her insistence that the videos, recorded by her ex-husband and submitted as evidence in the trial -- in which men can be seen sexually abusing her apparently inert body -- be shown to the public speak to her wish that trial serve as a national example, one of her lawyers told The Associated Press.

""It's a unique case: we don't have one representation of rape. We have dozens, hundreds of videos of a rape,"" said the attorney, Stéphane Babonneau. ""Gisèle Pelicot thinks that this shock wave is necessary, so that no one can say after this: 'I didn't know this was rape'.""

The explicit videos shown during the trial, which has underscored the difficulties that sexual violence victims can face in France, are especially important, Pelicot's lawyers say, since the vast majority of the defendants deny the allegations of rape.

Some defendants claim Pelicot's husband tricked them, others say he forced them to have sexual intercourse with her and that they were terrified. Still others argue they believed she was consenting or that her husband's consent was sufficient.

The videos, the lawyers say, speak for themselves.

With Friday's decision, Judge Arata reversed his earlier Sept. 20 ruling that the videos would be shown only on a case-by-case basis, and behind closed doors. At the time, he had argued that they undermined the ""dignity"" of the hearings.

A day later, France's Judicial Press Association filed a request against the decision, backed by Pelicot's lawyers.

Until now, each time a video was shown, journalists and members of the public had to leave the courtroom.

Jean-Philippe Deniau, a journalist who covers the judiciary for France Inter Radio and who has followed the trial, says the videos are essential to the people's understanding of the case.

They would be no more disturbing that some of the evidence he has seen in the past, he said.

""When we work on trials about terrorist attacks, crimes, murders ... there are always difficult moments,"" Deniau said.

As an example, he mentioned hearing several defendants earlier this week testify they had come to the Pelicots' house in Provence to have consensual sexual intercourse, and that they were taking part in a ""game"" to see if they could get Gisèle Pelicot to wake up.

Deniau said that following the ruling on Friday, the court was later in the day shown one four-minute recording from the collection of videos. In his opinion, Deniau said the video appeared to counter claims by the defendants of a consensual ""game."""

(AP) -- A man fatally shot his 81-year-old wife and then took his own life at a Connecticut nursing home Friday, according to a company official.

The woman, who had been a resident of Apple Rehab in Cromwell for three years, was shot in her room, Michael Landi, vice president of operations for Apple Rehab, said in a statement.

The woman did not have a roommate, and no one witnessed the shooting, Landi said. No one else was hurt, he said.

Landi said that the motive was unclear and that there were no known threats in the past.

""Our focus will remain on our staff and residents and we will be providing any and all resources and counseling services that they may need to get through this tragic event, many of which are already onsite,"" he said, adding there was ""great sadness.""

Police were on the scene investigating. A police spokesperson did not immediately return an email seeking comment.

Apple Rehab operates about 20 care centers in Connecticut and Rhode Island. The Cromwell location where the shooting happened is about 13 miles (21 kilometers) south of Hartford.

Damion Blevins, 33, was arrested outside a Portland, Oregon, convenience store after a three-day search and will be extradited back to Washington, the Seattle Times reported.

Blevins was convicted in 2017 of second-degree assault on a woman and was deemed a ""sexually violent predator,"" according to the newspaper. He was civilly committed to a barbed wire-ensconced treatment facility on McNeil Island, about 14 miles (22.5 kilometers) southwest of Tacoma, Washington. He had recently been granted court permission to live in less restrictive conditions in a Tukwila neighborhood.

The Department of Corrections and the Department of Social and Health Services will investigate what went wrong.

Department of Corrections spokesperson Christopher Wright said the agency is gathering details on what happened since he was last seen Monday at a Seattle station, where he likely took a train to Portland.

The incident is among the more severe lapses in supervision of community housing placements in recent years, the newspaper reported.

No attorney for Blevins was listed in court or jail records. He is scheduled for an arraignment hearing Monday in Portland."

The justices on Friday agreed to review an appellate ruling that upheld the dismissal of the discrimination lawsuit filed by the woman, Marlean Ames, against the Ohio Department of Youth Services. Arguments probably will take place early next year.

Ames, who has worked for the department for 20 years, contends she was passed over for a promotion and then demoted because she is heterosexual. Both the job she sought and the one she had held were given to LGBTQ people.

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 bars sex discrimination in the workplace. A trial court and the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruled against Ames.

The question for the justices is that the 6th Circuit and several other appeals courts apply a higher standard when members of a majority group make discrimination claims. People alleging workplace bias have to show ""background circumstances,"" including that LGBTQ people made the decisions affecting Ames or statistical evidence showing a pattern of discrimination against members of the majority group.

The appeals court noted that Ames didn't provide any such circumstances."
Mexico's new president promises to resume fight against climate change,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mexico-scheinbaum-energy-transition-climate-change-renewables-93a78b5f2c22d1eab0494a3d6dfaa5e9,2024-10-04T15:10:24Z,"MEXICO CITY (AP) -- In her first days as Mexico's new president, Claudia Sheinbaum made a point of distancing herself from the fossil fuel reliance promoted by her predecessor and mentor, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, and vowed to resume an energy transition that he halted.

""We are going to boost renewable energies. The goal is that by 2030, they will have a 45% share (of total electricity production),"" she said Tuesday in her first public speech in the capital's Zocalo square, shortly after being sworn in as the country's first woman president.

Specifics are still scant, but her speech marks a sharp departure from the energy policy of former President López Obrador, a fierce defender of fossil fuels who, among other things, spent more than $20 billion to build a new oil refinery and stopped the auctions that had allowed developers to build solar and wind farms in the country.

The president said in the coming days she will unveil an ""ambitious energy transition program"" aimed at ""the reduction of greenhouse gases that cause climate change.""

Yet Sheinbaum has also promised to strengthen the nation's Federal Electricity Commission, which owns older plants that mainly burn fossil fuels, and state-owned oil company Pemex.

Even without specifics, experts and environmentalists said the change in rhetoric was notable.

""The terms 'sustainability' or 'renewable energy' really never appeared,"" in López Obrador's policies, said Rosanety Barrios, who worked for more than a decade at the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commission. ""He didn't use the term in any speech, in any document. And she has been using it all the time.""

During her campaign, Sheinbaum repeatedly promised to promote renewable energy to meet an increasing demand for electricity, due in part to rising temperatures from climate change. In a speech to Congress, also on Tuesday, with López Obrador sitting a few steps from her, the promises seemed more tangible.

The goal of reaching 45% clean electricity by 2030 is well above the 24% it represented last year, according to the Ministry of Energy. If achieved, Mexico would be back on track to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement, which seeks to keep the global average temperature to no more than two degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

The energy policy promoted by López Obrador led Climate Action Tracker, an organization which evaluates the actions countries take to comply with the Paris Agreement, to downgrade Mexico's rating to ""critically insufficient.""

In her speech to Congress, the president also announced what would be the country's first ever limit on oil production - 1.8 million barrels per day. All crude oil in Mexico is produced by Pemex, and that amount is approximately what the company produced in 2023 on an average day.

It is far less than the 2.6 million barrels per day López Obrador promised at the beginning of his term.

Sheinbaum recalled that more than a decade ago, a 2013 energy reform promoted by then President Enrique Peña Nieto proposed production of 3 million barrels per day. ""That is environmentally impossible,"" she said. ""It is better to promote efficiency and renewable sources.""

At the same time, however, Sheinbaum has vowed to ""strengthen Pemex"" and she never criticized the building of the new Dos Bocas refinery, paying several visits to it with López Obrador.

Experts said Mexico would not be able to increase oil production using current methods, because its fields are getting tapped out.

""Mexico has ten years of oil left at its current rate of production, which is modest. Mexico is almost out of oil,"" said Adrian Fernandez, who holds a PhD in environmental science from Imperial College London and directs the Mexico Climate Initiative, a think tank.

But Fernández nevertheless praised Scheinbaum's words ""because it means she is not going to try to increase oil production.""

Mexico would have to invest significant money either in hydraulic fracturing, also known as fracking, or deepwater exploration to increase production beyond current levels, he said. Up until now, the country has rejected both of these.

Fernández also said Sheinbaum's speech is ""totally consistent with her experience and knowledge."" The president has a PhD in energy engineering and degrees in physics, and was part of the United Nations panel of experts on climate change that won the Nobel Prize in 2007.

This week, Sheinbaum saw firsthand the havoc that climate change is wreaking in Mexico. On Wednesday, on her first trip as the country's leader, she visited Acapulco, in the southern state of Guerrero, to assess the damage caused by Hurricane John, which struck the coast first as a hurricane and then again as a tropical storm last week.

The storm left a trail of devastation while the city was still recovering from last year's Hurricane Otis. The strengh of both hurricanes was turbocharged by rising ocean temperatures due to global warming.

But the big question is whether the new president will be able to achieve her goals within Mexico's current legal framework. Before leaving office, López Obrador pushed through a constitutional reform that strongly favors the Federal Electricity Commission.

On one hand, Sheinbaum has supported that legal change and promised the state will keep control of 54% of electricity generation. On the other, she has committed to reopening private investment in renewable energy, stopped by López Obrador to favor the state-owned CFE.

""From my point of view, the biggest problem Claudia has is legal uncertainty,"" Barrios said.

Supreme Court to weigh a Texas death row case after halting execution,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/texas-execution-ruben-gutierrez-dna-testing-b8bfc9ccc170156d8b2cd387beac56fb,2024-10-04T15:04:28Z,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. Supreme Court will hear the case of a Texas man on death row who has long argued that DNA testing would help prove he didn't kill an 85-year-old woman during a home robbery decades ago.

The order came down Friday in the case of Ruben Gutierrez, months after the justices stayed his execution 20 minutes before he was scheduled to die by lethal injection.

Gutierrez was condemned for the 1998 stabbing of Escolastica Harrison at her home in Brownsville, on the state's southern tip.

Prosecutors said the killing of the mobile home park manager and retired teacher was part of an attempt to steal more than $600,000 she had hidden in her home because of her mistrust of banks.

Gutierrez has long asked for DNA testing on evidence like Harrison's nail scrapings, a loose hair wrapped around one of her fingers and various blood samples from within her home.

His attorneys have said there's no physical or forensic evidence connecting him to the killing. Two others were also charged in the case.

Prosecutors said the request for DNA testing is a delay tactic and that Gutierrez's conviction rests on other evidence, including a confession in which he admitted to planning the robbery and that he was inside her home when she was killed.

Gutierrez was convicted under Texas' law of parties, which says a person can be held liable for the actions of others if they assist or encourage the commission of a crime. He has had several previous execution dates in recent years that have been delayed."
Relatives say a whole family was killed in Israel's deadliest West Bank strike since Oct. 7,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/israel-hamas-west-bank-strike-tulkarem-militants-1656f77bb28acdfb3d72ec5fccd628e9,2024-10-04T12:17:08Z,"TULKAREM, West Bank (AP) -- An Israeli airstrike on a West Bank cafe that the military said targeted Palestinian militants also killed a family of four, including two young children, relatives told The Associated Press on Friday.

The strike slammed into a three-story building in the Tulkarem refugee camp late Thursday, setting it on fire, destroying a popular cafe and killing at least 18 Palestinians, according to the territory's Health Ministry. It was the deadliest strike in the West Bank since the start of the Israel-Hamas war nearly a year ago.

On Friday, paramedics searched the rubble inside the blasted-out coffee shop, gathering human remains into small boxes. Young boys and men walked among the ruins of the shop, with holes in the ceiling and debris blanketing the ground, digging past bloodstained furniture and dislodged iron beams for anything to salvage.

Among the dead was the Abu Zahra family: Muhammad, a bakery worker; his wife, Saja; and their two children, Sham, 8, and Karam, 6, according to the man's brother, Mustafa Abu Zahra, who said the family lived above the coffee shop. He added that one of Muhammad's brothers-in-law was also in the apartment at the time and was killed.

The Israeli military said the strike killed several militants, including Hamas' leader in the camp, who it accused of planning and taking part in multiple attacks against Israeli civilians. Tulkarem, known to be a hotbed of Palestinian militancy, is a flashpoint in the West Bank and a frequent target of Israeli military raids.

Hamas, which did not immediately claim any of the dead as its fighters, condemned the strike and called for Palestinians in Tulkarem to rise up.

Israel has carried out several large-scale raids in the West Bank since the start of the war in Gaza, ignited by Hamas' Oct. 7 attack on southern Israel. While airstrikes used to be rare in the Palestinian territory, they have grown more common since the outbreak of war as Israeli forces clamp down, saying they aim to prevent attacks on their citizens.

Israeli fire has killed at least 722 Palestinians in the West Bank since Oct. 7, Palestinian health officials say. In that time, Palestinian militants have launched a number of attacks on soldiers at checkpoints and within Israel.

A shooting attack in Tel Aviv earlier this week that Israeli police said was carried out by Palestinians from the West Bank left at least six people dead.

Nimer Fayat, the owner of Dr. Coffee, said the cafe was full with ""regular customers coming to eat and drink"" when the strike occurred around 10:15 p.m.

""What happened was a very strong blow, the likes of which we had not seen in the past since the Al-Aqsa Intifada,"" he said, using a Palestinian term for the second intifada, or uprising, in the early 2000s.

Paramedics rushing to the area encountered a ghastly scene, with body parts flung onto power lines by the force of the blast, said Nebal Farsakh, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Red Crescent, whose teams brought nine dead to the hospital.

A full list of the dead and wounded was not immediately released by the Palestinian Health Ministry.

Yasser Jibra, another relative of the Abu Zahras, said the strike was ""like a lightning bolt.""

""Look around, the destruction is so obvious,"" he said, adding that it was difficult to identify the bodies of his loved ones.

The Israeli military did not immediately respond to a request for comment on civilian deaths in the strike. Israel says it takes care to guard against such deaths.

But to Jibra, that means little.

""This is the work of the criminal occupation, which does not take into account the presence of a child or a woman, or an elderly or young person,"" he said, as he stood inside the blasted-out cafe. ""Everything is permissible for them.""

Clashes in Kenya as people discuss the deputy president's impeachment motion,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/kenya-deputy-president-impeachment-ff1e3f2172b0e8b3b3753b68ca57893c,2024-10-04T11:37:13Z,"NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) -- Supporters and opponents of Kenya's deputy president clashed Friday at public forums over an impeachment motion against him, which was introduced in parliament by the ruling alliance this week. Rigathi Gachagua is accused of supporting anti-government protests in June and of being involved in corruption and other irregularities, charges he denies.

A motion for the impeachment of Gachagua was proposed in parliament on Tuesday and Kenyans were given until Friday to fill out public participation forms at their constituencies. Public forums are being held across the country to discuss the impeachment.

In the capital, Nairobi, a public forum at the Bomas of Kenya turned violent as supporters of President William Ruto clashed with those supporting Gachagua. Chairs were thrown in the auditorium and an activist Morara Kebaso, known for exposing stalled government projects, said he had been injured.

In central Kenya's Nyeri county, police clashed with supporters of the deputy president as they chanted that there would be no president if his deputy is impeached. The two were elected on a joint ticket.

In Nyandarua county, opponents were called out as being traitors and were chased out of the community hall.

Some 291 legislators, more than the 117 constitutional requirement, signed the impeachment motion before it was introduced, but a number of them from the deputy president's home tuff say they no longer support the motion after hearing contrary views from their constituents.

""If the deputy president is guilty, then his boss the president is equally guilty,"" a woman supporter told Citizen TV.

Gachagua is facing impeachment on 10 grounds that include corruption, ethnic discrimination and contradicting government policies.

He has maintained that he is innocent and has vowed to fight the impeachment motion.

The high court on Thursday declined to stop Friday's public participation and set next Wednesday as the date for the hearing.

President Ruto has not weighed into his deputy's impeachment debate.

He is on record in the earlier days of his presidency saying he would not publicly humiliate his deputy, alluding to the troubled relationship he had with his predecessor Uhuru Kenyatta during their second term in office.

The senate is expected to hear the impeachment motion on Tuesday next week."
Progressive prosecutors in Georgia faced backlash from the start. They say it's all politics.,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-prosecutors-election-deborah-gonzalez-cook-jones-c48d490952db1f0845db0ecf2fbab5b9,2024-10-04T05:16:56Z,"ATHENS, Ga. (AP) -- Two Georgia district attorneys who promised criminal justice reforms are facing reelection races that will test whether progressive prosecutors in liberal pockets of the swing state can survive intense blowback from state Republicans and some prominent local Democrats.

Shalena Cook Jones of Chatham County and Deborah Gonzalez of Athens-Clarke and Oconee counties were elected in 2020 in the wake of nationwide protests against racial injustice. They, like dozens of other progressive prosecutors elected to office over the past decade, promised a holistic approach to prosecuting that offers diversion programs, rehabilitation and shorter sentences for nonviolent offenders.

Cook Jones and Gonzalez say the criticism is political and misleading. But opponents say they have led dysfunctional offices that let people convicted of violent crimes off the hook. Among their critics are Democrats including Athens-Clarke County Mayor Kelly Girtz and Savannah Mayor Van Johnson, a former police officer.

Pushback against progressive prosecutors is not new: Republicans in Texas, Indiana, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Missouri and Florida have tried to remove those who they disparagingly call ""woke prosecutors."" In Georgia, Republicans frustrated with Gonzalez passed legislation to discipline and remove prosecutors if they fall afoul of a newly created commission.

In 2020, Cook Jones unseated her former boss, Chatham's tough-on-crime, Republican, incumbent district attorney, Meg Heap. Cook Jones was the first African American woman elected in a county that includes Savannah, which is over 50% Black. In May, she easily won her Democratic primary.

Gonzalez's circuit includes Athens-Clarke County, which is mostly liberal, and Oconee County, which is mostly conservative. She didn't face a primary challenger in May.

When Gonzalez took office, she released a memorandum detailing revised policies on prosecution, sentencing and rehabilitation programs. But she quickly retracted it because of intense backlash.

""I think part of it is because I'm outspoken and I am unapologetically a Democrat, and I consider myself a progressive prosecutor,"" Gonzalez said of the criticism. ""There are many prosecutors who don't like that word -- progressive -- but to me, what it means is that we need to look at this differently. ... We need to always ask ourselves, 'Is this in the interest of justice?'""

In 2023, Republican Gov. Brian Kemp traveled to Savannah to sign a law creating a commission that he said could go after ""far-left prosecutors"" who are ""making our communities less safe.""

Cook Jones said such rhetoric contributes to a ""smear campaign"" against reform-minded prosecutors who seek to reduce incarceration rates that skyrocketed since the 1990s because of punitive policies for low-level drug offenses that were disproportionately enforced for people of color.

Cook Jones also said people overlook mistakes made by other district attorneys.

""The progressives are under a microscope,"" said Jessica Brand of The Wren Collective, a criminal justice group of former public defenders. ""So I think people are looking harder for flaws.""

Former DeKalb County District Attorney J. Tom Morgan said Cook Jones and Gonzalez are under attack for the simple reason that they aren't good at their jobs.

""When your district attorney is more political than prosecutorial oriented ... you're going to have problems leading the DA's office,"" he said.

After Cook Jones and Gonzalez took office, dozens of staff left.

Though turnover is normal when new district attorneys enter office and offices across Georgia face staffing shortages, it is especially pronounced for progressive prosecutors.

The early exodus in Gonzalez's office was driven by policy disagreements, said Patrick Najjar, a former prosecutor under Gonzalez. But it didn't take long for the office to descend into a ""downward spiral"" due to poor management, he said, adding that he was overwhelmed by his caseload and left after five months.

June Teasley, who left Gonzalez's office to work for Cook Jones until she had a child, said Gonzalez didn't have the prosecutorial experience for the job.

""People left Shalena's office because they didn't like the idea of progressive prosecution,"" Teasley said. ""People left Deborah's office because they couldn't function under her disjointed attempt to be a progressive prosecutor.""

Girtz, the Athens-Clarke County mayor, supported Gonzalez when she ran for state House and for DA. But now, he is supporting her independent opponent Kalki Yalamanchili.

""Even if you call yourself a progressive, part of that is just making sure that the wheels of justice turn and don't grind to a halt,"" Girtz said. ""And unfortunately, the wheels are not turning very smoothly these days.""

Yalamanchili has said he would clean up the ""general dysfunction"" in the office, including low conviction rates. Gonzalez blames staffing shortages and said she hired eight prosecutors in recent months.

Gonzalez also has faced legal reprimands, including having been cited at least four times for not communicating with victims about cases and sued for violating open records laws. She said her critics are trying to ""distract"" from her office's accomplishments, which include expunging people's records, resentencing five people and referring 15 juveniles to restorative justice programs.

Gonzalez and Cook Jones also had large case backlogs from the pandemic, which both have mostly cleared.

Cook Jones has mostly restaffed her office. Still, safety concerns from residents led Cook Jones' opponent, former employee Andre Pretorius, to run against her.

Johnson, Savannah's Democratic mayor, criticized Cook Jones in August when, without notifying the mayor's office, she publicly dismissed six murder cases involving two Savannah police officers who have been indicted on perjury charges.

""My expectation is that when my police make the arrest, this community has to have the assurance that they are going to be aggressively prosecuted,"" Johnson said, referring to Cook Jones' overall performance.

Cook Jones has said her office examined each case and determined they wouldn't hold up in court.

""I've gotten a black eye for dismissing murder cases that should not have been murder cases,"" she said.

Nathanael Wright, one of Cook Jones' former prosecutors, called Cook Jones' predecessor ""prosecution happy"" and said she left the office with ""crappy murder cases.""

Brian DeBlasiis, Cook Jones' chief assistant district attorney, is a Republican who worked for her predecessor.

DeBlasiis said Cook Jones is meticulous when she considers reducing a charge and has forged close relationships with law enforcement.

""If my wife was murdered tomorrow, I would want them trying the case,"" DeBlasiis said of Cook Jones' office.

Cook Jones hopes voters will dismiss ""the political back and forth"" and focus on her work, including attempts to expand diversion programs, expunge records and examine wrongful convictions. She said she concentrates legal resources on violent cases, since 80% of the cases that come to her desk are nonviolent while less than 1% are homicides.

In September, she announced a murder indictment against a former Savannah police officer who fatally shot a Black man in 2022. She explained that she has a ""dual responsibility"" to ""cultivate good working relationships"" with law enforcement and hold public officials accountable when they break laws.

Like Gonzalez, Cook Jones has faced her own legal woes, including an ethics complaint for not filing campaign documents. She also was sanctioned for unethical behavior, including missed court dates and ""material misrepresentations"" related to a workplace discrimination lawsuit a former staffer brought against her. Jones denies the allegations and said she was busy representing a rape victim when the judge called her for the deposition dates.

Cook Jones is used to public reprimands and said she is tired of it.

""I have suffered, bled and died for this DA office over and over and over again,"" Cook Jones said in an interview. ""If they don't want me, I'm fine with that. That means I can go back to my family and raise my kids.""

"For migrant women who land in Colorado looking for jobs, a common answer emerges: No",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/immigration-us-work-permit-tps-aurora-colorado-30dc5eeac61cfa7cb36872f348637844,2024-10-04T04:16:38Z,"AURORA, Colo. (AP) -- East Colfax Avenue was the best place to find a job. That's what everyone told Sofia Roca.

Never mind the open drug use, the sex workers or the groups of other migrant women marching the sidewalks soliciting work at the very same Mexican restaurants and bakeries.

On East Colfax in Aurora, Colorado, bosses and customers would speak Spanish and might be willing to hire someone like Roca -- a 49-year-old immigrant from Colombia -- without legal authorization to work. That was the rationale for going back to Colfax each morning, fruitless as it was.

""Do you know how to cook Mexican food?"" asked one woman, looking up from the limes she was quartering, when Roca inquired about a kitchen position advertised on the door. Roca's accent was a giveaway: not Mexican.

As record numbers of South Americans attempt to cross the U.S. southern border seeking better economic opportunities, many are landing in communities that are unprepared for them -- and sometimes outright hostile.

And many migrants have also been unprepared for the realities of their new home.

Women are leaving Colombia, and to a greater extent Venezuela, to escape starvation and violence, to provide for their children and to seek medical care. They represent some of the more than 42,000 migrants who have arrived in the Denver area over two years. Many didn't know anyone in Denver. But it was the closest city to which Texas was offering free bus rides, both to relieve pressure on its towns and to make a political point to liberal-leaning cities about immigration's impact on the border.

From Denver, untold numbers made their way to the neighboring suburb of Aurora, lured by cheaper rent and abundant Spanish speakers. But finding a job and an affordable place to stay has been anything but easy, and women face their own particular challenges.

Last year, nearly 900,000 women and girls tried to cross the U.S. southern border, more than a fivefold increase over the last decade, U.S. Customs and Border Protection data shows. Like many of them, Roca came to the United States to help her children. Her adult daughter back in Colombia suffers from lupus and can't afford ""the good medicines.""

The economy in Colombia never recovered from pandemic shutdowns, and Roca heard from acquaintances that in the United States she could earn $1,000 a week. ""That's a lot of money in Colombia,"" she said. Back home, ""one U.S. dollar can buy breakfast for your entire family.""

Roca set out for the United States with an uncle. He was detained in Mexico, but Roca made it across the border in Juárez and told U.S. agents she was seeking asylum. She heard from a shelter worker in El Paso that Denver was offering free housing for migrants and Texas would pay to get her there.

As of September, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has bused at least 119,000 migrants from the border to cities run by Democratic mayors, including Denver, New York, Chicago and Washington, D.C., according to a press release from the governor's office.

Roca arrived in November and stayed for two weeks in a hotel-turned-shelter paid for by the city of Denver. When she went looking for work in front of Home Depot and along East Colfax, she observed an icy reception from locals. ""They said horrible things about Venezuelans,"" she said.

She didn't know the benefits many recent migrants have received -- specifically, a path to a temporary work visa and with it better-paying jobs -- were causing resentment among Aurora's large Mexican community. Many have loved ones in the country illegally or have themselves lived for years in the United States without legal permission to work.

As chaos and economic collapse drove more migrants to the border, President Joe Biden's administration created and expanded legal pathways to enter the U.S., with the possibility of applying for work permits. However, in June, Biden temporarily suspended asylum for new immigrants who cross illegally, ending a main pathway to legal work.

Roca never was eligible for a work permit, but Mexican residents in Aurora still associate her with the many migrants who are.

Resentment for newcomers was building in another corner of Aurora, too -- City Hall. Aurora officials in February had warned other communities against housing migrants there, vowing not to spend city money to help them. This summer, Aurora's mayor repeated a landlord's claim that a notorious Venezuelan gang had taken over an apartment building, saying he would investigate how so many Venezuelans ended up living in Aurora. Even though police say gangs hadn't taken over the building, former President Donald Trump took up the claim, mentioning it at his campaign rallies. The mayor last month walked back some of his comments.

Roca never made a deliberate decision to settle in Aurora. To her, it wasn't clear where Denver ended and Aurora began, or that Denver was more eager to help migrants coming to the area.

So when her time is almost up at the Denver shelter, she does the only thing she knows to do: She heads to East Colfax in Aurora.

She walks up and down the sidewalks, dodging people who'd taken over the bus shelters to shoot up drugs or smoke fentanyl and who sell apparently shoplifted toiletries on the sidewalks. She approaches migrants holding cardboard signs and begging for money outside Walmart, asking if they know of work or a place to stay.

A man standing by his truck parked outside a Goodwill thrift store catches her attention. He is singing along to rap music in Spanish. He seems happy, she thinks. He seems like a good guy.

He says he can help her and her cousin, who arrived a few weeks earlier. But not in Colorado. She can come back to Kentucky with him and his family. To hold her over in the short term, the man -- El Cubano, she calls him -- gives her $10 and invites her for ice cream.

After more than a week of staying with the family in Kentucky and cooking and eating meals together, Roca learns El Cubano's wife works in el negocio, or ""the business."" There is not much work in Kentucky, so she earns her money through sex work, she tells Roca, while her kids play a few feet away.

A few days later, while they are cooking dinner together at the couple's trailer, a Mexican man in his 30s pulls up outside in a pickup truck.

He'd seen a picture of Roca and liked her -- and would pay $1,000 for two nights with Roca, the wife says. Roca would keep $600, the couple would get $400. Roca would have to pay him $6 for each ride to and from his house.

Roca stops chopping the onion and looks at her cousin. Don't go with that man, the cousin says. You don't know him.

Roca considers all of the jobs she's done in her life. Caring for Alzheimer's patients as a home health aide. Answering phones at a call center. Selling beauty products on the street in Mexico.

In her month in the United States, she has quickly come to understand she'll have to make sacrifices in this country. That the reports she'd heard back in Colombia about earning $1,000 a week were likely hyperbole. That she'll have to push her body to its limits doing manual labor. She'll have to accept below-standard wages until she gets work permission, if it ever comes. She'll have to stay in someone's living room with other new arrivals and give up her privacy.

But subjecting herself to the whims of a stranger in such an intimate and vulnerable way?

""No,"" she tells the woman. ""I'm not going anywhere with anyone.""

The man is told to leave. The insults start immediately.

How are you going to earn money, girl? asks the woman. You're not going to just live here for free. The food here is good, isn't it? But it's not free.

Roca doesn't know what to expect -- maybe violence. She and her cousin have no money or transportation. They're essentially trapped. But a few days later, Roca leaves as El Cubano yells insults from his trailer. A Venezuelan woman she met outside Home Depot finds someone to help them leave Kentucky.

Where did they want to go? Somewhere she knew people, she remembers thinking. Somewhere with other migrants.

Back to Aurora and East Colfax Avenue.

Back in Aurora, Roca reached out to a Venezuelan woman she'd met briefly begging for money outside the Walmart on Colfax. Soon she took a place in the woman's living room, sharing a queen-sized blow-up mattress with the woman's teenage son.

Roca found a job on the weekends helping a man set up and break down his stall at an outdoor flea market. She hefted large sacks of used clothing over her shoulders, put out the clothing on display, talked to customers. All for $10 an hour. ""It's an abusive wage,"" she said, ""but it's a job.""

She tried standing outside Home Depot, but found many people propositioned her for sex or wouldn't pay her after she completed legitimate jobs. She gave up standing outside a day laborer's center in Aurora when she didn't feel safe trying to jockey for work against dozens of men, who would push her out of the way and jump onto moving trucks rounding up workers.

On most days walking along Colfax Avenue, Roca says, men would solicit her for sex, holding up their fingers to signal how many hundreds of dollars they were willing to pay.

As she looked for work in March, she came across what looked like an old motel, a place she hadn't tried before. ""Is this a hotel or a motel? I don't know,"" she said as she opened the heavy metal door. ""Let's check.""

In the small vestibule, a 1970s-era cigarette vending machine stood in the corner. A grandfatherly man waited behind a plexiglass sliding window. There were no vacancies, but he urged her to try the bar in the back. ""They're always looking for girls,"" he said.

Roca walked to the rear of the building and recognized the name of the bar. ""I know about this place,"" she said.

At a few Mexican cantinas around Aurora and Denver, women are paid to talk and drink with men. ""Ficheras,"" as the women are known in Spanish, sell beers at a significant markup to men and pocket the profits. It can be a fast way to earn money, but also a route to sex trafficking or the drug trade. Visit these establishments, and you can see some ""ficheras"" wearing government-issued ankle bracelets with their sky-high heels. The bracelets were given to them by federal immigration officials to monitor their movements while they await immigration hearings.

""I don't think I have to do that yet,"" Roca said. ""But this street -- it only offers prostitution.""

Since returning to Aurora, Roca had discovered she has few options for establishing legal residence or working legally in the U.S. She told U.S. Border Patrol officials she plans to plead for asylum at her deportation hearing next year, but she doubts they will grant it. Ironically, what happened to her in Kentucky could help her win a visa. The U.S. government issues special visas to victims of sex trafficking here, but Roca has never wanted to report the Cuban couple, fearing they might come after her.

She had gotten in touch through Facebook with a high school friend from Colombia living for the last year in the northeastern United States. ""She's told me she can get me a job at a hotel and I can stay with her,"" she said. ""What would you do if you were me?"" she asked a reporter. ""Would you go?""

The idea of learning to move around a new American city exhausted Roca. But without more work, there wasn't much keeping her in Aurora. Her roommates were headed to eviction court the next week. She didn't know where she would go if they lost the apartment.

Two days later, with about $80 in her pocket, Roca boarded a Greyhound bus paid for by the city of Denver. She landed in a new town -- one that hasn't received busloads of migrants from Texas -- and reunited with her high school friend. (The Associated Press is not identifying her new location, since Roca is afraid the Cuban couple might seek her out after she spoke about them in the media.)

Roca's friend followed through on her promises, allowing her to live with her and connecting her to a job cleaning hotel rooms. Roca has already changed jobs and has found one she likes better. She walks through the city with ease -- and anonymously.

""It's a huge difference from my life in Denver,"" she says. ""There's less chaos, and no one has disrespected me. It's been a great refuge.""

She's not sure how long she'll stay. But Sofia Roca will never live in Aurora, Colorado, again.

Record-setting number of transgender candidates risk their lives in Brazil,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/brazil-transgender-trans-candidates-elections-41e80c76edee7fea645bd6e859ee0143,2024-10-04T04:13:10Z,"RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) -- Benny Briolly beamed as she strode through the concrete favela alleyway in a snow-white dress, volunteers proudly waving campaign flags emblazoned with her face.

The city councilwoman and nearly 1,000 other transgender politicians are running Sunday in every one of Brazil's 26 states, according to the nation's electoral court, which is tracking them for the first time. The number of candidacies has tripled since the last local elections four years ago, when trans rights group Antra mapped them.

As trans people have set their sights on political office, many have been met with intimidation efforts bent on turning them away, including a candidate in Brazil's biggest city who survived an assassination attempt last week.

More trans people -- 100 -- were murdered in Brazil last year than in any other country, according to Transgender Europe, a network of global non-profits that tracks the data. Those precise statistics are almost certainly driven by a combination of poor reporting elsewhere and Brazil's active network of advocates, but experts agree that transphobia is ubiquitous.

On International Women's Day last year, Nikolas Ferreira -- the federal lawmaker who received more votes than any other -- donned a blond wig in Congress' lower house. He said it allowed him to speak as a woman and denounce trans people.

In 2022 Rio state lawmaker Rodrigo Amorim called Briolly ""an aberration of nature"" in the state's legislature.

Such tactics rally voters by portraying trans people as a menace to be courageously fought, according to Ligia Fabris, a gender and law specialist and a visiting professor at Yale University.

Both Amorim and Ferreira were staunch allies of far-right former President Jair Bolsonaro.

Transgender politician Leonora Áquilla, a candidate for city council in Sao Paulo this year, said that Bolsonaro had inflamed transphobia and that she has had to stare down people shouting death threats to her face.

Bolsonaro lost his re-election bid to leftist Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in 2022 but transphobia has far from retreated.

Since entering the public eye, Briolly has received over 700 death threats. Some have included the address of her home in Rio de Janeiro's metro area and warnings that she would suffer the same fate as city councilwoman Marielle Franco, a champion for LGBTQ+ rights who was gunned down in 2018. That threat prompted the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights to demand that Brazil provide Briolly protection.

She won't be scared off her reelection bid even though some may want her dead.

""When we get into politics, our bodies become threats and we become constant targets,"" Briolly told the Associated Press, with the city of Niteroi -- across the bay from Rio -- stretching out behind her. ""Our bodies are revolutionary, are daring ... they are bodies that emanate hope to all those who were left behind.""

Áquilla narrowly escaped an assassination attempt on Sept. 26. She was in northern Sao Paulo on her way to look into reports of transphobia when a motorcycle deliberately slammed into her car. When she got out, the driver revved his engine, and instinctively she ducked. The bullet from his gun missed her, and he fired more shots as she lay there, pretending to be dead. He escaped and Áquilla has ceased in-person campaigning.

""There have been so many threats they became banal; we never thought it would happen. I'm completely in shock. I'm taking a sedative, because I can't control my nervousness, my anxiety,"" she said in a video call. ""Right on the eve of the election, the moment when I most need to be on the streets, they're trying to silence me.""

Duda Salabert, who is running for mayor in Brazil's sixth biggest city, Belo Horizonte, made history in 2022 when elected alongside another trans woman to Brazil's lower house of Congress. Their victories were widely regarded as a breakthrough for trans representation, but Salabert said that during that campaign she received death threats daily.

""I had to walk with an armed escort ... I had to vote with a bulletproof vest, according to police instructions, and I couldn't go into large crowds because I risked being attacked,"" she said.

This year, Salabert said she is seeking to become the first trans mayor of a major city in Latin America.

""It's a joy, because we're making history, but it's sad because our candidacy highlights the entire history of exclusion, violence and alienation of the transvestite and transgender community from electoral processes in Brazil and Latin America,"" she said in a video call.

Indianarae Siqueira, a trangender sex worker and longtime activist running to be a city councilor in Rio, says that increasingly seeing trans people occupy places of power has had a snowball effect.

""Those who managed to win and are there -- I think this is a reference and gives incentive so that people want to enter (politics),"" she said during an interview on the steps leading to Rio's municipal assembly.

Back in the Niteroi favela, Briolly agreed that there's an element of joy to playing an active role in politics, even amid the threats.

""For me, it's pride -- a latent, powerful pride -- that grows more and more in my heart and in the heart of each and every person who believes that my body and my voice are just a reflection, an empowerment of the collective struggle,"" she said. ""When a Black trans woman moves, she moves the whole of society."""
Subway rider shot in the head by police files claim accusing officers of recklessly opening fire,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/nypd-lawsuit-shooting-nyc-subway-delpeche-13115fdbddb1a66e5d9cbb02be2ef7c6,2024-10-03T22:50:36Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- A lawyer for a New York City subway rider who was inadvertently shot in the head by police at a station has filed a legal claim against the city, accusing the officers of showing ""carelessness and reckless"" disregard for the lives of others when they opened fire on a man holding a knife in front of a train.

Gregory Delpeche, 49, suffered a brain injury when he was hit by a bullet while riding the L train to his job at a Brooklyn hospital last month, according to the notice of claim, which is the first step in filing a lawsuit against the city.

The two officers opened fire on the man with the knife, Derell Mickles, after he entered the station without paying and refused to drop the weapon. They pursued Mickles onto an elevated platform, and briefly onto the train itself, demanding he relinquish the knife and deploying Tasers that failed to stop him.

Bodycam video later showed Mickles ran in the direction of one of the officers on the platform, though stopped when they pulled out their firearms. When they opened fire, he was standing still with his back to the train near an open door, where several passengers could be seen.

In addition to Delpeche and Mickles, the bullets also wounded one of the officers and another bystander, a 26-year-old woman.

The legal notice, filed Thursday by lawyer Nick Liakas, alleges Delpeche was hit due to the officers' ""carelessness and reckless disregard of the lives, privileges, and rights of others"" and says he is seeking $80 million in compensation.

It notes he ""is currently suffering with multiple cognitive deficits including deficits in his ability to speak and to form words"" and ""remains confined to a hospital bed in a level-one trauma center.""

Liakas said that since the Sept. 15 shooting, Delpeche has been able to communicate ""in few words, but with difficulty and delay.""

The city's law department declined to comment.

Police officials have defended the officers' actions. NYPD Chief of Patrol John Chell previously described the shooting as a ""tragic situation"" and said ""we did the best we could to protect our lives and the lives of people on that train.""

Mickles pleaded not guilty from a hospital bed to charges including attempted aggravated assault on a police officer, menacing an officer, weapons possession and evading his subway fare."
Garth Brooks accused of rape in lawsuit from hair-and-makeup artist,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/garth-brooks-lawsuit-6f40d39e2ba568cfa7f17f0091ee9d8d,2024-10-03T22:39:55Z,"LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A woman who says she worked as a hair-and-makeup stylist for Garth Brooks alleged in a lawsuit filed Thursday that he raped her in a Los Angeles hotel in 2019.

The woman does not use her name and goes by Jane Roe in the lawsuit filed in Los Angeles Superior Court. An email seeking comment from Brooks' publicist and attorney were not immediately answered.

The woman says in the lawsuit she had worked for Brooks' wife, country singer Trisha Yearwood, since 1999, and had started also working for Brooks in 2017.

She said the assault occurred when she traveled from Nashville to Los Angeles with Brooks, who was performing with soul singer Sam Moore at a Grammy Awards tribute to Moore in October 2019.

Brooks normally traveled with an entourage, but the two were alone on his private jet, and he booked just one hotel suite for both of them, the lawsuit says.

The woman alleges that in the suite, he appeared naked in the doorway to the bedroom and raped her.

The suit says that he then proceeded as though nothing had happened and expected her to do his hair and makeup immediately after.

She alleges that earlier in 2019, when she was at Brooks' home, he had appeared naked in front of her, grabbed her hands, and put them on his genitals.

The lawsuit says that Brooks filed his own preemptive lawsuit in federal court in Mississippi last month, in which both him and the woman are anonymous.

In court filings in that case, the plaintiff, going by John Doe, says the allegations are ""wholly untrue,"" and he first learned of them in July when she threatened to publicly sue him unless he gave her millions of dollars.

He asks a judge to stop the woman from ""intentional infliction of emotional distress, defamation, and false light invasion of privacy.""

The woman's suit also says Brooks exposed himself to her many other times and talked about sexual fantasies with her and sent her explicit text messages.

She said she was forced to keep working for Brooks because of financial hardship, which he knew about and took advantage of.

An email to the woman's attorney asking whether she had reported her allegations to police was not immediately answered.

Utah woman arrested after telling informant she shot her estranged husband in his sleep,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/utah-man-shot-wife-arrested-191ad81a32efc0a00414b6a8227982db,2024-10-03T20:43:54Z,"A Utah woman has been arrested for investigation of murder after she told a confidential informant that she shot her estranged husband in his sleep and buried him in a shallow grave but did not disclose the location, police said.

Jennifer Gledhill, 41 of Cottonwood Heights, was arrested Wednesday and is jailed in Salt Lake County without bond, according to court records.

The body of Matthew Johnson, 51, had not been found as of Thursday, police said. The Utah National Guard member was reportedly shot late Sept. 20 or early Sept. 21, the informant told police Sept. 28 -- six days after Gledhill ""openly admitted"" to killing Johnson, police records said.

Gledhill said she shot Johnson on the bed, buried his body and removed items from the house and destroyed them to cover up the crime, the informant said.

A search of the house found a bloodstain on the carpet under the bed, blood on the bed frame and evidence the wall had been bleached. Gledhill also had a new mattress, according to documents supporting her arrest.

Johnson has had no contact with anyone since Sept. 20, and he did not report to work Sept. 23, officials said. Investigators believe he is dead.

Other court records indicate the couple was going through a contentious divorce and a custody dispute involving their three children. Gledhill had obtained a temporary protective order against Johnson in late August, but a permanent order was denied Sept. 16 -- just days before the shooting -- after the court commissioner watched videos that Gledhill had taken of arguments and reviewed text message exchanges between the two.

Commissioner Russell Minas determined that no abuse had occurred. Glehill was equally confrontational, Minas said, and seeking a restraining order appeared to be ""a litigation tactic"" in their pending divorce, which had been filed in July.

""The conduct of the parties over the past several months is representative of a highly dysfunctional marriage bringing out the worst in the parties -- clearly suggestive that an action for divorce should have been filed long before reaching the current state of affairs,"" Minas wrote.

Gledhill's attorneys in the restraining order and divorce cases declined to comment Thursday. No attorney is listed for her in court records."
Twin babies who died alongside their mother in Georgia are youngest-known Hurricane Helene victims,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/hurricane-helene-victims-georgia-mother-babies-twins-9a1b3108488a582e1ea6cf44e3242c06,2024-10-03T18:56:42Z,"Georgia father Obie Lee Williams spent every morning looking forward to a daily phone call from his daughter. But their last conversation was fraught with fear as Kobe Williams, 27, told her father that she and her newborn twins were hunkering down alone at their trailer home in Thomson as Hurricane Helene ripped through the southeast.

Before hanging up to check on his other kids, he urged her to shelter in the bathroom with her month-old babies until the storm passed. Minutes later, she was no longer answering her family's calls.

One of her brothers dodged fallen trees and downed power lines to check on her later that day, and he could barely bear to tell his father what he saw.

A large tree had fallen through the roof, crushing Kobe and causing her to fall on top of infant sons Khyzier and Khazmir. All three were found dead.

""I'd seen pictures when they were born and pictures every day since, but I hadn't made it out there yet to meet them,"" Obie Lee Williams told The Associated Press days after the storm ravaged eastern Georgia. ""Now I'll never get to meet my grandsons. It's devastating.""

The babies, born Aug. 20, are the youngest known victims of a storm that had claimed 200 lives as of Thursday. Among the other young victims are a 7-year-old girl and a 4-year-old boy from about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south in Washington County, Georgia.

In the elder Williams' home city of Augusta, 30 miles (48 kilometers) east of his daughter's home in Thomson, power lines stretched along the sidewalks, tree branches blocked the roads and utility poles lay cracked and broken. The debris left him trapped in his neighborhood near the South Carolina border for a little over a day after the storm barreled through.

Kobe, a single mother nursing newborns, had told her family it wasn't possible for her to evacuate with such young babies, her father said.

Many of his 14 other children are still without power in their homes across Georgia. Some have sought refuge in Atlanta, and others have traveled to Augusta to see their father and mourn together. They are waiting for the bodies to be released by the county coroner and for roads to be cleared before arranging a funeral.

Williams described his daughter as a lovable, social and strong young woman who cared deeply about her large family. She always had a smile on her face and loved to make people laugh, he said.

She was studying to be a nursing assistant but had taken time off from school to give birth to her sons.

""That was my baby,"" her father said. ""And everybody loved her."""
"Melania Trump says she supports abortion rights, putting her at odds with the GOP",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/melania-trump-harris-abortion-election-2024-vance-walz-a9a44cf9d3113eb55e8c4346c7e1fe59,2024-10-03T18:10:42Z,"CHICAGO (AP) -- Melania Trump revealed her support for abortion rights Thursday ahead of the release of her upcoming memoir, exposing a stark contrast with her husband, Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump, on the crucial election issue.

In a video posted to her X account Thursday morning, the former first lady defended women's ""individual freedoms"" to do what they want with their body -- a position at odds with much of the Republican Party and her own husband, who has struggled to find a consistent message on abortion while wedged between anti-abortion supporters within his base and the majority of Americans who support abortion rights.

""Individual freedom is a fundamental principle that I safeguard,"" she said in the video. ""Without a doubt, there is no room for compromise when it comes to this essential right that all women possess from birth: individual freedom. What does 'my body, my choice' really mean?""

The video appears to confirm excerpts of her self-titled memoir reported by The Guardian on Wednesday.

Melania Trump has rarely publicly expressed her personal political views and has been largely absent from the campaign trail. But in her memoir, set to be released publicly next Tuesday, she argues that the decision to end a pregnancy should be left to a woman and her doctor, ""free from any intervention of pressure from the government,"" according to the published excerpts.

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body?"" she wrote, according to The Guardian. ""A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.""

Melania Trump writes that she has ""carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

These views contrast sharply with the GOP's anti-abortion platform and with Donald Trump, who has repeatedly taken credit for appointing the three Supreme Court justices who helped overturn Roe v. Wade and boasted about returning the abortion question to the states. Democrats have blamed the former president for the severe deterioration of reproductive rights as abortion bans were implemented in large swaths of the country following the overturning of the landmark case, which had granted a constitutional right to abortion.

Vice President Kamala Harris ' campaign noted Trump's role in ending Roe v. Wade in a statement reacting to Melania Trump's defense of abortion rights.

""Sadly for the women across America, Mrs. Trump's husband firmly disagrees with her and is the reason that more than one in three American women live under a Trump Abortion Ban that threatens their health, their freedom, and their lives,"" Harris campaign spokesperson Sarafina Chitika said in a statement. ""Donald Trump has made it abundantly clear: If he wins in November, he will ban abortion nationwide, punish women, and restrict women's access to reproductive health care.""

Donald Trump on Tuesday said he would veto a federal abortion ban, the first time he has explicitly said so after previously refusing to answer questions on the subject. Abortion rights advocates are skeptical, however, saying Trump cannot be trusted not to restrict reproductive rights.

Trump's campaign did not respond to a request for comment Thursday about Melania Trump's book or video.

Alexis McGill Johnson, president and CEO of Planned Parenthood Action Fund, said the memoir is another example of ""the Trumps playing voters like a fiddle.""

""As president, (Trump) made it his mission to get Roe v. Wade overturned,"" she said in a statement. ""Melania stood by him, never once publicly disavowing his actions until weeks before an election where our bodies are again on the ballot and they are losing voters to this issue. Read between the lines.""

Democratic strategist Brittany Crampsie called the memoir's release a ""clear attempt to appeal to more moderate voters and to moderate JD Vance's very clearly extreme views on the issue."" But she is skeptical that the move would work in favor of Trump, saying his shifting views ""have already confused voters and sowed distrust.""

Melania Trump also defends abortions later in pregnancy, asserting that ""most abortions conducted during the later stages of pregnancy were the result of severe fetal abnormalities that probably would have led to the death or stillbirth of the child. Perhaps even the death of the mother.""

""These cases were extremely rare and typically occurred after several consultations between the woman and her doctor,"" she writes.

These views appear diametrically opposed to her husband, who has often parroted misinformation about abortions later in pregnancy, falsely claiming that Democrats support abortion ""after birth,"" though infanticide is outlawed in every state.

Mary Ruth Ziegler, a law professor at the University of California, Davis School of Law who focuses on reproductive rights law and history, said it is unclear if the memoir's release so close to the election was an attempt to help Donald Trump. But she did note that Melania Trump's split from Trump on the issue is not uncommon historically.

There is ""a pretty deep history of first ladies being more supportive of abortion rights than their husbands,"" including Betty Ford, a vocal abortion rights supporter and the wife of former President Gerald Ford, Ziegler said.

Donald Trump promoted his wife's book at a September rally in New York, calling on supporters to ""go out and get her book."" It is unclear if the former president has read the book.

""Go out and buy it,"" he told the crowd. ""It's great. And if she says bad things about me, I'll call you all up, and I'll say, 'Don't buy it.'""

Dozens of migrants still missing off Djibouti's coast after smugglers forced them out of boats,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/migrants-djibouti-yemen-boats-28721e85bd552163ee92264aefd644f2,2024-10-03T16:42:31Z,"MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) -- Rescuers searched Thursday for dozens of migrants from Africa still missing after smugglers apparently forced them out of two boats in the Red Sea off the coast of Djibouti earlier this week, the Djiboutian coast guard said.

At least 48 people were earlier reported to have drowned. The boats had departed from Yemen, across the Red Sea on the Arabian Peninsula, carrying 310 people, the International Organization for Migration said.

It was not known why the migrants were forced off the boats while still at sea.

Initially, the IOM said the two boats with migrants had capsized but later made no mention of that, saying instead that the smugglers forced the people off the boats and told them to swim.

Djibouti's coast guard said the tragedy struck some 150 meters (about 500 feet) off a beach in the East African nation's northwestern region of Khor Angar. It said 115 survivors had been rescued.

Moktar Abdi, a member of the Djiboutian coast guard, told The Associated Press over the phone on Thursday that the search operation was now focusing on deep-sea areas and nearby beaches. He said the coast guard would later share an update on the number of recovered bodies.

On Wednesday, the IOM said 111 people were still missing while the Djiboutian coast guard put the number at 61.

""One woman drowned, but her 4-month-old infant survived along with 98 others from the first boat,"" said the U.N. agency, which was assisting search and rescue efforts.

Thousands of migrants from African, Middle Eastern and South Asian countries seeking a better life in Europe attempt irregular migration every year. Smugglers pack vessels full of desperate people willing to risk their lives to reach continental Europe.

Yemen has been embroiled in a civil war since 2014, when Iran-backed Houthi rebels seized the capital of Sanaa and much of the country's nort h, forcing the internationally recognized government into exile. A Saudi-led coalition of mostly Arab states entered the conflict the following year to back the government forces.

Over the past years, the war has become mostly stalemated along established front lines while efforts to find a negotiated solution have stalled."
Some New Orleanians skeptical of city and DOJ's request to exit consent decree,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/us-news/new-orleans-law-enforcement-general-news-d5cf861acf6ef30f4c2a8556d903dd02,2024-10-03T16:15:13Z,"Community members and elected officials are reacting to the city of New Orleans and U.S. Department of Justice's attempt to close a yearslong chapter of federal oversight of the New Orleans Police Department.

On Sept. 27, the city and DOJ asked U.S. District Judge Susie Morgan to begin to ramp down the police department's consent decree, which was put into place after a federal investigation found the department was engaging in unlawful behaviors, including excessive force, unconstitutional stops and discriminatory policing. City and federal officials say the department is now generally in compliance. Although not completely compliant in areas of searches and arrests, bias-free policing and community engagement, the DOJ has deemed NOPD's conduct sufficient enough to warrant transitioning to the sustainment period.

If approved by Morgan, the city and DOJ will enter a two-year ""sustainment"" period, during which the NOPD will have to demonstrate that it can follow certain benchmarks to police itself. Even if Morgan approves the request to exit the decree, she can reverse that decision if the NOPD fails to meet agreed upon benchmarks of the sustainment period, as the judge wrote in a notice last week.

But at two separate events this week, residents, activists and politicians expressed concern and curiosity about the possibility of less federal oversight. Some told Verite News that they still see misconduct in the NOPD and wonder who will hold the police accountable if the consent decree ends.

""At the end of the day, they need to be held accountable,"" Belden ""Noonie Man"" Batiste, a community activist, told Verite News at a community meeting held to discuss the city and DOJ's request to exit the decree.

The First District Police Community Advisory Board hosted the meeting on Sept. 30 at the Treme Recreation Community Center. Those in attendance heard from New Orleans police officers and Orleans Parish District Attorney Jason Williams and asked them questions.

Batiste said that he does not think NOPD is ready to exit the consent decree due to what he believes is excessive force and corruption. He referenced two recent events -- a Sept. 20 indictment of a former NOPD reserve officer on multiple charges and a Sept. 22 incident in which an officer allegedly punched a woman unconscious -- as evidence that the department isn't ready.

""It's a disgrace how some of the cops function,"" Batiste said. ""I'm not saying we have all bad cops -- we do have good cops -- but we ain't ready to get out of the consent decree.""

Verite News reached out to NOPD with questions about residents' critiques of the city and DOJ's request to exit the consent decree and was referred to the city's press release. They offered no further comment.

Charles Aponzo, a New Orleans resident who was at the Monday meeting, said that the consent decree has to end at some point and that he feels comforted knowing Morgan can change her decision based on how the police are complying with the benchmarks of the sustainment period.

Aponzo also said that he would like to see clear judgment, transparency and clarity from the city on where they want to go from here. He emphasized the need for implementing community input in a way that brings out people who do not typically come to community events like the one on Monday.

""Ultimately, I think it's a matter of defining 'community' effectively, and asking yourself who is in the room, who's not in the room and bringing people who are not into the room into the room,"" Aponzo said.

Jalence Isles, another city resident, also emphasized wanting the city to come up with additional ways to engage parts of the city that don't normally attend community events. She is concerned that the people who really need messages from the city about the consent decree are not receiving them.

""I appreciate ... efforts like this, but this clearly does not represent the broader community,"" Isles said. ""This represents the people that are already kind of informed, at least somewhat, about some of these things. I really wish that the city would develop a comprehensive communication plan for major things like this.""

Morgan Clevenger, president of the First District Police Community Advisory Board, said she thinks the most important thing with transitioning away from the consent decree is the city having events in place to engage with the public.

""If we don't have highly productive community engagement with the NOPD and vice versa, we're probably going to end up back where we started,"" Clevenger said.

State Sen. Royce Duplessis, D-New Orleans, was at Monday's meeting and told Verite that he and his constituents have many questions about lifting the consent decree.

""I think there's been a lot of great progress, but...I've heard from the community that there are still concerns around what oversight (there will) be when there's no longer the federal monitor. So, it still remains to be seen,"" Duplessis said.

Williams, the district attorney, told Verite News after the meeting that he understands that it can be scary to have the federal government step in to tell the police to treat people fairly.

""It's a scary situation, so it's very hard to just go back and say, 'okay, we trust you now, that you're going to do it,'"" Williams said.

But Williams said there is another aspect of the issue people should consider -- what the money used for the consent decree could go toward. He said the $5 million a year used to keep up with the decree could be instead invested in community organizations like police community advisory boards or into programs for young people.

Early Tuesday afternoon, members of New Orleans for Community Oversight of Police (NOCOP) and allies held a press conference outside of the federal district courthouse opposing the city's ask to move to sustainment.

Several speakers from local community and activist groups, like Freedom Road Socialist Organization and Eye on Surveillance, talked to the press about why they do not want an end to the consent decree. They connected the consent decree to local issues of immigration, police responses to a pro-Palestine encampment that occurred at Tulane University and some of their own interactions with the law.

NOCOP's Toni Jones said racially biased policing is the main reason why the organization does not think NOPD should move to exit the consent decree.

Jones cited the New Orleans Office of the Independent Police Monitor's 2023 annual report, which revealed that NOPD's use of force against Black women increased by 54.9 percent from 2021 to 2023. The report also said that 86% of NOPD use of force cases against women were against Black women and 90% of NOPD use of force cases against men were against Black men in 2023.

""This extreme disparity is due to NOPD racism, and not Black criminality,"" Jones said. ""We don't believe that racist policing is sustainable.""

"The Grammys' voting body is more diverse, with 66% new members. What does it mean for the awards?",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/grammy-awards-recording-academy-voting-diversity-women-c8f6d88c3821bb54efdb04fe1a3650b6,2024-10-03T15:11:07Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- For years, the Grammy Awards have been criticized over a lack of diversity -- artists of color and women left out of top prizes; rap and contemporary R&B stars ignored -- a reflection of the Recording Academy's electorate. An evolving voting body, 66% of whom have joined in the last five years, is working to remedy that.

At last year's awards, women dominated the major categories; every televised competitive Grammy went to at least one woman. It stems from a commitment the Recording Academy made five years ago: In 2019, the Academy announced it would add 2,500 women to its voting body by 2025. Under the Grammys' new membership model, the Recording Academy has surpassed that figure ahead of the deadline: More than 3,000 female voting members have been added, it announced Thursday.

""It's definitely something that we're all very proud of,"" Harvey Mason jr., academy president and CEO, told The Associated Press. ""It tells me that we were severely underrepresented in that area.""

Reform at the Record Academy dates back to the creation of a task force focused on inclusion and diversity after a previous CEO, Neil Portnow, made comments belittling women at the height of the #MeToo movement.

Since 2019, approximately 8,700 new members have been added to the voting body. In total, there are now more than 16,000 members and more than 13,000 of them are voting members, up from about 14,000 in 2023 (11,000 of which were voting members). In that time, the academy has increased its number of members who identify as people of color by 63%.

""It's not an all-new voting body,"" Mason assures. ""We're very specific and intentional in who we asked to be a part of our academy by listening and learning from different genres and different groups that felt like they were being overlooked, or they weren't being heard.""

Mason says that in the last five years, the Recording Academy has ""requalified 100% of our members, which is a huge step."" There are voters who have let their membership lapse -- and those who no longer qualify to be a voting member have been removed.

There have been renewal review processes in the past, but under the current model, becoming a voting member requires proof of a primary career in music, two recommendations from industry peers and 12 credits in a single creative profession, at least five of which must be from the last five years.

Comparisons might be made to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, which announced in 2016 that it would restrict Oscars voting privileges to active members -- ineligible parties included those who haven't worked in three decades since joining the Academy, unless they themselves are nominated -- as a response to #OscarsSoWhite criticisms of its lack of diversity. As a result, some members protested that the new measures unjustly scapegoated older academy members. The film academy has also grown its membership, adding more women and people from underrepresented racial and ethnic communities.

The Recording Academy sought to increase its voting body by reaching out to different, underrepresented communities, says Mason. ""Let's take the time to understand why those people aren't engaging with us, figure out how we can fix that,"" he said. ""And once we fixed it, then let's invite them or ask them if they would like to be a part of our organization. So, it was a multi-step process.""

Since 2019, the Recording Academy has also seen growth in voters across different racial backgrounds: 100% growth in AAPI voters, 90% growth in Black voters and 43% growth in Latino voters.

Still, Mason sees room to grow. Of the current voting membership, 66% are men, 49% are white and 66% are over the age of 40.

""Going forward, we're going to continue the work. We're going to continue to grow,"" he says.

That might not look like a public commitment to a specific figure, but Mason promises ""that our goals will be to be the most relevant, the most reflective, the most accurately representative of the music community that is humanly possible."""
Cambodian maid is arrested and deported by Malaysia for criticizing Cambodia leaders on social media,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/cambodia-maid-deport-malaysia-dissent-80e6155380d495511a30ae6cda174878,2024-10-03T14:41:35Z,"PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- A Cambodian woman who worked as a maid in Malaysia has been deported to her homeland for comments she posted on social media criticizing Cambodian government leaders, in the latest example of a Southeast Asian government helping another arrest a dissident.

A Cambodia prison official and an opposition activist group said Thursday that Nuon Toeun, 36, who had worked in Malaysia for several years, was arrested last week by Malaysian authorities following a request from the Cambodian government.

Human rights groups have criticized several Southeast Asian governments for helping each other harass, detain and deport political dissidents in exile. New York-based Human Rights Watch has urged the Thai government to stop forcing political dissidents to return to their authoritarian home countries, including Vietnam, Laos, Cambodia and China, where they might face torture, persecution or death.

Freedom House, a U.S.-based organization that promotes democracy, says the practice of attacking or sending back exiled dissidents ""is becoming a 'normal' phenomenon as more governments around the world use it to silence dissent.''

Nuth Sovana, a spokesperson for Cambodia's prison department, said Nuon Toeun was detained at Prey Sar prison in Phnom Penh upon her arrival in Cambodia on Tuesday. She was charged with incitement to commit a felony or cause social disorder and incitement to discriminate on the basis of race religion or nationality, he said. He couldn't provide details of the offenses she was accused of committing.

If convicted on both charges, she could face up to five years in prison and a fine.

Malaysian police and immigration officials couldn't immediately be reached for comment on her deportation.

Nuon Toeun is neither an opposition leader nor a well-known activist. However, Cambodia's government has expressed concern recently about overseas critics rallying support among Cambodian expatriates.

Nuon Toeun's arrest came shortly after a Cambodian investigative reporter, Mech Dara, known for exposing online scams and corruption, was charged with incitement to commit a felony for material he posted on social media.

Radio Free Asia, a U.S. government-funded news service that reports extensively on Cambodia, said Nuon Toeun often used social media to criticize Cambodia's leadership, including Prime Minister Hun Manet and his father Hun Sen, the former prime minister who is now the Senate president, over their handling of social issues.

Cambodia's government under the governing Cambodia People's Party has long been accused of silencing critics and political opponents.

Radio Free Asia said Nuon Toeun was a supporter of the opposition Cambodian National Rescue Party, which was dissolved ahead of the 2018 general election as part of a crackdown on the opposition. The Cambodian People's Party subsequently won every seat in the National Assembly.

A few days before her arrest, Nuon Toeun posted a video on Facebook in which she said she was ""expressing rage on behalf of the people living inside Cambodia,"" Radio Free Asia reported.

""If I have sinned because I (have cursed) this despicable guy, I am happy to accept the sin because he has mistreated my people so badly,"" she said, in a reference to Hun Sen, Radio Free Asia reported.

The Khmer Movement for Democracy, a movement formed by opposition leaders in exile, condemned Nuon Toeun's deportation from Malaysia. It said in a statement that she was working legally in Malaysia and had committed no crime except expressing her opinions.

It said her deportation without due process was a ""blatant violation of international law and a grave assault on human rights."""

Spider lovers scurry to Colorado town in search of mating tarantulas and community,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/tarantula-mating-colorado-spider-festival-da14f6d08bd4b325ce34970ec7864c73,2024-10-03T05:16:43Z,"LA JUNTA, Colo. (AP) -- Love is in the air on the Colorado plains -- the kind that makes your heart beat a bit faster, quickens your step and makes the hair on the back of your neck stand up.

It's tarantula mating season, when male spiders scurry out of their burrows in search of a mate, and hundreds of arachnophiles flock to the small farming town of La Junta to watch them emerge in droves.

Scientists, spider enthusiasts and curious Colorado families piled into buses just before dusk last weekend as tarantulas began to roam the dry, rolling plains. Some used flashlights and car headlights to spot the arachnids once the sun set.

Back in town, festivalgoers flaunted their tarantula-like traits in a hairy leg contest -- a woman claimed the title this year -- and paraded around in vintage cars with giant spiders on the hoods. The 1990 cult classic film ""Arachnophobia,"" which follows a small town similarly overrun with spiders, screened downtown at the historic Fox Theater.

For residents of La Junta, tarantulas aren't the nightmarish creatures often depicted on the silver screen. They're an important part of the local ecosystem and a draw for people around the U.S. who might have otherwise never visited the tight-knit town in southeastern Colorado.

Word spread quickly among neighbors about all the people they had met from out of town during the third year of the tarantula festival.

Among them was Nathan Villareal, a tarantula breeder from Santa Monica, California, who said he heard about the mating season and knew it was a spectacle he needed to witness. Villareal sells tarantulas as pets to people around the U.S. and said he has been fascinated with them since childhood.

""Colorado Brown"" tarantulas are the most common in the La Junta area, and they form their burrows in the largely undisturbed prairies of the Comanche National Grassland.

In September and October, the mature males wander in search of a female's burrow, which she typically marks with silk webbing. Peak viewing time is an hour before dusk when the heat of the day dies down.

""We saw at least a dozen tarantulas on the road, and then we went back afterwards and saw another dozen more,"" Villareal said.

Male tarantulas take around seven years to reach reproductive readiness, then spend the rest of their lifespan searching for a mate, said Cara Shillington, a biology professor at Eastern Michigan University who studies arachnids. They typically live for about a year after reaching sexual maturity, while females can live for 20 years or more.

The males grow to be about 5 inches long and develop a pair of appendages on their heads that they use to drum outside a female's burrow. She will crawl to the surface if she is a willing mate, and the male will hook its legs onto her fangs.

Their coupling is quick, as the male tries to get away before he is eaten by the female, who tends to be slightly larger and needs extra nutrients to sustain her pregnancy.

Like many who attended the festival, Shillington is passionate about teaching people not to fear tarantulas and other spiders. Tarantulas found in North America tend to be docile creatures, she explained. Their venom is not considered dangerous to humans but can cause pain and irritation.

""When you encounter them, they're more afraid of you,"" Shillington said. ""Tarantulas only bite out of fear. This is the only way that they have to protect themselves, and if you don't put them in a situation where they feel like they have to bite, then there is no reason to fear them.""

Many children who attended the festival with their families learned that spiders are not as scary as they might seem. Roslyn Gonzales, 13, said she couldn't wait to go searching for spiders come sunset.

For graduate student Goran Shikak, whose arm was crawling with spider tattoos, the yearly festival represents an opportunity to celebrate tarantulas with others who share his fascination.

""They're beautiful creatures,"" said Shikak, an arachnology student at the University of Colorado Denver. ""And getting to watch them do what they do ... is a joy and experience that's worth watching in the wild."""
A small town in central Thailand is mourning the 23 who died in a school bus fire,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/thailand-school-bus-fire-funeral-78b1bac792d9eff5febe6000182fdb0a,2024-10-03T04:23:30Z,"LAN SAK, Thailand (AP) -- A small town in central Thailand prepared for a somber mass funeral Thursday for the 23 children and teachers who died in a horrific bus fire while on a school trip.

Some residents and monks waited past midnight at Wat Khao Phraya Sangkharam, the Buddhist temple in Lan Sak town in Uthai Thani province, to receive the bodies of the dead returned from Bangkok. Also arriving back were relatives of the dead who went to the Thai capital to help identify the severely burned victims.

The school the children attended is on the temple grounds, a common location for schools in much of rural Thailand.

In the school's assembly hall, florists came early to build a large display of white flowers in front of a line of coffins with portraits of the dead. An elderly woman wept in front of a photo of a 14-year-old boy before limping away, tears streaming down her face and and hands tightly clutching a black plastic bag. Relatives put food, snacks and beverages as offerings on top of the coffins -- an act of respect symbolically sending nourishment and blessings to those who died.

The afternoon funeral was to be attended by the head of Thailand's Privy Council as a representative of the royal family. King Maha Vajiralongkorn has declared a royal cremation ceremony will be held for the victims next week.

Six teachers and 39 elementary and junior high school students were on the bus that caught fire Tuesday on a highway in suburban Bangkok. It spread so quickly, only 22 were able to escape.

On social media, parents have expressed nervousness about sending children on school field trips as well as deep outrage about potential safety lapses.

Police were investigating whether the fire was caused by negligence and filed several initial charges against the driver, including reckless driving and failing to stop to help others.

Police have not determined the cause but say the driver told them a front tire malfunctioned and the vehicle then scraped a concrete highway barrier. The sparks from the friction might have set off highly flammable gas canisters on the bus, police said.

The bus had 11 gas canisters inside, but a permit to install only six. Many Thai vehicles use compressed natural gas for fuel.

The bus company owner had told public broadcaster ThaiPBS the gas cylinders had passed safety standards.

Thailand's Department of Land Transport was implementing urgent inspections of all natural gas-fueled buses. The department also will upgrade its safety guidelines to require crisis management training for drivers and safety inspection when such vehicles are to be commissioned by schools, said Seksom Akraphand, the agency's deputy director-general."
"In South Korea, deepfake porn wrecks women's lives and deepens gender conflict",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-deepfake-porn-women-df98e1a6793a245ac14afe8ec2366101,2024-10-03T02:57:26Z,"SEOUL, South Korea (AP) -- Three years after the 30-year-old South Korean woman received a barrage of online fake images that depicted her nude, she is still being treated for trauma. She struggles to talk with men. Using a mobile phone brings back the nightmare.

""It completely trampled me, even though it wasn't a direct physical attack on my body,"" she said in a phone interview with The Associated Press. She didn't want her name revealed because of privacy concerns.

Many other South Korean women recently have come forward to share similar stories as South Korea grapples with a deluge of non-consensual, explicit deepfake videos and images that have become much more accessible and easier to create.

It was not until last week that parliament revised a law to make watching or possessing deepfake porn content illegal.

Most suspected perpetrators in South Korea are teenage boys. Observers say the boys target female friends, relatives and acquaintances -- also mostly minors -- - as a prank, out of curiosity or misogyny. The attacks raise serious questions about school programs but also threaten to worsen an already troubled divide between men and women.

Deepfake porn in South Korea gained attention after unconfirmed lists of schools that had victims spread online in August. Many girls and women have hastily removed photos and videos from their Instagram, Facebook and other social media accounts. Thousands of young women have staged protests demanding stronger steps against deepfake porn. Politicians, academics and activists have held forums.

""Teenage (girls) must be feeling uneasy about whether their male classmates are okay. Their mutual trust has been completely shattered,"" said Shin Kyung-ah, a sociology professor at South Korea's Hallym University.

The school lists have not been formally verified, but officials including President Yoon Suk Yeol have confirmed a surge of explicit deepfake content on social media. Police have launched a seven-month crackdown.

Recent attention to the problem has coincided with France's arrest in August of Pavel Durov, the founder of the messaging app Telegram, over allegations that his platform was used for illicit activities including the distribution of child sexual abuse. The South Korean government said Monday that Telegram has pledged to enforce a zero-tolerance policy on illegal deepfake content.

Police say they've detained 387 people over alleged deepfake crimes this year, more than 80% of them teenagers. Separately, the Education Ministry says about 800 students have informed authorities about intimate deepfake content involving them this year.

Experts say the true scale of deepfake porn in the country is far bigger.

The U.S. cybersecurity firm Security Hero called South Korea ""the country most targeted by deepfake pornography"" last year. In a report, it said South Korean singers and actresses constitute more than half of the people featured in deepfake pornography worldwide.

The prevalence of deepfake porn in South Korea reflects various factors including heavy use of smart phones; an absence of comprehensive sex and human rights education in schools and inadequate social media regulations for minors as well as a ""misogynic culture"" and social norms that ""sexually objectify women,"" according to Hong Nam-hee, a research professor at the Institute for Urban Humanities at the University of Seoul.

Victims speak of intense suffering.

In parliament, lawmaker Kim Nam Hee read a letter by an unidentified victim who she said tried to kill herself because she didn't want to suffer any longer from the explicit deepfake videos someone had made of her. Addressing a forum, former opposition party leader Park Ji-hyun read a letter from another victim who said she fainted and was taken to an emergency room after receiving sexually abusive deepfake images and being told by her perpetrators that they were stalking her.

The 30-year-old woman interviewed by The AP said that her doctoral studies in the United States were disrupted for a year. She is receiving treatment after being diagnosed with panic disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder in 2022.

Police said they've detained five men for allegedly producing and spreading fake explicit contents of about 20 women, including her. The victims are all graduates from Seoul National University, the country's top school. Two of the men, including one who allegedly sent her fake nude images in 2021, attended the same university, but she said has no meaningful memory of them.

The woman said the images she received on Telegram used photos she had posted on the local messaging app Kakao Talk, combined with nude photos of strangers. There were also videos showing men masturbating and messages describing her as a promiscuous woman or prostitute. One photo shows a screen shot of a Telegram chatroom with 42 people where her fake images were posted.

The fake images were very crudely made but the woman felt deeply humiliated and shocked because dozens of people -- some of whom she likely knows - were sexually harassing her with those photos.

Building trust with men is stressful, she said, because she worries that ""normal-looking people could do such things behind my back.""

Using a smart phone sometimes revives memories of the fake images.

""These days, people spend more time on their mobile phones than talking face to face with others. So we can't really easily escape the traumatic experience of digital crimes if those happen on our phones,"" she said. ""I was very sociable and really liked to meet new people, but my personality has totally changed since that incident. That made my life really difficult and I'm sad.""

Critics say authorities haven't done enough to counter deepfake porn despite an epidemic of online sex crimes in recent years, such as spy cam videos of women in public toilets and other places. In 2020, members of a criminal ring were arrested and convicted of blackmailing dozens of women into filming sexually explicit videos for them to sell.

""The number of male juveniles consuming deepfake porn for fun has increased because authorities have overlooked the voices of women"" demanding stronger punishment for digital sex crimes, the monitoring group ReSET said in comments sent to AP.

South Korea has no official records on the extent of deepfake online porn. But Reset said a recent random search of an online chatroom found more than 4,000 sexually exploitive images, videos and other items.

Reviews of district court rulings showed less than a third of the 87 people indicted by prosecutors for deepfake crimes since 2021 were sent to prison. Nearly 60% avoided jail by receiving suspended terms, fines or not-guilty verdicts, according to lawmaker Kim's office. Judges tended to lighten sentences when those convicted repented for their crimes or were first time offenders.

The deepfake problem has gained urgency given South Korea's serious rifts over gender roles, workplace discrimination, mandatory military service for men and social burdens on men and women.

Kim Chae-won, a 25-year-old office worker, said some of her male friends shunned her after she asked them what they thought about digital sex violence targeting women.

""I feel scared of living as a woman in South Korea,"" said Kim Haeun, a 17-year-old high school student who recently removed all her photos on Instagram. She said she feels awkward when talking with male friends and tries to distance herself from boys she doesn't know well.

""Most sex crimes target women. And when they happen, I think we are often helpless,"" she said."
Virginia House candidates debate abortion and affordability as congressional election nears,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/derrick-anderson-eugene-vindman-congress-election-virginia-9eb610dfc95d6e18cad17a5d19518416,2024-10-03T01:11:02Z,"FREDERICKSBURG, Va. (AP) -- Nearly a month before election day, Republican Derrick Anderson and Democrat Yevgeny ""Eugene"" Vindman attempted to portray themselves as the candidate best fit for Congress on Wednesday in what is shaping up to be Virginia's most competitive race.

Anderson, a former Army Green beret native of the state's 7th District, touted his local roots and military service, stressing his desire to represent his community and continue his public service endeavors.

Vindman, an Army veteran who rose to national prominence after contributing to President Donald Trump's first impeachment alongside his brother, argued that he would be a fierce defender against Republican extremism in Congress.

In a roughly hourlong debate hosted by the University of Mary Washington, the candidates blasted each other's actions on the campaign trail. Anderson accused Vindman of lying about his military rank and combat experience. Vindman was promoted to colonel, but he retired before being eligible to retain the rank.

""He's lied about being a colonel -- he's not a colonel,"" Anderson said, later adding: ""My opponent said that he used weapons of war in combat when knows very well he did not.""

Vindman, in turn, flamed Anderson for ""trying to fool the voters in the district about his fake family,"" referencing a photo reported by the New York Times of Anderson standing to a woman and her three daughters. Anderson's campaign said Wednesday that he never claimed the women in the photo were his family, and that Anderson has often posted photos with his actual family.

""If you're going to portray yourself as a family man so people like you, how can you be trusted on more serious topics?"" Vindman said.

The rebukes are some of the latest jabs Vindman and Anderson have made in their battle to win the House seat, which became open after Democratic incumbent Rep. Abigail Spanberger filed to run for Virginia governor and declined to seek reelection.

Home to some of the fastest-growing counties in Virginia, the congressional district ranges from outer-ring D.C. suburbs to the rural piedmont of central Virginia. Experts say the election could be critical in determining which party will clinch a House majority. According to the Virginia Public Access Project, Anderson had raised $1.4 million,and Vindman nearly $7.5 million throughout their campaigns.

Over the course of the debate, Anderson focused on the economy, criticizing President Joe Biden's economic policies and the lack of affordability in Virginia.

""Are you better off than you were four years ago today?"" Anderson said. ""I would say the answer is 'No.' ""

Vindman emphasized his pledge to protect abortion rights and fend off Republican extremism, making reference to Project 2025, a detailed blueprint for governing in the next Republican administration.

He referenced his daughter, who he argued had fewer rights than the generations of women before her.

Supporters of candidates clapped, cheered, booed and heckled at the candidates throughout the debate. At one point, the moderator told the crowd: ""Your job is to be an audience member, not a candidate.""

Before the event, supporters gathered on the university campus, waving signs and donning candidate T-shirts."
Bills place emphasis on defensive backups in wake of NFL's 4-game suspension of Von Miller,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/bills-von-miller-suspended-texans-dee4ca0b3c39238407ca54b111bd7ec3,2024-10-02T23:07:36Z,"ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Bills cornerback Rasul Douglas didn't think anything of Von Miller's absence at practice on Wednesday, assuming the edge rusher had a rest day, as sometimes happens for the 35-year-old veteran.

""What?"" Douglas said, appearing confused when asked how the secondary will hold up against a dynamic Texans passing attack on Sunday without Buffalo's top pass-rushing threat. ""He's not playing or something?""

Douglas was apparently so preoccupied with the prospect of facing Nico Collins, who leads the NFL with 489 yards receiving, former Bills star Stefon Diggs and the potential return of Tank Dell that he missed the news of Miller's four-game suspension for violating the NFL's personal conduct policy.

""Damn. Four games,"" Douglas said. ""Well, we've been next man up since I got here, so hopefully it gives somebody else a chance to go get some more snaps and make some more plays.""

That's how it has been for the Bills during a 3-1 start. The defense has been leaning on backups to fill in for injured starters such as linebackers Matt Milano (torn left biceps) and Terrel Bernard (partially torn pectoral) and nickel cornerback Taron Johnson (broken right forearm).

What's troubling is the timing of Miller's suspension, coming on the heels of a 35-10 dud at Baltimore on Sunday for Buffalo's most lopsided loss in nearly three years. And the defense could be minus yet another starter with safety Taylor Rapp in the concussion protocol.

Though as a pass-rushing specialist Miller didn't factor into the issues the Bills had in giving up 272 yards rushing to the Ravens, he was expected to play a larger role against C.J. Stroud and company.

Miller is the NFL's active leader in sacks with 126 1/2, which is tied for 17th on the career list with Derrick Thomas. After failing to produce a sack in 14 games, including the playoffs, last season while coming off knee surgery, Miller is tied for the Bills lead with three this year.

""The job is to move forward, right?"" coach Sean McDermott said. ""I've really been proud of the way the guys have stepped up. They've had to deal with quite a few situations, injuries, now in this case the suspension with Von. So I expect the same, quite honestly. ... Somebody needs to step up and they have to this point.""

McDermott called Miller's suspension ""an unfortunate situation,"" while adding: ""We respect the decision made by the league, and really it's out of our control.""

Aside from saying the Bills were informed by the league in advance of the suspension being announced, McDermott said he wasn't in a position to discuss the reasons behind the decision. ""You can assume what you can assume. That's where we're at on it,"" he said.

The NFL cited only its personal conduct policy in announcing the suspension that will keep Miller away from the Bills' facility until the week leading up to Buffalo's home game against Miami on Nov. 3.

Miller was accused in November of assaulting his pregnant girlfriend at their home outside Dallas during the Bills' bye week. He turned himself in to police after he was charged with third-degree felony assault of a pregnant woman, which is punishable by two to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

The woman and Miller had been in a relationship for seven years and have two other children together.

No charges have been filed. Miller said in July he considered the case closed based on feedback from his attorneys.

The NFL was conducting its own investigation into the matter, and reserved the right to discipline Miller based on conduct deemed detrimental to the sport.

A police affidavit regarding the alleged assault on Nov. 29 said Miller put his hands on his girlfriend's neck, pulled out her hair and threw her on the couch. The woman was treated for minor injuries, including bruising on her neck, officers wrote.

In December, Miller disputed the allegations, calling them false and ""blown out of proportion."" Miller indicated something happened between him and his girlfriend, but stressed it did not approach what he was alleged to have done.

The Bills have turned their attention to Sunday, with Greg Rousseau and A.J. Epenesa starting, ahead of veteran backup Dawuane Smoot and rookie Javon Solomon, who has been limited to two games this season.

""Nobody knows any details, so I'm sure my reaction is probably the same as yours. You know, I'm confused,"" Epenesa said. ""But from a football standpoint, everybody knows what they're supposed to do or what the job is. So it'll be easy from there just to execute.""

Notes: Bernard was listed as being limited in practice, and said he still has several tests to pass before being cleared to play. ... Johnson practiced with his right arm heavily wrapped and could only say ""We'll see,"" regarding the prospect of playing Sunday. ... Starting left tackle Dion Dawkins (hamstring) and WR Khalil Shakir (right ankle) did not practice and their status to play on Sunday is uncertain."
Parole rescinded for former LA police detective convicted of killing her ex-boyfriend's wife in 1986,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/stephanie-lazarus-detective-sherri-rasmussen-killing-parole-fee7812abf96bcbe35129b5dff4b7c70,2024-10-02T22:25:57Z,"LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A chance for parole was rescinded Wednesday for a former Los Angeles police detective serving a sentence of 27 years to life in the cold-case killing of her ex-boyfriend's wife in 1986.

Stephanie Lazarus was convicted in 2012 of killing Sherri Rasmussen, a 29-year-old nurse who was bludgeoned and shot to death in the condo she shared with her husband of three months, John Ruetten. She wasn't arrested until 2009.

The state Board of Parole Hearings heard arguments from lawyers on both sides during a hearing Wednesday that lasted about 90 minutes. The three commissioners then met privately and returned with a decision to rescind a previous grant of parole, according to attorney John Taylor, who represents the Rasmussen family.

Taylor said the family was relieved by the decision.

""Lazarus had her parole time up front, evading arrest for 23 years after the murder. She has expressed no remorse for the cold-blooded execution of Sherri Rasmussen committed while she was an LAPD officer. It's unfair to the family that she should now go free and enjoy her life while receiving her LAPD pension,"" Taylor said in a statement following the board's decision.

A select committee of the parole board determined last November that Lazarus was eligible for parole. The full board took up her case in May but the final decision was delayed until this week. An attorney for Lazarus couldn't be located Wednesday.

Rasmussen's sisters and widower gave emotional testimony during May's hearing about their pain and described Lazarus as a conniving criminal who used her police training to cover up the killing.

At her trial 12 years ago, prosecutors focused on the romantic relationship between Lazarus and Ruetten after they graduated from college. They claimed Lazarus was consumed with jealousy when Ruetten decided to marry Rasmussen.

The case hinged on DNA from a bite mark prosecutors say Lazarus left on Rasmussen's arm.

Lazarus was not a suspect in 1986 because detectives then believed two robbers who had attacked another woman in the area were to blame for Rasmussen's death.

No suspects were found and the case went cold until May 2009, when undercover officers followed Lazarus and obtained a sample of her saliva to compare with DNA left at the original crime scene, police said.

Prosecutors suggested Lazarus knew to avoid leaving other evidence, such as fingerprints.

Lazarus rose in the ranks of the Los Angeles Police Department, becoming a detective in charge of art forgeries and thefts."
"Figures, Dobson clash in congressional debate",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/alabama-congress-figures-dobson-election-debate-d7450f75e79ae2c3667e08d67c3dac8c,2024-10-02T20:53:24Z,"MONTGOMERY, Ala. (AP) -- Congressional hopefuls Shomari Figures and Caroleene Dobson clashed in a debate Wednesday punctuated by policy differences and verbal swipes at each other's resume.

Figures, a Democrat, and Dobson, a Republican are running to represent Alabama's 2nd Congressional District, which was redrawn after a lengthy redistricting battle. The two faced off in Montgomery in a candidate forum hosted by the Montgomery Chamber of Commerce and broadcast online by WSFA.

Dobson attacked Figures, who worked in the Obama White House and as a former top aide to U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland, over his background in the nation's capital. Figures said his opponent was opting for a ""photo-op"" over meaningful solutions.

Dobson repeatedly called Figures a ""Washington D.C. insider"" and said he was ""part of an administration that for the past four years crushed American opportunity.""

""He wants to continue the policies of the last four years, but you and I should ask ourselves: Are we better off than we were four years ago?"" Dobson said.

Figures, speaking after the forum, said he does not ""run from the fact"" that most of his professional career was spent in Washington. Nonetheless, he said, Alabama is his home. ""The root of it is: This is home for me. This where I was born, where I was raised,"" Figures said.

He added that he is the son of two Alabama legislators and grew up in Mobile.

Dobson has made border security, a cornerstone of her campaign. Figures referred to a campaign trip that Dobson took to the Mexico border to highlight immigration issues as a ""photo-op"" while saying he has been at the border ""as a staffer"" to work on legislation to provide more resources to border agents.

""My opponent mentions the border, but what she fails to mention about the border is that in her early legal career, she spent time in Texas actually selling millions of acres of our border state land in Texas to shadow companies owned by Mexican investors,"" Figures said.

Dobson responded that the transaction involved a Mexican company that was buying office space in Texas as it fled the drug cartel crisis in Mexico. She said Figures was part of the transition team for the Biden administration that ""flung open our borders and has resulted in less safe communities.""

Alabama's 2nd Congressional District was redrawn after the U.S. Supreme Court agreed Alabama had likely illegally diluted the influence of Black voters when drawing congressional lines. A three-judge panel selected new lines to give Black residents¸ who now make up nearly 49% of the district's voting-age population, an ""opportunity"" to elect a candidate of their choice.

The open seat has sparked a heated race for the district that could help decide control of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Some of the sharpest policy contrasts were over abortion and healthcare.

""I do not believe it is the government's role to tell a woman what she can and cannot do with her body. I think it's pretty simple. If you don't believe in abortion, if you don't want an abortion, don't have one,"" Figures said.

Dobson described herself as ""pro-life"" but said the issue should be left to the states.

""This is an issue that's best left to state legislatures to decide with compassion and common sense,"" Dobson said.

Dobson said she supports exemptions to abortion bans for rape, incest and for a pregnant woman's health. Alabama's abortion ban does not have exemptions for rape and incest.

Both candidates spoke of the need to address infrastructure and healthcare challenges in the district.

Figures said four rural hospitals have closed in the district since the campaign began, and life expectancy in Alabama lags most of the nation. Figures urged Alabama to expand its Medicaid program to cover more low-income people who he said are often working jobs but don't have access to health insurance. He said he would support legislation that would renew financial incentives to holdout states to expand their programs. Alabama is one of 10 states that did not expand Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act.

""In the state of Alabama, you are just barely expected to live past your 60s, your 60s. That is unacceptable, and for too many people. That is because of lack of health care earlier in life,"" Figures said.

Dobson said she would encourage state officials to ""examine"" the issue of Medicaid expansion but said that inflation is helping to drive healthcare costs.

""We also have to recognize that the best insurance is the one that you get through your job. So, we need to create more jobs to allow people to have private insurance that is going to pay those reimbursements to keep our rural hospitals open,"" Dobson said.

The two candidates will meet again on Oct. 10 in an online debate hosted by al.com."
Lawsuit filed over road rage shooting by off-duty NYPD officer that left victim a quadriplegic,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/police-shooting-road-rage-lawsuit-4eea8127f8891678dba1ecd83e88d858,2024-10-02T19:07:35Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- The family of a man who was left permanently disabled after he was shot in the head during a road rage encounter in New Jersey, allegedly by an off-duty New York City police officer, has filed a lawsuit against the city and police department arguing that the officer was an alcoholic and a ""ticking time bomb"" who should not have been carrying a department-issued gun.

Officer Hieu Tran has pleaded not guilty to attempted murder and other charges stemming from the May 17 shooting of 30-year-old Kishan Patel while authorities say they were stopped at a traffic light in Voorhees, New Jersey.

The shooting and the crash that followed left Patel a quadriplegic who will require round-the-clock care at a skilled nursing facility for the rest of his life, according to the lawsuit filed Tuesday in Manhattan federal court by Patel's mother, Manjina Patel.

Prosecutors in Camden County, New Jersey, allege that Tran shot Patel while they both were stopped at a red light. Surveillance footage showed that Patel's car sped into the intersection and crashed into other cars, injuring a woman in one of them.

Police responded and found Patel with a head wound.

Tran drove to his home in Yonkers, New York, and later reported to his job at the NYPD's communications office, prosecutors contend.

Detectives used surveillance video, cellphone records and ballistics evidence to identify Tran as the shooter, according to prosecutors. He was arrested on June 6 and is awaiting trial on charges of attempted murder, aggravated assault and weapons possession.

During a pretrial detention hearing in June, defense lawyer Ross Gigliotti said a psychiatric examination found that the 27-year-old Tran suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and an alcohol-abuse issue, and he called the shooting ""an aberration.""

Assistant Prosecutor Peter Gallagher called Tran ""a ticking time bomb waiting to go off"" and said there was ""no guarantee that this was a one-time event.""

The judge denied Tran bail.

According to the lawsuit, Tran's alcoholism and mental health problems were known to his police superiors and should have disqualified him from serving as an armed officer, but he was nonetheless carrying a department-issued 9mm pistol that he used to shoot Patel.

The suit seeks unspecified damages and names the city, the police department, New York City Mayor Eric Adams, former Police Commissioner Edward Caban and several unnamed police officials as defendants.

Tran was suspended from the police department without pay following his arrest. A spokesperson said the department would not comment on pending litigation.

Messages seeking comment were left with the New York City law department and Gigliotti, Tran's attorney."
Saoirse Ronan felt happy and settled. That's why she could play an alcoholic in 'The Outrun',AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/saoirse-ronan-outrun-movie-ce3ee970a38e07b56fb4d79ceff8ba4e,2024-10-02T16:48:09Z,"The thing about birthing a lamb on camera is you only get one take.

Saoirse Ronan had been getting up at dawn to observe local farmers in Orkney in action, soaking in as much as she could. But soon it was her turn. Not only would she have a life in her hands: She had to look like she'd been doing it her whole life. She was terrified.

It wouldn't be the last time Ronan, 30, would have to step out of her comfort zone to make the "" The Outrun "" (in theaters Friday), a harrowing and transcendent portrait of addiction and recovery which she produced alongside her husband, actor Jack Lowden. She'd yell and scream and say the meanest things she could think of to her fellow actors. She'd go from euphoric to inconsolable on a dime in a chaotic, drunken haze. And she'd plough the despairing depths of a very sick person about to relapse.

But after 20 years of acting, these were challenge she was ready for. There's a reason her performance, defining and distinctive on a resume full of memorable characters, from Briony Tallis to Lady Bird, has garnered comparisons to Gena Rowlands in ""A Woman Under the Influence.""

It was Lowden who put Amy Liptrot's bestselling memoir in her hands during the pandemic, thinking it might be an interesting role for her.

""We tend to be drawn towards the same kind of material,"" Ronan said in a recent interview with The Associated Press. ""I trust his taste and opinion. I kind of hold it higher than anyone else's.""

They were both at a point where they felt like they had more to give to the movies than just performing. They wanted more responsibility, more agency to help shape the material that they loved so much. And so, Ronan and Lowden set off on a journey to make ""The Outrun"" together. Producing, she said, made her fall in love with filmmaking even more.

""It only made the experience as an actor even richer,"" Ronan said. ""I had history with every single decision that had been made. I was a part of it and there was a piece of me in those decisions.""

One of the first decisions that Liptrot, Ronan and German filmmaker Nora Fingscheidt made was to come up with a new name for Amy to create some healthy distance from their real life subject. They decided on Rona, after an uninhabited island visible from the Liptrot's real farm.

The production would involve an extensive pre-shoot on the Orkney Islands, on a remote corner of Scotland, to get the full scope of its natural splendor across a year, including lambs being born and birds nesting. The film skips around between her childhood, her downfall in London and her return to Orkney, with sublime asides about the history of the place, the folklore and what's going on in Rona's head. She finishes the odyssey in isolation on the even smaller island of Papay.

""We wanted to create a poetic film where the images and atmosphere stay with you for a long time after watching,"" wrote director Fingscheidt. ""A film that takes you on a journey, not just to Orkney or London, but a spiritual journey into the inner world of a young woman, raised under extreme circumstances, searching for her place in life without alcohol.""

In the chaotic London portions, in which Rona's relationship with her boyfriend Daynin (Paapa Essiedu) crumbles under the weight of her addiction, Ronan found herself apologizing often to her screen mates. To capture the full extent of Rona's cruelty, Fingscheidt asked Ronan to get mean and personal.

""I've never explored that before with a character to get that cruel and just genuinely mean,"" Ronan said. ""But you really have to kind of go, OK, I'm doing this for the sake of authenticity and honoring Amy's life. In a way, it felt more respectful to the people who were affected by Amy's illness. Because the cruelty and the meanness and the ugliness that comes out...I've experienced myself. It's incredibly painful. If we were going to do this story and their experience justice, we needed to show all of that.""

Behind the scenes Lowden, who is Scottish and is particularly passionate about telling Scottish stories, was a helpful presence who understood the culture and the people. They worked with many locals in the small community of Orkney and Papay -- which has no hotels. Ronan loved when he was able to be on set. They married in private earlier this year.

""He's one of those enigmas where, yes, he's a brilliant, brilliant actor and is so incredible on screen, but most of the time would much prefer to watch someone else shine,"" she said. ""He loves being behind the scenes, making sure everyone has what they need and making sure that the set is operating well. He's more naturally a producer.""

After the shoot, Ronan was ready to let Rona go. She had a six-week break and took herself on a train holiday around Europe to shake her off. Then she was due on another set: Steve McQueen's highly anticipated World War II film ""Blitz,"" an AppleTV+ film opening in theaters Nov. 1. She plays a mother searching for her 9-year-old son who was supposed to be safely in the English countryside but has set on a dangerous journey to get back to her.

""I'm buzzing that these two films are coming out at once because they couldn't be more different,"" Ronan said. ""It's very exciting for me to stand by the two of them. They feel very personal for different reasons.""

They're also already getting her awards buzz. Ronan has been nominated for four acting Oscars, going back to ""Atonement,"" but has yet to win. This year it's possible she could get both a lead and supporting nomination for the two projects. But she's more focused on getting them out to the world. And in ""The Outrun,"" which she's seen from development to release, she is proud of a performance that she's not sure she would have been capable of a few years ago.

""I don't think it's necessarily something that I would have had the strength of character to take on years before,"" Ronan said. ""But because I felt so happy and settled in my own life, and professionally speaking, I felt ready to play someone that was as messy and disconnected as she was. I was more than ready to give in to not knowing what this character was going to be, what it was going to turn into."""
US 'Welcome Corps' helps resettle LGBTQ+ refugees fleeing crackdowns against gay people,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/lgbtq-refugees-welcome-corps-rainbow-railroad-1c4a419125f50aa769c8416cd47312e2,2024-10-02T04:13:37Z,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- Cabrel Ngounou's life in Cameroon quickly unraveled after neighbors caught the teenager with his boyfriend.

A crowd surrounded his boyfriend's house and beat him. Ngounou's family learned of the relationship and kicked him out. So Ngounou fled -- alone and with little money -- on a dangerous, four-year journey through at least five countries. He was sexually assaulted in a Libyan prison, harassed in Tunisia and tried unsuccessfully to take a boat to Europe.

""The worst thing was that they caught us. So it was not easy for my family,"" Ngounou said. ""My sisters told me I need to get out of the house because my place is not there. So that's what really pushed me to leave my country.""

Ngounou's troubles drew attention after he joined a protest outside the U.N. refugee agency's Tunisia office. Eventually, he arrived in the United States, landing in San Francisco in March.

Ngounou joined a growing number of LGBTQ+ people accepted into the Welcome Corps, which launched last year and pairs groups of Americans with newly arrived refugees. So far, the resettlement program has connected 3,500 sponsors with 1,800 refugees, and many more want to help: 100,000 people have applied to become sponsors.

President Joe Biden has sought to rebuild the refugee programs Donald Trump largely dismantled as president, working to streamline the process of screening and placing people in America. New refugee resettlement sites have opened across the country, and on Tuesday, the Biden Administration announced that it resettled 100,000 refugees in fiscal year 2024, the largest number in more than three decades.

In contrast, Trump has pledged to bar refugees from Gaza, reinstate his Muslim ban and impose ""ideological screening"" for all immigrants if he regains the presidency. He and running mate JD Vance are laying groundwork for their goal of deporting millions of illegal immigrants by amplifying false claims, such as the accusation that Haitians given temporary protected status to remain in the U.S. legally are eating pets in Ohio.

Under Biden, meanwhile, two human rights officials in the State Department were tasked last year with identifying refugees who face persecution either due to their sexual orientation or human rights advocacy.

""LGBTQ refugees are forced to flee their homes due to persecution and violence, not unlike other people,"" said Jeremy Haldeman, deputy executive director of the Community Sponsorship Hub, which implements the Welcome Corps on behalf of the State Department. But they are particularly vulnerable because they're coming from places ""where their identities are criminalized and they are at risk of imprisonment or even death.""

More than 60 countries have passed anti-LGBTQ laws and thousands of people have fled the Middle East and Africa seeking asylum in Europe. In April, Uganda's constitutional court on Wednesday upheld an anti-gay law that allows the death penalty for ""aggravated homosexuality.""

""There are just a lot of people who are really at risk and are not safe in their country, and they're usually not safe in the neighboring or regional countries either,"" Kathryn Hampton, senior adviser for U.S. Strategy at Rainbow Railroad, which helps LGBTQI+ people facing persecution.

The demand far outstrips capacity: Of more than 15,000 requests for help in 2023, the nonprofit helped resettle 23 refugees through the Welcome Corps program in cities as large as Houston and towns as small as Arlington, Vermont. It has a goal of resettling 50 this year.

""So, we have a lot of urgency as an organization to find and create new pathways that LGBTQI+ people can access to find safety,"" Hampton said.

Another refugee in the program, Julieth Luna Garcia, is a transgender woman from El Salvador who settled in Chicago.

Speaking through a translator, the 31-year-old Garcia said she suffered abuse from her family because of her trans identity and couldn't legally access gender-affirming care until she arrived in the United States.

""I lived with constant fear, even more so at night. I didn't like to go out. I was really scared that somebody would find me alone and do something,"" Garcia said. Since arriving in February, Garcia has found a place to live and a job as a home health aide and hopes to study to become a lawyer. ""Here, I'm not scared to say who I am. I'm not scared to tell anyone,"" she said.

Maybe the biggest change was starting hormone treatments, she said: ""To see yourself in the mirror and see these changes, I can't really explain it, but it's really big. It's an emotional and exciting thing and something I thought I would never experience.""

Welcome Corps sponsors are expected to help refugees adjust for at least three months after they arrive. Garcia said the five volunteers helped her ""adapt to a new life with a little less difficulty,"" by accessing benefits, getting a work permit and enrolling in English classes.

Ngounou recalled how his sponsors, a team of seven that included a lesbian couple, Anne Raeff and Lori Ostlund, hosted him and connected him with LGBTQ resources and a work training program. They also served as his tour guides to gay life, taking him to the historically gay Castro district, where Ngounou got his first glimpse of the huge rainbow Pride flag and stopped to read every plaque honoring famous gay people.

""Cabrel was just very, very moved by that. Just kind of started crying. We all did,"" Raeff recalled.

""I know that feeling like when we were young, when you'd go into a gay bar and you'd feel like this sense of kind of freedom, like this community,"" she said. ""That was the only place where you could go and actually be open. And that ... this is this community of people and we all have this in common.""

Now the 19-year-old Ngounou works in a coffee shop and takes college courses, with the goal of becoming a social worker. He hopes the boyfriend he met in Tunisia can visit him in San Francisco -- and he still finds it hard to believe that they can share their love openly.

""Here I'm really me ... I feel free,"" he said with a laugh. ""I feel free to have my boyfriend and walk with him in the street. I feel free, you know, to enjoy myself with him wherever we want to enjoy ourselves. But in Tunisia or anywhere else, in Cameroon, you have to hide such things."""
Doctor charged in connection with Matthew Perry's death is expected to plead guilty,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/matthew-perry-doctor-ketamine-920ad848602817c7d267f5924236d7fc,2024-10-02T04:10:57Z,"LOS ANGELES (AP) -- One of two doctors charged in the investigation of the death of Matthew Perry is expected to plead guilty Wednesday in a federal court in Los Angeles to conspiring to distribute the surgical anesthetic ketamine.

Dr. Mark Chavez, 54, of San Diego, signed a plea agreement with prosecutors in August and would be the third person to plead guilty in the aftermath of the ""Friends"" star's fatal overdose last year.

Prosecutors offered lesser charges to Chavez and two others in exchange for their cooperation as they go after two targets they deem more responsible for the overdose death: another doctor and an alleged dealer that they say was known as ""ketamine queen"" of Los Angeles.

Chavez is free on bond after turning over his passport and surrendering his medical license, among other conditions.

His lawyer Matthew Binninger said after Chavez's first court appearance on Aug. 30 that he is ""incredibly remorseful"" and is ""trying to do everything in his power to right the wrong that happened here.""

Also working with federal prosecutors are Perry's assistant, who admitted to helping him obtain and inject ketamine, and a Perry acquaintance, who admitted to acting as a drug messenger and middleman.

The three are helping prosecutors in their prosecution of Dr. Salvador Plasencia, charged with illegally selling ketamine to Perry in the month before his death, and Jasveen Sangha, a woman who authorities say sold the actor the lethal dose of ketamine. Both have pleaded not guilty and are awaiting trial.

Chavez admitted in his plea agreement that he obtained ketamine from his former clinic and from a wholesale distributor where he submitted a fraudulent prescription.

After a guilty plea, he could get up to 10 years in prison when he is sentenced.

Perry was found dead by his assistant on Oct. 28. The medical examiner ruled ketamine was the primary cause of death. The actor had been using the drug through his regular doctor in a legal but off-label treatment for depression that has become increasingly common.

Perry began seeking more ketamine than his doctor would give him. About a month before the actor's death, he found Plasencia, who in turn asked Chavez to obtain the drug for him.

""I wonder how much this moron will pay,"" Plasencia texted Chavez. The two met up the same day in Costa Mesa, halfway between Los Angeles and San Diego, and exchanged at least four vials of ketamine.

After selling the drugs to Perry for $4,500, Plasencia asked Chavez if he could keep supplying them so they could become Perry's ""go-to.""

Perry struggled with addiction for years, dating back to his time on ""Friends,"" when he became one of the biggest stars of his generation as Chandler Bing. He starred alongside Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Lisa Kudrow, Matt LeBlanc and David Schwimmer for 10 seasons from 1994 to 2004 on NBC's megahit sitcom."
Federal prosecutors file new indictment against ex-Louisville police officers,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/breonna-taylor-police-boyfriend-6abc9a45d7ceef72e99878d4ff1fd035,2024-10-02T01:10:33Z,"LOUISVILLE, Ky. (AP) -- Federal prosecutors filed a new indictment Tuesday against two former Louisville officers accused of falsifying a warrant that led police to Breonna Taylor's door before they fatally shot her.

The Justice Department's superseding indictment comes weeks after a federal judge threw out major felony charges against former Louisville Police Detective Joshua Jaynes and former Sgt. Kyle Meany.

The new indictment includes additional allegations about how the former officers allegedly falsified the affidavit for the search warrant.

It says they both knew the affidavit they used to obtain the warrant to search Taylor's home contained information that was false, misleading and out of date, omitted ""material information"" and knew it lacked the necessary probable cause.

The indictment says if the judge who signed the warrant had known that ""key statements in the affidavit were false and misleading,"" she would not have approved it ""and there would not have been a search at Taylor's home.""

Attorney Thomas Clay, who represents Jaynes, said the new indictment raises ""new legal arguments, which we are researching to file our response."" An attorney for Meany did not immediately respond to a message for comment late Tuesday.

Federal charges against Jaynes and Meany were announced by U.S. Attorney General Merrick Garland in 2022. Garland accused Jaynes and Meany, who were not present at the raid, of knowing they falsified part of the warrant and put Taylor in a dangerous situation by sending armed officers to her apartment.

When police carrying a drug warrant broke down Taylor's door in March 2020, her boyfriend, Kenneth Walker, fired a shot that struck an officer in the leg. Walker said he believed an intruder was bursting in. Officers returned fire, striking and killing Taylor, a 26-year-old Black woman, in her hallway.

In August, U.S. District Judge Charles Simpson declared that the actions of Taylor's boyfriend were the legal cause of her death, not a bad warrant.

Simpson wrote that ""there is no direct link between the warrantless entry and Taylor's death."" Simpson's ruling effectively reduced the civil rights violation charges against Jaynes and Meany, which carry a maximum sentence of life in prison, to misdemeanors.

The judge declined to dismiss a conspiracy charge against Jaynes and another charge against Meany, who is accused of making false statements to investigators."
"Atlanta rapper Rich Homie Quan died from an accidental drug overdose, medical examiner says",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/rapper-rich-homie-quan-atlanta-724d2307f46db72360650712503fdff1,2024-10-02T01:04:32Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- Rapper Rich Homie Quan died from an accidental drug overdose, the medical examiner's office in Georgia confirmed.

The cause of death for the hip-hop performer, born Dequantes Devontay Lamar, was from a slew of drugs such as fentanyl, alprazolam, codeine and promethazine, according to a Fulton County medical examiner's report obtained by People Magazine on Tuesday.

The report said that Quan showed no signs of trauma when his body was found. His death was ruled an accident.

His brother told police that he thought Quan was asleep on the floor by the kitchen before he picked up the rapper and put him on the couch, saying it was ""very unusual"" to see food still in his mouth.

Later that morning, police were called by a woman who noticed that Quan's body was cold and he was not breathing.

Quan, 33, who died at an Atlanta hospital on Sept. 5, was one of the biggest names in hip-hop in the mid-2010s. He gained mainstream fame through the trap singles ""Flex (Ooh, Ooh, Ooh)"" and ""Type of Way,"" which became such a success that several other rappers jumped on the remix, including Jeezy and Meek Mill.

Quan appeared on a YG track with Jeezy and released the London on da Track-produced song ""Lifestyle"" through his Rich Gang rap collective that included Young Thug and Birdman.

Quan followed up with ""Flex (Ooh, Ooh, Ooh),"" a song produced by DJ Spinz and Nitti Beatz. It became his highest charting solo single at No. 26 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. He was also featured on Lil Dicky's viral ""$ave Dat Money.""

In 2018, Quan debuted his first and only studio album ""Rich as in Spirit,"" which mostly went without any features -- except for ""Think About It,"" a single with Rick Ross."

(AP) -- A woman associated with MS-13 was sentenced Tuesday to 50 years in federal prison for her role in luring four young men to be killed by more than a dozen members of the violent transnational gang in the New York City suburbs.

Leniz Escobar was a ""critical player"" at nearly every step of the April 2017 massacre, ""willingly and enthusiastically"" helping to plan and execute the horrific killing, in which gang members armed with machetes, knives and tree limbs ambushed the victims in a park on Long Island, declared U.S. Judge Joseph Bianco as he handed down his decision in Central Islip federal court.

The now 24-year-old, who was nicknamed ""Diablita"" or ""Little Devil"" among members of MS-13, was convicted in 2022 of one count of racketeering and four counts of murder in aid of racketeering.

Escobar said in court that she is reminded every day of the pain she's caused.

""All I can do is hurt,"" she said through tears. ""Every breath reminds me that they are not here and their families are in pain. If I could trade places with them and take away that pain, I would.""

But parents and other relatives of the victims who spoke in court were unmoved.

""She does not deserve 50 or 60 years in prison. She deserves the death penalty,"" Bertha Ullaguari, the mother of 18-year-old Jorge Tigre, said in Spanish through a translator.

Jason Tigre said his older brother was a mentor to him and was looking forward to graduating high school and going on to college before his life was cut short.

""Now I'm all alone and I'm trying to be strong for him,"" the now 17 year-old said through tears. ""This never should have happened, but it did because she did it. He should still be here.""

Escobar's lawyer had argued for a sentence of no more than 32 years in prison, noting that she had been just at the cusp of 18 at the time and had already endured violence, sexual abuse, exploitation and human trafficking.

""From the time of her birth until April 2017, she had lived a horrible, terrible life,"" defense attorney Jesse Siegel said. ""The best years of her life have been the last seven years in custody.""

He also noted that she'd begun to turn her life around behind bars -- earning her high school degree, leading Bible studies, and serving as a mentor and ""positive influence"" to fellow inmates with ""wisdom beyond her years.""

But prosecutors, in arguing for a stiffer sentence of 65 years in prison, said Escobar had continued to maintain strong ties to MS-13 after her arrest, even coordinating the beating of another female gang associate for violating the gang's code.

Assistant U.S. Attorney Megan Farrell also said it was Escobar that had set the massacre in motion by bringing photos on social media to the attention of gang leaders that were posted by one of the intended victims.

Escobar had felt ""personally offended"" that the victim had worn items typically associated with the gang and appeared to use the gang's hand signs even though he was not an MS-13 member, she said.

Escobar then endeared herself to the victims, who had thought they were being invited to smoke marijuana at a park, according to Farrell. Then after the killing, she bragged to other MS-13 members about her role and instructed those involved to destroy evidence and evade police.

""She was one of the most culpable people,"" Farrell said. ""Without her, these murders would not have occurred."""
Bills' Von Miller suspended by NFL for 4 games for violating personal conduct policy,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/bills-von-miller-suspended-2c434b3358dd698a0dbce5266ee5667f,2024-10-01T21:41:21Z,"ORCHARD PARK, N.Y. (AP) -- Buffalo Bills edge rusher Von Miller was suspended four games by the NFL on Tuesday for violating the league's personal conduct policy.

The NFL did not reveal the reason for the suspension, which comes as Buffalo (3-1) prepares to play at the Houston Texans on Sunday. Miller, the NFL's active leader in sacks, is eligible to rejoin the Bills ahead of their home game against Miami on Nov. 3.

Miller was accused last November of assaulting his pregnant girlfriend at their home outside Dallas during the Bills' bye week. He turned himself in to police after being accused of third-degree felony assault of a pregnant woman, which is punishable by two to 10 years in prison and a $10,000 fine.

The woman and Miller have been in a relationship for seven years and have two other children together.

No charges have been filed. Miller said in July he considered the case closed based on feedback from his attorneys.

""My life is all about football right now and my kids, and being the best teammate and best football player I can possibly be,"" he said at the time. ""I'm happy to be here with the Buffalo Bills. I'm happy to just be in this moment, living my life and do the things that we do normally.""

The 35-year-old Miller has three sacks in four games this season. He failed to get one in 14 games last season, including playoffs, after recovering from a torn knee ligament.

Miller has 126 1/2 sacks, which is tied for 17th on the career list with Derrick Thomas.

In Miller's first comments about his arrest in December, he disputed the allegations, calling them false and ""blown out of proportion."" Miller indicated something happened between him and his girlfriend, but stressed it did not approach what he was alleged to have done.

According to a police affidavit regarding the alleged assault on Nov. 29, Miller twice put his hands on his girlfriend's neck, pulled out some of her hair and threw her onto a couch. The woman was treated for minor injuries, including bruising on her neck, officers wrote.

Police wrote that Miller became ""visibly angry"" when the woman went into an office in their shared apartment and slammed the door behind her.

Miller then told her to ""get out,"" police wrote, and when she tried to collect her laptop and cellphone, Miller began pushing her. She repeatedly yelled, ""Stop. I'm pregnant,"" the affidavit said. She fell into a chair after being pushed, and Miller then put one hand on her neck and held it with pressure for three to five seconds, police wrote.

According to the document, Miller then threw the woman's laptop on the floor and stomped on it. She told police she recorded some of the attack and, when she threatened to call police, he left.

The Bills filled Miller's spot on the roster by signing defensive tackle Zion Logue off the Atlanta Falcons' practice squad. Logue was drafted in the sixth round by Atlanta after playing in college at Georgia."
Louisiana governor plans to call third special session to overhaul the state's tax system,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/income-tax-louisiana-session-48825835564024ee09e0c1d5a0ac60f3,2024-10-01T19:26:07Z,"BATON ROUGE, La. (AP) -- Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry says that he plans to call the Legislature into a special session in November, marking the third such gathering this year, with the hopes of overhauling the state's current tax system that the Republican said is failing residents.

Landry detailed his proposed tax plan during a news conference on Tuesday, with a focus on reducing the income tax and charging sales tax for more items and services. Louisiana is the latest state in the Deep South to discuss tax changes, as Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves continues to push for his state to phase out the income tax and as Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp signed measures earlier this year to significantly cut income taxes.

""We, in this state, have been on the losing end of an economic game that other states are playing and beating us at today,"" Landry said. ""We offer an opportunity to change that playbook so Louisiana can start winning.""

According to information from the state's revenue department, Louisiana residents currently pay a 4.25% tax rate on income $50,000 and above, 3.5% on income between $12,500 and $50,000, and 1.85% on income $12,500 and below. Landry's proposal would eliminate income tax for those making up to $12,500 and would set a flat income tax rate of 3% of those earning above $12,500.

Landry touted the plan, saying it would ""provide an immediate increase in take-home pay for every Louisiana taxpayer."" The governor said under that plan, he believes Louisiana will be on ""the road to reducing or eliminating the income tax"" by 2030, an idea that has been pushed by other Republican officials including State Treasurer John Fleming and Revenue Secretary Richard Nelson.

Currently, there are nine states that do not levy an individual income tax. Among those are the nearby states of Florida, Tennessee and Texas.

Landry said that while his plan does not include increasing the current rate of sales tax, he does believe the tax should be expanded to including other items and services such as lobbying, dog grooming and car washes. Currently, there are 223 sales tax exemptions, Nelson said.

""So your taxation will be driven by more about what you choose to buy, rather than by your labor,"" Landry said. ""I think that's fair. I hate the income tax ... a man and woman's labor should never be owned by the government.""

While Landry's full list of proposals, and additional details, were not immediately available, he said other changes could include repealing the corporate income tax, eliminating the tax on prescription drugs, making the partial business utility exemption permanent and ""modernize our constitutional funds and property tax exemptions to give our legislature more flexibility to meet"" budget shortfalls and future fiscal issues.

Louisiana faces a looming estimated $700 million budget shortfall because of the expiration of some temporary sales taxes. Officials say the shortfall could result in budget cuts that threaten teacher pay, recent education reforms, higher education and health care infrastructure.

Landry says that his tax plan would close out most of the shortfall. Additionally, he argues that it will make Louisiana more competitive with surrounding states that have seen substantial economic and population growth in recent years.

""This holistic plan is designed not only to address budget shortfalls, but to catapult Louisiana into the future with increased jobs and economic growth for years to come,"" he said.

Landry said he plans on calling the GOP-dominated Legislature into a special session in November. If lawmakers pass any bills, final approval will be determined by voters in the March election.

This will be Louisiana's third special session held this year and since Landry took office in January. The legislature gathered in January to redraw congressional boundaries that included a second majority-Black district and returned to the Capitol again in February to pass tough-on-crime policies.

Also this year, the GOP-dominated Legislature held its regular three-month-long session during which lawmakers pushed conservative priorities. Lawmakers couldn't vote on tax measures in this year's regular session.

The last time there were three special sessions in a year was 2018. During that time, the Louisiana Legislature spent more than $1.5 million on the sessions, with those costs including supplies, extra hours for staff, additional employees hired for the sessions and per diem and mileage for lawmakers."
No one expects a judge's rollback of Georgia's abortion ban to be the last word,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/abortion-georgia-ban-overturned-appeal-ec732417c9c3b714ccee3b0c9e77bc7d,2024-10-01T18:23:21Z,"SAVANNAH, Ga. (AP) -- When a Georgia judge overturned the state's abortion ban this week, abortion rights advocates praised the ruling and opponents denounced it -- all knowing the state's top court could put it on hold in coming days or weeks.

Any changes to abortion policy in Southern states could have an impact that resonates beyond their borders. Most states in the region have bans in place, forcing women who are seeking abortion procedures to travel to obtain them.

So as long as the ban is lifted, it could change abortion-related travel patterns. And the ruling puts another spotlight on a contested state in this year's presidential election, in which Democrats have sought to make abortion a major issue.

Here's a look at where things stand.

Georgia's abortion law violates women's rights to liberty and privacy guaranteed by the state constitution, Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled Monday.

Since 2022, the law effectively prohibited abortions beyond six weeks of pregnancy, which is before women often know they're pregnant. That's the point when cardiac activity in an embryo's cells can be detected by ultrasound. The law banned abortions once a ""detectable human heartbeat"" was present -- with some exceptions.

McBurney ruled that the law infringed on the liberty ""of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices."" He also wrote that Georgia gives women a constitutional right to privacy that includes making personal health decisions.

The judge wrote that his ruling reverts Georgia's abortion law to its prior status, which allowed abortions until viability, which is generally considered to be about 22 to 24 weeks' gestational age.

It was the judge's second ruling striking down the same law. In 2022, McBurney declared the law invalid because it was enacted by state lawmakers in 2019, when Roe v. Wade still protected abortion rights nationally.

The Georgia Supreme Court overturned that earlier ruling and sent the case back to McBurney to consider the merits of other legal arguments raised by abortion providers challenging the law. That paved the way for the Monday ruling.

Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, blasted the ruling, saying: ""Once again, the will of Georgians and their representatives has been overruled by the personal beliefs of one judge.""

Republican state Attorney General Chris Carr planned an immediate appeal to the state Supreme Court, a spokesperson said.

Advocates on both sides of the abortion debate in Georgia noted the state's high court could keep McBurney's order from taking effect while the state's appeal is pending.

It took the Georgia Supreme Court just over a week to overrule McBurney and reinstate the law after it was struck down the first time, in November 2022.

Georgia clinic officials told The Associated Press that they would accept patients whose pregnancies are past six weeks' gestation -- and also that they know the ban could be reimposed quickly.

That could make a big difference in the state. There were about 4,400 abortions monthly in Georgia before the ban took effect, and there have been about 2,400 monthly since then, according to estimates from the Society of Family Planning.

Allowing more abortions could mean that more women who want them can obtain them. It could also ease the flow of patients to clinics in other states, particularly North Carolina, the closest place where abortion is legal further into pregnancy. The Guttmacher Institute estimated that nearly 6,000 Georgia residents traveled to North Carolina for abortions last year.

Most Southern states have abortion bans that are either similar to the one overturned in Georgia or that are in effect at all stages of pregnancy.

So when a state lifts a ban, it could become a destination for people from nearby states seeking abortion. It's not clear whether that will happen in Georgia, given the possibility the state Supreme Court could reinstate the ban.

Even before this week, Georgia, a hotly contested state in the presidential election, has been a flashpoint in the political debate over abortion.

Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris traveled there last month to highlight reporting that two women in the state died after they didn't get proper medical treatment for complications from taking abortion pills to end their pregnancies. The vice president used the occasion to blast her Republican opponent, former President Donald Trump, for appointing justices to the U.S. Supreme Court who cleared the way for states to impose bans.

After Monday's ruling, it leaves 13 states with bans on abortion at all stages of pregnancy and three that bar them after the first six weeks or so of pregnancy."
"Catholic hospital in California illegally denied emergency abortion, state attorney general says",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/california-attorney-general-hospital-abortion-lawsuit-2df6c59133dbb5a0ccca5b0269bd1bc0,2024-10-01T18:22:59Z,"SAN FRANCISCO (AP) -- California's attorney general is suing a Catholic hospital, saying that Providence St. Joseph Hospital illegally denied emergency abortion care to a woman whose pregnancy was no longer viable after her water broke 15 weeks into carrying twins.

Attorney General Rob Bonta announced the lawsuit Monday, which was filed that day in Humboldt County Superior Court and details the case of Anna Nusslock. In February, Nusslock was 15 weeks into her pregnancy when her water broke and she was rushed to Providence in Eureka, where she lives.

According to the complaint, Nusslock was told by the doctor at the hospital that they could not provide an abortion ""so long as one of Anna's twins had detectable heart tones, unless Anna's life was sufficiently at risk."" The doctor recommended she take a helicopter to the University of California, San Francisco for emergency services. But she doubted her insurance would cover the $40,000 cost of the ride.

She asked if she could drive to UCSF, and the doctor advised that if she drove 270 miles (435 kilometers) south, which is about five hours, to San Francisco she would ""hemorrhage and die,"" according to the complaint. Nussbaum was discharged to Mad River Community Hospital 12 miles (19 kilometers) away, where she received the abortion at a labor and delivery unit that is scheduled to close this month, according to Bonta's office.

""They broke the law, and we are taking action to make sure they never do it again,"" Bonta said at a news conference.

A spokesperson for Providence Hospital, the hospital's parent company, said in a statement that it was reviewing the complaint.

""Providence is deeply committed to the health and wellness of women and pregnant patients and provides emergency services to all who walk through our doors in accordance with state and federal law,"" according to the statement.

Bonta's lawsuit states that California's Emergency Services Law prohibits ""the kind of patient dumping (Nusslock) experienced and requires all licensed health facilities"" with an emergency department provide emergency care to those who need it. The lawsuit alleges violations of state civil rights and unfair competition laws."
Justice Department finds Georgia is 'deliberately indifferent' to unchecked abuses at its prisons,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/georgia-prisons-death-sex-abuse-justice-department-72f4ba2bc960d4b0feaeb5663906e175,2024-10-01T17:16:26Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- Georgia prisons are ""deliberately indifferent"" to unchecked deadly violence, widespread drug use, extortion and sexual abuse at state lockups, the U.S. Justice Department said Tuesday, threatening to sue the state if it doesn't quickly take steps to curb rampant violations of prisoners' Eighth Amendment protections against cruel punishment.

The allegations laid out in a stark 93-page report are the result of a statewide civil rights investigation into Georgia prisons announced in September 2021, when federal officials cited particular concern about stabbings, beatings and other violence.

""Grossly inadequate staffing"" is part of the reason violence and other abuse flourishes uncontrolled, and sometimes unreported or uninvestigated, the report said, saying the state appears ""deliberately indifferent"" to the risk faced by people incarcerated in its prisons.

Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who oversees the department's civil rights division, presented the findings of the investigation Tuesday during a press conference.

""The state has created a chaotic and dangerous environment,"" she said. ""The violence is pervasive and endemic.""

Multiple allegations of sexual abuse are recounted in the report, including abuse of LGBTQ inmates. A transgender woman reported being sexually assaulted at knifepoint. Another inmate said he was ""extorted for money"" and sexually abused after six people entered his cell.

""In March 2021, a man from Georgia State Prison who had to be hospitalized due to physical injuries and food deprivation reported his cellmate had been sexually assaulting and raping him over time,"" the report said.

Homicide behind bars is also a danger. The report said there were five homicides at four different prisons in just one month in 2023.

The number of homicides among prisoners has grown over the years -- from seven in 2017 to 35 in 2023, the report said.

Included in the report are 13 pages of recommended short-and long-term measures the state should take. The report concludes with a warning that legal action was likely. The document said the Attorney General may file a lawsuit to correct the problems, and could also intervene in any related, existing private suits in 15 days.

The Georgia Department of Corrections ""is committed to the safety of all of the offenders in its custody and denies that it has engaged in a pattern or practice of violating their civil rights or failing to protect them from harm due to violence,"" Corrections spokeswoman Lori Benoit said in an email in 2021, when the investigation was announced. ""This commitment includes the protection of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and intersex (LGBTI) prisoners from sexual harassment, sexual abuse, and sexual assault.""

At the time the investigation was announced three years ago, assistant Attorney General Clarke said the investigation would focus on ""harm to prisoners resulting from prisoner-on-prisoner violence.""

The Justice Department's investigation was prompted by an extensive review of publicly available data and other information, Clarke said in 2021. Among factors considered, she said, were concerns raised by citizens, family members of people in prison and civil rights groups, as well as photos and videos that have leaked out of the state's prisons that have ""highlighted widespread contraband weapons and open gang activity in the prisons.""

Woman who lost husband and son uses probate process to obtain gunman's records,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/maine-shooting-probate-hearing-records-3c10a52c0553f6860f6bc608de27b1bc,2024-10-01T16:23:06Z,"AUGUSTA, Maine (AP) -- A woman who lost her husband and son in Maine's deadliest shooting is seeking the gunman's health and military records through the probate process.

Cynthia Young filed a petition to become a special administrator of Robert Card's estate to obtain the records for herself, others who lost loved ones, and attorneys preparing lawsuits. The move was not opposed by Card's son, who is his sole heir. A hearing was set for Tuesday afternoon.

The records will help parties evaluate legal claims and may help families ""understand why the mass shooting occurred and what steps could have been taken to prevent it,"" her filing said.

Eighteen people were killed when the 40-year-old Army reservist opened fire on Oct. 25, 2023, at two locations in Lewiston, Maine.

Young lost her husband Bill and her 14-year-old son Aaron at a bowling alley, the first of two locations targeted by Card. The other was a bar and grill that was hosting a cornhole tournament.

An independent commission concluded both the Army Reserve and law enforcement agencies missed opportunities to intervene in the gunman's psychiatric crisis and initiate steps to seize his weapons before the tragedy.

In the filing, Young said she's seeking a limited role in obtaining documents surrounding Card. She said it won't interfere with the family or others if they want to move forward with probate at a later date.

Four law firms are jointly representing 90 plaintiffs, and someone is needed to serve as administrator of the estate to sign necessary releases to get information to investigate claims, Young's filing said.

The probate hearing was on the same day religious leaders held a service of remembrance and prayer outside the Maine State House, where the names of all of the victims were read aloud.

Faith leaders from 10 denominations offered prayers for healing for the survivors of the shootings and those who lost friends and family members. They also offered up prayers for the family of the gunman."
Johannesburg considers naming a street after a Palestinian woman who hijacked a plane,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/south-africa-sandton-street-renaming-palestine-bec02d2b06debe710a27d3871c91d865,2024-10-01T14:34:01Z,"JOHANNESBURG (AP) -- Officials in South Africa's biggest city of Johannesburg have proposed renaming a major street after a Palestinian woman who was involved in a hijacking more than 50 years ago, sparking criticism from several political parties and the city's Jewish community.

The city council is considering naming the street in its financial district of Sandton after Leila Khaled, a Palestinian militant and member of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine group.

Khaled, who is now 80 years old, gained infamy in 1969 when she was part of a group who hijacked a Trans World Airlines flight on a journey from Rome to Tel Aviv, Israel. She became known as the first woman to hijack a plane.

She was also one of two people who attempted to hijack an Israeli Airlines flight from Amsterdam to New York City the following year, which resulted in the other hijacker being fatally shot by air marshals.

Israel considers Khaled a terrorist, but she is widely seen as a hero and freedom fighter by Palestinians and by some in South Africa who support the Palestinian cause. The PFLP is part of the Palestine Liberation Organization, the internationally recognized representative of the Palestinian people. While the main PLO faction, Fatah, recognizes Israel's right to exist, the PFLP doesn't, and Israel, the United States and other Western allies of Israel consider it a terrorist group.

South Africa has historically close ties to the Palestinians and has accused Israel of committing genocide in the war in Gaza in a highly sensitive case that's being heard by the United Nations' top court. South Africa and Israel have been fiercely critical of each other over that case.

Khaled has previously visited South Africa.

The street renaming controversy dates back to 2018, when it was first proposed and reportedly sparked a brawl among Johannesburg city officials, according to local media coverage at the time. It was initially proposed by Al Jama-ah, a pro-Palestinian minority party in the Johannesburg council, and supported by the African National Congress, South Africa's largest political party.

The name change is being considered again and members of the public have until mid-October to register their objections.

The South African Zionist Federation said the proposed change was partly aimed at the fact that the U.S. consulate in Johannesburg is located on the same street, which is currently called Sandton Drive. SAZF spokesperson Rolene Marks said renaming the street ""after a failed terrorist with ties to a globally recognized terrorist organization"" would sow division in South Africa.

Marks has also previously called the proposal ""an affront to peace-loving South Africans"" and ""deliberately provocative"" toward Johannesburg's Jewish community.

Sandton Drive is a major road in the district of Sandton, which is considered to be the richest square mile in Africa. It's also been the site of several pro-Palestinian protests in recent months outside the U.S. consulate.

Fana Mkhonza, a council member for the African Christian Democratic Party, a South African political party opposed to the proposal, said Khaled did not qualify to have the street renamed after her, according to the city's policies. South Africa has renamed some streets in recent years to remove colonial references and better reflect and recognize the country's majority Black population, especially those who fought against the apartheid system of white minority rule that ended in 1994.

""As much as Ms. Khaled could be seen as a freedom fighter in a thin slice of South African society, her fight has been for the Palestinian cause, not for the development of Johannesburg,"" Mkhonza said. ""The ACDP does not see any tolerance, reconciliation and peace in this proposed person's name to replace Sandton Drive.""

Al Jama-ah said renaming the street would show solidarity with the Palestinian people and be a recognition of their struggle.

""While some argue that we should focus on South African heroes, we should not ignore international figures who have fought for justice and freedom,"" said Thapelo Ahmad, the Johannesburg chairperson of Al Jama-ah and the former mayor of the city who originally proposed the name change in 2018."
"Ina Garten, the Barefoot Contessa, looks back in memoir 'Be Ready When the Luck Happens'",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/barefoot-contessa-ina-garten-book-0c1047f38386a620a846507472a7f503,2024-10-01T14:28:50Z,"NEW YORK (AP) -- Long before Ina Garten's Barefoot Contessa mini-empire of bestselling cookbooks and TV shows ever took off, she found herself at an airport, wanting to learn to fly.

It was the late 1960s and she was a newlywed in Fayetteville, North Carolina. She and her soldier-husband, Jeffrey, would often pass a small private airport and Garten was intrigued.

She marched into the terminal to find out about taking flying lessons. ""I'm really sorry,"" the guy at the desk told her, ""but we don't have anybody who'll teach a girl how to fly.""

Do you think that stopped Ina Garten?

The story of how she refused to budge until she got lessons in a cockpit is included in her new memoir, ""Be Ready When the Luck Happens,"" which distills stories from her life into lessons for foodies and non-foodies, alike.

""I wanted it to be fun to read because otherwise nobody would read this,"" she tells The Associated Press. ""I wanted it to be stories from my life, but I also wanted each story to have a point -- in the way you could take a recipe away and make a chocolate cake, I want you to take the idea away and be able to use it in your life.""

The memoir -- written with help from writer Deborah Davis -- is packed with stories of Garten pushing for her vision, not least when in 1978 she spotted an ad in The New York Times and on a whim bought a little specialty food store in the Hamptons called Barefoot Contessa.

At the time, she was 30, writing policies on nuclear energy at the White House and had never worked in food, outside of re-selling Dunkin' Donuts to hungry students in her dorm room in college.

""It sounded a little crazy, but I was out of my mind with excitement. I didn't know if it would be the best decision or the worst mistake I ever made,"" she writes of the store, named after a 1954 Ava Gardner movie but perfectly summing up her philosophy of both elegant and earthy.

Garten would, of course, turn it into a global, inviting brand thanks to her keen eye for quality and dedication to sourcing the finest ingredients. She also put in the long hours, learning each dish and even sleeping in the store.

""The process of writing the book really kind of gave me confidence that this wasn't just luck -- that I had actually worked really hard for it with determination and vision,"" she says ""I stuck with what I wanted. And my life has turned out so much better than I could have even dreamed.""

Fans know much of her story already since her cookbooks are filled with personal anecdotes, but they may not know about her chilly childhood in Connecticut.

She describes her father as abusive at times, a man who told her when she was 15 that no one would ever love her. Her mother was distant and used food as a source of control, serving broiled chicken or fish with canned peas and carrots. ""I spent my early life searching -- no, begging -- for flavor,"" she writes.

That early nightmare helped her down the road. ""My childhood, because it was so painful, it gave me enormous empathy for people,"" she says. That meant she could read customers, putting herself in their shoes.

Readers will also learn for the first time about her six-month separation from Jeffrey, which took them to the brink of divorce. Their relationship has lately been heralded on social media -- #couplegoals or #relationshipgoals -- as an ideal partnership, but Gartner reveals it took work.

After finding her new career path, Garten rebelled at the traditional domestic chores expected of her -- cooking, cleaning, shopping, managing. ""When I bought Barefoot Contessa, I shattered our traditional roles -- took a baseball bat to them and left them in pieces,"" she writes. Following some time apart, the couple agreed to meet each other halfway.

""There are lessons that any reader can find throughout, specifically about persistence and trusting yourself and your instincts and also taking chances,"" says Gillian Blake, executive vice president, publisher and editor-in-chief of Crown & Currency.

""I think there's a thematic resonance between the way she's taught people how to cook and the way she teases out these inspirational lessons for larger life questions.""

Garten may be known for her approachability, but she admits to having a stubborn streak -- ""a barrier to me isn't a stop sign; it's a call to action,"" she writes -- and she isn't a blushing flower. She once worked in the backroom of a strip club.

She writes that she faced off both a robber at gunpoint who wanted $50 and a bank officer who wouldn't make a loan to her business because she was a woman and likely would soon have babies.

There are also lighter stories about a memorable lunch with Mel Brooks, and meeting Elmo, Jennifer Garner and Taylor Swift, plus a boozy tale of playing beer bong with soccer star Abby Wambach.

There are practical lessons -- like standing up for yourself, even when it's hard or taking a risk. Find just one person who really believes in you, she argues.

""People who are well known and successful aren't there because they are smarter, more creative. It's because they hit a wall and they just said, 'I don't even see the wall. I'm going to get around the wall. I really want to do this and I'm going to figure it out,'"" she says.

""One thing I learned by doing the book, which surprised me, is I had a lot more courage than I thought I had. And I realized that those things that I did with courage were the making of my life."""

Officers were alerted to the incident in the Oerlikon district of Switzerland's biggest city shortly after midday. Police said the children were on their way to the day-care center with a woman who works for the facility when the man suddenly stabbed them.

The center employee quickly overwhelmed the assailant with the help of another man and held him until police arrived. The suspect, who police said was 23 years old and Chinese, was arrested.

Three 5-year-old boys were taken to hospitals, one with serious injuries and two others with injuries of medium severity, police said in a statement.

Chanel show wrestles with designer void. Actor Lupita Nyong'o talks about diversity in fashion,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/chanel-paris-fashion-week-lupita-295f0d27ab9e2cfca5c3b1cb28eb5739,2024-10-01T14:01:27Z,"PARIS (AP) -- A giant empty cage greeted Chanel's guests at its return to the Grand Palais venue on Tuesday. Though perhaps not intentionally symbolic, the décor seemed to capture the current state of the house itself: a majestic structure empty of creative direction. With Virginie Viard's recent departure, Chanel finds itself at a crossroads, as the fashion world eagerly awaits the appointment of a new creative leader.

Meanwhile, in a powerful step toward embracing diversity, Chanel announced Lupita Nyong'o as its newest ambassador. The appointment of the Oscar-winning actor, who identifies as Kenyan-Mexican, comes at a pivotal moment for the French fashion house that had faced criticism in the past for its lack of inclusivity. This move follows the widely-lauded appointment of British-Indian Leena Nair as Chanel's global chief executive in January 2022, making her the only woman of color at the helm of a major luxury brand.

Here are some highlights of spring-summer ready-to-wear shows:

The spring collection delivered many familiar elements from Chanel's vast repertoire -- chiffon capes, slit skirts, embroidered transparent shirt dresses, trench coats adorned with multicolored feather prints, aviator jackets with Peter Pan collars, total pink or blue tweed looks, and the iconic little black dress (LBD) that Chanel herself introduced to the world. Tweed, jersey, faille, transparent embroidery, sequins, fringe, pastel knits, and sparkling platform shoes all made an appearance, forming a showcase of the house's signatures.

Yet despite the breadth and richness of the offering, something was amiss. There was little cohesion, and at times, the collection lacked the unmistakable soul that once characterized Chanel's shows. A series of foulard-printed gowns seemed out of place -- as if borrowed clumsily from another narrative altogether.

With a snip of scissors, Gabrielle ""Coco"" Chanel freed women from their corsets. Today, Chanel itself needs liberation. The applause at the end of the show, which featured designs that often felt uninspired, was distinctly muted, with critics visibly shifting in their seats.

Star appearances by Elvis Presley's granddaughter Riley Keough, who capped the show with a funky vocal performance of a Prince hit from inside the gilded cage, as well as interviews given by Lupita Nyong'o, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Vanessa Paradis, Margaret Qualley, Naomi Campbell, and Erykah Badu, seemed like an effort to divert attention from the elephant -- or the empty cage -- in the room.

Chanel is unquestionably a fashion juggernaut, and it will weather this moment of transition. However, there is no overstating the importance of the decision the house now faces. Chanel must find a designer who can reshape and redefine its vision for the future -- someone who can capture the spirit of creativity and innovation that has been the essence of Chanel since its founding.

The fashion world is rife with speculation. Potential successors include Daniel Roseberry, known for his dramatic work at Schiaparelli, Marc Jacobs, a seasoned classicist with Paris experience, and Nadège Vanhée, the skilled designer from Hermès.

Viard, ousted this summer, succeeded Karl Lagerfeld upon his death in 2019 and was his closest collaborator for decades. She had overseen record sales for Chanel, reaching a reported $19.7 billion last year. Ready-to-wear sales reportedly increased 23% during her tenure.

Viard was only the third creative director in Chanel's over 100-year history, following Lagerfeld and legendary founder Chanel herself.

Speaking with the Associated Press, Nyong'o shared her excitement and the deep sense of responsibility accompanying the new role. ""It's a great honor,"" she said. ""Chanel is a legacy brand with a long history. And to be the newest face of it feels monumental. I feel very, very proud and excited to take this new journey with a brand that I think is dynamic and always feminine and regal.""

Nyong'o's appointment comes as a breath of fresh air in an industry criticized for lack of diversity and reluctance to change. The number of Black designers leading heritage houses remains alarmingly low -- currently only Balmain's Olivier Rousteing and Louis Vuitton men's designer Pharrell Williams hold such positions in Parisian legacy brands.

For Nyong'o, joining Chanel is about more than wearing beautiful clothes -- it's about contributing to a narrative shift in fashion. ""The message that I bring naturally and deliberately to the role is that things have changed. And we don't want them to go back to what they once were,"" she said.

Nyong'o drew inspiration from watching a recent documentary about Bethann Hardison, the iconic model and activist who was at the forefront of pushing for diversity in fashion during the 1960s and 1970s. Hardison, who rose to prominence after her appearance at the historic 1973 Battle of Versailles -- a groundbreaking fashion show that brought American designers into the spotlight -- became one of the first high-profile Black models and an outspoken advocate for change.

""In that documentary, I was really alarmed to see how much work had been done to diversify the fashion industry, but then how much it reverted to monoculture in the following years,"" Nyong'o said.

Hardison's tireless efforts led to significant gains for Black models in the past, but the subsequent regression underscored how fragile those victories could be. Her fight for inclusivity in fashion serves as both a cautionary tale and a source of inspiration for Nyong'o, who now finds herself continuing Hardison's legacy.

""It took a step back, so for me that was testament to the fact that it takes consciousness. It's a conscious effort that has to be made on a daily basis and in present time. You don't fix it once and then hope it stays that way,"" Nyong'o added. She sees Chanel's decision to name her as an ambassador as part of a broader, deliberate declaration: ""I feel like these movements that Chanel is making are part of declaring a desire to represent a more realistic world. And I'm proud to be one of those faces that is sending that message.""

The importance of visibility in reshaping perceptions cannot be understated.

""When I was growing up, I didn't see myself in ads for brands like this. It resulted in me going through quite the identity crisis and feeling undervalued by the world,"" Nyong'o said candidly. She recounted those early days -- staring at glossy magazine pages, searching for a face that mirrored her own, only to find none.

Now, she imagines a little girl somewhere, watching her in a Chanel campaign, seeing someone who looks like her -- someone who is elegant, celebrated, and valued.

""I would hope that there is a message for little girls,"" she continued. ""My work as an actor and as an author, as a podcast maker, and now as a brand ambassador, is to change that by just occupying the space."" It is a powerful reminder of the transformative impact of representation; when someone finally occupies a space that was once empty, it changes the way people see themselves and the world around them.

The luxury sector has frequently been accused of tokenism and superficial diversity efforts -- making short-term gestures without genuine long-term change. Nyong'o is determined to make her role count, embodying the idea that representation must come with influence and purpose."
Second chapter begins for Seattle Kraken with upgrades looking to rebound after missing playoffs,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/kraken-preview-capsule-1d28cb70e6d67c537a7e6a7a98e63d7d,2024-10-01T10:18:33Z,"COACH: Dan Bylsma (320-190-55 in 8 seasons with Pittsburgh and Buffalo, 1 Stanley Cup title), hired May 28.

ADDITIONS: Bylsma, F Chandler Stephenson, D Brandon Montour, D Josh Mahura.

GOALIES: Joey Daccord (19-18-11, 2.46 GAA, 0.916 save percentage) and Philipp Grubauer (14-16-2, 2.85 GAA, 0.899).

BETMGM STANLEY CUP ODDS: 66-1.

The organization underwent its first significant shake up following a disappointing third season with the firing of coach Dave Hakstol and the decision to hire former Stanley Cup champion coach Dan Bylsma. His task will be to bring some punch to an offense that regressed badly last season. His coaching staff includes Jessica Campbell, the first woman to work as an assistant coach on an NHL bench. The Kraken signed center Chandler Stephenson and defenseman Brandon Montour to big contracts in the hope of adding some offense to a team that last year was strong defensively and received terrific goaltending from the combo of Joey Daccord and Philipp Grubauer. Seattle will need Jared McCann to continue his evolution into a top scorer, could use a rebound season from Matty Beniers and should see the full-time arrival of top prospect Shane Wright. The Western Conference is loaded but Seattle could content for a playoff spot if others in the Pacific Division regress.

The good: Montour and Stephenson are the kinds of upgrades Seattle needed, even if their seven-year contracts worth nearly $94 million become anchors later on. Montour gives the Kraken a second points scorer on the blue line along with Vince Dunn without sacrificing one of their strengths last season limiting high-danger scoring chances. Stephenson's arrival also means McCann can play on the wing instead of center and keeps Beniers from having to match up against other top center lines.

The not-so-good: There is regression to the norm and then there is plummeting. Seattle's shooting percentage in its playoff season was 11.6%, second in the league. Last season, the Kraken shot 9.1%. The offense must improve. Hakstol's system was stagnant and Seattle was too inconsistent on the power play. The new additions should help but Seattle must get better seasons from Beniers, Jordan Eberle, Yanni Gourde and something from the fourth line for the offense to improve.

Given a chance to be a regular starter, Daccord become a fan favorite letting his personality show during a terrific season. Seattle needs more of that - the good goaltending and a little bit of excitement on the ice. Montour should be an immediate boost on the blue line and former first-round pick Wright has a chance to become a regular in the lineup after a strong season playing for Bylsma at Coachella Valley in the AHL."
Germany arrests woman who allegedly passed airport details to suspected spy for China,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/germany-china-spying-airport-lawmaker-former-assistant-abd38fe18d7f38e0dc4f759720cb5e3d,2024-10-01T10:08:27Z,"BERLIN (AP) -- German authorities have arrested a Chinese national accused of passing information on a major air freight hub to a man who is suspected of spying for China, prosecutors said Tuesday.

The woman, identified only as Yaqi X. in line with German privacy rules, was arrested in the eastern city of Leipzig on Monday, federal prosecutors said in a statement. She is suspected of working for a Chinese intelligence service, providing information on flights, freight including military equipment and passengers.

The suspect works for a company that provides logistical services at sites including the Leipzig/Halle Airport, prosecutors said. The airport handles both passengers and freight but is known principally as a cargo hub.

They alleged that, between August 2023 and mid-February this year, she repeatedly passed information to Jian Guo -- a German national who was an aide to far-right European Parliament lawmaker Maximilian Krah and was arrested in April. That, prosecutors said, included above all information on the transport of military equipment and of people with connections to a German defense company, which they didn't identify.

A judge on Monday ordered Yaqi X. held in custody pending a possible indictment, prosecutors said. Her apartment and workplace were searched.

Prosecutors have said that Guo is accused of working for a Chinese intelligence service and of repeatedly passing on information on negotiations and decisions in the European Parliament. They allege that he also snooped on Chinese dissidents in Germany.

In a separate case in April, three Germans were arrested on suspicion of spying for China and arranging to transfer information on technology with potential military uses."
A Texas man is set to be executed for fatally stabbing twin teenage girls in 1989,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/texas-execution-garcia-white-76c56a0a76ab94991b2d2b77e3faaad8,2024-10-01T05:21:02Z,"HOUSTON (AP) -- A Texas man linked to five killings and convicted of fatally stabbing twin 16-year-old girls more than three decades ago is facing execution on Tuesday evening.

Garcia White was condemned for the December 1989 killings of Annette and Bernette Edwards. The bodies of the twin girls and their mother, Bonita Edwards, were found in their Houston apartment.

White, 61, a former college football player who later worked as a fry cook, was scheduled to receive a lethal injection Tuesday evening at the state penitentiary in Huntsville. White would be the sixth inmate put to death in the U.S. in the last 11 days.

Testimony showed White went to the girls' Houston home to smoke crack with their mother, Bonita, who also was fatally stabbed. When the girls came out of their room to see what had happened, White attacked them. Evidence showed White broke down the locked door of the girls' bedroom. He was later tied to the deaths of a grocery store owner and another woman.

""Garcia White committed five murders in three different transactions and two of his victims were teenage girls. This is the type of case that the death penalty was intended for,"" said Josh Reiss, chief of the Post-Conviction Writs Division with the Harris County District Attorney's Office in Houston.

White's lawyers have asked the U.S. Supreme Court to stop his execution after lower courts previously rejected his petitions for a stay. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles on Friday denied White's request to commute his death sentence to a lesser penalty or to grant him a 30-day reprieve.

His lawyers argued that Texas' top criminal appeals court has refused ""to accept medical evidence and strong factual backing"" showing White is intellectually disabled.

The Supreme Court in 2002 barred the execution of intellectually disabled people. But it has given states some discretion to decide how to determine such disabilities. Justices have wrestled with how much discretion to allow.

White's lawyers also accused the Texas appeals court of not allowing his defense team to present evidence that could spare him a death sentence, including DNA evidence that another man also was at the crime scene and scientific evidence that would show White was ""likely suffering from a cocaine induced psychotic break during his actions.""

White's lawyers also argued he is entitled to a new review of his death sentence, alleging the Texas appeals court has created a new scheme for sentencing in capital punishment cases after a recent Supreme Court ruling in another Texas death row case.

""Mr. White's case illustrates everything wrong with the current death penalty in Texas -- he has evidence that he is intellectually disabled which the (Texas appeals court) refuses to permit him to develop. He has significant evidence that could result in a sentence other than death at punishment but cannot present it or develop it,"" White's attorneys said in their petition to the high court.

In a filing to the Supreme Court, the Texas Attorney General's Office said White has not presented evidence to support his claim he is intellectually disabled. The filing also said White's claims of evidence of another person at the crime scene and that cocaine use affected his actions have previously been rejected by the courts.

""White presents no reason to delay his execution date any longer. The Edwards family -- and the victims of White's other murders ... deserve justice for his decades-old crimes,"" the attorney general's office said.

The deaths of the twin girls and their mother went unsolved for about six years until White confessed to the killings after he was arrested in connection with the July 1995 death of grocery store owner Hai Van Pham, who was fatally beaten during a robbery at his business. Police said White also confessed to fatally beating another woman, Greta Williams, in 1989.

White would be the fifth inmate put to death this year in Texas, the nation's busiest capital punishment state, and the 19th in the U.S."
Jimmy Carter and hometown of Plains celebrate the 39th president's 100th birthday,AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/jimmy-carter-100th-birthday-1e540c277dea07bd84242d290b4ebcdc,2024-10-01T04:21:18Z,"ATLANTA (AP) -- Jimmy Carter is preparing to celebrate his 100th birthday on Tuesday, the first time an American president has lived a full century and the latest milestone in a life that took the son of a Depression-era farmer to the White House and across the world as a Nobel Peace Prize-winning humanitarian and advocate for democracy.

Living the last 19 months in home hospice care in Plains, the Georgia Democrat and 39th president has continued to defy expectations, just as he did through a remarkable rise from his family peanut farming and warehouse business to the world stage. He served one presidential term from 1977 to 1981 and then worked more than four decades leading The Carter Center, which he and his wife Rosalynn co-founded in 1982 to ""wage peace, fight disease, and build hope.""

""Not everybody gets 100 years on this earth, and when somebody does, and when they use that time to do so much good for so many people, it's worth celebrating,"" Jason Carter, the former president's grandson and chair of The Carter Center governing board, said in an interview.

""These last few months, 19 months, now that he's been in hospice, it's been a chance for our family to reflect,"" he continued, ""and then for the rest of the country and the world to really reflect on him. That's been a really gratifying time.""

The former president was born Oct. 1, 1924 in Plains, where he has lived more than 80 of his 100 years. He is expected to mark his birthday in the same one-story home he and Rosalynn built in the early 1960s -- before his first election to the Georgia state Senate. The former first lady, who was also born in Plains, died last November at 96.

The Carter Center on Sept. 17 hosted a musical gala in Atlanta to celebrate the former president with a range of genres and artists, including some who campaigned with him in 1976. The event raised more than $1.2 million for the center's programs and will be broadcast Tuesday evening on Georgia Public Broadcasting.

In St. Paul, Minnesota, Habitat for Humanity volunteers are honoring Carter with a five-day effort to build 30 houses. The Carters became top ambassadors for the international organization after leaving the White House and hosted annual building projects into their 90s. Carter survived a cancer diagnosis at age 90, then several falls and a hip replacement in his mid-90s before announcing at 98 that he would enter hospice care.

Townspeople in Plains planned another concert Tuesday evening.

The last time Jimmy Carter was seen publicly was nearly a year ago, using a reclining wheelchair to attend his wife's two funeral services. Visibly diminished and silent, he was joined on the front row of Glenn Memorial United Methodist Church in Atlanta by the couple's four children, every living former first lady, President Joe Biden and his wife Jill and former President Bill Clinton. A day later, Carter joined his extended family and parishioners at Maranatha Baptist Church in Plains, where the former president taught Sunday School for decades.

Jason Carter said the 100th birthday celebrations were not something the family expected to see once his grandmother died. The former president's hospital bed had been set up in the same room so he could see his wife of 77 years and talk to her in her final days and hours.

""We frankly didn't think he was going to go on much longer,"" Jason Cater said. ""But it's a faith journey for him, and he's really given himself over to what he feels is God's plan. He knows he's not in charge. But in these last few months, especially, he has gotten a lot more engaged in world events, a lot more engaged in politics, a lot more, just engaged, emotionally, with all of us.""

Jason Carter said the centenarian president, born only four years after women were granted the constitutional right to vote and four decades before Black women won ballot access, is eager to cast his 2024 presidential ballot -- for Vice President Kamala Harris, the Democrat who wants to become the first woman, second Black person and first person of south Asian descent to reach the Oval Office.

""He, like a lot of us, was incredibly gratified by his friend Joe Biden's courageous choice to pass the torch,"" the younger Carter said. ""You know, my grandfather and The Carter Center have observed more than 100 elections in 40 other countries, right? So, he knows how rare it is for somebody who's a sitting president to give up power in any context.""

Jason Carter continued, ""When we started asking him about his 100th birthday, he said he was excited to vote for Kamala Harris.""

Early voting in Georgia begins Oct. 15, two weeks into James Earl Carter Jr.'s 101st year."
"Claudia Sheinbaum to be sworn in as 1st female president of Mexico, a country with pressing problems",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mexico-president-claudia-sheinbaum-7d3599b39a7298df46e7eda34d80afee,2024-10-01T04:18:42Z,"MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Claudia Sheinbaum will take the oath of office Tuesday as Mexico's first female president in more than 200 years of independence, promising to protect an expanded social safety net and fight for the poor like her predecessor, but facing pressing problems.

The 62-year-old scientist-turned-politician will receive a country with a number of immediate challenges, foremost among them stubbornly high levels of violence, a sluggish economy and hurricane-battered Acapulco.

Sheinbaum romped to victory in June with nearly 60% of the vote, propelled largely by the sustained popularity of her political mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

He took office six years ago declaring ""For the good of all, first the poor,"" and promising historical change from the neoliberal economic policies of his predecessors. Sheinbaum promised continuity from his popular social policies to controversial constitutional reforms to the judiciary and National Guard rammed through during his final days in office.

Despite her pledge of continuity, she is a very different personality.

""López Obrador was a tremendously charismatic president and many times that charisma allowed him to cover up some political errors that Claudia Sheinbaum will not have that possibility of doing,"" said Carlos Pérez Ricart, a political analyst at Mexico's Center for Economic Research and Teaching. ""So, where López Obrador was charismatic, Claudia Sheinbaum will have to be effective.""

He is not leaving her an easy situation.

Her first trip as president will be to the flood-stricken Pacific coast resort of Acapulco.

Hurricane John, which struck as a Category 3 hurricane last week and then reemerged into the ocean and struck again as a tropical storm, caused four days of incredibly heavy rain that killed at least 17 people along the coast around Acapulco. Acapulco was devastated in October 2023 by Hurricane Otis, and had not recovered from that blow when John hit.

Sheinbaum must also deal with raging violence in the cartel-dominated northern city of Culiacan, where factional fighting within the Sinaloa cartel broke out after drug lords Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada and Joaquín Guzmán López were apprehended in the United States after they flew there in a small plane on July 25.

López Obrador has long sought to avoid confronting Mexico's drug cartels and has openly appealed to the gangs to keep the peace among themselves, but the limitations of that strategy have become glaringly apparent in Culiacan, the capital of Sinaloa state, where gun battles have raged on the city's streets. Local authorities and even the army -- which López Obrador has relied on for everything -- have essentially admitted that the fighting will only end when the cartel bosses decide to end it.

But that's only the latest hotspot.

Drug-related violence is surging from Tijuana in the north to Chiapas in the south, displacing thousands.

While Sheinbaum inherits a huge budget deficit, unfinished construction projects and a burgeoning bill for her party's cash hand-out programs -- all of which could send financial markets tumbling -- perhaps her biggest looming concern is the possibility of a victory for Donald Trump in the Nov. 5 U.S. presidential election.

Trump has already vowed to slap 100% tariffs on vehicles made in Mexico. Though that would likely violate the current U.S.-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, there are other things Trump could do to make life difficult for Sheinbaum, including his pledge of massive deportations.

Things with its northern neighbor were already tense after López Obrador said he was putting relations with the U.S. embassy ""on pause"" after public criticism of the proposed judicial overhaul.

First lady Jill Biden struck an optimistic tone for relations with the incoming Sheinbaum administration saying at a reception Monday that, ""Under Dr. Sheinbaum's presidency I know we will continue to build a more prosperous, safe and democratic region -- and take the steps in our U.S.-Mexico partnership.""

There are areas where Sheinbaum could try to take Mexico in a new direction. For example, she has a Ph.D. in energy engineering and has spoken of the need to address climate change. López Obrador built a massive new oil refinery and poured money into the state-owned oil company. But his budget commitments do not leave her much room to maneuver.

Jennifer Piscopo, professor of gender and politics at the Royal Holloway University of London who has studied Latin America for decades, said Mexico electing its first female leader is important because it will show girls they can do it too, but it can also create unrealistic expectations.

""Woman firsts are powerful symbols, but they do not gain magic power,"" she said. ""Especially when the governance challenges are so large, expecting magic solutions overnight can also generate outsized disappointment."""
"Who is Claudia Sheinbaum, the scientist who will head Mexico as its first female president?",AP NEWS,,https://apnews.com/article/mexico-claudia-sheinbaum-woman-president-aa24527fc05dafa9e30b28e4bb40ccbd,2024-10-01T04:18:22Z,"MEXICO CITY (AP) -- Claudia Sheinbaum takes office Tuesday as Mexico's first female president in the nation's more than 200 years of independence.

The 62-year-old former Mexico City mayor and lifelong leftist campaigned on a promise of continuity, of protecting and expanding the signature initiatives of her mentor, former President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.

In the four months between her election and inauguration she held that line, backing López Obrador on issues big and small. But Sheinbaum is a very different person; she likes data and doesn't have López Obrador's backslapping personal touch.

Mexico now waits to see if she will step out of his shadow.

Sheinbaum's background is in science. She has a Ph.D. in energy engineering. Her brother is a physicist. In a 2023 interview with The Associated Press, Sheinbaum said, ""I believe in science.""

Observers say that grounding showed itself in Sheinbaum's actions as mayor during the COVID-19 pandemic, when her city of some 9 million people took a different approach from what López Obrador espoused at the national level.

She comes from an older, more solidly left tradition that predates López Obrador's nationalistic, populist movement.

Her parents were leading activists in Mexico's 1968 student movement, which ended tragically in a government massacre of hundreds of student demonstrators in Mexico City's Tlatelolco plaza just days before the Summer Olympics opened there that year.

Sheinbaum is also the first president with a Jewish background in the largely Catholic country.

Sheinbaum led wire to wire and won convincingly in June with almost 60% of the vote, about double the number of her nearest competitor, Xóchitl Gálvez.

As López Obrador's chosen successor, she enjoyed the boost of the high popularity he maintained throughout his six years in office.

The opposition's coalition led by Gálvez struggled to gain traction, while support for the governing party carried over to Congress, where voters gave Morena and its allies margins that allowed it to pass important constitutional changes before López Obrador left office.

Before passage of a controversial constitutional overhaul of Mexico's judiciary that will make all judges stand for election, Sheinbaum stood with López Obrador who had pushed it.

Sheinbaum said ""the reforms to the judicial system will not affect our commercial relations, nor private Mexican investments, nor foreign ones. Rather the opposite, there will be a greater and better rule of law and democracy for everyone.""

Shortly after, when López Obrador's proposal to put the National Guard under military command was being considered, Sheinbaum defended it against critics. She said it would not militarize the country and that the National Guard would respect human rights.

And just days before she took office, Sheinbaum stood with López Obrador in his long-running diplomatic spat with Spain. She defended her decision to not invite Spain's King Felipe VI to her inauguration, saying in part that the king had failed to apologize for Spain's conquest of Mexico as López Obrador had demanded years earlier.

Sheinbaum's victory came 70 years after women won the right to vote in Mexico.

The race really came down to two women, Sheinbaum and Gálvez, but Mexico's prevailing machismo still pushed both women to explain why they thought they could be president.

Since 2018, Mexico's Congress has had a 50-50 gender split, in part due to gender quotas set for party candidates. Still, Sheinbaum inherits a country with soaring levels of violence against women.

There are also still many parts of the country, especially rural Indigenous areas where men hold all the power. And some 2.5 million women toil in domestic work where despite reforms they continue to face low pay, abuse by employers, long hours and unstable working conditions.

Mexico's Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that national laws prohibiting abortions are unconstitutional and violate women's rights.

Although the Mexican ruling orders the removal of abortion from the federal penal code and requires federal health institutions to offer the procedure to anyone who requests it, further state-by-state legal work is pending to remove all penalties.

Feminists say that simply electing a woman as president does not guarantee she will govern with a gender perspective. Both Sheinbaum and López Obrador have been criticized before for appearing to lack empathy toward women protesting against gender violence."

Wigdor LLP, the firm representing Roe, released a statement following the filing.

""We applaud our client's courage in moving forward with her complaint against Garth Brooks. The complaint filed today demonstrates that sexual predators exist not only in corporate America, Hollywood and in the rap and rock and roll industries but also in the world of country music. We are confident that Brooks will be held accountable for his actions and his efforts to silence our client through the filing of a preemptive complaint in Mississippi was nothing other than an act of desperation and attempted intimidation.

A Florida woman accused of suffocating her boyfriend inside a suitcase prepares to stand trial next week after Hurricane Milton delayed the case.

Sarah Boone's request for professional hairstyling and makeup for her murder trial was denied by a judge last week because of security concerns about those products, CourtTV reported.

Boone, 46, has been charged with second-degree murder in connection with the 2020 suffocation death of her boyfriend, Jorge Torres, 42, at their Winter Park apartment.

Torres was found dead inside the suitcase at the apartment the morning of Feb. 24, 2020.

WOMAN ACCUSED OF KILLING HER BOYFRIEND IN SUITCASE SAYS HER 8TH LAWYER HAS 'SNOTTY ATTITUDE'

The Florida State Attorney's Office released a video allegedly recorded on Boone's cellphone, showing Torres' final moments as he shouted, ""I can't breathe,"" after allegedly being shut inside the suitcase during a drunken game of hide-and-seek.

Boone allegedly told law enforcement that she and Torres drank wine and played hide-and-seek when she passed out in her bed.

Boone had sought to suppress her initial interview with police from being used during the trial, but a judge denied that request, the Orlando Sentinel reported.

The wide receiver was arrested on misdemeanor charges of battery and assault of an unborn child, per Athens-Clarke County Jail records. Young was booked into the Athens-Clarke County detention center shortly after 4 a.m. ET. His bond was set at $2,500.

One Georgia football program employee and 10 players have been taken into police custody for some sort of driving-related incident within the past 22 months.

Young spent the 2022 and 2023 seasons playing for the Miami Hurricanes, racking up 939 yards over the two years. He also hauled in 10 touchdowns at Miami before deciding to transfer to Georgia in December 2023.

Georgia athletic department spokesperson Steven Drummond declined to offer further comment on the arrest.

""This is a pending legal matter, we will have no further comment at this time,"" Drummond said in a statement to ESPN.

VANDERBILT QUARTERBACK AFTER HUGE ALABAMA UPSET: 'WE WANT A CHANCE AT THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP'

A woman, who was listed in the incident report as Young's ex-girlfriend, informed authorities that she arrived at the football player's apartment around midnight on Oct. 8 to talk about the status of their relationship.

According to the complaint, the 20-year-old woman stated that Young ""grabbed her left arm near her biceps and triceps and physically pulled her out of his room."" She alleged that the wide receiver was ""using derogatory terms and being demeaning of her,"" before claiming he closed and locked the door to his bedroom.

The woman said she was gathering her personal items when a friend called her cellphone. After answering the call, the woman told investigators that, ""Mr. Young came out and grabbed her from behind. She said that he picked her up and began to squeeze her torso and abdomen very hard. She said she felt like [Young] was trying to harm her.""

The woman was taken to a local hospital after an officer noticed some bruising and redness. She ""had a bruise and discoloration on the bottom right side of her chest where it meets the abdomen. She also had redness on her right flank. No injuries were noted on the arm where she said Mr. Young grabbed her,"" the officer reported.

Young pushed back against the accusations that he grabbed the woman, saying he simply walked her to the door when he noticed the discussion became elevated. He also told police that the woman did not receive the injuries ""from him.""

""Colbie Young was arrested last night after he asked his ex-girlfriend to leave his apartment,"" Kim Stephens, an attorney representing Young told ESPN. ""He did not make physical contact with her in any way that could ever be considered a crime. I expect Mr. Young to be fully exonerated once our investigation is complete and the truth revealed.""

Young has 149 receiving yards and two receiving touchdowns so far this season.

Wide receiver Rodarius ""Rara"" Thomas, whose transfer to Georgia was announced one year before Young's, was arrested on misdemeanor battery charges in January 2023. Thomas transferred from Mississippi State just one month prior to being taken into police custody.

Thomas accepted a plea deal, but was dismissed from the football program this past offseason after he was arrested on multiple family violence charges in a separate case. He was initially suspended from the football team on an indefinite basis, in accordance with the school's policy after felony charges are filed against an individual.

""He can no longer be part of the football team,"" Georgia football head coach Kirby Smart said in August following his meeting with Thomas upon the receiver's release from jail on bond. ""He understands that. We wish him the best moving forward."""
Kamala Harris's 'joy' is quietly turning to panic for Democrats,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/kamala-harriss-joy-quietly-turning-panic-democrats,2024-10-08T16:59:02Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

In the days after Joe Biden dropped out of the presidential election to be replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris, there was real joy among Democrats across the country. That was not just a made-up media story, I saw it, but with less than a month to go, the joy is gone and a quiet panic is setting in.

In the first week of August I was, appropriately enough, in Harrisburg, Pa. and Democrats I spoke to were ebullient and effervescent at the change atop the ticket. One woman told me of calling her mother to celebrate together the chance at a Black female president.

Other left-leaning voters told me that they didn't love how Biden had been shown the door but that they felt Harris could turn the race around and take down Donald Trump. For about a month, it sure looked that way.

5 KEY TAKEAWAYS FROM KAMALA HARRIS' '60 MINUTES' INTERVIEW

In San Francisco, most voters I spoke to, red and blue alike, felt like Harris was likely to win, that the Democrats' stalled campaign had called AAA, gotten a jump, and was back on the road.

Harris had erased the lead Trump had over Biden, quickly eclipsing him as the frontrunner and much like a new restaurant opening in a small town, voters were eager to give her a try.

While Republicans and some in the media were frustrated by her unwillingness to do traditional interviews or hold so much as one press conference, her arrogant advisers smirked and said basically, ""So what? She's winning.""

Well, she's not winning anymore, and with her back against the wall appeared on ""60 Minutes"" this week, showing voters the real reason why she is camera shy when it comes to tough questions.

Asked if she and the Biden administration had lost America's influence with our Middle East ally Israel, the veep once again proved herself to be a walking, talking salad bar, here is what she had to say:

""Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements by Israel that were very much prompted by, or a result of many things, including our advocacy for what needs to happen in the region.""

KAMALA HARRIS SET FOR EXTREMELY FRIENDLY INTERVIEW BLITZ WITH 'THE VIEW,' STEPHEN COLBERT AND HOWARD STERN

The most generous interpretation of this odd assemblage of verbiage is that she is saying, ""we're trying,"" the more likely one is that she has no idea what she is talking about.

Over the past two weeks in my travels, it has been increasingly difficult to engage Democrats about the presidential race, much like a fan whose team has dropped a few playoff games and who is avoiding the sports page, they just don't want to talk about it.

As one lifelong Democrat in Ohio who I did get to talk to put it, ""I don't know, she's just kind of there.""

It is hard to say exactly when the shine started wearing off the Harris penny, when joy gave way to frustration, but the failure of the Teamsters to endorse her, and the massive union's internal polling showing Trump with a lead seems significant.

CLICK HERE FOR MORE FOX NEWS OPINION

It was only after that, that I started hearing Democrats uttering words that seemed unthinkable back in August, namely, ""Maybe we should have stuck with Biden."" Ouch.

Biden himself even joked about it at a press conference, something he is at least still capable of, quipping ""I'm back in.""

Harris spokespeople are busy trying to talk Democratic voters down off the bridge, they insist she still leads in the polling averages, she has a war chest worth more than Fort Knox, and a ground game that Trump can only envy.

These points are all true, and the latter may prove decisive. The Harris movement may be Astroturf and not grassroots, much like her crowning as the nominee, but those busloads of supporters in matching teachers' union T-shirts are the same machine that gets out the vote.

But still, there is no mistaking that the thrill is gone.

It is not clear what Harris can do to reverse the clear trends favoring Trump today, ""60 Minutes"" wasn't it, and her appearances on podcasts, late night shows, and ""The View"" make her look like she is pitching a new Rom Com, not running for president of the United States.

The only answer left may be for Harris to make this fight uglier and dirtier as the clock runs out. If the joy is gone, and it is, the only thing left to do may well be to rage and rage, against the dying of the light."

Harris scheduled interviews on ""The View,"" ""The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,"" and with radio host Howard Stern on Tuesday, who have all expressed open support for Harris or Democrats in general.

""I vote we put this woman into that Black job,"" she declared.

Co-host Ana Navarro, a Republican who has supported Democratic candidates since 2016 and hosted night two of the Democratic National Convention, asked Harris bluntly at the end of the interview if she would come back on the show ""when"" she's elected president.

Montana authorities are searching for a woman who disappeared after an afternoon ride, leaving her horse and phone behind.

Meghan Rita Rouns, 27, has not been heard from since Friday, Oct. 4 around 2 p.m., when she took her horse out to a recreational area about 90 minutes from Bozeman, according to the Lewis & Clark County Sheriff's Department.

Rouns' parents reported the woman missing around 8 that night, after she failed to return home; her horse and a saddlebag containing her phone were found the next day.

After a Texas woman was tied up, robbed at gunpoint and pistol-whipped in her Dallas home in late September, multiple Venezuelan men have been arrested and charged in connection with the incident.

The robbery occurred around 10 p.m. on Saturday, Sept. 21, after the woman returned from dinner to her home in Bluffview, a neighborhood in Dallas where the average home price is more than $880,000, according to Zillow.

The men are accused of targeting the woman in her driveway, forcing her into her home and tying her up while pointing guns at her head, according to police records obtained by FOX 4 Dallas-Fort Worth. The men allegedly hit her in the head with a gun and threatened to cut off her fingers.

The suspects allegedly used Google Translate to communicate with the victim and made off with $75,000 worth of jewelry, a Gucci purse, a Ferragamo handbag, a Judith Leiber handbag, the victim's phone and coins from a wooden box, FOX 4 reported.

On Oct. 3, the Dallas Police Fugitive Unit executed an arrest warrant in Irving, Texas, with the assistance of Irving Police SWAT and Dallas Police SWAT, and arrested three other male suspects in connection with the same crime.

Those suspects are 20-year-old Yean Brayhan Torrealba-Sanabria, 34-year-old Carlos Alberto Martinez-Silva and 27-year-old Wilmer Jesus Colmenares-Gonzalez, who are also each charged with aggravated robbery.

"Remains of Michigan woman, 68, who disappeared during vacation, found in stomach of shark",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/remains-american-woman-68-found-stomach-shark-after-disappearing-diving-vacation,2024-10-08T15:47:43Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

The remains of an American woman have been discovered inside the stomach of a shark after she disappeared on vacation in Indonesia while on a diving trip, according to a friend of the woman.

Colleen Monfore, 68, was diving with friends near the Pulau Reong island off the coast of Indonesia's Southwest Maluku Regency on Sept. 26 when she did not resurface, Asia Pacific Press reported.

Two weeks after Monfore disappeared in the tropical waters, a fisherman spotted a shark in distress and killed the creature. Upon cutting open the shark's stomach, the fisherman uncovered what were believed to be Monfore's remains along with her wetsuit and bathing suit.

Initial reports indicated the shark had attacked and eaten Monfore, but a friend of the Michigan woman says that the evidence so far suggests this is likely false.

TOURIST, 30, DIES AFTER LOSING HER LEG IN SHARK ATTACK OFF CANARY ISLANDS

Kim Sass, who wrote that Monfore was her ""very good friend"" in a Facebook post, listed what is known about the case, and how it appears likely that Monfore died of a medical issue during a dive.

Sass wrote that the fisherman captured the shark around Oct. 4 near Timor-Leste, a southeast Asian country which is 70 miles away from the dive site where Monfore vanished over a week earlier.

Monfore's remains were identifiable, according to Sass, which would not have been had the shark eaten her at the time she went missing.

While it can take days for sharks to fully digest a meal, the stomach of a shark ""produces an acid that is strong enough to dissolve metal,"" while ""large bones and other indigestible objects are prevented from going past the stomach due to the small size of the opening to the intestine,"" according to the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources.

Sass believes that the nearly eight-day timeframe from when Monfore disappeared to when the shark was found suggests that the shark consumed Monfore after she was already dead.

""Colleen's body was identifiable. Her fingerprints (again identifiable) are being used by our US Embassy and the local government for proof of death,"" Sass wrote. ""This would not be possible if the shark had attacked her weeks ago.""

7-FOOT SHARK WAS EATEN BY EVEN BIGGER SHARK, RESEARCHERS SUSPECT

Sass said that dive information, photos and witness accounts from two other divers and the group's dive master show that Monfore was in 24 feet of water when the group turned around due to a change in the current. Sass added that Monfore likely had half a tank of air at that time.

""There was a down current at the turn around site, but it was manageable,"" she wrote. ""I've easily done 1000+ dive with this gracious woman; she was an excellent diver. I don't believe it was the environment and certainly not a shark that ended her life.""

Indonesian authorities are continuing to investigate."

A German court on Tuesday acquitted a man who is also under investigation in the 2007 disappearance of British toddler Madeleine McCann in a trial on charges of unrelated sexual offenses.

The Braunschweig state court acquitted the 47-year-old German national, who has been identified by local media as Christian Brueckner, of two counts of rape and two of sexual abuse.

However, Brueckner will remain in prison another year because he is still serving a seven-year sentence for rape in a different case, German news agency dpa reported.

MADELEINE MCCANN WITNESS CLAIMS SUSPECT IN HER KIDNAPPING DRUNKENLY CONFESSED TO CRIME

Brueckner had been on trial since February over offenses he is alleged to have committed in Portugal between 2000 and 2017. Defense lawyers had pointed to what they labeled a lack of evidence and witnesses who weren't credible, and suggested he might not have been charged if he hadn't also been a suspect in the McCann case.

Prosecutors had argued he should be given a 15-year prison sentence and kept in preventive detention once he has served it.

""The evidence we had was not enough to convict the defendant,"" presiding judge Uta Engemann said, according to dpa, adding that ""we were dealing with unreliable witnesses, some of whom deliberately lied to the court.""

Engemann argued that witnesses had been influenced in their statements by the media's reporting on Brueckner, who she said had been ""stylized as a sex monster and child murderer.""

Prosecutors said they would appeal the ruling.

""We believe that the decision is wrong, so we will appeal to the German supreme court so that the supreme court can check the verdict for mistakes,"" prosecutor Hans Christian Wolters said.

Brueckner's lawyer, Friedrich Fülscher, told reporters after the ruling that ""it was foreseeable, at least from the point of view of the defense, that there can only be one outcome that corresponds to the factual and legal situation and that is the acquittal.""

Brueckner has not been charged in the McCann case, in which he is under investigation on suspicion of murder. He spent many years in Portugal, including in the resort of Praia da Luz around the time of Madeleine's disappearance there in 2007. He has denied any involvement in her disappearance.

He is currently serving a seven-year prison sentence after being convicted in 2019 by the Braunschweig court for the rape of a 72-year-old American woman in Portugal in 2005.

The Braunschweig state court has jurisdiction because Brueckner had his last German residence in that city in Lower Saxony."

He pointed to polling misses from the 2016 campaign, such as when The New York Times predicted on Election Day, 2016, that Hillary Clinton had an 85% chance at winning the presidential election.

""No, I don't think people should be running their lives based on these polls,"" he said.

Moore ripped Democrats pushing Harris to the center because of these concerns, arguing that the VP's progressive policy positions on abortion, the environment, guns and jobs are actually in the mainstream.

""You mentioned Democrats who want [Harris] to 'tone it down,'"" Moore continued. ""That's something women have been told for decades.""

""The reason she's so progressive -- because she believes in a woman's right to choose, she believes a 14-year-old shouldn't take an assault rifle to school....you go down all her positions and they line up exactly with where the majority of Americans are at,"" he continued.

""The majority of Americans believe climate change is real. The majority of Americans believe the minimum wage is too low. Just go down the list,"" Moore argued.

""The majority of Americans want regulation. They want people to be making sure that, when you have a hurricane and only 1% of the people have flood insurance -- That's not the country I live in. That's not the country I'm going to live in, where people now are suffering because of this,"" he said, referring to devastation from Hurricane Helene.

Last week, Moore warned Harris to not ""move to the center"" or it could backfire for Democrats.

""If Harris is advised by her wealthy donors to shun the left and drop her more progressive positions in favor of a 'move to the center,'"" Moore warned in a post on Substack, that could ""reduce or depress the vote."""
Woman with muscular dystrophy completes 12 marathons in wheelchair for charity: 'Won't let it define me',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/woman-muscular-dystrophy-completes-marathons-wheelchair-charity-wont-let-define,2024-10-08T08:46:59Z,"Born with a rare form of muscular dystrophy, Peri Finkelstein has never let her disorder define her.

Instead, the 24-year-old New Yorker has used her challenges as a springboard to make the world a better place, completing 12 marathons to raise funds for charity.

In January 2024, Finkelstein's nonprofit organization -- the Team Peri Foundation -- exceeded the $1 million fundraising milestone for its Chai Lifeline project, which offers support to families following an illness diagnosis or trauma.

FATHER CREATED A DRUG TO SAVE HIS SON FROM A RARE DISEASE, NOW OTHER FAMILIES ARE DESPERATE TO GET IT

Muscular dystrophy is a group of more than 30 genetic conditions that affect the functioning of the muscles, according to Cleveland Clinic.

Finkelstein's form of the condition, called nemaline rod myopathy, causes severe muscle weakness and affects her speech and mobility.

Despite her physical limitations, she was inspired to start doing marathons in 2010 when her mother and brother began running them for charity.

""After watching everybody do the marathon and cheering from the sidelines, I knew that I wanted to make more of an impact,"" she said during an interview with Fox News Digital.

MOTHER FRANTIC TO SAVE CLINICAL TRIAL THAT COULD CURE HER DAUGHTER: 'THE TREATMENT IS SITTING IN A FRIDGE'

For the first few years, Finkelstein's mother pushed her in a jogging stroller with all the necessary medical equipment secured to the bottom.

Then, in 2016, Finkelstein decided it was time to stand up and walk a few steps over the finish line, with the help of her physical therapist and her parents.

""At that moment, it felt as if I could do anything that I put my mind to,"" she said.

""It was a defining moment, when I realized the only person who could get in my way was myself -- and that it was up to me to change my life.""

'LIQUID GOLD' COULD BRING NEW HOPE TO MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS PATIENTS, STUDY SUGGESTS: 'PROFOUND BENEFIT'

In subsequent marathons, those initial steps turned into walking more than 1,000 steps, then a mile, and then a mile and a half, forwards and backwards across the finish line.

After several years of pushing that ""extra mile,"" Finkelstein experienced medical challenges in 2022 that made her unable to compete.

""It never dawned on me that part of my life would be over,"" she said.

""You have to push yourself to the limit for each mile marker, as nothing will ever come easily.""

""Once I officially lost that part of myself, I realized that I couldn't allow this setback to get to me -- I knew that I had to keep moving.""

Instead of competing physically, Finkelstein now funnels her energy into her foundation's fundraising efforts.

""Since I was 8 years old, my dream was to launch a nonprofit organization of my own,"" she said.

""The same mindset that I used to prepare both physically and mentally for a marathon is what I carry into my daily life as an entrepreneur.""

STIFF PERSON SYNDROME PATIENTS SHARE WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE WITH THE RARE DISEASE

The Team Peri Foundation strives to make the world a ""more connected and inclusive place for all,"" Finkelstein said, with the mission to ""educate others on the power of inclusion and to disrupt the stereotypical views revolving around disability.""

While Finkelstein strives to stay positive and focus on her goals, she acknowledges that her day-to-day life isn't always easy.

""Not every day is all rainbows and sunshine -- some days are harder than others, to the point where severe migraines, fatigue and pain keep me from doing what I have to do,"" she said.

THE GIRL WHO CAN'T SMILE: HOW A RARE DISORDER BECAME A YOUNG WOMAN'S 'GREATEST GIFT'

Finkelstein undergoes different forms of therapy multiple times a week, has frequent doctor's appointments and is ""always in pain,"" she shared.

Her social media posts highlight the highs and lows.

""My hope is that by sharing bits and pieces of my world -- portraying all the different sides of me, whether it's rather dark or filled with light -- I can portray that people with disabilities can live a full life and step out of line in ways that can change the course of their future,"" she said.

To other people living with a disabling condition, Finkelstein advises them, ""Use your rareness to your advantage.""

""My time is precious and I still have a lot more to accomplish.""

""Growing up, I would give anything to blend in and become invisible, as being 'different' put a lot of labels on me that caused me to be bullied severely by students and teachers alike,"" she said.

""But as I've gotten older, I've realized it's OK to be rare.""

Life itself can be compared to the dozen marathons she has competed in, according to Finkelstein.

""You have to push yourself to the limit for each mile marker, as nothing will ever come easily,"" she said.

""All the pain, traumas and setbacks are what enable you to keep going and keep hustling.""

""You have to power through the pain, because there is no other option.""

Since hitting the $1 million milestone, Finkelstein and her foundation have launched new projects, including a scholarship fund in partnership with Adelphi University, where she earned her MBA in marketing.

She also works to boost awareness and education through speaking engagements, social media and podcasting, and hosts various fundraising events throughout the year.

Finkelstein plans to write and publish a memoir to share her life's journey with the world.

""While I used to be an athlete, I am still just as competitive and am somewhat of an overachiever in the real world,"" Finkelstein said.

The entrepreneur is also acutely aware that life is short.

Meghan Markle's daring plan to win over Hollywood amid royal drama: expert,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/meghan-markles-daring-plan-win-over-hollywood-royal-drama-expert,2024-10-08T08:07:08Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Meghan Markle displayed a bold new look for a surprise appearance, a move that some royal watchers claim was part of a master plan to win over Hollywood.

On Saturday, the Duchess of Sussex was a glamorous guest at the Children's Hospital Los Angeles 2024 gala. The 43-year-old walked the red carpet solo as Prince Harry was absent at the event. The Duke of Sussex was in the African Kingdom of Lesotho this week.

The mother of two recycled her plunging red Carolina Herrera gown, which she originally wore in 2021 when she and Harry attended the Salute to Freedom gala honoring veterans in New York City.

PRINCE HARRY'S NYC TRIP WITHOUT MEGHAN MARKLE CAN HELP HIM BOOST REPUTATION AFTER ROYAL DRAMA: EXPERTS

""Meghan's ultimate aim seems to be to make herself relevant and to transform herself into American royalty who is admired and powerful, independent of her husband,"" psychotherapist Dr. Robi Ludwig told Fox News Digital. ""Whether this will be successful remains to be seen, as the public has not always been receptive to many aspects of her character and personality.""

""Wearing red is a powerful, boss lady color,"" she shared. ""It says, 'I'm here, I'm not hiding, and I'm ready to assume my position of power.' Wearing red often symbolizes attraction, confidence and empowerment.

""The 'red dress effect' studies found that red enhances the male gaze and encourages men to find women wearing red more appealing. In fashion, red is also considered a power color that represents strength and determination. The hair is a throwback to her Hollywood actress days. It's all in sync with Meghan taking control of her life and doing things her way again.""

Meghan's appearance came shortly after a friend told People magazine that a ""twin-track approach is evolving for Duke and Duchess of Sussex as they take on individual projects.""

While Harry has been supporting his philanthropic passions both in New York City and in Africa, Meghan is gearing up to launch a new Netflix show and lifestyle brand, American Riviera Orchard.

""The Duke and Duchess have now hit their stride as individuals, not just as a couple,"" an insider told the outlet. ""The duke appears focused on his patronage work and the duchess focused on her entrepreneurial track.""

Several royal experts told Fox News Digital that the couple is now working individually to boost their brands. British royals expert Hilary Fordwich told Fox News Digital the duchess in particular has been unpopular with the U.K. press since she and Harry decided to step back as senior royals in 2020.

""Sadly, she has squandered both the support of the British public, which greeted her with open arms and adoration, as well as the celebrity status she originally garnered in the U.S.,"" Fordwich said.

Ludwig claimed that Meghan is looking to revamp her image, especially in Hollywood where she's looking to expand her business empire.

""Meghan Markle seems to be constantly strategizing to achieve more -- more fame, more power, more popularity, and more wealth,"" Ludwig explained. ""Her goal appears to be establishing herself as a global brand, aiming to be the most famous and influential woman in the room. However, she may have realized that being high-profile comes with its challenges. Fame can be a double-edged sword; while it can attract admiration, it can also invite criticism and disdain. The unconditional adoration she may have hoped for is not a given.""

""She may be considering ways to re-imagine her public persona,"" she said. ""Meghan might be... curious to explore what happens when she steps out on her own.""

Kinsey Schofield, host of the To Di For Daily podcast, pointed out to Fox News Digital that the mother of two has a long way to go before she wins over the public on both sides of the Atlantic.

An unnamed source recently spoke to The Hollywood Reporter about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's staff, labeling Meghan a ""dictator in high heels"" who has reduced ""grown men to tears.""

Fox News Digital reached out to a spokesperson for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. It is understood that Josh Kettler, the couple's former chief of staff who left the position after three months in August, was hired on a trial basis. The decision to part ways was described as ""mutual,"" with both sides agreeing it wasn't the right fit.

Several former and current staff members have since come forward to Us Weekly, defending the couple and their work ethic.

""I think Prince Harry and Meghan Markle seem incredibly lost when it comes to their purpose, but Harry comes off far more confident,"" Schofield claimed. ""There are a significant number of people that question Harry and Meghan's sincerity when they flipped a switch almost overnight from selling family secrets to showing up at charity events. It does not seem authentic... This strategy looks like a desperate attempt to get back into everyone's good graces. For a lot of royalists, it would be too little, too late.""

""I agree with the theories that Prince Harry is doing more solo events because the public responds better to him alone,"" Schofield claimed. ""Perhaps if Harry's team nurtures that love for Harry... it will organically and inevitably seep over to his wife. And I think the theory that this is his way of expressing that Meghan is not his boss is also a fair observation.""

Royal expert Shannon Felton Spence told Fox News Digital that we can expect to see Meghan doing more solo engagements as she attempts to win back the public and earn positive press.

-- Dr. Robi Ludwig

""She looked great, better than she has in years,"" said Felton Spence about Meghan's latest appearance.

""The hair and makeup were very USA Network Meghan, which I think is interesting,"" she noted about Meghan's ""Suits"" years.

""The Duke and Duchess of Sussex seem to be embracing a new PR strategy that focuses on their strengths, and it's a smart move.

""Prince Harry looked like his old self at the UN General Assembly, where his passion for global causes shone through -- a return to the grounded, purpose-driven image many admire. Meanwhile, Meghan's recent appearance on the red carpet in LA was a clear nod to her roots, showcasing the same style and charisma that made her a popular cable TV actress.""

""This approach allows them to capitalize on the very qualities that first made them popular -- Harry's dedication to statesmanship and philanthropy and Meghan's TV glamour and activism,"" Felton Spence explained. ""By leaning into their individual interests, they're not only redefining their public personas but also bringing renewed authenticity to their respective platforms.""

""I just think they haven't had a lot of success reinventing themselves over the past four years,"" she continued. ""And so, they are going back to the elements which initially made them likable. And so, yes, in that regard, the red color [Meghan chose] is bold and confident. Even her hair and makeup - everything about it was more USA Network Meghan than 'quiet luxury' Meghan. People like 'Suits' and Tig Meghan.""

As Meghan and Harry take on solo projects, their work together will continue behind the scenes, insiders claimed. According to People magazine, they launched The Parents Network, an initiative to support families impacted by online harm. They've also participated in local engagements, like the opening of Godmothers, a bookstore near their home in Montecito.

""An entrepreneurial and enterprise focus is going to be more the duchess's priority, and the duke will continue to champion his not-for-profit patronages,"" the friend told the outlet. ""But there will be joint efforts around those cause-driven areas of work.""

""What we are seeing is a functional and healthy relationship with two working partners, not the contrary,"" a royal insider added."
GREG GUTFELD: Trump showed the election can be decided on the merits and not under the threat of the left,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/greg-gutfeld-trump-showed-election-can-decided-merits-not-under-threat-left,2024-10-08T03:27:45Z,"Fox News host Greg Gutfeld and the panel discuss former President Trump's return to Butler, Pa., after an assassination attempt on his life on 'Gutfeld!'

So on Saturday, Donald Trump returned to Butler, Pa., where roughly three months ago, he was almost assassinated by a loser who couldn't make his high school rifle club but somehow mastered slanted roof technology. It was huge. So huge, the rest of the media had to cover it. First, Trump returns to the scene of his near death, and then opens with this.

MUSK ENERGIZES TRUMP SUPPORTERS AT BUTLER RALLY, 3 MONTHS AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPT ON FORMER PRESIDENT

Yes, Trump's got charts while Biden's got sharts. Elon Musk showed up jumping around like a human embodiment of the First Amendment. All it needed was Hulk Hogan tearing his shirt off or Kid Rock putting a shirt on. The crowd was even bigger this time around, and it's solemn. It was funny and, dare I say it, joyous. Now compare that to the existential prophecies of a future Trump presidency. A ""threat to democracy, dictatorship, chaos."" Was there anything in Butler resembling that?

Tens of thousands of people from all over standing together to hear speeches that painted America as a place worth protecting, where safety matters, where borders matter, where American jobs matter, where our leaders would actually put our country first. All things that a Harris presidency would make disappear faster than an erection on Bikini Day at The View. That sentence started out so well.

Tens of thousands of people, the people that the legacy media demonizes all day long, people who happen to be in the ultimate swing state, by the way. Who do you think, though, our media is going to blame if Trump wins this thing? Just listen to these chuckleheads continue to push violent retribution if Trump wins.

JOE SCARBOROUGH: This is an increasingly desperate person who's preparing for civil war.

MSNBC GUEST: People right now in the Republican Party are, in fact, actively rooting for and inciting a split, you know, a division in the country.

MICHAEL COHEN: What he says he intends to do. And when he turns around and says he intends to use Seal Team Six or the military within which to round up his critics or his opponents, he intends to do it.

MSNBC GUEST: He's putting in place what he needs to disrupt the process and to create enough tension and confusion that you'll have people on the streets protecting and defending him.

So, you get the sense there's going to be chaos if Trump wins. That's the sense they want you to have. It's less an election and more of an extortion. And sadly, they may be right. There will be chaos if Trump wins because it will come from them. What they're saying is if you win, there will be blood, your blood. It's the mafia saying, nice country you got here. It'd be a shame if something were to happen to it. At least the thugs from Goodfellas had style. Democrat fellas look like this. Think about it. Has Kamala Harris articulated a single original policy point?

KAMALA HARRIS CAMPAIGN FRUSTRATED BY RECENT BIDEN MEDIA APPEARANCES, SAYS CNN REPORTER

Sure, she mentioned not taxing tips, which she lifted from Trump like a Cartier watch during a smash-and-grab. She doesn't bother with policy because she doesn't have to. Because as the woman who babbles on about not going back from her own administration, it's always followed by 'or else.' Or else disaster, chaos, chaos they seem to be guaranteeing. We've seen their chaos in Chicago, New York, San Fran and Minneapolis. Well, Tim Walz, he missed that one. He was busy fighting ISIS in Iraq with exploding tampons.

Now, some of us might be a bit scared, but that's what they want. But you can't let them blackmail or threaten you into a Democrat win because, clearly, this is their last sure sign of desperation. From a side that doesn't have policy or history or even common sense on their side, only threats. But the good news, like Gerald Nadler's deodorant, it's not working. Tens of thousands of people standing shoulder to shoulder in a field that had the blood of Trump and three others in it showed him that. Trump came back like he promised.

He didn't let them set the limits. They took their best shot, literally, then he boldly returned to the scene of the crime. Like Brian Stelter, returning to steal from the CNN fridge. Trump showed up saying, 'Forget it.' The threats won't stop us. So it wasn't just about Butler, but the election itself. By gathering all those people in the same field where a weaponized nutcase tried to end Trump's run for president, Trump and thousands of others showed that this election can actually be decided on the merits and not under the threat of the left, vowing chaos if they don't get their way.

It's funny, the guy they're telling us will end elections and democracy is actually the one doing the most to preserve it. And tens of thousands joined him. They're ready to fight, fight, fight with a prez who has their backs every step of the way. So let the Dems keep telling you that Team Trump will end America as we know it. And if they're talking about the way we've known it the past four years, let's hope this is one time they're right."

The Reddit user added, ""Well, lo and behold, the right seat owner comes up and, of course, says, 'Excuse me, but you're in my seat.'""

The user said that after a few passengers laughed, the ""seat stealer"" got up and walked back 27 rows to her assigned seat.

""People are becoming bolder in taking what they want, or expecting others to back off,"" she said, adding, ""Civility requires a lot of self-control, listening and deep sighs of disbelief.""

If you ever find yourself in a similar situation, Randall recommended first double-checking your boarding pass to ensure you're in the right place -- then seek the assistance of fellow passengers or flight attendants if it escalates.

A 60-year-old man was arrested in Hawaii on Sunday after allegedly stabbing and killing a Wendy's employee, while seriously injuring another, according to reports.

The Honolulu Police Department's arrest logs show that Reynaldo Cheney was charged with murder and criminal contempt of court.

Hawaii News Now reported that the Honolulu Police Department said the incident happened just before 10 a.m. on Sunday at a Wendy's on Farrington Highway in Nanakuli.

Police confirmed with the station that the suspect, later identified as Cheney, was a customer and the other two people involved were employees of the fast-food restaurant.

The back and forth between the employee and the patron escalated after the suspect allegedly called the employee a derogatory name, police said.

As the two argued, a 44-year-old employee reportedly intervened and escorted the man out of the restaurant, where the argument continued.

Former Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney officially endorsed Vice President Harris for the Oval Office, breaking from the GOP to hit the campaign trail with the Democrat ticket in the key battleground state of Wisconsin last week.

Fox News Digital traveled to Casper, Wyoming, over the weekend to speak to voters about their thoughts on the upcoming election and Cheney snubbing the Republican presidential ticket in favor of endorsing Harris this cycle. Voters in the Cowboy State overwhelmingly admonished Cheney for the endorsement, with some slamming her as a ""traitor"" and ""turncoat.""

""I'm not impressed with that at all,"" Clark Johnson told Fox News Digital when asked about his thoughts on Cheney campaigning with Harris last week in Wisconsin.

""I think it's ridiculous. I think she's a traitor to the country,"" another Wyomingite, Gunner Berg, said of the campaign event.

KAMALA HARRIS TEAMS UP WITH LIZ CHENEY IN BIRTHPLACE OF REPUBLICAN PARTY

Cheney, who is the daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, is a vocal critic of former President Trump, putting her at odds with the Republican Party and her former constituents, who overwhelmingly supported Trump in his 2016 and 2020 elections. Wyoming is again expected to vote red this election.

The vast majority of voters who spoke to Fox Digital from Casper said they are no fan of Cheney's and that she would unlikely hold another elected office in Wyoming due to her politics.

""I'm definitely not a fan, and it definitely kind of turned some tables there,"" Dillon Sigman said, adding that he does not believe Cheney could again successfully run for office in Wyoming.

""I think Liz Cheney, who originally was a Wyoming person that moved to Connecticut and then returned to Wyoming wearing cowboy blue jeans and a cowboy rodeo belt buckle and seated herself, completely flipped and became a turncoat. Liz has gone totally Democratic and appears to be down the road of the DEI inclusion and all the other dysfunctional things that are going on in her government,"" said a Wyoming resident who identified himself as ""Ralph.""

""I support her decision to campaign for whoever she chooses. However, I do not think that she is a voice for the Wyoming people. The majority of people I know do not back Kamala Harris or that campaign,"" Alicia Kellch told Fox Digital.

NIKKI HALEY DEFENDS TRUMP SUPPORT AFTER BEING CALLED OUT BY LIZ CHENEY: 'THIS IS ABOUT AMERICA'

Kellch said it is unlikely Cheney would be re-elected in Wyoming if she were to pursue such an avenue, adding that she believes many people who initially voted for Cheney feel ""sold out once they got her in office and realized what her true intentions were.""

Chuck Kucera added in an interview that Cheney is a ""backstabber,"" quipping that a Harris campaign event is ""probably a good place for her.""

John Shelton said Cheney could ""never"" run for office again in Wyoming and that he wouldn't vote for her even ""if she's the last one to be voted for.""

One Wyoming resident told Fox Digital that Cheney teaming up with Harris didn't ""bother"" him and didn't view it as an issue, while noting that ""most folks in Wyoming don't agree with"" Cheney endorsing Harris.

Two Wyoming residents told Fox News Digital they support Cheney teaming with Harris, with Jennifer Dillinger saying it was ""absolutely amazing.""

""It's amazing how somebody who is extremely conservative, has been Republican her entire life but will support the Constitution and the country and not be specific for the party,"" Dillinger said, adding that it's unlikely Cheney would make a successful return to Wyoming politics as the state is ""too conservative.""

TRUMP CALLS LIZ CHENEY A 'LOW IQ WAR HAWK' AFTER APPEARANCE IN SUPPORT OF HARRIS

Another woman, Randi Chepke, said she's ""thrilled that Liz Cheney is supporting Kamala Harris,"" arguing that Cheney is ""putting our country above her party.""

Chepke added that Cheney's endorsement of Harris will ""absolutely"" encourage some Republican voters to cast ballots for Harris next month.

""I think that she is a die-hard conservative and that she is stating her case about why she thinks it's important to put democracy first. And, you know, frankly, democracy is much more important than the cost of a loaf of bread or a gallon of gas at this point in our lives,"" Chepke said.

Cheney joined Harris in Ripon, Wisconsin, which bills itself as the birthplace of the GOP, on Thursday, and formally endorsed Harris for president.

""I have never voted for a Democrat, but this year I am proudly casting my vote for Vice President Kamala Harris,"" Cheney told the audience. ""As a conservative, as a patriot, as a mother, as someone who reveres our Constitution, I am honored to join her in this urgent cause.""

LIZ CHENEY CALLS SPEAKER JOHNSON 'DANGEROUS' FOR HELPING TRUMP 'UNDERMINE OUR REPUBLIC'

Harris praised Cheney as a leader who ""puts country above party and above self, a true patriot.""

Cheney was the third-most powerful Republican in Congress from 2019 to 2021 but saw her rising star fade in the party as she launched repeated attacks against Trump after the Jan. 6, 2021, riot at the Capitol.

""What is important is to recognize we just had a violent mob assault the U.S. Capitol in an attempt to prevent us from carrying out our constitutional duty,"" Cheney said on Jan. 6 after Trump supporters stormed into the Capitol.

""There is no question that the president formed the mob. The president incited the mob, the president addressed the mob. This is what America is not.""

Cheney went on to vote to impeach Trump on a charge of inciting an insurrection, sat on the House Select Committee on the January 6 Attack to investigate the protest and has continued leveling attacks on Trump this year.

""I ask you to stand in truth. To reject the depraved cruelty of Donald Trump,"" Cheney told the Harris supporters in Wisconsin last week.

Trump has meanwhile slammed Cheney as ""a low IQ War Hawk"" who suffers ""gravely from Trump Derangement Syndrome.""

Georgia high court restores state's 6-week 'heartbeat' abortion law,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/georgia-high-court-restores-states-six-week-heartbeat-abortion-law,2024-10-07T22:07:07Z,"Abortion Survivors founder Melissa Ohden breaks down how Governor Tim Walz has changed Minnesota's abortion laws during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

The Georgia Supreme Court on Monday stopped a lower court's ruling from last week that allowed abortions up to 22 weeks, as opposed to six weeks, as it considers an appeal filed by the state.

The order from the state Supreme Court came a week after Fulton County Superior Court Judge Robert McBurney ruled that abortions must be regulated the way they were before the ""Heartbeat Law"" went into effect, meaning abortions could be allowed until the 22-week mark.

The Associated Press reported that Justice John J. Ellington argued against McBurney's ruling, saying the case ""should not be predetermined in the State's favor before the appeal is even docketed.""

""The State should not be in the business of enforcing laws that have been determined to violate fundamental rights guaranteed to millions of individuals under the Georgia Constitution,"" Ellington wrote. ""The 'status quo' that should be maintained is the state of the law before the challenged laws took effect.""

GEORGIA JUDGE OVERTURNS STATE'S 6-WEEK 'HEARTBEAT' ABORTION LAW, CALLS IT 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL'

Gov. Brian Kemp, a Republican, signed the ""Heartbeat"" abortion bill, also known as the Living Infants Fairness and Equality Act, into law in 2019. The law made abortions after the six-week mark illegal.

McBurney called the law ""unconstitutional.""

""The authors of our Constitutions, state and federal, entrusted to future generations a charter protecting the right of all persons to enjoy liberty as we learn its meaning,"" McBurney wrote in his final order last week. ""A review of our higher courts' interpretations of 'liberty' demonstrates that liberty in Georgia includes in its meaning, in its protections, and in its bundle of rights the power of a woman to control her own body, to decide what happens to it and in it, and to reject state interference with her healthcare choices.

GEORGIA GOV BRIAN KEMP SIGNS CONTROVERSIAL 'HEARTBEAT' BILL INTO LAW

""That power is not, however, unlimited,"" the judge added. ""When a fetus growing inside a woman reaches viability, when society can assume care and responsibility for that separate life, then - and only then - may society intervene.""

McBurney continued by saying a law that prevents abortions after six weeks was inconsistent with those rights as well as the proper balance that a viability rule establishes between a woman's rights and society's interests in protecting and caring for unborn infants.

There were exceptions written into the law Kemp signed in 2019, including rape and incest as long as a police report was filed.

GEORGIA ABORTION LAW: A LOOK BACK AT WHAT HOLLYWOOD PRODUCTION COMPANIES HAVE SAID ABOUT FILMING IN THE STATE

The law signed by Kemp was blocked by a federal judge in October 2019 - before it went into effect - and ruled it violated the right to abortion as established by Roe v. Wade in 1973.

The Supreme Court then overturned Roe v. Wade in June 2022, clearing the way for Georgia's law on abortion to go into effect.

McBurney, in November 2022, ruled the law was ""unequivocally unconstitutional"" because it was enacted in 2019 when Roe v. Wade allowed abortions after six weeks.

But in October 2023, the Georgia Supreme Court rejected the ruling in a 6-1 decision, saying McBurney was wrong.

McBurney's ruling last week determined that the state, county, municipal and other local authorities are ""enjoined"" from seeking to enforce the six-week abortion law."

A man, who New York City police arrested on Monday for an alleged assault on former New York Gov. David Paterson and his stepson, is claiming self-defense.

Officers escorted Travor Nurse, 40, out of the 23rd Precinct in handcuffs on Monday. Asked by a reporter why he allegedly assaulted Paterson and his stepson, Nurse replied, ""He attacked me,"" without specifying who he was referring to.

When asked what had happened, Nurse said, ""Look at my eye,"" showing reporters his injuries before officers put him in the back of a police cruiser.

""His son punched me in my eye and I defended myself,"" Nurse said, before officers slammed the door.

Paterson, 70, and his stepson, Anthony Sliwa, 20, were attacked around 8:30 p.m. Friday while they were walking in Manhattan's Upper East Side. They were treated for minor injuries, police said.

Nurse is charged with gang assault and assault, a police spokesperson said, while another woman, age 34, has also been charged with gang assault.

It was not clear whether they had attorneys who could speak for them.

""Governor Paterson and his family are happy that these two adults were caught.

Paterson said he suffered bruises and some pain to his head. Sliwa, also battered and bruised, received a cut lip that required five stitches, Paterson said.

An Uber driver sexually assaulted a Pennsylvania college student last month after dropping her off on campus, before demanding she pay for a mess made in his backseat, authorities said.

Mirvan Dinler, 26, was arrested last week and faces several criminal charges, including rape, related to the alleged Sept. 13 incident.

The unnamed victim, a 21-year-old Villanova University student, had requested an Uber after heading to a birthday party in Philadelphia with friends, according to a criminal complaint. She began to feel sick on the way to the venue and decided to go home, prosecutors said.

After the assault, Dinler left but came back a short time later to demand the woman give him money for a mess in his car. She handed him her cell phone, and he transferred $150 to a Venmo account under another name, court documents state.

Down Syndrome Awareness Month: 5 key questions answered,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/down-syndrome-awareness-month-key-questions-answered,2024-10-07T20:13:52Z,"CEO of 21 Pineapples Nate Simon and co-founder of Candidly Kind Grace Key join 'Fox & Friends Weekend' to shine a light on businesses that have been founded by individuals with Down syndrome.

As October marks World Down Syndrome Awareness Month, it's an opportune time to learn and support those with the condition.

About 5,700 babies are born in the U.S. with Down syndrome each year, and more than 400,000 people in the country currently live with it, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

The life expectancy of those with the condition has increased dramatically over the years. In 1983, it was just 25 years old, but it is now 60, per the Global Down Syndrome Foundation.

LIFELONG BEST FRIENDS WITH DOWN SYNDROME TO ATTEND COLLEGE TOGETHER

Below is everything you need to know about Down syndrome and how you can help spread awareness about it.

Down syndrome is a condition in which a baby is born with an extra chromosome.

Chromosomes determine how the body forms and functions. Those born with an extra chromosome experience changes in the way the body and brain develop.

MY LITTLE GIRL HAS DOWN SYNDROME, AND SHE'S PERFECT

A baby is typically born with 46 chromosomes. A baby with Down syndrome has a full or partial copy of chromosome 21.

The most common type of Down syndrome is trisomy 21, which accounts for 95% of all cases.

Less common types of Down syndrome are translocation (caused by rearranged chromosome material) and mosaicism (when there is a mixture of two types of cells).

There are no known ways to prevent the condition during pregnancy and no known root causes, experts say.

NANNY AND 5-YEAR-OLD WITH DOWN SYNDROME SAY DAILY AFFIRMATIONS TOGETHER-'SO EMOTIONAL'

One risk factor associated with Down syndrome is the age of the mother -- for a 25-year-old pregnant woman, the odds are about 1 in 1,250. At age 40, they are 1 in 100, statistics show.

There are both physical and developmental symptoms of Down syndrome.

Physical symptoms include a flattened face; shorter height; short neck; small ears, hands and feet; and decreased muscle tone, according to the CDC.

Developmental symptoms include a short attention span, impulsive behavior, slow learning and delayed speech development.

While these are all common symptoms, not every child with Down syndrome will display each one of these traits.

National Down Syndrome Awareness Month is ""a month to raise awareness and celebrate the many abilities of our loved ones with Down syndrome,"" according to the National Down Syndrome Society, which created the occasion in the 1980s.

""Down syndrome is one of the most common types of intellectual disabilities,"" states the Special Olympics website.

""Down syndrome is one of the most common types of intellectual disabilities.""

""So, it's no surprise that each year in October, we recognize Down Syndrome Awareness Month to raise public awareness about the condition and advocate for acceptance and inclusion of people with Down syndrome.""

""People with Down syndrome still face stereotypes and myths, but they've shown time and again that the condition is just one part of who they are and doesn't define them or limit their abilities,"" the statement continued.

""That's why it's so important that during Down Syndrome Awareness Month and all year long, we help spread the message of love, acceptance, inclusion and respect.""

The Down syndrome awareness ribbon is blue and yellow. People can choose to wear a blue and yellow ribbon throughout the month to spread awareness.

Some also choose days to wear blue and yellow clothing to spread the word and support those with Down syndrome throughout the month.

World Down Syndrome Day is celebrated on March 21 each year - which stands for the tripling of the 21st chromosome (3.21) in people with the condition.

Educating yourself and others about Down syndrome is one way to honor the occasion throughout the month. You can educate yourself by reading books and articles and watching documentaries.

You can take your knowledge and spread awareness to others by sharing information on social media.

Through the month of October, there are plenty of events, fundraisers and walks around the country dedicated to Down syndrome awareness.

You can also choose to set up a fundraiser of your own or support a local business founded by or inspired by individuals with Down syndrome.

"October 7 hasn't ended. One year later, 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/october-7-hasnt-ended-one-year-later-101-hostages-still-being-held-gaza,2024-10-07T18:18:28Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

While visiting her boyfriend's family for the religious holiday of Simchat Torah, a young Israeli woman, Sapir Cohen, was taken hostage on October 7, 2023. She spent 55 days in captivity in Gaza before she was released in a deal with the Hamas terrorists who took her and hundreds of other Israelis captive. Cohen's boyfriend, Sasha Troufanov, has been held captive with one hundred others for exactly one year, today.

Cohen visited my children's overnight sleepaway program this summer, telling campers about the plight of those still left behind in Gaza while sharing her own experience.

She shared, ""Down there [in the tunnels] there is no light. Sometimes a terrorist would use a flashlight, but even then, I couldn't see anything. There is also no air."" She went on to explain the lack of oxygen, the prevalence of humidity and mold, and the lack of food. She experienced this for less than two months; Sasha and 100 others have for twelve months.

She goes anywhere she can to share her story in order to raise awareness about the hostages who have spent a year of their lives wasting away in the tunnels of Gaza, because she knows the world has lost interest. There are no yellow ribbons lining the trees of America's small towns in honor of the four Americans still being held hostage; nor were there large memorials for Hersh Goldberg-Polin, a young American boy who was taken hostage and executed in the tunnels in Gaza one month ago.

ONE YEAR AFTER 10/7, IRAN IS LOSING THE WAR. NOW, ISRAEL MUST SECURE PEACE

Even Troufanov's own employer has forsaken him. Despite working as an engineer on a pivotal project for Amazon, the Seattle-based company has been silent about his plight.

Amazon isn't alone in their disinterest in their imprisoned Jewish employees. One year ago, PepsiCo's subsidiary, SodaStream, had one of its employees, Guy Gilboa-Dalal taken captive as well, and Pepsi have maintained their silence. Pepsi has had no issues speaking up and ponying up on other social issues, yet, when it comes to their own staffer kidnapped from a music festival, they can't be bothered to advocate for his immediate and unconditional release.

On the anniversary of October 7th, hostage Emily Damari's mother Mandy spoke out about her daughter, violently taken from a Kibbutz on the Gaza border, Kfar Aza.

ONE YEAR AFTER 10/7 ATTACKS AND DEMOCRAT-RUN STATES HAVE LET THE PROBLEM FESTER

In her British accent, Mandy pleaded, ""I would like to feel that the British public were behind her, and the British government were behind her, and they were saying there is a British hostage held captive in the terror tunnels by Hamas in Gaza. I want them to know she's there, and to advocate for her release, unconditionally and immediately. She's a young woman, and who knows what's happening to her. If there's a way to put her on social media, and see her out there. Remind people that she's there, [and] make sure she's not forgotten.""

The worst fears of their families and loved ones have been realized; Sasha, Guy and Emily have been forgotten. Put simply and bluntly: Hostages and their families feel alone and forsaken because they have been. Their employers have abandoned them, and their governments have, too. The world community and organizations, tasked with advocating for the most vulnerable among us, have clearly indicated that Jews don't count in their hierarchy of victims.

Not only are the victims of October 7th forgotten, they have been transformed into oppressors by evil individuals and organizations who have decided that Jewish lives simply do not matter.

Amnesty International UK, in the days leading up to the anniversary, justified the massacre and reminded their followers ""Don't let anyone tell you that this all started on the 7th of October 2023.""

In response to Amnesty, pro-Israel influencer Hen Mazzig asked, ""So when did it start? In 2002, during the Second Intifada, when I was almost killed in a terror attack? Or in 1951, when my family was expelled from Tunisia for being Jewish? Or in 1941, during the Farhud, when my family members were killed and expelled from Iraq? Or the Hebron massacre in 1929? When did it start? When did the world become so apathetic as to deny Jews the right to mourn our dead and post videos like this on the day we commemorate the worst massacre of Jews since the Holocaust? And October 7th hasn't ended for us, because 101 hostages are still being held in Gaza for 365 days.""

A year on, millions of Jews, both American and Israelis alike, are all still trapped in October 7th, but the year is still 2023, not 2024. Life has moved on as we have scrambled to try to beg for sympathy, relevancy and attention while the world marks holidays like Christmas and Hanukkah, Easter and Passover, all the while we struggle to remind the world that we are still trapped in October. And here we are, back in October.

In her famous book, ""Anne of Green Gables,"" L. M. Montgomery wrote, ""I'm so glad I live in a world where there are Octobers.""

For Jews, our world has been nothing but Octobers for the last twelve months. Finding ourselves back in October is a painful reminder that our hearts, all 101 of them, still lay captive in Gaza. It won't stop being October 7th until they're all home."

Authorities have identified a body found stuffed inside a suitcase in Seattle this week as a woman who first went missing in 2023.

The woman, 37-year-old Shannon Marie Caslin Reeder, was reported missing in 2023, and her last confirmed sighting was in November of that year. Police say they are still trying to piece together what happened to Reeder.

The Washington State Patrol say Reeder's body was found in late September when state officials were clearing out a homeless encampment and smelled a strong odor coming from the suitcase.

Supreme Court denies Biden administration appeal over federal emergency abortion requirement in Texas,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/supreme-court-denies-biden-administration-appeal-over-federal-emergency-abortion-requirement-texas,2024-10-07T15:06:02Z,"Abortion Survivors founder Melissa Ohden breaks down how Governor Tim Walz has changed Minnesota's abortion laws during an appearance on 'Fox & Friends Weekend.'

The U.S. Supreme Court decided not to hear oral arguments about whether a Texas state abortion ban is at odds with a federal emergency care law - permitting the ban in the Lone Star state to be upheld.

Supreme Court justices, for now, are keeping in place a lower court ruling that hospitals in Texas can deny terminating certain emergency pregnancies that violate state law, despite the federal requirement.

The Biden administration had requested that the justices overturn the lower court's ruling, contending that federal law requires hospitals to provide abortions in emergency situations. They referenced last term, when the Supreme Court permitted emergency room abortions to continue in Idaho while a lawsuit continues in federal court. Texas is asserting that its laws are distinct from Idaho's because Texas has a health exception for pregnant patients.

TEXAS SUPREME COURT REJECTS CHALLENGE TO STATE ABORTION BAN'S MEDICAL EXCEPTIONS

In Texas, the central legal issue is whether the Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act (EMTALA), which mandates hospitals to treat emergency conditions, overrides state laws that prohibit abortion in emergencies. The case focuses on whether a state can stop an emergency physician from performing an abortion if it's necessary to stabilize a pregnant woman's health.

Previously, the Texas Supreme Court ruled in June against a group of women who suffered serious pregnancy complications and became the first in the country to testify in court about being denied abortion access since Roe v. Wade was overturned in 2022.

CLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP

In a unanimous ruling, the court upheld the Texas law after the women filed a lawsuit in March 2023 seeking clarity on when exceptions to the abortion ban are permitted, arguing the law was confusing for doctors who might turn away patients over fears of repercussions.

The court ultimately ruled that the law's exceptions are broad enough and that doctors would be misinterpreting the law if they decided not to perform an abortion when the mother's life is in danger.

With the SCOTUS decision looming just a month before Election Day, abortion has become a major focus for the Harris-Walz campaign.

A 19-year-old rodeo star, who won Miss Teen Rodeo Kansas in 2024, died in a single-vehicle car accident that left four of her teammates and a fifth person injured on Friday night in rural Kansas, according to officials.

Emma Brungardt, of Blue Rapids, was a passenger in a 2007 Ford F250 pickup truck traveling southbound on County Road 21 in Thomas County when the pickup ""left the roadway"" at the Y intersection and struck a tree row, Kansas Highway Patrol said in an online crash report.

Troopers said Brungardt was wearing her seatbelt at the time of the crash. The driver and four other passengers survived the crash, reporting possible injuries.

Colby Community College, where Brungardt was a sophomore, confirmed her death to Fox News Digital on Monday morning.

Brungardt majored in equine management and production. The rodeo events she competed in included goat tying, breakaway and team roping.

Harris echoes debunked claim about Georgia abortion limits causing woman's death despite pushback from doctors,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/harris-echoes-debunked-claim-about-georgia-abortion-limits-causing-womans-death-despite-pushback-from-doctors,2024-10-07T10:33:58Z,"Two Georgia doctors, one a congressman and the other a state legislator, weigh in on the tragic case of Amber Nicole Thurman and media claims that state laws regulating abortion led to her death.

Vice President Kamala Harris repeated the left's claim Sunday that a woman in Georgia died due to delayed care as a result of the state's abortion limits, despite doctors previously denouncing the narrative as false.

During an interview on the raunchy and often-sexually explicit ""Call Her Daddy"" podcast, host Alex Cooper asked Harris about the impact of the overturning of Roe v. Wade, blaming the death of Amber Nicole Thurman on the Supreme Court ruling and the state's abortion limits after she received a chemically induced abortion in 2022.

""So, Amber was a young mother of a six-year-old son. She was a medical assistant who was so excited because she was just getting on her feet to be independent. She got her own apartment in a gated community with a pool that her son could play in. She got accepted to nursing school,"" Harris told listeners.

WALZ REPEATS GEORGIA ABORTION DEATH FALSEHOOD DECRIED BY DOCTORS AS 'FEARMONGERING'

""She was, as described by her family, so excited and so ambitious, and she had plans. Then she found out she was pregnant, and she didn't want to go through with her pregnancy. And she was living in Georgia, and she couldn't receive care there because she was past six weeks. And so she ended up going to another state, and...she couldn't get there on time. And because the other state had been so overwhelmed by all these women coming from all these southern states who couldn't get treatment in their own state, her window for her appointment had closed and instead of having a surgical procedure, she had medication and basically went back home and then had some complications and went to the hospital because she was bleeding.""

""And they delayed 20 hours before they treated her,"" Harris continued, suggesting that Georgia's laws prevented her from receiving lifesaving care.

Her remark comes after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Harris and other members of the Democratic Party, including her running mate Tim Walz, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access after the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Here's the thing that's so messed up about this,"" Harris told Cooper. ""Some of these people will say whoa, but I do believe in exceptions, I believe that there should be an exception in terms of the life of the mother. You know what that means in practical terms? She's almost dead before you decide to give her care. What, so we're going to have public health policy that says a doctor, a medical professional, waits until you're at death's door before they gives you care. That's outrageous...where is the humanity?""

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

OB-GYNs have criticized the Amber Thurman narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop called out the ""fearmongering"" and ""lies"" of the media that are hurting women who don't understand new abortion laws.

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

U.S. Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, alleging it was caused by complications from abortion pills because doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

Dr. Christina Francis, CEO of the American Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists (AAPLOG), made similar comments on ""Fox & Friends"" last month.

""We are seeing the direct results of spreading lies and misinformation about these laws. Women are being harmed by that because they are delaying in seeking care. And so I think it's really important, no matter where somebody stands on the issue of abortion, we should all want women to have accurate information so that they seek care immediately if they're experiencing complications from things like these high-risk abortion drugs,"" Francis said.

ProPublica previously defended their story in a statement to Fox News Digital, saying, ""We stand by our reporting. The state's committee of more than 30 experts concluded that the deaths of Amber Thurman and Candi Miller were preventable, a newsworthy finding. Our ongoing reporting is illuminating the challenges doctors face in caring for patients with pregnancy complications in states with restricted access to abortion.""

The Harris campaign did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment."
'Seismic implications' for fired teacher who won lawsuit after refusing to use students' pronouns: Attorney,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/seismic-implications-fired-teacher-who-won-lawsuit-refusing-use-students-pronouns-attorney,2024-10-07T09:47:51Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

An attorney, who recently won a case involving a Virginia school board firing a teacher refusing to use a student's preferred pronouns, told Fox News Digital that the settlement has ""seismic implications.""

""We're grateful that, because of this decision, tolerance is now a two‐way street, not a one‐way ratchet for totalitarian ideology,"" Alliance Defending Freedom (ADF) President and CEO Kristen Waggoner told Fox News Digital on Friday.

The Virginia-based West Point School Board agreed to pay a former high school teacher, Peter Vlaming, $575,000 in damages and attorney's fees after he refused to call a transgender student by their preferred pronouns.

""It protects all teachers in Virginia and its rationale should guide other courts addressing similar issues,"" Waggoner said.

She also said that the ADF represents many other teachers facing similar situations in other states and how ""no teacher should be fired for living according to their beliefs or protecting their students.""

The settlement stems from a lawsuit filed by ADF against the school board in September 2019. Vlaming, who taught French at West Point High School for 7 years, lost his job after the board made the unanimous 5-0 decision to fire him. A devout Christian, Vlaming said he could not comply with the school district's policy to refer to students with pronouns inconsistent with their biological sex.

According to the ADF, ""Vlaming tried to accommodate the student by consistently using the student's new preferred name and by avoiding the use of pronouns altogether.""

However, school officials were obstinate that Vlaming used the student's preferred pronouns and also to use them ""even when the student wasn't present,"" ADF claimed.

Several months before Vlaming's court victory, the Virginia Supreme Court reinstated the case after it was stuck down in a lower court. According to the Virginia Mercury, the King William Circuit Court ""did not believe Vlaming had any valid reasons for the law to accept his suit.""

""However, the Supreme Court determined in December that the school board violated Vlaming's rights,"" the outlet reported.

The board did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

""Peter's Christian faith prevented him from lying to his students about biological reality by using pronouns inconsistent with a student's sex,"" ADF attorney Waggoner told Fox News Digital. ""Since his victory in court, we have seen overwhelming gratitude and support on social media from people who, like Peter, teach or work in places that might punish them for living according to their beliefs.""

In addition to the cash settlement, Vlaming scored another win after the case.

The settlement agreement authorized that Vlaming's record be cleared, and that the West Point School Board's policies to ""respect free speech.""

The French teacher is allowed to go back to teaching and his former colleagues at West Point School can also do their jobs ""without fear of retribution for living consistent with their faith and biological reality,"" the attorney added.

""I am so relieved that our fundamental rights of freedom of expression and freedom of religion were upheld,"" Vlaming told Fox News Digital. ""However, it still bewilders me that a legal battle was necessary to reiterate that thought police and compelled speech are antithetical to the foundations of Virginian and American society; not to mention western civilization. How did we arrive at such a point today in America?"""
"North Carolina woman eats nothing but sardines, loses 35 pounds: 'This is not a diet'",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/food-drink/north-carolina-woman-eats-nothing-sardines-loses-35-pounds-this-not-diet,2024-10-07T09:24:31Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

A North Carolina woman has spent the last three months eating nothing but sardines - and she said it has changed her life and improved her health.

""This is not a diet. To me, a diet insinuates a beginning and an end. This is my lifestyle and I have no intention of introducing plants back into it,"" Jane Crummett of Mint Hill, North Carolina, told Fox News Digital.

Crummett normally eats no carbohydrates whatsoever, calling it a ""zero carb/carnivore"" way of eating. She also eschews dairy, saying she ""finds it inflammatory.""

BEST AND WORST FOODS FOR PEOPLE WITH DIABETES TO MAINTAIN GOOD HEALTH

But for the last three months, she ate nothing but sardines and MCT oil, a supplement that helps the body get energy.

Each day, Crummett said she consumed four cans of sardines, plus MCT oil.

Crummett said she ended her experiment on Sept. 30 after 135 days.

Since switching to only sardines, she has lost 35 pounds in three months, she said.

Plus, she said, she feels she's experienced a host of other health benefits.

""My pain has resolved,"" she said, noting that she previously dealt with plantar fasciitis, a foot condition. Her inflammation, too, has decreased, she told Fox News Digital.

Despite her extreme dietary regimen, Crummett insists she's in good health and sees a doctor regularly.

""I have tested all kinds of things,"" she said. ""I'm a firm believer that if you don't figure things out for yourself, you'll never know.""

Crummett said she planned on gradually re-introducing various meats back into her diet - with the assistance and guidance of a doctor.

""My plan is to eat sardines with two tablespoons of MCT oil for breakfast and then will introduce about three ounces of beef with [a few] tablespoons of beef drippings for lunch, then sardines for dinner,"" she said.

""I will have to take things day by day and just see how my blood sugar reacts to the new food,"" she said, noting that she's noticed her blood glucose levels have increased if she eats too much protein at once.

""My ultimate goal is to have sardines for breakfast every day with MCT oil and incorporate normal beef, pork and/or chicken back into my diet,"" she said.

A dietitian, however, raised concerns about the ""carnivore"" lifestyle.

Omega-3 fatty acids ""should be part of a balanced diet.""

""In the short term, I would imagine that any type of change she's making is going to show immediate results. And it sounds to me like she had some issues with her gut and that she's removed some of the foods that [may have been] causing inflammation,"" Kim Shapira, M.S., R.D., told Fox News Digital in a Zoom interview.

Shapira, based in Los Angeles, is founder of the Kim Shapira Method and author of the book ""This is What You're Really Hungry For."" (Shapira was not involved in Crummett's dietary choices.)

A zero-carb diet, Shapira said simply, is ""not a sustainable way to live.""

Crummett's choice of sardines is an ""amazing form of omega-3s - a really good fatty acid,"" she said.

""The Mediterranean diet - the type of diet that includes a balance of everything - is really what we need long term,"" she said.

""When you go on a low-carb diet, you're actually dehydrating your system. So when you say 'quick weight loss,' it is quick weight loss only in the fact that it's water loss. It's not actually fat loss,"" she said.

""If you would like to lose weight, you actually need a combination of so many things,"" Shapira continued -- ""including lifestyle changes, better eating habits, exercise, sleep, and water intake.""

Sammy Hagar was just given the key to the Las Vegas Strip, but the former Van Halen frontman also has the key to a successful marriage.

Hagar and Kari Karte will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary next year, and the rocker says that amazing chemistry is the secret to their lasting romance.

During an interview with Fox News Digital, the Cabo Wabo Cantina founder said his biggest tip for couples trying to maintain their marriage is to ""have fun in the bedroom.""

""We still have fun in the bedroom, I tell you that. You know what I mean? I think I always say that, you know, when you guys are sleeping in separate beds and stuff, well, that's usually the end of it,"" Hagar said.

""It's not just that, you got to give and take and all that, but, that's such an undervalued or underestimated thing in a relationship is being physically attracted to each other and enjoying each other physically,"" the former Van Halen frontman continued.

Hagar and Karte tied the knot in 1995 and share two daughters: Kama and Samantha. The singer also has sons, Aaron and Andrew, from his first marriage to Betsy Berardi.

Hagar recently celebrated a big milestone. He was given a key to the Las Vegas Strip. The rock and roll star has some wild memories of his time in Sin City, and he compares the party town to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.

""You know that saying of what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. Well, I use that in Cabo as what happens in Cabo never happened. Like, you don't even have to admit it,"" he said. ""Between those two things and being in a rock and roll band like Van Halen and being in rock for my whole life, it's been a lot of crazy stuff.""

""I want to stay married, and again, I don't want to embarrass my kids. They're old enough now. They say, 'Dad did what?' It's just a lot of things happen in that town. I guarantee you, anything you can imagine happens daily, multiple times in that town. Anything you can imagine,"" he concluded.

A drug used to prevent organ rejection in kidney transplant patients is being touted for potentially slowing down aging.

The immune-suppressing medication rapamycin, also known as sirolimus, is being used off-label as a means of extending longevity.

""By targeting a key pathway (mTOR) in cells, this drug has been shown to extend lifespan in animals and could be beneficial to prevent age-related diseases in humans,"" Dr. Andrea B. Maier -- a professor in healthy aging and dementia research at the Director of the Centre for Healthy Longevity at the National University of Singapore -- told Fox News Digital.

AGING SPEEDS UP 'MASSIVELY' AT TWO POINTS IN ONE'S LIFETIME, STANFORD STUDY FINDS: 'ABRUPT CHANGES'

Maier was co-author of a recent review study that explored how rapamycin affected healthy humans.

The review, which was published in the journal Lancet Healthy Longevity, found that the medication improved the effects of aging on the skin.

""Rapamycin and its derivatives improve the immune and cardiovascular function of healthy individuals or individuals with aging-related diseases,"" Maier said in an email.

11 TIPS FOR ADULTS AGE 65 AND OVER TO 'LIVE WELL' OVER TIME, ACCORDING TO GERONTOLOGISTS

Daniel Tawfik, a molecular biologist and co-founder of Healthspan, a digital medical clinic that focuses on anti-aging and longevity-promoting therapies, said his team uses rapamycin to help slow down the rate of aging.

""We view this through the lens of reducing the accumulation of damaged senescent cells,"" Tawfik, who is based in Santa Monica, California, told Fox News Digital.

Senescent cells are cells that no longer function properly, but linger in the body and can contribute to tissue deterioration and inflammation, the expert said.

""By lowering the rate at which healthy cells transform into senescent cells, rapamycin can slow the aging process at the tissue level, helping to preserve organ function and overall health as we age,"" he added.

In the U.S., rapamycin is approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for its immune-suppressing properties in patients with kidney transplants and certain cancers.

It is not approved for use as an age-defying drug.

""Sirolimus (rapamycin) has not been evaluated by the FDA for safety and effectiveness as an anti-aging treatment,"" a press officer for the FDA confirmed to Fox News Digital.

""Rapamycin can slow the aging process at the tissue level, helping to preserve organ function and overall health.""

Despite this, rapamycin is being used ""off-label"" for anti-aging purposes, according to Elaena Quattrocchi, a registered pharmacist and an associate professor at Long Island University College of Pharmacy in Brooklyn, New York.

""Off-label means the FDA has not approved the drug for this use,"" she told Fox News Digital.

When prescribing a drug for off-label use, the provider must explain to the patient that the medication has not been approved for the indication for which they are prescribing it, Quattrocchi noted.

""People taking this medication must discuss with their primary care provider and pharmacist about the potential side effects and drug interactions,"" she said.

Tawfik's company currently treats more than 3,500 patients with rapamycin, he told Fox News Digital.

105-YEAR-OLD WOMAN GRADUATES FROM STANFORD UNIVERSITY 83 YEARS AFTER LEAVING CAMPUS: 'AMAZING'

His team has seen numerous benefits of its off-label anti-aging use, he said, including improved cellular health, reduced risk of age-related diseases and the potential for enhanced longevity.

""Under proper medical supervision, many of our patients experience a marked reduction in inflammation and improvement in conditions related to autoimmunity,"" Tawfik said.

""For example, patients with osteoarthritis often report significant relief from joint pain after starting rapamycin.""

The expert also noted that certain biomarkers linked to healthspan and longevity -- such as reduced inflammation markers and enhanced metabolic health -- were seen in the bloodwork of the patients using rapamycin.

Patients need a prescription for rapamycin, experts told Fox News Digital.

Individuals are screened to determine whether they are candidates for the treatment. If it is prescribed, patients are monitored carefully when taking the drug.

""It is essential that rapamycin use is overseen by a physician.""

""It is essential that rapamycin use is overseen by a physician to ensure that dosing is effective yet safe, as high doses can lead to unwanted immunosuppression,"" Tawfik warned.

Maier echoed that rapamycin and its derivatives are not for self-medication use.

""An important step is to first measure the patient's biological age and investigate why the pace of aging might be faster,"" she told Fox News Digital.

""Then a tailored approach to match the measures with interventions at need is required.""

Quattrocchi and Tawfik both emphasized the importance of working with an accredited pharmacy that sources the drug directly from a reputable manufacturer.

Rapamycin is not recommended for immunocompromised individuals or those taking immunosuppressant medication, Tawfik cautioned.

It is not typically used in younger adults, he added, since starting this regimen at such an early age is unnecessary.

There are limited studies on the effects of rapamycin on humans and organ systems, Maier noted.

In researching studies of the drug, Maier's research team found that adverse reactions in healthy individuals were classified ""as mild or moderate and were reversible after the discontinuation of treatment.""

However, the study authors stated, ""there were increased numbers of infections and increases in total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol and triglycerides in individuals with aging-related diseases.""

""Future studies should assess the remaining unexamined systems and test the effects of long-term exposure to rapamycin and its derivatives.""

The majority of studies exploring rapamycin's effects on aging have been conducted on mice and other animals as well as experimental models, researchers told Fox News Digital.

""The reason scientists are so interested in rapamycin is that in every species that's been studied to date - yeast, worms, flies, mice - when they are given rapamycin, healthspan and lifespan are extended,"" Tawfik noted.

""No other intervention has that degree of validation.""

Quattrocchi agreed that further research is needed into the drug's proper dosing, adverse effects, and potential anti-aging benefits in healthy individuals and those with medical conditions."

Lisa Phillips had big dreams of becoming a top model when she encountered Jeffrey Epstein.

The cover girl, who said she was abused by the late convicted sex offender on his private island, is speaking out candidly in a new podcast, ""From Now On."" It aims to raise awareness of human trafficking and how it can impact anyone.

""It took me many years to get to this point,"" Phillips, now a model scout and agent in Los Angeles, told Fox News Digital. ""I struggled with the confusion of what happened to me years ago.""

EPSTEIN GRAND JURY RECORDS RELEASED, DESCRIBE TRAFFICKER'S NETWORK FOR 'GROOMING' UNDERAGE GIRLS

""But as soon as I started speaking to other survivors, I started realizing that my story from so many years ago was the same as those - both the underage girls from Florida and the older girls that were 18-25,"" she shared.

Phillips began modeling when she was 16 years old. By 19, she was already heading to fashion capitals, like London and Paris, making her mark. At age 21, she found herself in New York City, where she had booked a photo shoot in the British West Indies.

It was there that a fellow model told her about an island nearby - Little Saint James.

""We had an extra day,"" Phillips recalled. ""She said, 'Let's get out of here. Let's do something. I have a friend, a really good friend. He's amazing. He owns an island close by. Let's see him. He said he would send us a boat, and we could hang out over there.'""

The women boarded a boat and headed to the island. When they arrived, there were other women already there swimming in a pool and ""enjoying themselves.""

At first, everything seemed ""fine,"" said Phillips. They had ""a wonderful dinner"" before Epstein approached them and introduced himself.

""He was very charming,"" she recalled. ""He was that type of man who just locked into you and made you feel very special, very safe and so interested in who you were as a person. I never had that attention from a man, not even from my father, expressing that much interest in everything that I was talking about, what I was doing, what my aspirations and goals were.""

""I always remember that he made me feel really special... That's what he did for everybody.""

However, things took a turn ""pretty quickly,"" she claimed.

That same night, a woman casually approached her, saying that Epstein wanted a massage. A confused Phillips said she did not know how to give one. The woman nonchalantly told her to ""just chill."" After assuring her, Phillips followed the woman's lead. She felt safe with her.

Phillips claimed that the massage turned into Epstein sexually assaulting her in the room.

""It wasn't a straight, 'Let me pull you into a room and abuse you,'"" said Phillips. ""He eases into things, like, 'It's just a massage, right?' The girl went along with it and brought me into the room to do this massage with him. It was a slow thing that escalated into abuse. The whole process was very confusing to me.""

""I was on an island,"" she said. ""I wasn't in a house where I could say, 'Excuse me, I need to leave,' and grab my stuff. I was far away from home on an island I should never have been on.""

Phillips later learned that multiple women, like her, alleged that they were assaulted by Epstein under the guise of a massage.

""After that, my life spiraled,"" Phillips admitted. ""I started doing drugs and drinking... I felt like I was tarnished, or something was wrong with me that I didn't stand up for myself... And everybody looked up to Jeffrey at the time.

""During those years, he wasn't a playboy who hung out in the scene. People talked about him highly. When I would bring up his name to people, they would say, 'We love Jeffrey. He did this for me. He got me a visa. He introduced me to my husband. He put me through school.' It was always these big things that he did for people. That was confusing for me.""

Phillips also pointed out that the incident occurred in the early 2000s, long before the #MeToo movement where victims of sexual abuse came forward publicly with their accounts. At that time, she said, ""You would never speak out about somebody like that with that kind of power.""

Phillips said she ""suppressed"" the shame and confusion she felt as Epstein portrayed himself as a mentor wanting to help.

""Nobody talked about the creepy massages and what was happening,"" she said. ""It was all hush-hush... He was influential, and he was manipulative. He groomed you to believe that he was your mentor.""

In 2006, Epstein was arrested over allegations that he had hired teenage girls to give him sexualized massages at his Florida home.

Two years later, prosecutors allowed Epstein to plead guilty to a charge involving a single victim. He served 13 months in a jail work-release program then quietly started rebuilding his network of influential friends, with the help of his socialite former girlfriend, Ghislaine Maxwell.

After a series of Miami Herald stories about the plea bargain that deprived Epstein's victims of justice, federal prosecutors in New York revived the investigation and charged Epstein in 2019 with sex trafficking.

Epstein reportedly created and maintained a ""vast network"" and operation from 2002 ""up to and including"" at least 2005 that enabled him to ""sexually exploit and abuse dozens of underage girls"" in addition to paying victims to recruit other girls.

Prosecutors said that victims would be escorted to a room with a massage table where they would perform massages on Epstein.

At the time of Epstein's arrest, prosecutors said they found a trove of pictures of nude and seminude young women and girls at his $77 million Manhattan mansion. They also say additional victims have come forward since the arrest. He pleaded not guilty.

On Aug. 10 of that year, Epstein was found dead behind bars. He was 66. The cause of death was suicide.

When Epstein killed himself in jail, prosecutors charged Maxwell with facilitating his illicit sexual encounters and participating in some of the abuse. The 62-year-old was convicted and is serving a 20-year prison term.

Phillips said that while she hated her abuser, she cried after learning of his death.

""I didn't know why,"" she explained. ""He was a bad guy, but I had good thoughts about him too... I just had this emotional breakdown of confusion. But if he was still alive, I probably would've had way too much fear to speak out. I probably would have never spoken out. But... I was willing to finally talk about what happened to me. I needed answers.""

Phillips went on to testify in a 2022 civil case involving another Epstein accuser, Virginia Roberts Giuffre, USA Today reported. She also filed as a Jane Doe under the Adult Survivors Act, citing abuse by an Epstein associate. According to the outlet, she received a settlement in a case involving JPMorgan Chase & Co. and Epstein accusers.

""The pain is in the numbers,"" she explained. ""You can go through some type of abuse and deal with it on your own... but when you start hearing about other women who had the same experiences with Jeffrey and others, it does something to your psyche,"" she said.

""... And when I started speaking to the other survivors, that's where I felt validation... That's when I felt safe to talk about my experience without people shaming me. I wasn't alone.""

Today, Phillips hopes her podcast will provide a platform for other victims who are healing, like her.

""I want people to know that there's a place where you can come and be heard,"" she said. ""I also want to educate people on how to advocate for themselves, and look out for red flags while you're building your career. Because this can happen in any kind of business.""

"American father of Hamas hostage Itay Chen pushes US, Israel on 'Plan B' as negotiations falter",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/american-father-hamas-hostage-itay-chen-pushes-us-israel-plan-b-negotiations-falter,2024-10-07T08:16:30Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

""When was the last time you talked to your kid? Do you know where he slept last night? Do you know what he ate? Do you know if he had a blanket on him?"" Ruby Chen, father of Itay Chen who was taken by Hamas on Oct. 7, 2023, asked in a sit-down interview with Fox News Digital.

""All those types of questions are questions that we ask ourselves constantly,"" he said. ""The feeling is that we've been failed.""

Itay,19 years old when he was taken, has remained a hostage held in Gaza for 365 days after his unit in the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) was attacked in southern Israel when Hamas terrorists flooded the border in a series of mass assaults.

Chen, a New York City native, said he and his wife have been given ""unprecedented"" access to the White House, the CIA and other top agencies throughout the last year to discuss ongoing strategies to try and get the hostages out of Gaza.

ISRAEL SAYS TOP HAMAS RAFAH BRIGADE 'DISMANTLED' ON PHILADELPHI CORRIDOR, 2,000 TERRORISTS KILLED

The Chens have not only met with national security adviser Jake Sullivan a dozen times, as well as CIA Director William Burns and Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, they also hold a weekly call with the White House.

But ultimately, these supportive efforts have fallen flat when it comes to the real needs of American families whose loved ones are still held hostage by Hamas.

""We have been failed by the Israeli government, we, as U.S. citizens, feel we've been failed by the Biden administration despite all of the access that they've provided us,"" he explained. ""They share as much as they can. But at the end of the day, it's... very black and white.

""Where is he?""

Chen explained that following the Oct. 7 attacks on Israel, the Israeli government pushed a strategy to secure the release of the then 251 hostages by bombarding suspected Hamas positions in Gaza.

In the initial weeks following the deadly Hamas attacks, Israel began pounding northern Gaza - a move Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu believed would bring Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar ""to his knees"" and make him be ""willing to release hostages.""

A week-long cease-fire in November saw the release of 105 hostages. Twelve other hostages have been freed following negotiations during the immediate aftermath of the attack, or because of IDF rescue operations between February and August.

YAZIDI WOMAN HELD HOSTAGE FOR 10 YEARS IN GAZA RESCUED IN ISRAEL, US OPERATION

None of the eight American hostages that were kidnapped have been released, and only seven continue to be held by Hamas after the body of Hersh Goldberg-Polin was discovered by IDF forces in late August, after he along with five others were killed by the terrorist group.

More than 100 hostages remain in captivity in the Gaza Strip - 97 of whom were abducted on Oct. 7, 2023.

The Chens, other American families and the international community have repeatedly urged Israel and Hamas to reach a cease-fire agreement and return all hostages to their families.

But disagreements over security corridors in Gaza have created a seemingly insurmountable hurdle as U.S., Egyptian and Qatari officials work to get Israel and Hamas to reach an agreement.

The father of the IDF soldier pointed out that so long as no one is discussing a ""day after"" plan for the Gaza Strip and the Palestinians there, Hamas will continue to hold tightly to its most powerful bargaining chip, the hostages.

""Where is Hamas in the day-after? And if no one is willing to talk about it, then Hamas believes that they are better off holding on to the hostages until something changes,"" he explained. ""It's a jihad organization. They wish to have chaos. They are looking for a regional conflict.

""When they see that there's now a conflict with Lebanon, that does not motivate them to get into a cease-fire agreement. On the contrary, they wish to belong, and have other players join in this jihad against Israel,"" Chen continued. ""So I question, what is the plan?""

""I am very critical of the time,"" Itay's father said. ""The last 10 months, I've been asking Mr. Sullivan, What's plan B?

""I haven't heard of a Plan B. And that's unacceptable,"" he added.

BLINKEN TRAVELS TO EGYPT FOR CEASE-FIRE TALKS AS ISRAEL ADDS NEW WAR GOAL

Securing peace in the region became even more precarious last week after Israel, against the objections of the U.S. and its international allies, launched an incursion into southern Lebanon with the expressed intent of dismantling the threat posed by Hezbollah.

Chen pointed out that this second front not only added another dimension to securing the release of the hostages, but it also seemingly pushed talks with Hamas on the backburner as concerns remain high over a broader regional conflict.

""If you could follow the news, you could see that the hostage issue has been less prioritized,"" he said. ""And that's a very difficult feeling for us and the families.""

Netanyahu has said his top priority is securing the release of the hostages, but his refusal to withdraw from the Philidelphi Corridor due to security reasons has created a negotiation impasse and questions have begun to mount over whether the prime minister is truly prioritizing the hostages over his push to ""eliminate Hamas.""

But the parents of Itay - who has been described as a ""fun-loving kid,"" the ""sandwich"" of the family with an older sibling and younger sibling, everybody's ""best friend,"" and a former Boy Scout turned a young man with a loving girlfriend - cannot allow for him, or the others still in Gaza, to be at the mercy of any political agenda.

""I'm a guy that comes from New York City - and we talk less, we look at actions. The actions of the last year show the opposite."" Chen said. ""He can say whatever he wants. I don't believe a thing that comes out of his mouth, I believe in what he does.""

The father of three also urged the Biden administration to question whether it is still in the U.S.'s strategic interest to unequivocally back Netanyahu.

""There is no accountability from either side for failed negotiation. You do not see any equation that says, 'OK, if you do not do A, then there's a consequence' on either side,"" Chen said in reference to both Israel and Hamas. ""There's no consequence associated with a negative action to a strategic interest of the United States.""

Chen also argued that ""effective pressure"" needs to be put on Hamas by reevaluating what other ""pressure points"" can be utilized.

The father pointed to the clear need for tougher economic and diplomatic involvement when it comes to international aid sent to Gaza - including tougher sanctions not only on adversarial nations but on partner countries that allow aid to flow into Gaza.

This includes stricter oversight of United Nations-provided humanitarian aid, which though intended for the Palestinian people, is falling into the hands of Hamas, a group that is not designated as a terrorist organization by the UN.

Hamas has long been accused of seizing basic goods in Gaza and then reselling them in a black-market scheme at exuberant prices.

Reports have further indicated that Hamas for years has had substantial access to monetary aid siphoned from funds provided by top organizations like the United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA), which has been directly used for combatant operations against Israel, including tunnel building and access to arms.

But aside from the substantial need to address aid-based concerns, Chen also argued that diplomatic solutions are not being fully recognized by the U.S.

Nations like Russia and Thailand secured the release of their citizens taken by Hamas, and Chen argued Washington - which was able to negotiate with its biggest adversary just months ago to free U.S. citizens from Russian prisons - should be working to do the same to secure the release of those held in Gaza.

""So, it's possible,"" Chen said. ""Complicated, yep. Doable, yep.""

""The assumption that was put in front of us at the beginning was that U.S. hostages will come out via a larger deal that Israel will be a part of. And if that assumption is not working out after a year, then yes, we need to challenge the administration and look at that assumption."
Swiss probe into woman's voluntary death causing advocacy groups behind 'suicide capsule' to suspend its use,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/swiss-probe-womans-voluntary-death-causing-advocacy-groups-behind-suicide-capsule-suspend-its-use,2024-10-07T07:49:27Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Advocacy groups behind a ""suicide capsule"" announced Sunday they have suspended applications to use the device until authorities in Switzerland complete a criminal investigation into a woman's voluntary death from its first use.

The president of Switzerland-based The Last Resort, Florian Willet, is being held in pretrial detention, according to the group and Exit International, an affiliate founded in Australia. Both organizations advocate for the right to assisted suicide.

Swiss police arrested Willet and several other people following the death of a 64-year-old American woman who last month became the first person to use the device to voluntarily end her life, according to The Associated Press. The device, known as the ""Sarco,"" was used in a forest in the northern Schaffhausen region of Switzerland near the German border on Sept. 23.

Other people who were initially detained in connection with the woman's death were released from custody, according to authorities.

SUICIDE ADVOCATES BOAST OVER APPARENT USE OF SARCO SUICIDE CAPSULE ON US CITIZEN IN SWITZERLAND

The woman was reportedly suffering from severe immune compromise.

Assisted suicide is legal in Switzerland, with laws allowing so-called death with dignity as long as the person ends their life with no ""external assistance"" and people who assist the person do not do so for any ""self-serving motive.""

The advocacy groups said in a statement Sunday that 371 people were in the process of applying to use the Sarco in Switzerland as of Sept. 23, but that applications were suspended after its first use.

Exit International, whose founder Philip Nitschke is based in the Netherlands, is behind the device, which was 3D-printed and cost more than $1 million to develop.

The capsule was designed to allow a person to sit in a reclining seat inside the device and push a button that injects nitrogen gas from a tank underneath into the sealed chamber. The person would then fall asleep and die by suffocation in a few minutes.

Exit International has said Willet was the only person present for the woman's death, which the group described as ""peaceful, fast and dignified.""

On the day of the woman's death, Swiss Health Minister Elisabeth Baume-Schneider told parliament that use of the device would not be legal.

But Exit International pushed back on Baume-Schneider's statement, arguing that the group's lawyers in Switzerland believe use of the device is legal.

Sean 'Diddy' Combs' mother defends disgraced music mogul as he sits in jail on sex crime charges,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/sean-diddy-combs-mother-defends-disgraced-music-mogul-he-sits-jail-sex-crime-charges,2024-10-07T02:48:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Janice Combs, Sean ""Diddy"" Combs' mother, broke her silence Sunday and admitted she was left ""devastated and profoundly saddened"" by the allegations waged against her son, she said in a statement provided to Fox News Digital.

Diddy was arrested Sept. 16 and charged the next day with racketeering conspiracy; sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion; and transportation to engage in prostitution. He entered a not guilty plea hours after an indictment detailing his alleged sex crimes was unsealed. If found guilty, he faces a minimum of 15 years behind bars or a maximum sentence of life in prison.

""It is heartbreaking to see my son judged not for the truth, but for a narrative created out of lies,"" Janice Combs wrote. ""To bear witness what seems to be like a public lynching of my son before he has had the opportunity to prove his innocence is a pain too unbearable to put into words. Like every human being, my son deserves to have his day in court, to finally share his side, and to prove his innocence.""

She pleaded, ""My son is not the monster they have painted him to be, and he deserves the chance to tell his side. I can only pray that I am alive to see him speak his truth and be vindicated.""

""I am not here to portray my son as perfect because he is not,"" Janice Combs said. ""He has made mistakes in his past, as we all have. My son may not have been entirely truthful about certain things, such as denying he has ever gotten violent with an ex-girlfriend when the hotel's surveillance showed otherwise.""

She added, ""Sometimes, the truth and a lie become so closely intertwined that it becomes terrifying to admit one part of the story, especially when that truth is outside the norm or is too complicated to be believed. This is why I believe my son's civil legal team opted to settle the ex-girlfriend's lawsuit instead of contesting it until the end, resulting in a ricochet effect as the federal government used this decision against my son by interpreting it as an admission of guilt.""

""I am not here to portray my son as perfect because he is not. He has made mistakes in his past, as we all have.""

Surveillance video taken from a Los Angeles hotel in 2016 allegedly showed the billionaire publicly assaulting his then girlfriend Cassie Ventura. In the footage, Sean Combs ""kicked, dragged, and threw a vase at a woman as she was attempting to leave,"" the indictment said. ""When a member of the hotel security staff intervened, Combs attempted to bribe the staff member to ensure silence.""

""It is important to recognize that none of us, regardless of our status, are immune to fear or mistakes,"" Janice Combs said. ""Not being entirely straightforward about one issue does not mean my son is guilty of the repulsive allegations and the grave charges leveled against him. Many individuals who were wrongfully convicted and later exonerated had their freedom taken from them not because they were guilty of the crimes they were accused of, but because they didn't fit the image of what this society considers to be a 'good person.' History has showed us how individuals can be wrongfully convicted due to their past actions or mistakes.""

She continued, ""Watching the world make jokes and laugh at my son's life crumbling before our eyes is something I can never forget. It is truly agonizing to watch the world turn against my son so quickly and easily over lies and misconceptions, without ever hearing his side or affording him the opportunity to present his side.""

Janice Combs believed people were seeking ""financial gain"" through telling lies about her son, and not pursuing justice. ""These individuals saw how quickly my son's civil legal team settled his ex-girlfriend's lawsuit, so they believe they can receive a quick payday by falsely accusing my son,"" she said. ""False allegations of sexual assault thwart true victims of sexual violence from getting the justice they deserve.""

Janice Combs accused the federal government of engaging in similar tactics ""to prosecute my son,"" and said the injustice has been ""unbearable"" on their family.

""The worst part of this ordeal is watching my beloved son be stripped of his dignity, not for what he did, but for what people choose to believe about him,"" she said before asking his supporters to not ""judge him before you've had the chance to hear his side.""

""I beg you to think about those who have been wrongfully persecuted, to remember that not everyone who has made mistakes in life deserves to have their entire existence judged by a single action or a few mistakes,"" she wrote.

Authorities alleged Diddy ran a criminal enterprise through his businesses, including Bad Boy Entertainment, Combs Enterprises and Combs Global, among others. He used ""firearms, threats of violence, coercion and verbal, emotional, physical, and sexual abuse"" to fulfill his sexual desires, according to the unsealed indictment obtained by Fox News Digital.

Diddy and his employees would ""intimidate, threaten, and lure female victims into Combs' orbit, often under the pretense of a romantic relationship. Combs allegedly then used force, threats of force and coercion to cause victims to engage in extended sex acts with male commercial sex workers that Combs referred to as, among other things, 'freak offs.'""

Melania Trump says former President Trump was aware of her abortion stance 'since the day we met',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/melania-trump-former-president-trump-aware-abortion-stance-since-day-met,2024-10-06T17:19:22Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Former first lady Melania Trump spoke with former President Trump before writing about her support for abortion in her self-titled memoir, she told Fox News' Maria Bartiromo on Sunday.

""He knew my position since the day we met, and I believe in individual freedom. I want to decide what I want to do with my body. I don't want government in my personal business,"" she said in an exclusive ""Sunday Morning Futures"" interview.

""I think it's very important and, as I said in the book, and it's very well explained in the chapter, 'What does my body, my choice mean?' because timing really matters and also the restrictions, so I encourage people to read it because we live in a world that everybody should have individual freedom,"" she continued.

Trump is promoting her upcoming ""Melania"" memoir, which disclosed a shocking truth to many of her husband's supporters regarding her stance on the controversial issue, calling abortion a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report from last Wednesday.

MELANIA TRUMP'S ABORTION VIEWS IN NEW MEMOIR SPUR OUTRAGE FROM PRO-LIFERS: 'SHE IS WRONG'

She reportedly wrote, ""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government.""

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes. Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

MELANIA TRUMP'S PRO-CHOICE STAND ISN'T THAT DIFFERENT FROM OTHER REPUBLICAN FIRST LADIES

The revelation ignited a flurry of responses across the political spectrum, with pro-lifers slamming her for the view they argue fails to align with the Catholic faith, to which she subscribes.

Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group, called the view ""anti-feminist"" and the ""opposite of empowerment.""

Others, including Lila Rose and president of pro-life advocacy group Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, Marjorie Dannenfelser, criticized the stance as well.

On the left, ""The View"" co-host Joy Behar accused Trump of lying about being pro-choice, calling her stance a ""big scam.""

Others have posed the question: why make the revelation just before the election?

""That was not written in the last week or the last month,"" Trump told Bartiromo.

""That book was written months before, and it was in print months before, so that was my belief, and it is my belief, and I wanted to put it in the book because I want to be authentic. I want people to read the book because they could find out a lot of things that were never discussed. I'm very selective in what I do, and when I'm doing interviews or not or where I am or not, and this is my story.

DAVID MARCUS: Pennsylvania's Gen Zers embrace Trump like Millennials never have,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/david-marcus-pennsylvanias-gen-zers-embrace-trump-like-millennials-never-have,2024-10-06T17:16:46Z,"Gen Z voters Jahmiel Jackson and Ranger Irwin discuss the deep divide between young male and female voters on 'The Story.'

Over the last two months, I have spent more time in Pennsylvania than any other state for the obvious reason that the outcome there will very likely determine whether our next president will be Donald Trump or Kamala Harris.

One increasingly clear phenomenon I have slowly seen, and it's backed up by some polling, is that Gen Z voters who are between the ages of 18 and 27 are far more open to supporting Trump than their Millennial elders, who are mainly in their 30s.

GROWING NUMBER OF GEN Z MEN SUPPORTING TRUMP REPRESENTS 'ONGOING CULTURE SHOCK' IN US POLITICS, VOTER SAYS

A recent poll from Harvard has Harris leading Trump 61 percent to 30 percent among Millennials, but an NBC News poll shows that with voters 18-29, that lead shrinks to 16 points at 50 to 34.

It tracks with what I have been seeing on the ground.

At a Trump rally in Harrisburg back in August, I met young, blue-collar Gen Zers who believed Trump would provide more opportunity, a JD Vance event in Hershey was overflowing with twenty somethings, and Saturday in Butler, I met dozens of first-time voters planning to pull the red lever.

It came into clear focus later on Saturday night at Jack Jolly's Holiday Bar in downtown Butler, a town which, unlike many of the hollowed out Ohio cities I've seen that are more rust than belt, is actually quite charming and seems to be thriving.

Jack Jolly's is one of those cocktail lounges where they infuse everything or put smoke in the glass, and the first people I met there were a trio in their late 30s; one married couple and their guy friend.

All were childhood buds from Butler who had moved away after college and recently returned to purchase homes in this lovely hillside hamlet. They were no fans of Trump, and they also weren't overly interested in politics.

GEN Z VOTER FLIPS FROM SANDERS TO TRUMP: HARD TO VOTE FOR THE PARTY PUTTING 'TAMPONS IN BOYS' BATHROOMS'

At one point, I asked them if the emerging well-to-do segment of the population and the longer-standing middle and lower classes mingled well. They looked at me quizzically and I said, ""I mean, your kids must go to school together, right?""

""Oh, we don't have kids,"" the single guy told me, though the woman is a teacher.

And they are a type of voter I have seen elsewhere, in San Francisco and Chicago -- good jobs, few responsibilities, and not terribly ill at ease with the state of their lives, the country, or the world.

About the time they took off, another trio took their place, this time, three dudes, younger, mid to late twenties. Two were Trump fans, and the other, a history teacher, supports Harris, but also said, ""I don't think Trump is a threat to democracy.""

What followed was a robust conversation about politics, America, and life. They were well-informed, avid social media users, and importantly, they all seemed to have a grasp on the best arguments of the other side.

Whatever is driving these young voters into the arms of the GOP, it will have profound implications not just on this election, but going forward for decades.

Earlier in the day, I had spoken to Johnny and Rocky at the Trump rally, who were also either Gen Z or close. They are buddies, but I was surprised when Johnny said, ""Rocky and I watched the VP debate together.""

When I was 27, we did a lot of things, but get together to watch a vice presidential debate was not among them. Then again, in the 1990s, we thought a bright future was inevitable. Unlike Gen X, Gen Z is very well aware that it isn't.

Part of the reason that I was slow to pick up on the reddening of Gen Z, especially, but not only, Gen Z men, is that I couldn't really explain it, and I still struggle to.

Are they less connected to and susceptible to the neoliberal pablum of the leftist media and entertainment industry? Is it because they grew up, in part, under a Trump presidency and so do not find it abhorrent or abnormal? Is it counter-cultural?

And unlike Millennials, who seem quietly resigned to a country and society that isn't going to get any better, there seems to be flickering hope among our youngest voters, as if they dare to dream.

A guest on ""Jimmy Kimmel Live!,"" late last week, Aniston explained how a picture of her working on set had recently been taken out of context to make headlines. Kimmel then pulled out a previous issue of In Touch Weekly, with the ominous headline: ""The Truth About Jen & Barack [Obama]!""

The caption below read: ""Michelle betrayed as Aniston steals her husband's attention.""

Kimmel was interested in if Aniston ever worried about stories like that.

Flabbergasted, Aniston responded. ""That's kind of - that was - of all the calls you get from your publicist where you're just like, 'Oh no, what's it gonna be?' or the email saying, you know, 'Some cheesy tabloid is gonna make up a story.' And then it's that. I was not mad at it.""

Aniston turned to the audience to reiterate that there was nothing romantic about her relationship with the former president, adding they'd only met once.

""I know Michelle more than him,"" she teased.

Kimmel took Aniston's honesty as an opportunity to ask her about more rumors written about her.

Aniston confirmed rumors that she'd had a salmon sperm facial, a fan had asked her for a photograph while she was nude in the sauna and that she travels abroad with a jar of olives. She was quick to dispel a rumor that said she'd had a $4,000 anti-aging water filter installed for her dogs. She also denied having a black belt in jiu-jitsu.

KIMMEL: ""You have a zip lock bag filled with your dead therapist's ashes?""

Aniston was horrified that Kimmel, her personal friend, asked that question.

KIMMEL: ""That one's a little bit true, right?""

ANISTON: ""It's a little true. Oh, I'm gonna sound like I really need a therapist after this.""

The actress tried to justify the response, saying she'd attended the woman's service, trailing off and calling it a long story.

Aniston also confirmed that as a child, she had artwork hanging at The Museum of Modern Art (MOMA) and that her family made her belly dance on Christmas Eve.

""Anytime, not just Christmas Eve!"" the ""Friends"" star quipped. ""You know the Greeks love any kind of a family dinner.... It's like when you say to your child, 'Play piano for everyone' or 'Let's sing for everyone.' I get such anxiety when my friends do that to their children... I have inner trauma from having to perform and belly dance in front of my great aunts and uncles and grandmothers."" she joked.

A representative for Aniston did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment. When reached for comment, an Obama representative simply replied, ""Stop.""

Walz tries to downplay laws he signed granting benefits to illegals in Minnesota: 'Not the VP's position',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/walz-tries-downplay-laws-he-signed-granting-benefits-illegals-minnesota-not-vps-position,2024-10-06T16:46:59Z,"Vice presidential nominee and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz discusses Israel's right to defend itself and Kamala Harris' economic policies on 'Fox News Sunday.'

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz sought to distance Vice President Kamala Harris from laws he himself signed that granted benefits to illegal immigrants in Minnesota on Sunday.

Walz made the comments during a wide-ranging interview on Fox News Sunday with host Shannon Bream. Bream pressed Walz on his military history and his record on abortion in addition to questioning him on legislation he signed in Minnesota that allows illegal immigrants to obtain driver's licenses and receive state-funded tuition assistance, among other benefits.

""Are those not magnets to draw people here, many times on dangerous journeys for themselves? And why should your taxpayers in Minnesota or across the states pay for those programs?"" Bream asked.

""Well, that's not the vice president's position,"" Walz admitted, before going on to defend his leadership in Minnesota.

TRUMP CAMPAIGN PUSHES BACK ON 'SNL' SKIT ABOUT ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS: 'DISGUSTING'

""But I will say this, Minnesota ranks as a top five business state. We rank as a top three state for children living, and we're a top state for health care access,"" he said. ""Look, the Vice President has made it clear that she has policies that make a difference. Her border policies are the most strongest, the fairest we've seen.""

Bream also challenged Walz to clarify his ticket's position on abortion access. The exchange ultimately led to Walz flatly accusing former President Trump of lying when he said he would not sign a national abortion ban into law.

Bream began by pointing out that Minnesota's abortion law imposes no limits on abortion procedures through all nine months of pregnancy, something that goes far beyond the provisions of Roe v. Wade, which Harris and Walz said they support.

""You signed the bill that makes it legal through all nine months. Is that a position you think Democrats should advocate for nationally?"" Bream asked.

""The vice president and I have been clear the restoration of Roe versus Wade is what we're asking for,"" Walz responded.

HARRIS CAMPAIGN PLEDGES MORE MEDIA INTERVIEWS AS VOTERS STILL HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT HER POLICIES

""But that law goes far beyond Roe v. Wade,"" Bream pressed. ""Let's agree, in what you signed there's not a single limit through nine months of pregnancy. Roe had a trimester framework that did have limits through the pregnancy. The Minnesota law does not have that.""

""This doesn't change anything. It puts the decision back on to the woman, to the physicians,"" Walz responded. ""And we know that this is simply something to be brought up - to be very clear Donald Trump's asking for a nationwide abortion ban.""

""[Trump] has said repeatedly that he will not sign a national abortion ban. Are you calling that a flat out lie?"" Bream asked.

""Yes, of course, and Senator Vance has in the past said so too,"" Walz said.

Bream concluded the interview by giving Walz a chance to respond to criticism of his frequent ""misstatements,"" such as his claims about military service and his assertion that he was in Hong Kong during the Tiananmen Square massacre.

""Look, I speak passionately. I had an entire career, decades before I was in public office. They know, and I'm very proud of my 24 years in service and my record. I have never disparaged someone else in this, but I know that's not what Donald Trump does. They disparage everyone,"" Walz said.

""I will own up when I misspeak. I will own up when I make a mistake. Let's be very clear. On that debate stage the other night, I asked one very simple question and Senator Vance would not acknowledge that Donald Trump lost the 2020 election,"" he finished."
"On Oct. 7 anniversary, we remember this betrayal of silence",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/oct-7-anniversary-we-remember-betrayal-silence,2024-10-06T13:05:59Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Reflections on the anniversary of the Oct. 7, 2023, massacre in Israel must not only consider the tragedy itself but the silence that followed.

That day, Hamas militants unleashed unspeakable violence, deliberately targeting civilians. Among the victims were hundreds of women and girls who were subjected to sexual violence - an intentional strategy designed to terrorize and degrade.

Yet, despite the horrific nature of these acts, international bodies, including the United Nations, took weeks - if not months - to even acknowledge what had transpired. Leaders who claim to stand for women not only failed women with their words; it was a failure to act.

Silence is not neutral.

AS OCTOBER 7TH ANNIVERSARY APPROACHES, JEWISH STUDENTS BRACE FOR PROTESTS, VOW TO 'WALK PROUDLY'

The use of sexual violence as a weapon in conflict is not a recent phenomenon. It is an age-old, barbaric tool of war, used to humiliate, destabilize and traumatize communities. However, the global community's muted response to the sexual atrocities of Oct. 7 reveals a troubling double standard.

Israeli women did not receive the swift and vocal condemnation for gender-based violence that is often extended in other conflicts. While many leaders and organizations, such as UN Women, eventually condemned the violence, it took them over 50 days to issue a statement denouncing these acts. This delay occurred despite a significant body of credible and corroborated evidence available at the time.

Even without an official report, every woman who saw that video of a young woman, her sweatpants stained with blood, instinctively knew the devastating reality behind those marks. That unspoken understanding crosses every boundary -- cultural, political or religious. It's a truth embedded in the experience of being a woman, a shared recognition of the raw vulnerability to violence that so many of us have felt, feared or survived.

ISRAEL BANS UN SECRETARY-GENERAL OVER ANTI-ISRAEL ACTIONS: 'DOESN'T DESERVE TO SET FOOT ON ISRAELI SOIL'

Yet, the willful delay of condemnation, combined with the relative silence from many women's rights organizations, reflects a larger issue where political affiliations seem to overshadow the fundamental responsibility to stand against rape as a weapon of war.

Silence in the face of gender-based violence is complicity. When leaders delay or fail to acknowledge such atrocities, they send a message that the suffering of women, especially in complex geopolitical conflicts, can be overlooked. It is precisely this neglect that fuels cycles of violence, making it clear that women and girls are collateral damage, their dignity expendable.

It also reflects a profound unwillingness to confront uncomfortable truths about the nature of this violence and who it is perpetrated against.

There remains a persistent reluctance in the West to confront and criticize cultures that subjugate women through practices like stoning for adultery or forcing women to cover their faces. Political correctness has led to a loss of moral clarity, and an inability to confront harmful practices and values that undermine human rights.

END US FUNDING FOR UN AGENCY GIVING IMMUNITY TO ITS MURDEROUS HAMAS MEMBERS

This reluctance to offend has led to dangerous acceptance and moral relativism. Practices such as honor killings or female genital mutilation are undeniably violations of basic human rights. Yet, the guise of inclusivity shields these practices from criticism, framing them instead as cultural differences that must be respected.

Tacit acceptance has consequences. In fact, the United Nations, the same body that failed Israeli women so spectacularly, also reported a 50% increase in verified cases of conflict-related sexual violence from 2022 to 2023. When women are overlooked or targeted in this way, the global response must be swift and unequivocal. Whether in Israel, Ukraine, Sudan or elsewhere, we must demand accountability for those who weaponize gender-based violence.

Protecting women and girls requires a clear, unambiguous commitment to their dignity, safety and inherent worth. It means recognizing that sexual violence is not just an issue of war, it's an attack on the very identity of women.

We need leaders who are willing to confront these truths, who will stand up unequivocally against violence, and who will advocate for policies that protect the most vulnerable, not shy away from defining who they are.

This anniversary must serve as a call to action and a reminder that silence is not an oversight, it is a betrayal. If the international community continues to hesitate, it signals that the lives, bodies and dignity of women are negotiable.

Women and girls must not be sacrificed on the altar of political expediency, and none of us should remain silent when women and girls' bodies are turned into battlefields."
Prince Andrew's Jeffrey Epstein fallout has Princess Beatrice 'devastated': expert,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/prince-andrews-jeffrey-epstein-fallout-princess-beatrice-devastated-expert,2024-10-06T08:12:07Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Princess Beatrice is expecting her second child, but not all is joyful inside the House of Windsor.

Her father, Prince Andrew, is the subject of Amazon Prime's ""A Very Royal Scandal,"" which focuses on his nuclear 2019 interview about his relationship with late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The princess, who reportedly supported her father in speaking out at the time, was mentioned in the special.

Buckingham Palace announced Beatrice's pregnancy on Tuesday.

""Princess Beatrice is no doubt still feeling devastated as she was in the room at Buckingham Palace during the negotiations [for the interview],"" British royals expert Hilary Fordwich claimed to Fox News Digital.

PRINCESS BEATRICE'S PREGNANCY ANNOUNCEMENT FEATURES RARE BUCKINGHAM PALACE SLIP-UP

""She was obviously out of her depth with neither track record nor experience with such matters,"" Fordwich noted.

Fordwich's comments came after a source claimed to Australia's New Idea Magazine that the 36-year-old is ""sick of being humiliated"" and feels ""stuck in the middle"" as the scandal continues to follow her father.

""It's a stress hole there and, for some reason, Beatrice always gets stuck in the middle of things, playing peacemaker on behalf of her dad,"" claimed the insider, as reported by GB News.

""Princess Beatrice is no doubt still feeling devastated as she was in the room at Buckingham Palace during the negotiations [for the interview].""

-- Hilary Fordwich, British royals expert

""No one wants to be around [Andrew] when he's dealing with so much right now,"" the source claimed. ""Beatrice is brokenhearted, of course.""

In ""A Very Royal Scandal,"" actor Michael Sheen portrays the disgraced Duke of York in the days leading up to his interview on ""Newsnight"" with Emily Maitlis.

Following the disastrous sit-down in which he addressed the allegations made by Epstein accuser Virginia Giuffre, Andrew announced he was stepping back from royal duties.

""'A Very Royal Scandal' is a dramatized account of Prince Andrew's car-crash interview, which has caused ... irreparable harm to his public persona and to his daughters,"" royal expert Ian Pelham Turner told Fox News Digital.

""Beatrice and [her sister] Princess Eugenie have always been very close to both of their parents,"" Pelham Turner pointed out. ""But obviously, Beatrice is pregnant and still lives in Britain, thus bearing the brunt of trying to keep all sides of her family and the rest of the royal family ... [calm].""

""[She's been] calming down the rhetoric on both sides,"" Pelham Turner claimed.

Pelham Turner also claimed that tensions between Andrew, 64, and his brother, King Charles, are at an all-time high.

""King Charles recently told Andrew he should move into a luxury townhouse in Belgravia, a very exclusive part of London, but he refused to do so,"" Pelham Turner claimed. ""Now, the king is [said to be] taking away most of Andrew's security detail while living at Royal Lodge in Windsor.""

""So for Beatrice right now, she is between a rock and a hard place with her father,"" Pelham Turner added.

Sources also claimed to New Idea magazine that Beatrice had been avoiding Royal Lodge, Andrew's lavish home that is said to be worth $38 million.

Pelham Turner noted that Beatrice's growing family had been welcomed by Andrew, who is described as ""a doting grandfather.""

""The arrival should also give him more to do,"" he said.

""A Very Royal Scandal"" isn't the only special on rotation about the news-plagued prince.

""Scoop,"" available on Netflix, is the film adaptation of former BBC Newsnight producer Sam McAlister's book, ""Scoops: Behind the Scenes of the BBC's Most Shocking Interviews."" In it, she detailed how the car-crash interview came to fruition.

McAlister previously claimed to Fox News Digital that Andrew was accompanied by Beatrice for his final negotiations before the interview took place.

""It was a curveball,"" McAlister claimed. ""He went, 'I hope you don't mind, I've brought someone with me.' I was expecting a lawyer, someone who was going to close this down. Instead, his young daughter came around the corner. You can only imagine what it was like to have a conversation as delicate as this one involving the allegations that were against him ... in front of his daughter.""

""She was exactly as you would imagine, a concerned daughter who is protective of her father,"" she continued. ""I appreciate these are extraordinary circumstances, and the allegations against him are exceptionally grave. But when it comes down to it, she's a young woman who clearly loves her father and is looking to protect him.""

""The dynamic between them, despite the extraordinary circumstances, was a protective daughter ... listening to us, concerned about what he might be doing,"" said McAlister. ""She is very receptive, polite, clever and interested in the process itself. A daughter is the same, whether you're a prince or a pauper. And that's exactly who she was.""

British broadcaster and photographer Helena Chard previously told Fox News Digital that the king wants Andrew to leave his palatial 31-room home where he resides with ex-wife Sarah Ferguson.

""King Charles realizes that Prince Andrew living in Royal Lodge is not a good look,"" Chard explained. ""Prince Andrew's reputation is at an all-time low. He lost the respect of the nation. And yet, his ego is at an all-time high. He does not see sense. He has dug his heels and refuses to leave the home he loves, the prestigious Royal Lodge.""

""King Charles has been covering him financially. I feel now he has no alternative but to freeze this support, which in turn will freeze Prince Andrew out of Royal Lodge.""

According to the U.K. Times, Andrew has lived in Royal Lodge since 2004 after he signed a 75-year lease agreement the year before. The property requires an estimated $503,000 annually for upkeep.

QUEEN ELIZABETH II HAD 'BLIND SPOT' FOR PRINCE ANDREW AS JEFFREY EPSTEIN FRIENDSHIP IMPLODED: EXPERT

It was reported that the duke, who is ""at the brink of eviction,"" was expected to downsize after his ties to Epstein.

The outlet noted that the king would cover his brother's living expenses if he moved into Frogmore Cottage, the former U.K. home of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. The king would also provide for Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York.

Frogmore Cottage remains empty more than a year after the Duke and Duchess of Sussex were asked to vacate.

However, Andrew is reportedly ""refusing"" to downsize. A spokesperson for Buckingham Palace told Fox News Digital they won't comment on ""security matters.""

Following his interview, Andrew was also stripped of his honorary military titles. Before Queen Elizabeth II died in 2022, she removed his honorary leadership of various charities, known as royal patronages, and barred him from using the title ""His Royal Highness"" in official settings.

The council in the northern city of York voted unanimously to withdraw the prince's ""freedom of the city."" The honor was awarded to Andrew in 1987 after the queen made him the Duke of York. He is the first person to be stripped of the status, an honor that dates back to medieval times.

Local leaders have since argued that Andrew should also lose the title of Duke of York. A spokesperson for Andrew declined to comment at the time.

In a lawsuit filed in 2020, Giuffre accused Andrew of sexually exploiting her on three occasions in 2001 when she was 17. Andrew has vehemently denied any wrongdoing.

In 2022, a U.S. judge dismissed the sex abuse lawsuit against Andrew, who settled with Giuffre. The prince made a substantial donation to his accuser's charity and declared he never meant to malign her character.

Andrew was named in previously secret court documents related to Epstein that were unsealed in the new year. It was part of a 2015 lawsuit filed against Maxwell by Giuffre.

The records, including transcripts of interviews with some of Epstein's victims and old police reports, contained reminders that the millionaire had surrounded himself with famous and powerful figures, including a few who have also been accused of misconduct."

'Snow White' reboot star responds to backlash over her comments criticizing original 1937 film: 'Made me sad',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/snow-white-reboot-star-responds-backlash-over-her-comments-criticizing-original-1937-film-made-me-sad,2024-10-05T20:26:57Z,"Actresses Lina Godouse and Brittney Guzman give their take on the controversial remake of the classic tale on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

The star of Disney's live action ""Snow White"" reboot, Rachel Zegler, is defending herself from backlash she received after calling out the ""weird"" love story in the original animated film years ago.

In a new interview with Variety, Zegler accused her critics of taking her comments ""out of context"" after interview footage from 2022 featured her chiding the original movie as old-fashioned in its depiction of romance between Snow White and the prince that saved her.

""In all honesty, it made me sad that it was taken in such a way, because I believe that women can do anything. But I also believe that they can do everything,"" she told the Hollywood outlet.

RESURFACED VIDEO OF 'SNOW WHITE' ACTRESS SPARKS CONTROVERSY OVER CHANGES IN DISNEY REMAKE: 'NO LONGER 1937'

In the 2022 clip from the Disney D23 Expo that year, Zegler commented on her film adaptation of the classic fairy tale being more modern.

""I just mean that it's no longer 1937,"" she said at the time, adding, ""She's not going to be saved by the prince and she's not going to be dreaming about true love. She's dreaming about becoming the leader she knows she can be and the leader that her late father told her that she could be if she was fearless, fair, brave and true.""

Elsewhere, she commented that some parts of the original film were ""weird"" and that said the prince ""literally stalks"" Snow White.

Fans of the original Disney ""Snow White"" and other cultural commentators slammed Zegler's desire for a version of the classic story with modern gender norms shoehorned into it. The actress has since become the subject of mockery and Disney's upcoming film - out in 2025 - has been written off by many movie fans online.

In her recent interview, Zegler explained that she never intended her comments to be offensive, stating that she just meant the classic Disney character has goals in addition to falling in love with the prince.

She said, ""I would never want to box someone in and say, 'If you want love, then you can't work.' Or 'If you want to work, then you can't have a family.' It's not true. It's never been true. It can be very upsetting when things get taken out of context or jokes don't land.""

The actress also denied allegations that Disney was going to update the love story for the modern era. ""The love story is very integral. A lot of people wrote that we weren't doing [that storyline] anymore -- we were always doing that; it just wasn't what we were talking about on that day.""

As she continued, Zegler suggested that her comments were taken out of context by people who want to tear down famous women. Variety stated, ""Zegler's not surprised by what she sees as people's willful misunderstanding of her comments. It's par for the course for an outspoken young woman in the public eye.""

The actress added ""I've watched women get torn down my whole life, my whole career. We'll watch it in the election that's upcoming. We're gonna witness that for a long time, I fear. Sometimes it can feel like we're going back; it certainly felt that way when that was happening.""

In addition to the ""Snow White"" controversy, Zegler also sparked outrage for an anti-Israel statement she shared to X in August.

After thanking her fans for tuning into the first trailer of the ""Snow White"" film online, she added, ""and always remember, free palestine."""

Though a notably private person, Sydney Sweeney was eager to ""set the record straight"" when it came to her relationship with fiancé, Jonathan Davino.

In a new interview with Glamour magazine, the ""Euphoria"" star, 27, opened up about the preconceived notion surrounding her decision to be with a man 13 years her senior.

""I'm a very successful, independent woman who's worked really hard,"" Sweeney, who has been sating Davino since 2018, said. ""I've accomplished and bought everything myself, and I provide for myself and my family.""

""I would love to set the record straight,"" she added. ""You can be in a healthy relationship with someone and also be very successful without needing the man. We're teammates. We're in it together. And we want to see each other succeed.""

The actress told the publication that she is secure in her decisions and proud of her financial accomplishments, which include paying off her mom's mortgage, flying her grandparents to Italy to visit her on set, and buying her uncle's dream boat for the family lake.

However, because of her upbringing, Sweeney is not naive when it comes to maintaining financial stability.

""I come from a family where I saw my parents lose everything, and I am terrified of that. That fear will always be instilled in me. I'm a huge saver. I don't just go and spend money. I like to invest. I like real estate. I like making, hopefully, smart choices with the money I'm making. But I don't think I'll ever actually feel comfortable.""

Though the couple have been engaged since 2022, their relationship faced questions as rumors surrounding Sweeney's relationship with ""Anyone but You"" costar Glen Powell circulated online.

The actress addressed the romance rumors last spring when she hosted ""Saturday Night Live.""

""[The rumors are] obviously not true,"" she said. ""Me and my fiancé produced the movie together, and he was there the entire shoot, and I just want to let everyone knows that he's the man of my dreams, and we're still together and stronger than ever.""

She said that Davino had come to ""Saturday Night Live"" to support her, but when she asked for the camera to cut to him, in a pre-planned joke, Powell was in the audience, to the delight of the crowd.

Jokes aside, Sweeney tells Cosmopolitan magazine in a recent interview that her reasoning for keeping her relationship out of the spotlight is intentional.

""I think that it's really important to keep my personal life personal,"" she told Cosmo. ""I became an actor because I loved playing characters. I loved creating stories and jumping in and learning everything that I could about other people. I never really thought that people would be interested in Sydney. I thought that they'd want to see my character, and so I want to keep it about the work.""

'Willful coverup': Democrat in key House race hit with ethics complaint that could derail campaign,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/willful-coverup-democrat-key-house-race-hit-ethics-complaint-could-derail-campaign,2024-10-05T18:38:15Z,"FIRST ON FOX: A Democratic House candidate in one of the most closely watched races in the country was the subject of an ethics complaint alleging that she had failed to act on allegations of sexual harassment and assault against a man working with her campaign.

Fox News Digital obtained a complaint filed with the state's Legislative Equality Office against Janelle Bynum, running for Congress in Oregon's 5th Congressional District, alleging that Bynum had failed to be a mandatory reporter of allegations against a man working for the PAC that staffed her State Representative campaign in 2022.

The complaint also alleged that when confronted about the alleged actions, Bynum was dismissive and even threatened the individual who had reached out to her.

""During the 2024 primary election, I was contacted by an informant with information about Rep. Bynum and her willful coverup of a sexual assault of a minor volunteer who worked for her during the 2022 cycle,"" the complaint reads.

DEM HOUSE CANDIDATE INTRODUCED 'SOFT-ON-CRIME' BILL BACKED BY DEFUND-POLICE GROUPS: 'SLAP IN THE FACE'

The complainant claims to have ""personally spoken"" with two former staff members who alleged that they had reported inappropriate sexual behavior by a field organizer ""directly"" to Bynum, along with two others associated with the campaign, ""only for nothing to be done.""

""For me, the primary issue here is that all Legislators are mandatory reporters,"" the complaint says. ""Bynum received credible information regarding one of her campaign staff sexually harassing and assaulting young volunteers, and not only did she not report it, but she also threatened to report the person who blew the whistle. . . .""

In a statement to Fox News Digital, a Bynum campaign spokesperson said, ""This attempt to smear Rep. Bynum is not based in reality. As a mom of two young women and a legislator who has spent her career advocating for others, Rep. Bynum takes this subject personally -- which is why she flagged these accusations directly to the accuser's employer, Future PAC, as soon as she was made aware of them after the 2022 election.""

""It's also why she's openly aided the Legislative Equity Office's investigation into the matter. Rep. Bynum expected Future PAC to deal with these accusations fairly and swiftly and to ensure their employees' well-being and safety. If Future PAC did anything less, that is unacceptable.""

The Bynum campaign shared an email exchange between Bynum and the Legislative Equity Office on September 20 in which the office told her she is ""not being investigated"" by the office.

However, two sources familiar with the situation told Fox News Digital that state police have conducted interviews regarding the complaint which was recently forwarded to them in the last couple of weeks. The nature and scope of that investigation is not known at this time.

Fox News Digital obtained text messages between a former Bynum campaign manager and Bynum in which Bynum appeared to show little interest in bringing attention to the alleged impropriety against her former staffer.

""I asked you not to send me anything and I meant that,"" Bynum says in a November 17th text in response to a warning from a former campaign manager about the staffer harassing women associated with the campaign. ""I really can't take anything else on my plate.""

The former campaign manager continued pressing the issue a few days later.

""While as unfortunate as this may be for you or [redacted] I am NOT siting (sic) by while someone like this gets off scott free treating young women abusively like that,"" the former campaign manager texted Bynum on November 21, 2022. ""If he gets a job down there this won't be the last you hear of it I promise.""

Bynum responds by asking, ""Are you threatening me?""

""Woah, easy there,"" the former campaign manager responds. ""I am promising you and anyone else that I am not OK with someone treating young women like that.""

""I'll consider reporting your actions,"" Bynum responded. ""Thank you for letting me know.""

In another text thread on November 14, 2022, a FuturePAC staffer says, ""It's best we handle telling Janelle"" and says we will ""certainly flag"" the concerns.

It is unclear the exact date that Bynum flagged the concerns through the appropriate channels, but two sources familiar with the situation told Fox News Digital that the accused staffer has continued to be associated with FuturePAC in the last couple of years and held a position with the Oregon State Legislature after the 2022 campaign. FuturePAC did not respond to an inquiry related to this allegation shared with Fox News Digital.

OREGON DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE PRIORITIZES LOOPHOLES OVER COMPENSATION, ADVOCATES ARGUE

Fox News Digital reviewed text messages between Bynum and a FuturePAC staffer between November 22, four days after the text exchange with the former campaign manager, and November 30 where she attempted to get him on the phone about an unspecified matter.

Two sources familiar with the situation told Fox News Digital that multiple staffers at FuturePAC, a campaign arm of Oregon House Democrats that staffs local campaigns, were aware of concerns and allegations against the individual during the campaign but told staffers it would be addressed after the campaign concluded. A spokesperson for FuturePAC denied these allegations.

""To our knowledge, during the 2022 cycle no official complaints that would have triggered [an] investigation under the contract were made regarding the staff assigned to Rep. Bynum's campaign,"" a FuturePAC spokesperson told Fox News Digital. ""FuturePAC hires and manages the campaign staff working on campaigns that we are supporting -- as such, campaign staffers are FuturePAC employees, not employees of individual candidates. We take all allegations regarding staff conduct during campaign work seriously.""

""Our union contract agreement with the Campaign Workers Guild requires official complaints and investigations to be handled through FuturePAC -- campaigns and candidates are not allowed to be responsible for investigations of any workplace conduct. To our knowledge, during the 2022 cycle no official complaints were made that would have triggered investigation under the contract.""

Rule 27 of the Oregon State Legislature says, ""Members of the Legislative Assembly ... are expected to conduct themselves in a manner that is free of harassment and to discourage all harassment in the workplace and at professional meetings, seminars, or at any event at which the Legislative business is conducted.""

Multiple state laws on the books in Oregon deal with state legislators being required to report allegations of sexual assault, specifically related to children and minors, and legislators are commonly understood to be mandatory reporters of such allegations.

Bynum drew criticism in 2019 from sexual assault survivors for voting against a bill that would have given more time for victims to sue by expanding the statute of limitations for rape.

""It's not popular to protect the accused, but it is our job,"" Bynum said at the time.

A spokesperson for the Oregon State Police confirmed they have ""received an initial complaint"" regarding the July complaint against Bynum but would not comment ""in regards to the status or scope of an investigation"" or on where the complaint they received originated.

""Janelle is the only person in this race who has been a consistent champion for the underserved and underrepresented, and she'll do what's best for Oregonians in the halls of Congress,"" DCCC spokesperson Dan Gottlieb told Fox News Digital. ""Lori Chavez-DeRemer has no business lecturing anyone about standing up for victims and survivors.""

Congressional Black Caucus PAC Senior Advisor, Chris Taylor told Fox News Digital that Bynum is not to blame for the complaint.

""Future PAC and Oregon Speaker of the House Julie Fahey ought to take responsibility for the alleged HR failures in their organization - We won't tolerate politically convenient blame shifting on the only Black woman in the State House,"" Taylor said. ""As a mother, small business owner and dedicated public servant, Janelle has a track record of delivering for Oregon and we know she'll do even more good for Oregonians when she gets to Congress.""

A spokesperson for EMILY's List told Fox News Digital that Bynum ""is a mother and a state representative who has been a steadfast advocate for Oregonians throughout her entire career.""

""Throughout this election, Republicans have shamefully tried to smear Bynum's record and this is just their latest attempt to distract from the extremist agenda Lori Chavez-DeRemer and her MAGA allies are pushing. We are proud to stand by Bynum and we are confident she will continue to stand up for Oregonians against Republican extremism.""

A source familiar with the situation told Fox News Digital that Bynum ""would have received annual training on her duties as a mandatory reporter"" making her certain of her ""obligation to report this to law enforcement"" and not to FuturePac.""

""Her dereliction of duty is not on Fahey or anyone else.""

Bynum is running against Republican Congresswoman Lori Chavez-DeRemer in a race that some experts believe could tip the balance of power in the House."

What are New York's squatter laws? Legal expert shares thoughts on what more can be done to protect landlords,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/what-new-yorks-squatter-laws-legal-expert-shares-thoughts-what-more-can-done-protect-landlords,2024-10-05T15:02:30Z,"Flash Shelton, founder of Squatter Hunters in California, shared with Fox News Digital his solution for helping to solve the issue.

New York's 2024 state budget signed into law in April included a clear definition of a ""squatter,"" but a New York City attorney believes more can be done to protect homeowners and landlords.

Several states across the country have passed laws to prevent squatting. One was Florida, where Gov. Ron DeSantis signed legislation in March 2024 that went into effect July 1.

""You are not going to be able to commandeer somebody's private property and expect to get away with it. We are in the state of Florida ending the squatter scam once and for all,"" DeSantis said during a press conference.

ADVICE FROM PROFESSIONALS ON PROTECTING YOUR HOME AGAINST SQUATTERS

In part, the law made it easier for law enforcement to intervene in squatter disputes in the state of Florida.

The law ""will give the homeowner the ability to quickly and legally remove a squatter from a property, which will increase criminal penalties for squatting. Now, we have not had the same type of issues here, as you've seen in California or New York. Nevertheless, our laws were really geared towards this not necessarily being a fad,"" DeSantis added.

True stories from those affected by squatters helped the law get passed in the Sunshine State. A woman named Patti Peeples, who had squatters in her home for 36 days, was asked to provide testimony before Florida Senate and House committees when the bill was still under consideration.

MENTAL, PHYSICAL AILMENTS CAN DEVELOP AMONG HOMEOWNERS OVERTAKEN BY SQUATTERS, ACCORDING TO EXPERT

""I'm amazed, surprised and really, really encouraged that this particular case of mine showed me and I hope shows others that our legislatures can listen to everyday citizens and sometimes actually seek to efficiently make new laws to address common everyday problems,"" Peeples previously told Fox News Digital.

After many squatter stories emerged from New York, particularly New York City, lawmakers defined a squatter in the 2024 state budget signed into law by Gov. Kathy Hochul in April in an attempt to make it easier for police to intervene.

The language defines a squatter as ""a person who enters or intrudes upon real property without the permission of the person entitled to possession, and continues to occupy the property without title, right or permission of the owner or owner's agent or a person entitled to possession,"" according to the New York Senate's website.

'PROFESSIONAL' SQUATTERS MOVE HOUSE TO HOUSE, RETAIN STATE-BY-STATE KNOWLEDGE ON THE LAW

This law came out at the same time as the Good Cause Eviction Law.

That law states ""that fair market tenants who are not regulated, such as rent-stabilized and rent-control tenants, but free market tenants, cannot be removed from possession of an apartment unless the landlord can establish either that they are exempt from the law or that they have what's called good cause, which is defined in the law to remove the tenant from possession,"" said Daniel Phillips.

Phillips is a real estate litigation partner at Belkin, Burden and Goldman who specializes in landlord-tenant disputes.

Phillips told Fox News Digital defining a squatter ""didn't change anything with laws pertaining to squatters at all.""

""All it did was give a definition of what a squatter is, basically saying that they're not tenants, which already existed,"" Phillips added.

Phillips spoke about ways he believes New York could help protect homeowners against squatters, including a clear description of what can be done if a homeowner or landlord has a squatter living on a property, such as removal by the police or utilizing self-help methods, like changing locks or turning off utilities.

""Even creating a special courtroom designated for these types of cases with an accelerated court date so that landlords can go through the judicial process faster,"" Phillips suggested. ""The law didn't do any of that."""

(Credit: KDFW)

An Uber driver was captured on video punching a 68-year-old passenger in the back of the head in Dallas after he complained about a lack of legroom inside his vehicle, a report says.

The incident involving Suleman Gauba unfolded Wednesday in the city's Design District as he and his wife called for an Uber to take them to a local Walmart, according to Fox4 Dallas.

""I cannot sit in the back seat,"" Gauba told the station, which reported that he complained to the driver about not having enough legroom in the rear of the car. ""Very small place, you know?""

Gauba told Fox4 Dallas that the driver then informed him that he was canceling his ride and asked him to get out of the vehicle.

""At that time, my wife told him, 'I'm calling the cops,'"" he said.

Surveillance footage recorded by a hotel in the area then shows Gauba and the rideshare driver stepping out of the car at the same time.

As Gauba begins walking around the rear of the car, the driver punches him in the back of the head.

""I was thinking, you know, what's happened with me? Why [did] he hit me?"" Guaba told Fox4 Dallas.

Rachel Morin's mom comes face-to-face with illegal immigrant murder suspect for first time in court,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/rachel-morins-mom-comes-face-to-face-illegal-immigrant-murder-suspect-first-time-court,2024-10-05T08:12:13Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The mother of a Maryland jogger who prosecutors say died at the hands of an illegal immigrant with a long history of attacks on women and girls came face-to-face with the suspected killer for the first time in court Friday.

Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez, 23, is accused of abducting and brutally assaulting Rachel Morin, a 37-year-old mother of five, on a running trail near her home before hiding her body in a culvert.

Martinez-Hernandez, wearing a striped jail jumpsuit, handcuffs and shackles, leaned into a Spanish-language interpreter throughout the proceedings, according to Randolph Rice, the lawyer for Morin's family. It was his first in-person court appearance after attending the others virtually.

RACHEL MORIN'S MOM CALLS OUT BIDEN-HARRIS FOR IGNORING FAMILY AFTER MIGRANT MURDER

""Seeing Victor Antonio Martinez-Hernandez enter the courtroom with a flat, emotionless expression only deepens the anguish felt by Rachel Morin's family,"" Rice told Fox News Digital. ""This is the man accused of taking Rachel's life in such a brutal and horrific manner, yet his demeanor suggests no remorse.""

He avoided eye contact with the grieving mother, Patty, other members of the family and even prosecutors.

""It's infuriating to think that if our borders had been properly secured or the DNA Fingerprint Act had been followed, this family would not be enduring this nightmare,"" Rice added. ""This tragedy was preventable, and today's court appearance is a painful reminder to America of the failures in our current immigration system that allowed this individual to remain undetected until it was too late.""

The murder suspect's arrival ""brought an overwhelming sense of grief and sadness to Patty Morin,"" who teared up as he took his place at the defense table, Rice said.

BIDEN-HARRIS OPEN BORDER POLICY FREED ILLEGAL 3 WEEKS BEFORE JOCELYN NUNGARAY MURDER, MOTHER SAYS

Martinez-Hernandez revealed in court he dropped out of school after seventh grade. When he first arrived in the U.S. illegally in 2023, he was already suspected of killing a woman in his home country of El Salvador.

Before making his way to Maryland, the border ""gotaway"" allegedly raped a California mother and her 9-year-old daughter in their home.

Martinez-Hernandez waived his right to a speedy trial and also waived a potential conflict of interest that arose due to Morin's boyfriend having once been represented by the same public defender's office.

TRUMP MEETS WITH RACHEL MORIN FAMILY AT BORDER

""Today's postponement was not unexpected. We've been preparing the family for a lengthy legal process,"" Rice said. ""The family is strong and taking this in stride, knowing that justice will take time. We remain committed to ensuring that Rachel's memory is honored and justice is served.""

After the waiver, the judge set a series of new hearing dates -- a motions hearing for Jan. 31, 2025, a pretrial conference on March 31 and a new trial date for April 1. It is expected to last two weeks.

Patty Morin traveled to Capitol Hill last month in a bid to get lawmakers to take the border crisis more seriously.

Morin told the House Judiciary Committee that if routine protocols had been followed -- like taking a DNA swab and a photo of Martinez-Hernandez when he was stopped at the border -- her daughter could still be alive.

Interpol already had a warrant for his arrest when he came to the U.S.

""I realize some of you are disinterested in this because you just think it's a partisan thing, but these are American people,"" Morin told lawmakers at the hearing. ""We need to close the borders. ... These people that are coming over the border, if they're coming over illegally, it's because they have something to hide.""

""What I would really like to come across is that I really want the American people, members of Congress, senators, presidents ... I want everyone to actually listen to our voices, listen to our words, listen to what we have to say and take it to heart,"" Morin told Fox News Digital later.

""It's hard to verbalize the message to them because they already have the mindset that this is a political thing, that you're either for immigration or you're against immigration. I don't think Americans are against immigration if it's done correctly."""
Ohio woman's viral videos about rug buried in her yard led to search for potential body,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/ohio-womans-viral-videos-about-rug-buried-her-yard-led-search-potential-body,2024-10-05T06:43:02Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

An Ohio woman shared videos on her TikTok account in which she was concerned that a body may have been buried in her yard, resulting in a police investigation of her property.

Katie Santry first shared a video early in the week that showed her and her family digging up a rug buried in the yard at their home in Columbus, and she made subsequent videos updating her followers on the situation, including that she called police to her home.

The videos racked up millions of views, and many people in her comments speculated why a rug would be buried in her yard.

Columbus Police responded to the property later in the week to investigate, but did not locate a body, according to Fox 59.

OHIO 'DANGEROUS' CHEMICAL SPILL CAUSED BY OPEN VALVE ON TRAIN CAR LEADS TO EMERGENCY EVACUATION

Santry described the events in a TikTok video as ""the most absurd, insane experience of my life.""

The investigation, which featured K-9 units and an excavation, concluded on Friday afternoon, and police collected pieces of the rug buried in the yard.

""The pieces all tested negative for human or animal remains and, at this time, there are no plans for further testing,"" police said.

An officer said it is common when homes are built for people to bury items instead of moving them to save effort. The officer said K-9 units are not always correct, but when they alert them to a spot, police have to dig to confirm if something is there.

It is also possible someone had suffered something as small as a nosebleed years ago that the dogs picked up on, an officer said.

Santry, in multiple videos, detailed her first phone call to the police. Officers who came to her home said at that time they did not plan to investigate any further.

'It all added up': Daily Mail reporter details allegations against second gentleman,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/it-all-added-up-daily-mail-reporter-details-allegations-against-second-gentleman,2024-10-05T02:12:00Z,"The Daily Mail senior reporter Josh Boswell outlines his process of investigation on 'Jesse Watters Primetime.'

Second gentleman Doug Emhoff's representative called a Daily Mail report detailing three unnamed sources who accused him of having slapped a former girlfriend during a 2012 trip to the Cannes Film Festival ""untrue.""

Fox News Digital has not been able to independently confirm the allegations.

""This report is untrue,"" an unnamed representative for Vice President Kamala Harris' husband told news outlet Semafor. ""Any suggestion that he would or has ever hit a woman is false.""

Daily Mail reporter Josh Boswell appeared on ""Jesse Watters Primetime"" and outlined the claims that Emhoff slapped his then-girlfriend in 2012.

""The process that I went through was extremely thorough and careful about this, because you're right, we're on the eve of an election, but the thing that made these sources come forward is not because there's an election, but because the Kamala Harris campaign was using Doug Emhoff, showing him as this feminist ally, baking up his credentials as an ally to women and that just enraged them,"" Boswell said.

""I quoted one of them in the piece saying this, that she thought that it was disgusting, that they were portraying him this way, when in fact, these friends knew what had really happened.""

TRUMP TARGETS BIDEN, HARRIS OVER FEDERAL RESPONSE TO HURRICANE: 'INCOMPETENTLY MANAGED'

The woman who was allegedly slapped is described by the Daily Mail as a successful New York attorney and is identified only by the pseudonym ""Jane.""

The incident was alleged to have occurred in 2012 while Emhoff and Jane were in a valet line at a Cannes Film Festival in Nice, France.

""Jane got into a cab. The valet, either with €100 that she slipped him or the fact that there was this domestic dispute going on apparently, ushered her into a car, but then Doug forced his way in too,"" Boswell recalled the alleged story. ""That's what the friends told me. That's when she got really scared. Jane called her male friend who was in New York at the time. So, it was kind of bedtime for him, but he took this call, and she told him what had happened. The next day she questioned Doug about it, and he seemed to be completely nonchalant about it. He used some tennis metaphor because he's into tennis. So, Jane slapped him back when he slapped her, and she slapped him back twice like this, one with each hand. Doug said, 'You got one down the line and across the court. So, it's no big deal.' That's all he had to say about it, and so Jane, of course, immediately broke up with him and never saw him again. They left. They went home separately. ""

The allegation was made to the Daily Mail by three people who described themselves as Jane's friends and who shared their recollections of the incident, along with travel itineraries and correspondence between Jane and Emhoff to corroborate the story. All three requested anonymity out of fear of potential retaliation from Emhoff.

""Those sources were each independently talking to us and their accounts closely corroborated each other,"" Boswell said. ""So, that's part of what gave me the confidence in this story. ""

One friend said Jane told her about the alleged incident at the time.

""He hauled up and slapped her so hard she spun around,"" the source is quoted as saying. ""She said she was in utter shock. She was so furious, she slapped him on one side, and then on the other cheek with the other hand.""

Another friend -- described by the Daily Mail as a New York businessman -- also gave his recollection of the alleged slap.

""It was very clear what she was telling me,"" that source said, according to the Daily Mail. ""She said she was with a guy, her date, she was at the Cannes Film Festival, and he hit her. She was in the car with the guy at the time.""

A third friend, described as a female executive, told the Daily Mail that she learned of the alleged incident in 2014, and purportedly found out new details from Jane in 2018, when Harris, then a senator from California, made headlines with her questioning of a Supreme Court nominee who had been accused of sexual assault.

The third source said that she had asked Jane if Emhoff had ever apologized and was told that he had not, but that ""he commented about the hit she gave him. It was a tennis metaphor. But no apology at all.""

According to the Daily Mail's sources, Jane and Emhoff had been dating for about three months before the reported trip to France. Emhoff allegedly cut the trip off early and returned to LA for his daughter's 13th birthday.

""Documents were very important,"" Boswell said. ""They helped prove that firstly, the relationship, you know, we've got this photograph of them together. We had other material like that. Then, the email actually references the fact that Doug had to leave early because he had to get back to L.A. in time for his daughter's birthday. Her birthday is May 29th. Their flight was scheduled to leave on May 29th. So, you can see that matched up. We got the flight details, and you can see they took a layover flight to take them to Nice. It all added up with what each of the sources were saying. Those sources were each independently talking to us and their accounts closely corroborated each other. So, that's part of what gave me the confidence in this story.""

Emhoff was married to his first wife from 1992 to 2009. The marriage ended following his affair with their children's nanny, who he got pregnant. Emhoff met now-Vice President Kamala Harris in 2013 when she was serving as California attorney general, and they were married in 2014.

The Harris campaign, the Office of the Vice President and a representative for Emhoff's ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, did not comment despite repeated requests from Fox News."

""Several men jumped to subdue another man in first class, who entered an altercation with the lady next to him. The flight landed 26 minutes early, but we aren't getting off soon.""

""Don't f------ touch her! Get your f------ hands off of her right now!"" one of the passengers could be heard saying to the man in the video.

""You touch her again, you're gonna get f------ arrested,"" he added.

Flight attendants soon arrived, and the woman said she was OK, but agreed to move to a seat across the aisle from her alleged attacker.

After the woman moved, she told the man who accused her of assaulting him: ""You weren't assaulted. I put my hand over your mouth to shut you up. I didn't slap you. I put my hand over your mouth.""

Minutes later, after the flight landed, an officer arrived and passengers were asked if any of them had seen him assault her. He began taking statements from those who said they'd seen the attack.

The alleged aggressor and the woman were escorted off the plane, according to the New York Post.

It wasn't clear what the man and woman's relationship was or if the man was arrested.

Fox News Digital has reached out to American Airlines and the Charlotte-Mecklenberg Police Department for comment.

""Two customers traveling together were engaged in an altercation aboard American Airlines flight 310, with service from Miami (MIA) to Charlotte (CLT) on Oct. 2."" American Airlines told the Post.

""Local law enforcement responded and escorted the customers from the CLT airport. We do not tolerate violence, and we thank our team members for their professionalism in managing a difficult situation.""

The airline wrote in the comments of Singh's post: ""Our first priority is the safety of the crew and our customers, and we take these matters very seriously."""
Will Ferrell regrets awkward Texas restaurant visit after co-star booed for trans rights toast,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/ferrell-regrets-awkward-texas-restaurant-visit-after-co-star-booed-trans-rights-toast,2024-10-05T00:09:44Z,"Will Ferrell joked that his look for the 2024 Critics Choice Awards red carpet came from Sears.

Actor Will Ferrell said he regrets his visit to a Texas restaurant after his trans co-star, Harper Steele, received an awkward response from diners.

It happened while Ferrell and Steele, a former ""Saturday Night Live"" head writer, were filming their new Netflix documentary, ""Will & Harper,"" which follows their 17-day road trip across the country ""to bond and reintroduce Harper to the country as her true self"" after Steele came out as transgender in 2022.

They received what they described as an unexpected and uncomfortable response from diners at a Texas restaurant after Steele mentioned the state hadn't done enough for trans rights, the New York Times reported.

""I'm from Iowa, but I will raise a glass to your great state of Texas,"" Steele said to a receptive audience of diners at the Big Texan Steak Ranch in Amarillo, where Ferrell and Steele planned to attempt the restaurant's famous 72-ounce steak challenge.

""I wish you guys would do more for trans rights in this state,"" Steele added, which silenced the cheers and was met with a few groans from the audience, Chron reported.

""Cheers to Texas and trans rights, right?"" Ferrell added. The toast didn't make it into the documentary, but Steele and Ferrell shared their responses to the moment afterward.

""The room started to feel very wrong to me,"" Steele said in the film. ""I was feeling a little like my transness was on display, I guess, and suddenly that sort of made me feel not great.""

""The saddest part for me is ... I just feel ... I feel like I let you down in that moment,"" Ferrell said in response.

ACTOR WILL FERRELL ASKS IF IT'S 'TIME FOR WOMEN TO RUN THE PLANET,' SAYS MALE LEADERS 'NOT DOING SO GOOD'

""I didn't really have a grasp on how intense it was going to be and felt responsible for not properly vetting the situation we were putting ourselves in,"" Ferrell told The New York Times. ""That felt like it was going to be this benign place where you eat a big steak in the amount of time, and then you walk in and it's a thousand people seated in this room and I was like, 'Oh, why are we here?'""

Steele described the feeling of being ""on display"" in that moment.

""We gave a little toast, and I said something about passing a trans bill, and the room did a kind of reversal and a little bit of a boo and a woman shouted out, 'We still love you.' I hate the phrase,"" Steele said. ""I could be misinterpreting this woman completely, but this is the feeling I had in the room: The 'still' is conditional. You still love me when I finally give up being trans and give my life over to Christ. They still love me even though I'm some kind of sinner or something. I felt that.""

'SUCCESSION' STAR BRIAN COX DISMISSES WOKE 'SHAMING' CULTURE: 'USUALLY A BUNCH OF MILLENNIALS'

""I wished I'd walked in and said: 'No. This is going to be terrible. Let's just go,'"" Ferrell said in response. ""I was feeling that remorse and guilt of even going there.""

Steele had previously criticized the New York Times in an interview with The Independent as ""generally left-leaning, but also sometimes very anti-trans. It's odd...""

""It's why I first tend to ask reporters who interview me if they believe in me,"" Steele added in that interview. ""Do they believe that I exist? That I'm valid? Because that's not always part of the conversation. I like to start there. Because there are many people in the liberal community who can't seem to get their heads around it for one reason or another.""

CANCEL CULTURE: DAVE CHAPPELLE AND OTHER COMEDIANS WHO HAVE TAKEN SIDES

Ferrell also said that ""transphobia"" comes from people ""not being confident"" in themselves.

""There is hatred out there,"" Ferrell told The Independent. ""It's very real, and it's very unsafe for trans people in certain situations.""

""It's so strange to me, because Harper is finally... her,"" he added. ""She's finally who she was always meant to be. Whether or not you can ultimately wrap your head around that, why would you care if somebody's happy? Why is that threatening to you? If the trans community is a threat to you, I think it stems from not being confident or safe with yourself.""

"Georgia mom, newborn twins killed sheltering from Hurricane Helene; twins are likely storm's youngest victims",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/georgia-mom-twin-newborns-killed-sheltering-from-hurricane-helene-twins-likely-storms-youngest-victims,2024-10-04T22:49:41Z,"Annie Meadows, whose uncle Bruce Tipton was swept away by floodwaters from Hurricane Helene, tells 'Fox & Friends First' about the catastrophic conditions that devastated communities.

A Georgia woman died alongside her twin newborn boys while hunkering down for their safety as Hurricane Helene ripped through their rural town.

Obie WIlliams discovered his daughter, Kobe Williams, 27, and her sons, Khyzier and Khazmir, after a tree fell on top of their trailer in Thompson, 120 miles east of Atlanta, causing her to fall on top of the children.

Williams said he received a call from his daughter last week as Helene battered the area. She heeded his advice and sheltered in the bathroom with her month-old babies until the storm passed. When she stopped answering her family's phone calls, Williams dodged power lines and downed trees to check on her and the boys.

""I'd seen pictures when they were born and pictures every day since, but I hadn't made it out there yet to meet them,"" Williams told The Associated Press, days after the storm ravaged eastern Georgia. ""Now I'll never get to meet my grandsons. It's devastating.""

Williams' grandsons were born Aug. 20 and are the youngest known victims of Helene, which has claimed the lives of at least 230 people throughout the Southeast.

The death toll is expected to rise as search and rescue continues to comb through new areas.

Williams described his daughter as a lovable, outgoing and strong young woman who always had a smile on her face and loved to make people laugh. She was studying to be a nursing assistant but had taken time off from school to give birth to her sons.

""That was my baby,"" he said. ""And everybody loved her.""

Williams, who lives in Augusta, said many of his 14 other children are still without power in their homes across Georgia. Some have sought refuge in Atlanta, and others have traveled to Augusta to see their father and mourn together.

"State Dept. officials hinted at Israeli 'war crimes,' pushed Gaza aid days after Oct. 7 Hamas attack: report",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/state-dept-officials-hinted-israeli-war-crimes-pushed-gaza-aid-days-after-oct-7-hamas-attack-report,2024-10-04T20:23:40Z,"Fox News correspondent CB Cotton has the latest on anti-Israel protests expected in New York on 'Fox News Live.'

Newly revealed emails show senior military officials raised concerns with the White House within days of Israel commencing its operation in Gaza.

Reuters obtained and examined emails between senior State Department and Pentagon officials between Oct. 11-14 that showed concern and alarm as Israel started hitting the Gaza Strip with missile strikes.

The emails specifically focused on the mass evacuation of Palestinians as a potential legal issue. Dana Stroul, the deputy assistant secretary of defense for the Middle East at the time, wrote to senior Biden aides Oct. 13 and warned that Israel could face war crime charges for its actions.

The emails also include pressure to include messages of sympathy for the Palestinian people and to allow more aid into Gaza while seeking to remain in solidarity with Israel.

ISRAELI MILITARY KILLS 250 HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS SINCE START OF LIMITED GROUND OPERATION IN LEBANON

Israel's invasion of Gaza has proven polarizing and painful for the Democrats. The progressive wing and younger voters are trying to hold the Biden administration to account for its support of Israel as tens of thousands of Palestinians die.

The invasion also made it difficult -- if not impossible -- for aid groups to help the displaced residents of Gaza who fled their homes to avoid getting caught up in Israel's operations.

Stroul outright alleged that Israel could be ""close to committing war crimes"" after the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) dropped leaflets over northern Gaza urging residents to flee their homes ahead of the military rolling into the territory as part of the early ""targeted incursions.""

""Their main line is that it is impossible for one million civilians to move this fast,"" Stroul wrote. One official said that such an operation was not possible without creating a ""humanitarian catastrophe.""

Three senior U.S. officials argued the White House was slow to address these problems, with Biden's team at one point arguing that the U.S. was ""leading international efforts to get humanitarian aid into Gaza,"" which would remain a ""top priority.""

Bill Russo, at the time an assistant secretary of state in the Bureau of Global Public Affairs, attempted to drive home the long-term impact of the U.S.'s ""lack of response on the humanitarian conditions"" in Gaza, calling it ""ineffective and counterproductive"" while also harming relations with Arab nations.

""If this course is not quickly reversed by not only messaging, but action, it risks damaging our stance in the region for years to come,"" Russo wrote in one email, according to Reuters. A colleague forwarded his emails to White House officials and warned that ""otherwise would-be stalwart"" Arab partners might think twice about relations with the U.S.

YAZIDI WOMAN HELD HOSTAGE FOR 10 YEARS IN GAZA RESCUED IN ISRAEL, US OPERATION

Russo eventually resigned from his post in March 2024, citing personal reasons for his decision.

Far-left voters have placed the fate of Gaza front and center of their concerns approaching November's election. The voters of Michigan started an ""uncommitted"" protest vote during the Democratic primary as a means of venting frustration at the Biden administration's handling of the crisis.

Those same voters shredded Harris for her DNC speech in August, calling it ""horrible"" and accusing Harris of ""downplaying"" U.S. complicity in the Gaza invasion by providing Israel funding and weapons.

Neither the White House, the State Department nor the Pentagon responded to Fox News Digital's requests for comment."
My friend Melania Trump is finally telling her story. Let's take a moment to hear her out,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/my-friend-melania-trump-finally-telling-her-story-lets-take-moment-hear-her-out,2024-10-04T19:04:01Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

After two decades of friendship, and as someone who had the honor to serve on Mrs. Trump's White House team for a time, I am excited that the former first lady is finally telling her story in her forthcoming book, ""Melania."" For this reason, I can no longer remain silent as many self-proclaimed ""experts"" continue to opine on her thoughts, her statements and her actions -- especially when many of them have obvious malice in their hearts and money on their minds.

The hate-Trump media industrial complex is largely a money-making endeavor attracting many longing to remain relevant, become famous, advance personal agendas, or cash in while they can.

Mrs. Trump's response to all of this -- she ignores all but the most egregious attacks -- is not surprising to those who truly know her as a woman of tremendous strength, grace and resilience, a loving and devoted mother, wife, daughter and friend.

MELANIA TRUMP OPENS UP ON RELATIONSHIP WITH HUSBAND, WHAT PREPARED HER TO BECOME FIRST LADY

Their vitriol is only likely to reach a more fevered pitch in coming days, ahead of the Oct. 8 release of Mrs. Trump's memoir, ""Melania."" Yet I remain hopeful that, with the book's publication, the public will finally have a chance to learn her story, firsthand, and come to understand the remarkable woman I am so fortunate to call my friend.

In my role as one of Mrs. Trump's advisers in the White House, I was in many of the rooms and witnessed many of the moments that have since been drastically recast in books, tweets and interviews by former staffers -- and I am aghast at the disparity between the truth I witnessed and the skewed narrative that is widely promoted.

Consider the ongoing rants of one of her former staffers, and self-proclaimed close friend, who has since worked indefatigably to promote herself while bashing Melania. After her contract with the White House was terminated, (full disclosure: my contract with the White House was also terminated at the same time) she wrote a one-sided book about her former boss. She admitted to secretly taping personal phone calls with Mrs. Trump, who was first lady at the time. An unprecedented breach of trust and civility if not ethics.

MELANIA TRUMP ON WHY THE 2024 ELECTION IS DIFFERENT: 'WE ARE DEALING WITH MUCH MORE DANGER'

Further, after leaving the White House, she began her campaign to criticize Mrs. Trump at every turn, apparently not only to sell her book but also to settle imagined personal scores. Like other former Trumpians, she apparently was positioning herself to be the go-to expert about a woman to whom she has not spoken now in more than seven years.

Examine her ongoing hateful tweets, such as opining about why Melania was not on the campaign trail with her husband last fall. When Mrs. Trump told reporters to ""Stay tuned"" about her plans to campaign, this former staffer predictably chimed in with a supposedly all-knowing tweet: ""Let me interpret this for you: DON'T HOLD YOUR BREATHE! [sic]""

How, exactly, would she know that -- or anything else about the former first lady? She was clearly so far out of the loop that she was unaware that Mrs. Trump was caring for her dying mother at the time. So much for expertise.

MELANIA TRUMP OPENS UP AFTER ASSASSINATION ATTEMPTS ON HER HUSBAND: SURVIVING BOTH WERE 'REALLY MIRACLES'

Then there is Mrs. Trump's onetime White House press secretary, who also appears to be competing to become the Left's Melania expert. This, after writing a self-aggrandizing book that attacked her former boss while auditioning for the never-Trump ""conservative"" seat on ABC's ""The View.""

This former ""insider"" is the same person who, embarrassingly, could not correctly explain to reporters in 2018 why the first lady wore a now-famous Zara designer jacket with its bold logo -- ""I Really Don't Care, Do U?"" -- on a flight to visit migrant children detained at the Texas border. This press secretary told reporters: ""It's just a jacket. There was no hidden message.""

How did she not know that the first lady was intentionally signaling to her critics with that jacket and not referring to the children? And if she had no understanding of Mrs. Trump then, while working for her, how can she possibly be considered an expert on her now when she has had no access to Mrs. Trump in years?

It took the former first lady herself to clear up the confusion and repair the damage. Melania told an ABC News interviewer that the jacket was ""kind of a message, yes,"" but one directed at her critics: ""I want to show them that I don't care. You could criticize whatever you want to say, but it will not stop me to do what I feel is right.""

Sadly, we have rarely seen any positive reporting on Melania's achievements because Mrs. Trump has seldom been recognized or credited for the important initiatives she undertook and supported during her four years as First Lady and in the years since.

As first lady, she worked to focus attention on the opioid crisis and its toll on families when visiting Lily's Place, a treatment center in Huntington, W.Va. She championed ""Be Best,"" her campaign which aimed at building children's wellness and emotional intelligence in education which included her work against cyber-bullying in schools.

Since leaving the White House, she has created ""Fostering the Future,"" to raise college scholarship funding for former foster children. Since its inception, ""Fostering the Future"" has given out scholarships to many students. You have probably heard little about it.

When consuming news, as with any other commodity, the old adage of ""let the buyer beware"" has perhaps never been more relevant.

Otherwise, we may learn that it was our freedoms and our very way of life that were actually for sale all along."
Melania Trump's pro-choice stand isn't that different from other Republican first ladies,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/melania-trumps-pro-choice-stand-isnt-different-from-other-republican-first-ladies,2024-10-04T17:11:57Z,"Former first lady Melania Trump opens up about her life before, during and after the White House in a sit-down interview on 'Fox & Friends.'

Melania Trump is not the only first lady to express pro-choice views. She joins several former Republican first ladies who have shared similar perspectives, often in their memoirs, despite this stance historically contrasting with the GOP platform.

Other spouses of Republican presidents, such as Pat Nixon, Betty Ford, Nancy Reagan, Barbara Bush and Laura Bush, have been recorded either during or after their husbands' tenure in office expressing pro-choice views.

""I feel very strongly that it was the best thing in the world when the Supreme Court voted to legalize abortion and, in my words, bring it out of the backwoods and put it in the hospital where it belongs,"" Betty Ford said in a CBS News' ""60 Minutes"" interview in 1975, two years after Roe v. Wade was handed down.

MELANIA TRUMP'S ABORTION VIEWS IN NEW MEMOIR SPUR OUTRAGE FROM PRO-LIFERS: 'SHE IS WRONG'

Following Ford's comments on premarital sex, marijuana and abortion during the CBS interview, then-President Gerald Ford reportedly joked that she had cost him votes.

As a more conservative first lady, Nancy Reagan avoided taking a public stance against abortion that would put her at odds with former President Ronald Reagan. However, she later revealed her personal position on the issue.

""I'm against abortion, I don't believe in abortion,"" Reagan said at George Washington University in 1994, five years after her husband left the Oval Office. ""On the other hand, I believe in a woman's choice. So, it puts me somewhere in the middle, but I don't know what you'd call that.""

Barbara Bush, former President George H. W. Bush's wife, was more reserved in her public statements about abortion and was at odds with her husband's anti-abortion stance. While she was not as outspoken as Betty Ford, she wrote in her 1994 memoir, ""I hate abortions, but I just could not make that choice for someone else.""

Former first lady Laura Bush, wife of former President George W. Bush and daughter-in-law to Barbara Bush, also differed with the former Presidents Bush on abortion.

""I think it's important that it remain legal, because I think it's important for people for medical reasons and other reasons,"" she said in an interview with Larry King Live in 2010.

Pat Nixon, then-President Richard Nixon's wife, told reporters during a 1972 press conference - as Roe v. Wade arguments were being considered by the Supreme Court - that she supported the right to choose an abortion, but opposed ""wholesale abortion on demand.""

Trump, wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Donald Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, she expresses a viewpoint closely aligned with that of former first ladies before her.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Trump reportedly wrote.

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The former first lady drew criticism from pro-life advocates on social media after the excerpts were published just a month away from Election Day. This year, the Republican Party's official platform also softened its language on abortion, as former President Trump also said he would not support a federal abortion ban."
"'Lies throughout': Trump-backed challenger, longtime Dem senator face off in heated battleground debate",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/lies-throughout-trump-backed-challenger-longtime-dem-senator-face-off-heated-battleground-debate,2024-10-04T14:14:11Z,"Lackawanna County, Pa., has emerged as a key battleground county this election cycle, with voters on the streets of Scranton speaking with Fox News Digital about their top issues.

Democratic Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey and Republican challenger Dave McCormick squared off in their first debate Thursday evening, less than five weeks ahead of what is expected to be one of the most closely watched races this election cycle.

Casey and McCormick took the debate stage Thursday at 8 p.m. in Harrisburg, where the two traded barbs over issues such as the economy and inflation, immigration, abortion. The race, which is rated as ""leans Democrat"" by the Cook Political Report, is expected to be one of the tightest Senate races across the country, with Casey himself acknowledging earlier this year that it will be a ""close, tough race.""

Casey has long been a Pennsylvania Democratic stalwart, first winning his election to the U.S. Senate in 2007. The Casey name also has deep roots in the state, with Bob Casey Sr., the senator's father, serving as the Keystone State's governor from 1987 to 1995, following years of serving in various other elected roles.

McCormick is an Army combat veteran and former CEO of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, who served as the Under Secretary of Commerce for Industry and Security as well as Under Secretary of the Treasury for International Affairs under former President George W. Bush's administration. Former President Donald Trump endorsed McCormick in April, lauding him as a ""a good man"" who ""wants to run a good ship.""

MCCORMICK SEIZES ON PENNSYLVANIA SENATE RACE GAP, LAYING BORDER BLAME ON CASEY

The Senate race comes as the federal election spotlights Pennsylvania once again as a key battleground state that will likely determine the outcome of the presidential election. Former President Donald Trump narrowly won the state in his successful 2016 election against former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, while President Biden declared victory in the Keystone State in the 2020 election.

As the pair squared off for the first of two debates ahead of Nov. 5, Fox News Digital compiled the top five moments of Thursday's event.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

Casey and McCormick both weighed in on the federal election, including Casey lauding Harris following his staunch support of Biden before the president ultimately dropped out of the 2024 race as concerns about his mental acuity and age mounted over the summer.

""From your perspective, who is the better candidate for Pennsylvania? Biden or Harris?"" moderator and ABC27 anchor Dennis Owens asked Casey.

""I think Vice President Harris, who's running a strong campaign, I think she'll carry Pennsylvania. It's going to be very close, just like the Senate race will be close. But she's running a strong campaign. But the people of our state have to make two basic decisions - in addition to other statewide races. They have decided in the presidential race, and they have to decide our race, and this race is very clear,"" Casey responded.

When asked whether he believes Biden or Harris would be a better president for Pennsylvania voters, Casey brushed off delivering a direct answer.

""Oh, I don't know, Dennis. I mean, we'll never know the answer to that, but the voters are gonna make a decision,"" he said.

McCormick, on the other hand, was asked if he could offer one example where he does not agree with Trump after slamming Casey during the debate for overwhelmingly voting with Biden over the last three and a half years.

FOX NEWS POLL: HARRIS, TRUMP LOCKED IN TIGHT RACE IN BATTLEGROUND PENNSYLVANIA

""[Trump] recently said that he wanted to get rid of the ban on SALT taxes, which Sen. Casey supported, too"" McCormick responded. ""Listen, that's a that's a tax break for millionaires in New York and California at the expense of PA taxpayers. So I wouldn't support that.""

""But listen, Senator Casey stood next to Joe Biden when he could hardly finish a sentence. We saw this on the debate stage, he said 'he's ready to go,'"" McCormick continued, referring to Casey's support of Biden remaining in the presidential race until Biden ultimately dropped out. ""Then Sen. Casey said, 'Kamala Harris is great. You're going to love her when you get to know her.' This is a woman who, in the last few years, says she wanted to ban fracking, legalize illegal immigration, give them federal benefits, take away our guns, defund the police. This is her position, so she's flip-flopped on everything, and Bob Casey standing there by her.""

Both candidates accused the other of ""lies"" throughout the debate, including McCormick touting a new website called CaseyLies.com, and Casey accusing McCormick of misrepresenting himself as a Pennsylvanian.

""For your viewers tonight, I have a website that's been established today, it's just been launched, CaseyLies.com. You can go and see the actual facts by third-party sources of all the things he's saying. There will be lies throughout. But you should ask yourself, 'Why is a senator with an 18-year track record, who should be able to run on his record, running his entire campaign with a negative set of attacks on me, most of them lies?'"" McCormick said towards the start of the debate.

McCormick claimed that Casey often launched ""lies"" at him during the debate because he ""doesn't have a track record"" in the Senate to run on.

Casey shot back during the debate that McCormick has misrepresented himself as a full-fledged Pennsylvanian.

""We've heard a couple of times tonight about telling lies, but probably the biggest lie told in this whole election, that probably most Pennsylvanians have never heard a bigger lie, was the lie when my opponent said he lived in Pennsylvania, when he was living in Connecticut. The Associated Press on August the 14th, 2023, did a story that proved that he was living in Connecticut,"" Casey said.

McCormick defended that he was born in Pennsylvania and has spent ""the majority of my life"" there, but also lived in Connecticut for years when he served as CEO of Bridgewater Associates.

PENNSYLVANIA SURVEY FINDS HARRIS LEADING TRUMP NARROWLY, IDENTIFIES HER 'BIGGEST WEAKNESS,' POLLSTER SAYS

The economy is among the top concerns for voters in Pennsylvania, as well as the nation at large, with both candidates outlining how they would tackle spiraling inflation if re-elected or elected to the Senate, and what they believe is behind the rise in consumers' costs.

""Prices are too high, especially when you go to the grocery store to buy food or household items, items that people need every week, or at least every other week. And these big conglomerates, these big corporations, rig those prices and jack them up to levels we've never seen, all while they're getting record profits,"" Casey said, while defending his efforts targeting corporations he has accused of ""greedflation.""

So-called greedflation is understood as corporations allegedly exploiting inflation woes by increasing prices on consumers to produce greater profits.

""We can take it on by passing a price gouging bill to go after those companies, hold them accountable,"" Casey said.

The Democratic senator also addressed his campaign against ""shrinkflation,"" which he explained as corporations shrinking products for consumers while not lowering prices.

""We did a report on shrinkflation, which covered a lot of companies around the country. And if that's happening with regard to a Pennsylvania company or any other company around the country, they should be held accountable. When they take a product, shrink the contents of the product, or what's in a bag, and don't shrink the price, that's deceptive. That's ripping people off,"" he said, adding that such companies should be held legally accountable.

McCormick shot back that higher costs on Americans in recent years is due to ""out of control spending"" at the hands of Casey and other Democrats, including Vice President Kamala Harris and President Biden.

""When you've spent your entire life in public service, elected office, 30 years, you're like a hammer looking for a nail. The cause of inflation is the policies, the out-of-control spending of Biden, Harris and Casey. Bob Casey voted 100% of the time for that $5 trillion of new spending. The experts at the time, Larry Summers, the San Francisco Fed, said this would create inflation,"" McCormick said.

""Bob Casey doesn't understand how the economy works. That's why he's trying to do all this economic voodoo stuff with price controls,"" he later charged.

Casey and McCormick were both grilled about their current abortion stances during the debate, as abortion once again sits atop many voters' list of election concerns following the Supreme Court's 2022 decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Casey positioned himself as a pro-life Democrat earlier in his career, but he voted to codify abortion protections nationwide following the overturning of Roe.

""In 2022, when the Supreme Court overturned a 49-year right, it overturned Roe v. Wade, I think everyone had to make a decision, including senators. I made a decision to support the Women's Health Protection Act. I don't support Republican efforts to ban abortion across the country,"" Casey said.

BATTLEGROUND STATE DEM DISTANCES HIMSELF FROM DEFUND MOVEMENT, BUT POLITICAL RECORD SHOWS DIFFERENT STORY

McCormick was questioned about his remarks in 2022 that he supports rare exceptions for abortion, such as when the health of the mother is at risk, and has since said that he supports additional exceptions for abortion.

""This is an extremely polarizing issue. As you know, I have six daughters, so this is something we spend time talking about. I believe this should be a state's right. I believe states should decide. Pennsylvania has had a law. It's been supported by Democrats and Republicans, like was signed into law by the Senator's father, Governor Casey. I support the three exceptions. I would not favor an abortion ban of any kind,"" McCormick responded.

Casey recently came under fire from a Pennsylvania sheriff who slammed the Democratic senator's border policies for the influx of fentanyl into the U.S., which the dad said had led to his son's death.

""We can't bring back the people we've lost. But we can get rid of the weak politicians like Bob Casey who let it happen,"" Blair County Sheriff Jim Ott said in a recent McCormick campaign ad.

Casey was asked about the sheriff's remarks during his debate Thursday.

""Mr. Casey, the Blair County Sheriff, blames you for the fentanyl death of his son, saying you have not done enough to secure the border. What is your response to that,"" Owens asked.

""I met so many families across the state, and whether it's a sheriff in Blair County or a mom in Allegheny County, Janet that I met, who talked about her daughter, Brianna, this is an awful, awful tragedy for those families. That's why we need to invest in the strategies that we know work. [McCormick] won't do that, because he's weak in the face of the political pressure from his own party. . . . We can solve this problem by investing in the technology, hiring thousands more Border Patrol, so we can inspect every single vehicle coming across the border,"" he said.

Amid the immigration debate, McCormick blamed the Biden-Harris administration and Casey for the immigration crisis at the southern border.

""The border crisis is the direct result of the weakness of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. And Bob Casey supported them every second. What chutzpah to run an ad on how tough he is on the border, when he voted against funding for the Border Patrol. He ran an ad in front of the wall that he voted against. He voted for sanctuary cities, he voted for federal benefits for illegal immigrants. And the fentanyl crisis that's come across our border is the direct result of the weakness of Bob Casey not standing up to these terrible cartels,"" McCormick argued.

The pair have agreed to another debate, next taking the same stage in Philadelphia on Oct. 15."

Women's volleyball team with transgender player getting police protection amid backlash and lawsuit,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/womens-volleyball-team-transgender-player-getting-police-security-amid-backlash-lawsuit,2024-10-04T11:09:47Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

The San Jose State women's volleyball team is getting added security in the form of police protection amid a national controversy over a transgender player on the team, according to a university spokesperson.

""I can confirm that we are using university police to provide extra security for the team at their home and away games,"" San Jose State's Senior Director of Media Relations Michelle Smith-McDonald told Fox News Digital on Thursday.

The university's police department annually documents about 60,000 incidents, arrests between 800 and 900 suspects and writes about 2,500 reports. The Police Communications Center dispatches personnel to more than 50,000 calls for service each year, according to the station's website.

However, Smith-McDonald said the department's resources are now necessary for the volleyball team due to the scale of national media attention the team has garnered in recent weeks.

""The safety of our students is our top priority. The team has been a subject of significant attention, not all of it positive, and we are ensuring their security,"" Smith-McDonald said.

The team is coming off of a loss against Colorado State on the road on Thursday, in which Blaire Fleming, a transgender female, took the court for San Jose State. Fleming transferred to San Jose State in 2022 from Coastal Carolina. As a biological male, Fleming previously set a high school record at John Champe High School with 30 kills in a match and a single-season record of 266 kills for the school's girls' volleyball team.

Footage on Fleming's Hudl page of the school-record 30-kill match in September 2019 shows how hard and fast Fleming's spikes came down at the high school level against girl opponents.

The National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA) requires transgender women to submit documentation including testosterone levels before a decision is made on their eligibility to play. San José State has said they are in full compliance with NCAA rules.

However, the program is still facing resistance in the form of a lawsuit from one of its own players over Fleming's presence on the team and in the locker room. Four other competing programs have also forfeited matches against San Jose State without providing a specific reason, after news of the lawsuit began to spread.

Brooke Slusser, a member of San Jose's women's volleyball team, joined 18 other athletes in suing the NCAA over its current gender identity policies. The lawsuit alleged Slusser, who transferred to San Jose, felt concerned for her safety after realizing one of her new teammates was transgender.

Slusser joined in the lawsuit that former NCAA swimmer and OutKick contributor Riley Gaines began earlier this year over having to share a locker room with and compete against transgender swimmer Lia Thomas, a biological male who tied with Gaines at the 2022 NCAA championships.

Slusser claimed she was not aware that Fleming was transgender despite sharing rooms together on team trips, per the court documents. Slusser also expressed safety concerns for opponents playing against Fleming.

""Brooke estimates that Fleming's spikes were traveling upward of 80 mph, which was faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball,"" Slusser's complaint read. ""The girls were doing everything they could to dodge Fleming's spikes but still could not fully protect themselves.""

GOP GOVERNOR REVEALS WHY HE ORDERED SCHOOLS TO BAR TRANSGENDERS FROM GIRLS SPORTS

The four teams that have forfeited matches against San Jose State in recent weeks are Boise State, Southern Utah, Wyoming and Utah State.

Colorado State, however, opted to play their match against San Jose State on Thursday. It just so happened to be Colorado State's annual inclusive excellence game. The University of Nevada also preemptively committed to playing San Jose State on Oct. 26, Nevada announced in a statement on Thursday.

The controversy surrounding whether Fleming should be allowed to compete and share locker rooms with women's volleyball players has resulted in impassioned arguments on both sides of the issue.

Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox have each commended the universities in their respective states, Boise State in Idaho and Utah State and Southern Utah in Utah, for forfeiting their matches against San Jose State.

""It is essential that we preserve a space for women to compete fairly and safely. Our female athletes are left grappling with this difficult issue because the NCAA has failed in its responsibility to protect female athletes and women's sports. It's time for the NCAA to take this seriously and protect our female student athletes,"" Cox wrote in a post on X.

Meanwhile, Little, who passed an executive order in his state on Aug. 28 aimed to oppose transgender inclusion in girls' and women's sports, commended his order for playing into Boise State's decision to forfeit.

""I applaud Boise State for working within the spirit of my Executive Order, the Defending Women's Sports Act,"" Little's post on X read. ""We need to ensure player safety for all of our female athletes and continue the fight for fairness in women's sports.""

Little previously told Fox News Digital in an exclusive interview that there were no incidents of transgender athletes competing in women's sports that occurred in his state that factored into his executive order prior to him passing it. Now, Boise State has ensured that trend continues.

""Obviously, a person with those kind of advantages, somebody that had competed previously in male sports and then transitioned over to compete in women's sports, that's what I'm certain the good people of Idaho think is wrong and shouldn't happen,"" Little said.

""From a national standpoint, there are radical little groups that want to implement changes in the rules that we have already. I'm confident in what we have, and we will aggressively (act), as the state of Idaho, both legally and legislatively to protect women's athletes and the great advances they've made because of Title IX.""

However, LGBTQ rights groups have advocated for Fleming's right to compete as a women's volleyball player.

LGBTQ advocacy group Wyoming Equality communications coordinator Santi Murillo released a statement on Wednesday saying, ""Athletics should be about fostering teamwork, growth and healthy competition -- not about discrimination and exclusion."" The statement was in response to the University of Wyoming canceling its match against San Jose State when it became the third program to do so on Tuesday.

New Jersey Democrat congressional candidate Sue Altman went so far as to say that women athletes in locker rooms ""aren't worried"" about transgenders competing in their sports and that biological men should be able to compete in girls' sports at the youth level.

""I promise you that in the locker rooms of women's sports teams, we're not super worried about this,"" Altman told the New York Post.

""If we decide as a society that making rules about who is and who isn't female is more important than giving young children a chance to be on teams and compete and to be part of something bigger than themselves, especially young people who are more susceptible to suicide and bullying, then I think we've lost our way a little bit."""
Wildlife lover facing charges after allegedly assaulting passersby while attempting to capture a baby seagull,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/wildlife-lover-facing-charges-after-allegedly-assaulting-passers-by-while-attempting-capture-baby-seagull,2024-10-04T09:45:17Z,"Seagulls were caught on camera trying to steal McDonald's fries through the windshield of a car in Sweden. See their desperate but failed attempts.

A Belfast woman was in court for allegedly attacking good Samaritans who attempted to free a baby seagull she captured Aug. 14.

Angela Wildman, 58, allegedly used a milk carton and a long-handled mop to attack passersby who tried freeing the waterfowl from her sports bag.

Wildman denied charges in court of common assault, possessing an offensive weapon in public, disorderly behavior and resisting a police officer, according to the BBC.

Wildman's defense attorney, Damien Trainor, said in court the 58-year-old denies being diagnosed with any mental health conditions.

NEW JERSEY MAN WHO RIPPED HEAD OFF OF SEAGULL AT PIER SPARKS OUTRAGE ONLINE: 'HORRIBLE MAN'

""[Wildman] explained to me that she feeds birds, takes birds home and looks after wildlife,"" said Trainor. ""She keeps herself to herself, feeds her birds and cleans her house, does her shopping and comes and goes.""

According to officers' testimony in court Tuesday, people who attempted to liberate the seagull from Wildman ""were assaulted by the defendant with a long-handled mop and a large carton of milk"".

One unlucky passerby was allegedly struck with both the mop and the milk carton during the Aug. 14 incident.

When officers responded in south Belfast, Wildman was allegedly aggressive and uncooperative when they tried to handcuff her.

The arresting officer argued against Wildman's application for bail in court, saying, ""I don't know that this obsession is with wanting to capture wildlife.

""The public were drawn to her attention because she had managed to capture a baby seagull and was looking after it.""

Wildman was granted bail due to the six weeks she spent in custody ahead of her court date Tuesday.

Fox News Digital spoke with Detroit, Michigan, residents about the political pulse in the city as Election Day nears in the crucial swing state.

""It got to be Trump for the whole city,"" Keandre, an east-side Detroit resident, told Fox News Digital. ""They are all voting Trump.""

One resident of St. Clair Shores in Macomb County said that he thinks the support for former President Trump and Vice President Kamala Harris is split.

""People on both sides. It's going to be a close one,"" Tom said.

Two other Detroit natives who spoke to Fox News Digital supported Harris.

NEW POLL INDICATES WHETHER HARRIS OR TRUMP IS MAKING GAINS WITH YOUNGER VOTERS

""All my friends that are Trumpers only think about themselves and we have to think about the world,"" Ron said.

""I really like Kamala Harris because she's got a lot more compassion. It's not about yourself. It's about everybody,"" he explained further.

""I think it's time for history to be made,"" Mandela said.

""I just think that it's going to be a woman president,"" he added.

A new poll released by the New York Times and Siena College found Harris had 48% support in Michigan and Trump had 47%.

Hillary Clinton narrowly lost Michigan to Trump in 2016 despite consistently leading in the polls there, making her the first Democrat to lose the state since Michael Dukakis in 1988. Joe Biden won the state in 2020.

The Trump and Harris campaigns have prioritized Blue Wall states in campaign stops throughout the summer. Trump's 2016 victory was powered by his surprise wins in Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan, which all had lengthy Democratic winning streaks until then. The winners of the past four elections have won the three states.

Michigan residents also weighed in on which presidential candidate they think would be a stronger leader.

Mandela admitted he thought it was Trump despite his support for Harris.

""I think Trump is [stronger] because I think that Trump is not going to let anybody run over us,"" he said.

When asked who was the stronger leader, Keandre said it was Harris.

""They're going to lean toward Trump because he's already been president,"" he predicted of other Detroiters.

""Not even a question. Donald J. Trump is the best leader we have to lead this nation forward,"" Jeff, a Detroit native, said.

""All of us can become better off financially under Donald Trump. Kamala has no clue about fiscal policies in this country,"" he said, before pointing to rising costs of groceries.

With the first anniversary of October 7 fast approaching, universities and college students are bracing for renewed anti-Israel demonstrations on campuses across the United States.

The anniversary of the devastating attacks by Hamas against Israel is likely to exacerbate already inflamed tensions at colleges - further heightened by Iran's unprecedented missile attack against the Jewish state.

Many anti-Israel groups are already planning demonstrations. In particular, the National Students for Justice in Palestine (NSJP) is orchestrating a nationwide ""Week of Rage"" on campuses beginning on the October 7 anniversary.

Cornell undergraduate student Amanda Silberstein suggested that while many students are focused on honoring the memory of innocent lives lost throughout the Israel-Hamas war, SJP is ""choosing to celebrate the day and glorify violence under the guise of resistance.""

JEWS PREPARE TO OBSERVE ROSH HASHANAH AS GROUP STEPS UP TO SECURE COMMUNITY AMID HUGE RISE IN ANTISEMITISM

""This overt dehumanization of Jews not only disrespects all of the victims but also incites Jew hatred on campus,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""It is disheartening to witness such a lack of empathy and understanding on a day that should be reserved for solemn reflection and unity - not for promoting hate and conflict.""

NSJP did not return Fox News Digital's request for comment.

Bela Ingber, a student at NYU, also expressed concern about her local SJP chapter. The group is staging a walkout in Washington Square Park before joining larger protests throughout the city.

She noted that NYU has an open campus, meaning student protests can snowball into much more significant events. Not only do the protests attract students, but outsiders can agitate and take advantage of students to support a larger platform.

Ingber said that she is hopeful the NYPD, in conjunction with NYU campus safety, will attempt to keep the situation under control. Still, she is ""angry, frustrated and sad"" that fellow students will ""continue to justify the murder, rape, and kidnapping of Jews.""

However, Ingber stressed that she is also empowered and motivated.

NEW YORK ANTI-ISRAEL RALLY AT UN FEATURES SIGN SUPPORTING TERROR GROUP HEZBOLLAH

""We are not going anywhere,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""We will not cower in fear and we most certainly will not be intimated. This October 7, as I mourn the innocent lives lost and pray for the brave men and women of the Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) who continue to fight, I will walk proudly and be a tribute, a public voice of remembrance, for all those beautiful souls who were stolen from us too soon.""

Other students at campuses across the country told Fox News Digital they are preparing for the worst.

University of Pennsylvania student Noah Rubin said that campus leaders are putting together a vigil for the victims of October 7. But many peers, he said, are preparing for professors and fellow students to ""glorify and eulogize"" Hamas terrorism.

He recalled how last year, an anti-Israel encampment at UPenn shouted, ""They should do it again"" while playing footage of the October 7 terrorist attacks.

Just last week, after Israel eliminated Hezbollah's terror organization leader Hassan Nasrallah, Rubin claimed that students and professors at the school organized a vigil for him and other ""martyrs"" in Lebanon.

""There absolutely should be no place on college campuses to mourn the death of terrorists - and yet that is what we expect will continue on October 7 this year,"" he said.

Harvard University student Shabbos Kestenbaum revealed to Fox News Digital that Jewish students at schools like Harvard, including Berkeley, Binghamton and the University of California-Los Angeles, have already hired and coordinated significant security operations to protect their October 7 commemorations.

While Berkeley has not released a statement on October 7 in particular, a school spokesperson told Fox News Digital that campus safety and inclusivity were addressed at the start of the semester in a video message from Berkeley's chancellor and UC's systemwide President, Michael Drake.

The spokesperson also told Fox News Digital that the school has been engaged in scenario discussions and planning.

""Student activism is nothing new on the Berkeley campus and we have established processes for planning and preparation,"" he added.

Kestenbaum called the need for security measures at several schools a ""damning indictment on the state of contemporary American higher education.""

""Many Jewish students don't feel safe because they are objectively not safe,"" he said.

Garth Brooks accused of sexual assault in latest controversy to plague country music superstar,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/garth-brooks-accused-sexual-assault-latest-controversy-plague-country-music-superstar,2024-10-04T08:33:35Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Garth Brooks is a country music icon and performer with dozens of hits and millions of albums sold, but he's now facing shocking new allegations, adding to a list of controversies he's faced over the years.

A former makeup artist for Brooks filed a lawsuit Thursday, accusing the singer of sexual assault and battery.

Brooks, 62, allegedly raped ""Jane Roe"" in 2019 during a work trip, according to court documents obtained by Fox News Digital. Per the documents, the woman was first hired in 1999 to do the makeup and hairstyling for Brooks' wife, Trisha Yearwood. She began working for Brooks doing makeup and hair in 2017, a few years before the alleged events took place.

Brooks shared a statement with Fox News Digital on Thursday, denying the allegations. ""For the last two months, I have been hassled to no end with threats, lies, and tragic tales of what my future would be if I did not write a check for many millions of dollars. It has been like having a loaded gun waved in my face,"" the statement began.

Brooks continued, ""Hush money, no matter how much or how little, is still hush money. In my mind, that means I am admitting to behavior I am incapable of -- ugly acts no human should ever do to another. We filed suit against this person nearly a month ago to speak out against extortion and defamation of character. We filed it anonymously for the sake of families on both sides.""

GARTH BROOKS ACCUSED OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND BATTERY BY HIS MAKEUP ARTIST IN NEW LAWSUIT

""I want to play music tonight. I want to continue our good deeds going forward. It breaks my heart these wonderful things are in question now. I trust the system, I do not fear the truth, and I am not the man they have painted me to be,"" Brooks' statement concluded.

""I trust the system, I do not fear the truth, and I am not the man they have painted me to be.""

-- Garth Brooks

According to the complaint, Brooks and the makeup artist traveled to Los Angeles in 2019 for a Grammys tribute to R&B singer Sam Moore. Instead of having separate rooms, ""Jane Roe"" claimed only one room was booked for the two of them to share.

""After they arrived, suddenly Brooks appeared in the doorway to the bedroom, completely naked,"" the complaint read. ""He stood there and flexed his muscles. Ms. Roe immediately had a sick feeling in her stomach, knowing she was trapped in the room alone with Brooks, with no one to help and far away from Nashville.""

The country star then allegedly raped her.

Jane Roe's complaint also accused Brooks of openly talking about sex in front of her, exposing his genitals, sharing sexual fantasies with her, texting her explicit messages and groping her breasts. He is also alleged to have taken advantage of her financial hardship at the time, with the frequency of the sexually charged interactions increasing after the 2019 alleged rape.

""We applaud our client's courage in moving forward with her complaint against Garth Brooks,"" attorneys for ""Jane Roe"" said in a statement obtained by Fox News Digital. ""The complaint filed today demonstrates that sexual predators exist not only in corporate America, Hollywood and in the rap and rock and roll industries but also in the world of country music.

""We are confident that Brooks will be held accountable for his actions and his efforts to silence our client through the filing of a preemptive complaint in Mississippi was nothing other than an act of desperation and attempted intimidation. We encourage others who may have been victimized to contact us as no survivor should suffer in silence.""

The new allegations against Brooks are by far the most shocking, but he's had his share of controversy throughout his multidecade career.

In 2023, Brooks drew backlash after he entered the fray about Bud Light and its partnership with transgender activist and TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney.

Brooks opened The Friends In Low Places Bar & Honky Tonk in Nashville, Tennessee, and spoke about his plans for the bar in an interview with Billboard, which include selling ""every brand of beer.""

""I want it to be a place you feel safe in. I want it to be a place where you feel like there are manners and people like one another. And, yes, we're going to serve every brand of beer. We just are. It's not our decision to make,"" Brooks said during a panel for Billboard Country Live. ""Our thing is this: If you [are let] into this house, love one another. If you're an a--hole, there are plenty of other places on lower Broadway.""

While some fans were supportive of Brooks, others were vocal in their disapproval of his comments and decision to sell Bud Light.

""If you live in Tennessee, I recommend you never go to @garthbrooks new bar. They're going to sell Bud Light and apparently he thinks we're 'a -- holes' if we don't like it. Make sure all your friends know that,"" one person wrote on Twitter.

Another spoke of getting rid of a collection of Brooks' music, noting, ""My trash bin is full...I threw out everything that had Garth Brooks name on it.""

""I was a huge fan of yours back in the early nineties, before you fell into the trap of being a star...,"" a third wrote. 'It was always about your fans. Now, we're, 'a--holes' for boycotting Budweiser? Welcome to the boycott.""

Brooks has been happily married to fellow country icon Trisha Yearwood for nearly two decades but has admitted he wasn't always the ideal partner.

""I sucked at being a husband. I was horrible at it. I was horrible at being a dad. I had to get my s--- together,"" Brooks told Billboard in 2023.

Before his marriage to Yearwood, Brooks was with his first wife, Sandy Mahl, from 1986 to 2001. They have three daughters together: Taylor, August and Allie.

""I was on the front page of the USA Today for being a bad husband and man,"" Brooks recalled. ""I'd have never survived that if there had been social media, ever.""

In his ""Garth Brooks: The Road I'm On"" documentary, Mahl spoke about the toll the singer's career took on their marriage.

""He'd be gone eight to 10 weeks at a time. He'd come home, [and] there would be No. 1 parties, or shows, or CMAs, or ACMs, American Music Awards. So, it was constantly going. But we both grew apart really, really quickly,"" Mahl said.

""I don't think either of us had stopped to think about how this would change our lives,"" she later added.

In a 2020 interview with Fox News Digital, Brooks said Mahl's perspective surprised him but gave him a greater understanding of their past.

""I heard things from her that she told me our whole life, but I didn't hear them until now,"" he said. ""And so my respect and love for her is through the roof for what she went through and how she's handled it as well.""

Brooks and Mahl finalized their divorce in 2001, and the ""If Tomorrow Never Comes"" singer married Yearwood in 2005.

The couple initially met in the late 1980s but were married to other people and did not pursue a relationship until they were both single.

""I was lucky enough to get to marry my best friend,"" Brooks told Fox News Digital. ""So, here you go. We've known each other since 1988 or '87, and so we've kind of been through it all together. And we've talked about this a long time. If we would have gotten married back in the late '80s, I don't think our marriage would have survived the '90s or our careers would not be what they were.

""So, I think everything happens right at the right time,"" he added. ""And if she was the mother of the children, our three children wouldn't be who they are either. They got the right amount of their mom in them, the right amount of me in them and the right amount of Trisha's influence in them as well. So, I think everything happens for a reason at a time. And I think she would probably tell you the same thing.""

GARTH BROOKS, TRISHA YEARWOOD'S NASHVILLE HONKY-TONK PUT THEIR RELATIONSHIP TO THE TEST WHILE WORKING TOGETHER

Brooks released his song ""The Thunder Rolls"" in 1991, with lyrics alluding to cheating and abuse. An additional verse, omitted from Brooks' version but later added by country star Tanya Tucker in her version, also alludes to the wife in the story seeking revenge through murder.

For the music video, Brooks played the part of the cheating and abusive husband, with scenes that hint at the fourth verse's contents. According to the 2009 book ""The Garth Factor: The Career Behind Country Music's Big Boom"" by Patsi Bale Cox, Brooks' label screened the music video for a group of women who approved of the content and considered it a powerful statement against domestic violence.

The violent nature of the music video got it banned by The Nashville Network (TNN) and CMT. A representative for CMT at the time said the network was ""in business to entertain, not to promote or condone gratuitous violence or social issues,"" according to the book.

At the time of the video's controversy, Brooks told Entertainment Weekly, ""This is real life. Where I'm from, people aren't afraid to talk about it.""

Despite the controversy, Brooks won the CMA video of the year award later that year.

In 1992, in the wake of the Los Angeles riots, Brooks released ""We Shall Be Free."" The song imagines a world where people are free from hunger, homelessness, homophobia and racism and have both freedom of religion and speech.

The following year, Brooks was set to perform the national anthem at that year's Super Bowl. He also had an agreement with NBC to air the music video for ""We Shall Be Free"" before the game.

The network initially refused to air the video, which included intense imagery, such as the KKK burning a cross, flag burning, violent incidents, starving children, as well as positive imagery of people coming together.

Brooks reportedly left the stadium 45 minutes before he was to perform. According to his 2019 A&E documentary, ""Garth Brooks: The Road I'm On,"" Brooks felt the network was making excuses for not airing the video.

NBC reportedly looked for a last-minute replacement but ultimately agreed to air the video, and Brooks performed ""The Star Spangled Banner"" as planned, accompanied by Oscar winner Marlee Matlin performing the song in American Sign Language.

According to former NFL Executive Director Don Weiss' book, ""The Making of the Super Bowl: The Inside Story of the World's Greatest Sporting Event,"" Brooks' walking out resulted in the requirement that all Super Bowl renditions of the national anthem be prerecorded.

Brooks celebrated the 25th anniversary of the song in 2017 with an updated music video released on his Facebook page.

""I didn't think it would be controversial, but when this song first came out, it was not welcomed with opened arms,"" Brooks told People in 2017. ""I guess I'm always surprised because, I guess, I'm just one of those ignorant guys who thinks that everybody kinda feels the same and, man, we don't.""

After 10 years of dominating the charts, Brooks unexpectedly presented his alter ego, Chris Gaines.

Gaines was a fictional rock musician from Australia with dark hair and a soul patch. The character appeared in a mock episode of VH1's ""Behind the Music,"" and there was even a potential Chris Gaines biopic. When Brooks hosted ""Saturday Night Live"" that year, he appeared as himself but performed as Gaines as the episode's musical guest.

An album was released, ""Garth Brooks in...The Life of Chris Gaines,"" put together as a greatest hits of Gaines' previous (and nonexistent) five albums. Despite the confusion created by the character, Brooks scored a Billboard Top 40 pop single with the song ""Lost In You.""

In a recent interview during Billboard Country Live, Brooks said he still loved the character and was interested in doing more with Gaines.

""The Gaines project was a lot of time put in because it's not natural. You're acting on a record, but I want to do it simply for people who love the Gaines project,"" the 61-year-old said.

""And, selfishly, I love the Chris Gaines record. So, I want to do it for me. It challenged me as a vocalist,"" added Brooks. ""So I don't know when we're going to get to it, but it's on the list."""
"Serial killers hide as long-haul truckers to terrorize America's highways, expert says",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/serial-killers-hide-long-haul-truckers-terrorize-america-highways-expert-says,2024-10-04T08:24:04Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Serial killers could be working as long-haul truckers in the United States.

The FBI launched its Highway Serial Killings Initiative in 2009 after analysts noticed a pattern of murdered women - most living transient lifestyles involving drug abuse and prostitution - who had been killed and dumped along the Interstate 40 corridor in Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas and Mississippi, according to its website.

Using the Violent Criminal Apprehension Program, which is a national database between law enforcement branches that contains information on homicides, sexual assaults, missing people and unidentified human remains, analysts amassed a list of hundreds of victims along highways nationwide and hundreds of suspects, predominantly long-haul truckers.

FBI'S 'FLAWED' CRIME DATA HIGHLIGHTED BY CHICAGO'S 118 'MISSING MURDERS': EXPERT

Frank Figliuzzi, a former assistant director of the FBI who spent 25 years with the agency, released a book this year on the subject, ""Long Haul: Hunting the Highway Serial Killers.""

In the book, he writes that there have been approximately 850 murders along America's highways since 1980, and that about 200 of them are unsolved.

""Oftentimes, the people who are at the highest risk for being kidnapped or harmed by a serial killer are the people who are the most invisible, the least likely to have connections to their families and may or may not have a trafficker,"" said Dominique Roe-Sepowitz, the director of Arizona State University's Office of Sex Trafficking Intervention Research.

""The casual reference [to a woman selling sex at truck stops along interstate highways] is a 'Lot Lizard.' They are often very transient and often suffer from substance abuse disorders. They are very likely to not be missed, to be easily lured in by a truck driver with some money,"" she said. ""It's a low level of screening and a low level of personal safety.""

ALABAMA PLUMBER ALLEGEDLY TRIED TO HIRE HIT MAN TO KILL WIFE, 6 ADULT KIDS: 'TAKE YOUR TIME'

There are between 300,000 and 500,000 long-haul truckers in America, NPR reported, and the majority of them are upstanding workers committed to keeping the supply chain moving.

But the mobile nature of truckers' lifestyles and the multiple jurisdictions that they travel through lends itself to a scarcity of witnesses and a lower chance of getting caught should they pick up, murder and dump vulnerable sex workers and transients.

""There are 25 long-haul truckers already in prison for multiple murders,"" Figliuzzi told NewsNation. ""There have been cases in the greater Cincinnati and the larger Ohio area.""

DOJ INSPECTOR GENERAL DOES NOT DENY FBI INFORMANTS WERE AMONG JAN 6 CROWD

The program led to the capture and arrest of suspects believed to be responsible for homicides across the country, according to the FBI's website.

Supervisory Special Agent Richard J. Kolko of the FBI's National Press Office told Fox News Digital last week that the program is ""no more,"" but he did not divulge specifics of the program's results or what led to its closure.

Roe-Sepowitz said the halted program is ""just one more cut in a very bleeding situation where women who are vulnerable are simply not being seen.""

""It's one more way that people can take advantage and participate in violence against girls and women,"" she said. ""There is no national tracking of traffickers.""

""Without that unit at the FBI level, that interstate level, there is nothing that is connecting those crimes,"" she continued. ""This is a loss for intelligence. They won't see the patterns because who else is looking for them? The answer is no one.""

Roe-Sepowitz noted that most long-haul truckers are certainly not serial killers or sex traffickers. In fact, one group called Truckers Against Trafficking has trained 235,329 truckers to spot and intervene in human trafficking situations, according to its website.

""Truckers are not always villains,"" Roe-Sepowitz said. ""They can be part of the solution. They can look out for victims. They can help rescue people. They can be part of our caring, loving community. But something needs to change."""
"South Carolina killer mom Susan Smith, who drowned sons, up for release as experts sound alarm",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/south-carolina-killer-mom-susan-smith-who-drowned-sons-up-for-release-experts-sound-alarm,2024-10-04T08:14:07Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Susan Smith, the South Carolina mother who drowned her two young sons in a lake in the 1990s, is up for a parole hearing in a month.

Smith, then 22, strapped her sons, Michael and Alexander Smith, into the back seat of her car in October 1994, and watched as she let the car roll into John D. Lake in Union County. It took six minutes for the two boys, one 3 years old and the other just 14 months, to drown.

""She spent nine days claiming that the carjacker had taken the kids and asking for help, so the search was going on,"" former Union County prosecutor Tommy Pope, now a South Carolina state representative, told Fox News Digital. ""Truthfully, I believed she probably had [the kids] hidden somewhere just because, based on my law enforcement experience, I didn't think that a carjacker would take children.""

Specifically, Smith lied to investigators and the press after killing her sons, falsely claiming a Black man had carjacked her with Michael and Alexander inside the vehicle.

MURDEROUS MOM SUSAN SMITH TOLD SUITOR IN JAILHOUSE CALL SHE IS 'READY TO GO' AHEAD OF PAROLE HEARING: REPORT

""She was on every major station, 'Good Morning America,' you name it, she was doing it, and she was pleading for the kids,"" Pope recalled. ""The one thing I saw from the beginning - I had some video footage from a local TV station that actually went to the house that she went to that night when she claimed she was carjacked. And [Smith's] husband, David, was called to the scene. And of course, he looked like someone who was just told his kids had been kidnaped. And Susan was kind of giddy about being on television. I think she really loved the attention.""

SUSAN SMITH, NEARING PAROLE AFTER MURDERS OF YOUNG SONS, SAYS SHE'D BE 'GOOD STEPMOM': REPORT

As far as a motive, Pope said Smith was having an extramarital affair at the time with Tom Findlay, the son of a local, wealthy business owner, who wrote Smith a letter a week before the murders telling the 22-year-old woman that while he was interested in her romantically, he was not suited to raise children, as the Birmingham News reported in a 2005 interview with Findlay.

That letter would become a key piece of evidence in the prosecution's case.

""I don't think he meant to tell her to get rid of her children. I just think he was trying to break up with her because he lost interest. And I think she took it to heart because she envisioned a life of luxury with a rich person,"" said Andrea Peyser, a New York Post columnist who reported on the murders in 1994 and authored a book about the case called ""Mother Love, Deadly Love: The Susan Smith Murders.""

Meanwhile, over the course of her 30 years in prison, Smith, now 52, has reportedly engaged in a sexual relationship with prison guards, a prison source said in an interview with People in 2020.

""She's not having a horrible time behind bars.""

-- Andrea Peyser

Pope sought the death penalty for Smith during her trial in 1995, and he does not think she should be eligible for parole today.

""Some of the jurors, after the fact, even said they gave her life under the theory she would be remorseful and spend her time thinking about Michael and Alex. Well, she has proved from her conduct in prison that she's had sexual relations with guards, she's got Facebook friends and sugar daddies waiting for her to get out,"" Pope said. ""She is focused on what's best for Susan, not what happened to Michael and Alex.""

Peyser also does not believe Smith should be eligible for parole, given her lack of remorse or ownership for her actions during her three decades behind bars.

""She had caused so much damage, she led to the investigation of all kinds of innocent men. It's unfair in every way. She's just a really sad and horrible person,"" Peyser said.

Peyser described the town of Union as ""slightly insane"" at the time she was covering the case.

""She was, of course, a woman who grew up there, lived there most of her life, and the town kind of embraced her while blaming her husband, who is really blameless in this situation. So the whole thing was really horrible,"" Peyser recalled.

(FOX 13 Seattle)

A Washington state woman was stalked and robbed at gunpoint at an ATM amid a continued crime crisis raging on the West Coast.

Surveillance video, obtained by FOX 13, showed the robbery taking place by a Bank of America in Parkland, Washington, a suburb of Seattle, on Thursday, Sept. 26.

The footage captured a figure in a ski mask hiding in the shadows as an unsuspecting woman arrives at the bank and goes about withdrawing money from the ATM.

After the woman had withdrawn her money, the suspect emerged from the bushes and approached the woman, holding her up at gunpoint and demanding her money.

SEATTLE BUSINESS OWNERS WARN VIOLENT CRIME IS HAPPENING ON A NEAR HOURLY BASIS: 'THIS IS MADNESS'

The Pierce County Sheriff's office said that the ski-masked suspect retreated - along with the $1,000 and the victim's passport.

""It's a random act of violence,"" Sergeant Darren Moss of the Pierce County Sheriff's Department said.

""That makes him extremely dangerous to our community,"" he said. ""We want to get this person in custody because we don't want him to do this to someone else.""

The ATM robbery comes after local business owners have voiced their continued concerns about the crime crisis.

Pat Callahan, the CEO of Urban Renaissance Group, told the Business Journal that while there has been some improvement, the crime problem is still yet to be solved. He claimed that many tenants at his downtown property are considering leaving the area.

""Really, what's happening now is all the fentanyl use is bringing consistent crime to the area, and it's festering,"" he said.

URG Executive Vice President Shawn Jackson echoed his sentiments and told the outlet that conditions have become ""somewhat extreme."" He revealed that one individual recently started a garbage truck fire near the company's Joshua Green Building.

""These are property damage events that happen quite frequently,"" he said. ""We can't let the challenges of several concentrated blocks in our downtown define our identity.""

Commercial real estate broker Tom Graff said the current approach to crime is not working and is ""not sustainable.""

The business leader's sentiment comes as the number of violent crimes in downtown Seattle fell by 10% in 2023 from 2022. It was the lowest number since 2018.

Utah State is fourth school to forfeit women's volleyball match amid San Jose State trans player controversy,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/utah-state-becomes-4th-school-forfeit-womens-volleyball-match-amid-san-jose-state-trans-player-controversy,2024-10-04T00:53:14Z,"Macy Petty, a Concerned Women for America legislative assistant and an NCAA college volleyball player, discussed the controversy with San Jose State University's volleyball team.

The Utah State Aggies are the latest women's volleyball team to choose not to participate in a scheduled match against San Jose State University due to a biological male playing on its women's team.

The university issued a statement saying it would not be participating in its Oct. 23 volleyball match at SJSU.

""The University will abide by Mountain West Conference policy regarding how this match is recorded,"" the statement said.

A San Jose State spokeperson also confirmed to Fox News Digital that the Aggies informed the team the match has been canceled, and Utah State will be assessed a loss due to forfeit.

Utah State would be the fourth team to forfeit a match with SJSU if it's made official. Southern Utah, Boise State and the University of Wyoming all did so. None of the three schools previously provided a reason behind the forfeit other than understanding the consequences to their win-loss records.

When Boise State forfeited its match with SJSU, the NCAA provided OutKick with a statement in response.

""College sports are the premier stage for women's sports in America, and the NCAA members will continue to promote Title IX, make unprecedented investments in women's sports and ensure fair competition for all student-athletes in all NCAA championships.""

FEMALE ATHLETES 'BLINDSIDED' ON VOLLEYBALL COURT WITH TRANS PLAYER PROMPTS CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLAINT, LAWSUIT

Blaire Fleming, a transgender redshirt senior at SJSU, has been at the center of the controversial forfeits. SJSU is undefeated this season, and Fleming, at 6-foot-1, has helped the Spartans in their efforts.

Brooke Slusser, Fleming's teammate, joined former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines and other female athletes who are suing the NCAA over policies regarding transgender athletes, claiming the current system is compromising the fairness and integrity of women's sports and putting women at risk.

Gaines said she commended Boise State's athletic department and everyone involved in the decision to forfeit its match, and she praised Utah State when seeing the statement before it was taken down.

""This kind of unity is what I (and many others who have worked far longer than me) have been pushing for over the past two years,"" Gaines tweeted. ""The gender ideology house of cards is crumbling, and it's a glorious sight.""

Speaker of the Utah House of Representatives Mike Schultz also commended the Utah State and Southern Utah women's volleyball teams.

""We stand behind you and are cheering you on!"" he wrote on X. ""Thank you for standing up for not only yourselves, but for women across the country - current and future generations! It's time for the NCAA to take action to protect our female athletes and preserve women's sports. Thank you to the athletes and the universities for doing what's right!""

Macy Petty, a Concerned Women of America legislative assistant and NCAA volleyball player, spoke with Fox News Digital's Sarah Rumpf-Whitten about how players are feeling ""blindsided"" because the NCAA has not informed teams of the presence of transgender players on opposing squads.

""There's no informed consent for the schools or for the female athletes here. They're totally blindsided when they walk up to the court, and they see that there's a male athlete on the other side,"" Petty said.

""Female athletes were put in this odd position of showing up on the court and looking at the other side and realizing that something was different about this game. I've never seen an athlete play like this before, which makes total sense considering that this athlete, first of all, is not female, but the net is seven inches shorter than it should be for male players.""

Slusser said she joined Gaines and others in the lawsuit against the NCAA because she was not aware Fleming was transgender despite sharing rooms together on team trips.

Former first lady Melania Trump is drawing heat from pro-life advocates over an excerpt in her memoir where she suggests a woman's right to choose an abortion is a ""fundamental right of individual liberty,"" according to a report Wednesday.

Melania Trump wife of Republican presidential candidate and former President Trump, wrote the memoir entitled ""Melania"" that is scheduled to come out on Oct. 8, per the Amazon release date. In the book, according to a preview by The Guardian, Melania expresses a viewpoint that has historically been at odds with the Republican Party's platform.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Melania reportedly wrote.

TRUMP RISKS LOSING SOME PRO-LIFE VOTERS UNLESS HE CHANGES 'HIS TUNE' ON ABORTION, ACTIVIST WARNS

""Why should anyone other than the woman herself have the power to determine what she does with her own body? A woman's fundamental right of individual liberty, to her own life, grants her the authority to terminate her pregnancy if she wishes.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life.""

The excerpts quickly drew the ire of pro-life advocates who have already been disgruntled by some of Trump's seemingly ambiguous comments regarding abortion.

""Melania Trump's support of abortion is anti-feminist and clearly outside the teaching of our Catholic faith. She is wrong,"" wrote Kristan Hawkins, president of Students for Life of America advocacy group.

""Who is this Melania Trump, or Kamala Harris? Functionally the same exact position on abortion,"" Rose wrote on X.

In August, Trump sparked confusion among pro-life supporters about where he stood on an amendment that would upend Florida's ban on abortions after six weeks' gestation. Trump, after saying ""I think the six-week is too short, there has to be more time,"" to an NBC reporter when asked how he would vote, later walked it back and said he would vote against the amendment.

Veteran in subway vigilante case wasn't told he killed madman threatening passengers during interrogation,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/veteran-subway-vigilante-case-wasnt-told-he-killed-madman-threatening-passengers-during-interrogation,2024-10-03T20:37:02Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

An NYPD detective testified in court Thursday that the New York veteran accused of manslaughter in connection with the death of an erratic man who barged onto a subway car and threatened passengers had not been told the man had died when he waived his Miranda rights and agreed to speak with detectives.

Lawyers for Daniel Penny, a 25-year-old Marine Corps veteran, told Fox News Digital there is ""overwhelming evidence that Danny was justified in the actions he took to protect the commuters on that train."" They are questioning whether police had probable cause to detain him and whether statements prosecutors plan to use against him at trial were properly obtained.

Penny was charged after he appeared on cellphone video placing Jordan Neely, 30, in a chokehold as other passengers helped restrain him in May 2023.

The defense called NYPD investigators to the stand Thursday to grill them about whether there was probable cause to arrest their client to begin with.

KEY WITNESSES IN DANIEL PENNY, JORDAN NEELY CASE REFUSE TO COOPERATE WITH DA BRAGG'S OFFICE: REPORT

Penny had not been told that Neely was dead during his questioning, NYPD Detective Michael Medina testified. He and a colleague let Penny go after interviewing other witnesses. They initially dubbed him a ""good Samaritan.""

Medina, a 23-year member of the NYPD, was the first of five officers involved in the investigation to testify Thursday.

Penny was treated as a witness during the interview and was not placed in handcuffs, he said. Their conversation was recorded on video. Penny waived his Miranda rights. There was another detective, whose last name is McCarthy, in the room with them.

Prosecutors played video from the interview in court Thursday.

It shows Penny calmly cooperating with the detectives, explaining that he's a Marine veteran and studying to be an architect. He said he was on his way to the gym after class at the time of the altercation.

According to testimony at the Thursday hearing, Neely barged onto the train after the 10th Street station, ripped his jacket off and threatened to ""kill anybody,"" he said.

""He was acting like a lunatic, like a crazy person,"" Penny told detectives. He said after Neely tossed his jacket, he shouted something along the lines of, ""If I don't get this, this and this, I'll go to jail forever.""

There were women and children on the train, and Penny perceived a threat. When Neely walked into him, he said, he put him in a chokehold.

""I'm not trying to kill the guy,"" he told detectives. ""I'm just trying to de-escalate the situation.""

He said that two other men on the train helped him hold Neely down as they waited for police to arrive.

""People do this all the time, but this guy, he was actually a threat,"" he told the officers. Medina and McCarthy told him he would be detained for the time being, and he asked for a lawyer.

A public safety officer testified that when he arrived at the train, he saw Neely unconscious on the ground and asked what happened. The witnesses pointed to Penny, he said, identifying the defendant in the courtroom.

He said witnesses told him that Neely boarded the train, began making threats, and Penny ""took him out."" Bodycam video showed Penny remained at the scene and cooperated with responding officers.

Neely was unconscious when police arrived but had a pulse, the public safety officer testified. However, responding officers later tried giving him CPR and administered Narcan, a heroin antidote used to revive people during overdoses.

The next witness was Officer Dennis Kang, a 5-year veteran who also responded to the train car and met Penny at the scene. He said witnesses described Neely as ""erratic"" and said Penny was ""stopping"" him. Other people on the train appeared to be supportive of Penny, he said.

The judge said he would not be releasing video played in court Thursday to the media because the trial has not yet begun.

Penny's lawyers are arguing that police had no cause to arrest him, and they are questioning whether any statements they intend to use against him were improperly obtained.

""The Government must demonstrate that any statements they intend to use at trial were not obtained through coercion or threats,"" one of his attorneys, Steve Raiser, told Fox News Digital earlier. ""In addition, they will need to prove that probable cause existed to believe that a crime was committed. Our position will be that despite the low level of evidence necessary to demonstrate probable cause, the police did not have sufficient evidence. This is especially true considering the overwhelming evidence that Danny was justified in the actions he took to protect the commuters on that train.""

Witnesses said the homeless Neely was threatening subway riders and behaving aggressively. He had a history of mental illness and violence, including the 2021 assault of a 67-year-old woman.

Police questioned and released Penny on the day of the incident, but 11 days later, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg's office announced an indictment on charges of manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. He has pleaded not guilty.

Critics of Bragg's decision to prosecute Penny have called the move political and believe that the veteran acted in self-defense and to protect other passengers.

""I don't care if I have to kill an F, I will,"" Neely had allegedly ranted. ""I'll go to jail, I'll take a bullet.""

Prosecutors said last year that they had obtained at least five eyewitness videos of the encounter and surveillance video they planned to introduce as evidence.

Penny faces up to 19 years in prison if convicted. His trial was slated to begin before the end of the month."

The other co-hosts also had their theories about the former first lady's stance, given that former President Trump expressed support for the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade.

Co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin agreed that it was a ""strategic"" move.

""I think she hates him. Okay, so we can all agree that. That's a given. I also think that she wants to take him out. She does not want to be the first lady anymore. She doesn't want to be the first lady. She destroyed the Rose Garden. Who hates Christmas? Melania Trump hates Christmas. She doesn't want to decorate for Christmas. She doesn't want anything to do with him. She doesn't want to sleep in the same room with him. She can't tolerate him,"" Hostin suggested.

The audience applauded Hostin after she claimed that Melania wanted to take out her husband.

Whoopi Goldberg chimed in to say ""allegedly"" following Hostin's statements.

""I really think that this is her way of undercutting his bid for the presidency because then she doesn't have to deal with him anymore,"" the host added. ""I think that she wants to take him out and she's doing a pretty damn good job with that.""

The former first lady wrote in her memoir that a woman's fundamental right of ""individual liberty"" grants her the right to have an abortion if she wishes.

""It is imperative to guarantee that women have autonomy in deciding their preference of having children, based on their own convictions, free from any intervention or pressure from the government,"" Melania wrote, according to reports.

""Restricting a woman's right to choose whether to terminate an unwanted pregnancy is the same as denying her control over her own body. I have carried this belief with me throughout my entire adult life,"" she continued.

Emhoff denies report he slapped ex-girlfriend outside ritzy overseas movie event,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/emhoff-denies-report-he-slapped-ex-girlfriend-outside-ritzy-overseas-movie-event,2024-10-03T19:27:11Z,"MSNBC host Jen Psaki asked Second Gentleman Doug Emhoff about redefining the view of masculinity by openly supporting his wife Vice President Kamala Harris.

Second gentleman Doug Emhoff denied the veracity of a Daily Mail report in which three unnamed sources accused him of having slapped a former girlfriend during a 2012 trip to the Cannes Film Festival.

Fox News Digital has not been able to independently confirm the allegations.

""This report is untrue,"" an unnamed representative for Vice President Kamala Harris' husband told news outlet Semafor. ""Any suggestion that he would or has ever hit a woman is false.""

The Daily Mail's exclusive story on Tuesday quoted a trio of unidentified sources who claim Emhoff slapped his then-girlfriend while the couple waited in a valet line following an event in Nice, France, in 2012. The alleged altercation was purportedly sparked when the woman - identified only by the pseudonym ""Jane"" and described as a successful New York attorney - flirted with a valet, according to the article.

The Harris campaign, the Office of the Vice President and a representative for Emhoff's ex-wife, Kerstin Emhoff, did not comment despite repeated requests from Fox News.

Several media outlets, including Semafor, noted they had been unable to match the Daily Mail's reporting and legacy media companies such as the New York Times have yet to report on the claims.

The Daily Mail's article hinged on the recollections of three people described as being Jane's friends. The outlet said its sources requested anonymity due to fear of retaliation from Emhoff. The three friends reportedly provided the outlet with a photo of the pair when they were still a couple, as well as itineraries and correspondence between Emhoff and Jane to substantiate that they made the trip to France in May 2012.

One of the sources is described by the Daily Mail as a female New York attorney who learned about the alleged incident from Jane.

""He hauled up and slapped her so hard she spun around,"" the source is quoted as saying. ""She said she was in utter shock. She was so furious, she slapped him on one side, and then on the other cheek with the other hand.""

Another friend, described by the Daily Mail as a New York businessman, told the outlet Jane called him sobbing following the alleged incident.

PROGRESSIVE WOMEN'S GROUPS SILENT ON SECOND GENTLEMAN DOUG EMHOFF'S AFFAIR

""It was very clear what she was telling me,"" that source said, according to the Daily Mail. ""She said she was with a guy, her date, she was at the Cannes Film Festival, and he hit her. She was in the car with the guy at the time.""

The male friend said he learned more details about the alleged episode after the initial phone call.

""It was something like 3 a.m. They were trying to get out of there and they both had been drinking. There was a gigantic line for taxis,"" he told the outlet. ""She went up to one of the valet guys, offered him 100 euros or whatever, to get to the head of the line. She told me she put her hand on his shoulder. Doug apparently thought that she was flirting, and came over and slapped her in the face.""

A third friend, described as a female executive, told the Daily Mail that she learned of the alleged incident in 2014, and purportedly found out new details from Jane in 2018, when Harris, then a senator from California, made headlines with her questioning of a Supreme Court nominee who had been accused of sexual assault.

""[She] is a gorgeous, strong woman and you would never expect somebody to hit her,"" the third friend told the Daily Mail. ""When he hit her she hit him back, like, 'Don't you ever do that again,'""

The third Daily Mail source added: ""I asked her if he ever apologized. She said 'no,' but he commented about the hit she gave him. It was a tennis metaphor. But no apology at all.""

All three friends told the outlet that Jane hit Emhoff back after the alleged initial slap. They also claimed that Jane tried to leave the valet area after the alleged slap, but that Emhoff got into a cab with Jane.

Jane and Emhoff had been dating for about three months before the reported trip to France, according to the friends. Emhoff allegedly cut the trip short and returned to the U.S. for his daughter's birthday at the end of May, and never saw Jane again, the friends told the outlet.

Emhoff's alleged relationship with Jane unfolded after his 2008 divorce from his first wife and before his 2014 marriage to Harris.

The New York Post on Wednesday slammed Emhoff as ""Worst Gentleman"" in its cover story detailing the Daily Mail's article.

Emhoff is fresh off of a Sunday sit-down interview on MSNBC during which Jen Psaki celebrated him as having reshaped ""the perception of masculinity.""

""There is also an important, interesting part about how people have talked about your role is how your role has reshaped the perception of masculinity,"" Psaki said. ""I'm not sure you planned on that, but you are an incredibly supportive spouse. Has that been an evolution for you? Do you think that's part of the role you might play as first gentleman?""

Emhoff responded: ""It's funny. I've started to think a lot about this. I've always been like this. My dad's always been like this. To me, it's the right thing to do, support women. It is mutual with Kamala and I. We support each other, we have each other's back.""

DOUG EMHOFF'S EX-WIFE RESPONDS AFTER SECOND GENTLEMAN ADMITTED TO AFFAIR WITH NANNY

He added: ""I've said many times when we lift up women, we support women, whether it's pay equity, child care, family leave, and all of these issues in this post-Dobbs hellscape. Women should not be less than. Women should not have less rights and be treated differently. That's not the American way.""

Clips of the exchange spread like wildfire on social media as critics noted that, in August, Emhoff admitted to having an affair with his family's nanny during his first marriage years ago.

Emhoff's admission came shortly after the Daily Mail published a separate report in August claiming that he got his daughter's nanny pregnant.

The affair occurred before Emhoff's relationship with and eventual marriage to Harris.

""During my first marriage, Kerstin and I went through some tough times on account of my actions. I took responsibility, and in the years since, we worked through things as a family and have come out stronger on the other side,"" Emhoff said over the summer, acknowledging the affair, but not naming the nanny.

Emhoff and his first wife were married from 1992 to 2008 and share two adult children. Harris married Emhoff in 2014, and helped co-parent his children, who call their stepmom ""mommala.""

An Arizona man who set fire to a cabin in the Grand Canyon National Park where his ex-girlfriend was staying was sentenced last week to nearly two years in prison.

Dahntay Dunbar, 21, a Flagstaff resident, was arrested in May after he broke into her locked cabin and set a fire inside, the Department of Justice said Tuesday.

Federal prosecutors said that Dunbar had found a bottle of clear liquor and dumped it on a bed before igniting a shirt belonging to his former girlfriend. She was not in the cabin at the time.

""The bed started to burn, and Dunbar left the cabin,"" a DOJ statement said. ""The fire caused scorching, burn damage, and smoke damage to the walls, ceiling, and other parts of the cabin.""

The university believes the Pictish ring means the ""painted ones.""

The Harpole Treasure refers to a collection of relics that was discovered in Harpole near Northampton in 2022. Among the treasures discovered was a unique gold necklace that archaeologists called ""the most ornate of its kind ever found,"" according to The Museum of London Archaeology's (MOLA) July 2022 news release.

The necklace was one of many finds that came out of an ancient burial site. The gorgeous necklace dates back between 630 and 670 A.D., according to MOLA.

The unique piece features many different pendants, which includes beads, glass pendants and Roman coins.

At the center of the necklace sits a rectangular pendant, decorated with a cross motif. While pendants in female burials aren't particularly uncommon, according to the press release, the variety of pendants adds to this particular find's uniqueness.

""Suddenly we had a rubbish pit that turned into a burial beyond burials,"" Paul Thompson, MOLA project manager, said, per the BBC in 2023.

""It's a once in a lifetime experience to be working on something like this,"" he went on to say.

Other finds unearthed from the ancient burial site were two decorated pots, as well as a shallow copper dish and a large ornate cross.

The necklace, paired with the other grave goods that were found, label the find as ""one of the most spectacular female Early Medieval burials ever discovered in the UK,"" per MOLA's press release.

""It wasn't just one or two items. That would have been incredible in its own,"" Thompson told The Washington Post in 2022. ""We have here the only complete example of this type of necklace excavated in modern archaeological standards.... It's an asymmetrical set-out of the gold coins, and the precious stones mounted in gold, which we haven't seen before.""

Though the identity of the woman who was buried with these goods remains an untold story, archaeologists do believe that the person was of high status, possibly an early Christian leader.

""Christianity provided a way for women to gain independence and power in their own right, by enabling them to run monastic houses, so we see an increase in elite women using Christianity as a means of increasing their status,"" Emma Brownlee, an archaeologist at the University of Cambridge, told The Washington Post in 2022. ""In this burial, we're seeing a particularly fine example of that process.""

In December 2023, MOLA released a second news release about the incredible find, sharing that the 30 pendants and beads making up the necklace had been cleaned and, at the time of writing, continued to be examined by specialists to learn more about their origins.

There have also been further developments regarding the human remains at the site.

When the grave goods, including the necklace, were found in 2022, it was believed that only a few fragments of the woman's teeth remained, according to the press release, but further investigation has led to the finding of more fragments, including the upper part of a femur, some vertebrae, part of a hand and wrist, plus part of the pelvic bone, per the press release."

A Yazidi woman held captive by Islamic terrorists for the last decade has been reunited with her family in Iraq following her escape and safe evacuation on Oct. 1 in a coordinated effort between Israeli and U.S. officials, the State Department confirmed to Fox News Digital on Thursday.

Fawzia Amin Sido, now 21, was just 11 years old when she was kidnapped by ISIS terrorists before she was sold and trafficked into Gaza, where she was forced to marry an alleged Hamas fighter.

Amin Sido was apparently able to escape after her captor was killed in what was believed to have been an Israel Defense Forces (IDF) strike, enabling her to flee to a ""hideout"" within the Gaza Strip.

CHILDREN ONCE HELD HOSTAGE STILL WORKING THROUGH TRAUMA: 'ARE THEY COMING FOR US AGAIN?'

""In a complex operation coordinated between Israel, the United States, and other international actors, she was recently rescued in a secret mission from the Gaza Strip through the Kerem Shalom Crossing,"" the IDF said in a statement Thursday. ""Upon her entry into Israel, she continued to Jordan through the Allenby Bridge Crossing and from there-returned to her family in Iraq.""

The operation was led by the IDF's Coordination of Government Activities in the Territories unit along with help provided by the U.S. Embassy in Israel, as well as other international actors, though the IDF did not detail who.

""Her story is heartbreaking, and we are glad that she will be reunited with her family in Iraq,"" a spokesperson for the State Department told Fox News Digital. ""As Secretary [Antony] Blinken has noted, '2,600 Yezidis remain missing and unaccounted for. We are determined to find them, to learn their fates, and to rescue those who remain alive'.""

The IDF said the coordinated trafficking efforts in Amin Sido's case are ""further evidence of the connection between the terrorist organization Hamas and ISIS.""

WHY NO ISIS MEMBER HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH GENOCIDE OR SEXUAL VIOLENCE FOR CRIMES AGAINST YAZIDIS

ISIS attacked Yazidi populations in the northern Iraqi town of Sinjar in August 2014, abducting some 6,400 people and killing another 1,200, according to a report by the Times of Israel.

Roughly half of the abductees have reportedly been able to escape or have been freed.

The growing ties between ISIS and other terrorist organizations like Hamas signify a growing shift in the Middle East in which extremist groups, despite prior differences, are increasingly expanding ties, often facilitated by the backing of Iran.

The IDF vowed to continue to counter the ""Hamas-ISIS terrorist organization"" by striking terrorist-based infrastructure sites and pledged to ""free all hostages in Hamas captivity.""

There are still 101 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza, including seven Americans, most of whom were taken during the Oct. 7, 2023 attacks, though four of them were abducted in 2014 and 2015.

This figure does not include other Yazidi abductees mentioned by Blinken who may also be being held in Gaza."

Sherrod Brown on his Inflation Reduction Act vote in a new ad that's part of a $25 million new buy ahead of Election Day.

The 30-second ad spot, which will run on television and digitally, opens with a single mother from Versailles, Ohio, saying she can't believe the current prices for groceries.

""It's a lot tougher to provide for my kids with the Democrats' inflation,"" the woman, Carla, says. ""Sherrod Brown's only made things worse. Brown supported Kamala, not us, and voted for her radical Inflation Act, and now prices are at a 40-year-high. Bernie Moreno will fight to lower prices and stop inflation. That's why I trust Bernie Moreno to help Ohio families.""

The ad, first obtained by Fox News Digital in advance of its planned roll out, also includes the message on screen: ""Sherrod Brown voted for Kamala's Inflation Act.""

It was paid for by Bernie Moreno for Senate and the National Republican Senatorial Committee.

""Hardworking Ohioans are suffering under the record-high inflation created by Kamala Harris and Sherrod Brown,"" Moreno said in a statement to Fox News Digital. ""While he claims to fight for Ohio, families are unable to afford basic necessities. In November, we will send him packing and get our economy back on track.""

Moreno's campaign told Fox News Digital that the ad is part of an additional $25 million in spending. It comes just 33 days before the Nov. 5 election. Early voting in Ohio starts Oct. 8.

The contest is on track to be the most expensive Senate race this cycle, with $310.4 million in spending from both campaigns as of August, according to Axios.

As of August, Moreno shelled out $158.4 million and Brown spent $152 million, Axios reported.

Brown's campaign announced Wednesday it will report raising nearly $31 million in the third quarter.

Fox News has labeled the race between Moreno and Brown as a toss-up.

Fox News Digital reached out to Brown's campaign and congressional office for comment about the new ad but did not immediately hear back.

Ohio is center stage on the presidential ticket this cycle with Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, as former President Trump's vice presidential running mate. Moreno ran against Vance in the 2022 GOP Republican primary for Senate, which Vance won, and has supported the Trump-Vance bid for the White House.

In August 2023, on the one-year anniversary of President Biden signing his Inflation Reduction Act into law, Brown's campaign issued a statement championing the legislation as having included ""key priorities Brown fought for to save Ohioans money, crack down on Wall Street stock buybacks, and attract investment and good-paying jobs to Ohio.""

""The Inflation Reduction Act is already saving Ohioans money at the pharmacy counter and spurring Ohio to lead the country in manufacturing the technology of the future - and those cost savings and Ohio jobs will only grow in the coming years,"" Brown said in a statement at the time.

""Taylor's great. Taylor's her own woman. And like, if Taylor wants to participate with us on theme nights, of course, we welcome it,"" he told the outlet.

California man learns sentence for killing UCLA graduate student Brianna Kupfer in brutal stabbing attack,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/california-man-learns-sentence-killing-ucla-graduate-student-brianna-kupfer-brutal-stabbing-attack,2024-10-03T15:31:24Z,"Former U.S. Assistant Attorney General Nathan Hochman joined 'Fox & Friends' to discuss the latest on the trial as the suspect is accused of stabbing the victim 26 times.

A California homeless man found guilty of brutally stabbing to death a UCLA graduate student inside a boutique furniture shop was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole on Wednesday.

Shawn Laval Smith, 34, was convicted in September for the gruesome murder of Brianna Kupfer, a 24-year-old architectural graduate student, on Jan. 13, 2022.

The sentence was handed down after Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Mildred Escobedo reviewed reports from doctors and determined Smith was sane at the time of the murder, FOX11 Los Angeles reported.

Kupfer was working alone at Croft House in Los Angeles' Hancock Park neighborhood when Smith, a homeless man with a long criminal history, entered the store and stabbed her 26 times during an unprovoked attack.

WHO IS BRIANNA KUPFER, THE LOS ANGELES STABBING VICTIM?

Kupfer suffered 11 stab wounds to the chest, two in the abdomen, one to the pelvis, two on her right arm, five on her left arm, two on her right leg and three on her left leg. Security cameras showed Smith at the store and his DNA was found on the knife, prosecutors said.

Smith was arrested six days after Kupfer's murder.

During the trial, prosecutors argued that Smith went ""hunting for a woman alone"" on the day of the murder, having approached six other stores before finding Kupfer working alone.

Moments before her death, Kupfer had sent a text to a friend that said she was getting a ""bad vibe"" from someone inside the store, authorities have said.

BRIANNA KUPFER SENT PAL OMINOUS TEXT BEFORE SHE WAS STABBED TO DEATH

The friend said they saw the message about 15 minutes later, although police said Kupfer was killed within 10 minutes of sending it. A customer found Kupfer dead inside the store.

Kupfer's family remembered the 24-year-old as someone who always worked to better herself and her community.

""In many ways, [Brianna] embodied everything that is great about Los Angeles, and the entire city should grieve over this senseless act,"" the family said in an earlier statement.

How data brokers are fueling elder fraud in America,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/tech/how-data-brokers-fueling-elder-fraud-america,2024-10-03T14:09:50Z,"Many of these calls were made by scammers, often promising to eliminate your taxes.

Elder fraud is a growing concern in the United States, with criminals increasingly targeting individuals over the age of 60.

Increasingly, data brokers have been identified as a favored tool among criminals, providing access to personal information that criminals use to improve their scamming schemes.

Using data from the FBI for the calendar year 2023, researchers have found that economic losses from scams continue to increase. In addition to financial loss rising over time, scam complaints have risen for the first time since 2020. Americans over the age of 60 lost over $3.4 billion to scams in 2023 alone. They reported more than 101,000 scams, representing a 14.5% increase compared to the 88,000 reports filed in 2022.

More than 17,000 tech-support scams were reported in 2023, which is also nearly the same number as reported in 2022. Behind tech-support scams were personal data breaches, which were reported 7,800 times in 2023.

WHAT IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (AI)?

BEWARE OF SOCIAL SECURITY SCAMS BY CROOKS TRYING TO TRICK YOU

Researchers found that elder abuse scams were made possible by personal data being available online. This happens largely thanks to data brokers, which are large companies that make money by selling personal information for the purpose of advertising.

So what can you do about it? Invest in personal data removal services. While no service promises to remove all your data from the internet, having a removal service is great if you want to constantly monitor and automate the process of removing your information from hundreds of sites continuously over a longer period of time.

As elder fraud continues to rise, it's crucial for seniors and their families to be proactive in safeguarding personal information and recognizing potential scams. Here are some additional actionable strategies to help mitigate the risks.

1. Monitor financial accounts regularly: Set up alerts for any unusual activity on bank accounts and credit cards. Review statements monthly and consider using financial management apps that can help track spending and detect anomalies.

2. Use strong, unique passwords: Create complex passwords that combine letters, numbers and symbols. Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays. Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords.

3. Enable two-factor authentication: Two-factor authentication adds an extra layer of security by requiring a second form of verification.

4. Limit sharing personal information: Be cautious about the information you share online and over the phone. Scammers often use social media to gather details about potential victims. Adjust privacy settings on social media accounts to limit who can see your information.

5. Verify before trusting: Always verify the identity of anyone requesting personal or financial information. Use official contact numbers to confirm the legitimacy of the request.

6. Be skeptical of unsolicited calls, emails or messages: Never click on links or download attachments from unknown or suspicious sources because they may contain malware or phishing attempts. The best way to safeguard yourself from malicious links that install malware, potentially accessing your private information, is to have antivirus software installed on all your devices. This protection can also alert you to phishing emails and ransomware scams, keeping your personal information and digital assets safe. Get my picks for the best 2024 antivirus protection winners for your Windows, Mac, Android and iOS devices.

7. Report suspicious activity: If you suspect a scam, report it to local authorities or organizations like the Federal Trade Commission. Early reporting can help prevent others from falling victim to the same scam.

8. Stay connected with family and friends: Regular communication with loved ones can help reduce feelings of isolation, which scammers often exploit. Encourage seniors to stay socially active through community groups, clubs or regular family gatherings. Also, be sure to check out five ways tech can help you feel less alone.

Missing Missouri mother's remains found 6 months after mysterious disappearance,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/missing-missouri-mothers-remains-found-6-months-after-mysterious-disappearance,2024-10-03T12:43:00Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out whats clicking on Foxnews.com.

The body of a missing Missouri mother of four who mysteriously vanished six months ago has now been identified after being found in a wooded area on Saturday, according to the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office.

Authorities say that the identity of 33-year-old Emily Strite was confirmed through medical and dental records after her skeleton remains were found in the De Soto area by a Frissell Road property owner. De Soto is about 45 miles southwest of St. Louis.

Her cause of death has yet to be determined and investigators say they are working to piece together how exactly her remains ended up there.

MISSOURI WOMAN FOUND DEAD DAYS AFTER GOING MISSING, PICKED UP AT HOSPITAL BY SHERIFF'S DEPUTY

Strite had not been seen since April 12 when she left a friend's house on foot and is believed to have left her own free will, the Jefferson County Sheriff's Office said in a prior press release. She was reported missing eight days later by her mother, Charlyn McClain.

McClain tells NBC her daughter's body was found close to the house where she was staying.

McClain says she last spoke to her daughter that morning over the phone where the 33-year-old said she was planning on visiting three of her younger children who live with their father, Steve Fults, over the Missouri border in Cahokia, Illinois.

""We only talked for about a minute and she said, 'I'm going to go see my kids.'"" McClain told NBC News.

McClain told NBC that whenever her daughter went to see her children, Fults would either pick her up himself or send someone to get her. ""That was pretty routine. So my assumption was, 'Well, she's at Steve's now, and she's staying there,'"" McClain told the outlet.

Strite's sister, Jess Strite, claimed to Fox2Now in June that Emily was ""in and out of an abusive relationship for most of her adult life"" with Fults and that her sister was not actively in a relationship with him at the time she went missing, but was in contact with him.

McClain says that on April 19, a week after she spoke to ger daughter, she received an alarming phone call from Fults, who said he hadn't heard from Emily in a week, sparking panic.

""He has never called me and questioned anything about Emily or to tell me anything about Emily,"" McClain told NBC. ""That's why I panicked when he called me because he had never done that before.""

NBC says it spoke to Fults via text in which he said the last time he saw Emily was at the end of March or beginning of April and said he was unaware she had plans to visit the kids. ""I had no knowledge of emily [sic] wanting to see her kids April 12th because she didn't call me!"" he wrote, per NBC.

He told the outlet his relationship with Emily ended in 2022 and that their relationship revolved around their three kids. He described Emily as a ""strong courageous woman and a great mom.""

The Jefferson County Sheriff's Office, per NBC, says that there are currently no suspects or persons of interest because there is nothing at this time to indicate foul play or that a crime was committed.

As the investigation continues, Emily's friends paid homage to the mother of four and say they want answers.

""She literally lit up a room every chance that she got."" Amanda Bauman, Strite's childhood friend, said, per Fox2Now. ""We pray now that we get answers and whoever hurt her is brought to justice.""

Bauman's sister, Christi Bauman, added that Emily always sought to help her friends.

""Even if she was down, she was going to lift you up,"" Christi Bauman said, per Fox2Now."
Virginia school board to pay 'wrongfully fired' teacher who refused to use student's preferred pronouns,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/virginia-school-board-pay-wrongfully-fired-teacher-who-refused-use-students-preferred-pronouns,2024-10-03T10:51:36Z,"Tammy Fournier said she and her husband did not go along with school district's ""affirmative care"" model, so they removed her daughter from the district and she later desisted from her gender dysphoria

The Virginia-based West Point School Board agreed to pay a former high school teacher $575,000 in damages and attorney's fees after he refused to call a transgender student by their preferred pronouns.

""I was wrongfully fired from my teaching job because my religious beliefs put me on a collision course with school administrators who mandated that teachers ascribe to only one perspective on gender identity -- their preferred view,"" Peter Vlaming said.

""I loved teaching French and gracefully tried to accommodate every student in my class, but I couldn't say something that directly violated my conscience,"" he added. ""I'm very grateful for the work of my attorneys at Alliance Defending Freedom to bring my case to victory, and hope it helps protect every other teacher and professor's fundamental First Amendment rights.""

MAX INCLUSIVITY: HARRIS CAMPAIGN IS LETTING NEW HIRES ID THEMSELVES WITH CUSTOM PRONOUNS

The settlement stems from a lawsuit filed by Alliance Defending Freedom against the school board in September 2019.

Vlaming, who taught French at West Point High School for 7 years, lost his job after the board made the unanimous 5-0 decision to fire him.

Vlaming said he could not comply with the school district's policy to refer to students with pronouns inconsistent with their biological sex.

According to the ADF,""Vlaming tried to accommodate the student by consistently using the student's new preferred name and by avoiding the use of pronouns altogether.""

However, school officials were obstinate that Vlaming used the student's preferred pronouns and also to use them ""even when the student wasn't present,"" ADF claimed.

JESSE WATTERS: TRUMP'S RUNNING AGAINST A WOKE WOMAN AND A PROGRESSIVE VP

""Peter wasn't fired for something he said; he was fired for something he couldn't say. The school board violated his First Amendment rights under the Virginia Constitution and commonwealth law,"" ADF senior counsel Tyson Langhofer said.

Several months before Vlaming's court victory, the Virginia Supreme Court reinstated this case after it was stuck down in a lower court. Per the Virginia Mercury, the King William Circuit Court ""did not believe Vlaming had any valid reasons for the law to accept his suit.""

""However, the Supreme Court determined in December that the school board violated Vlaming's rights,"" the outlet reported.

The board did not immediately respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment.

The settlement comes after Republican Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin updated ""model policies"" regarding the treatment of transgender students, claiming that the previous ""guidelines disregarded the rights of parents."""
Texas man suspected of aggravated robbery and threatening to cut off woman's finger arrested,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/texas-man-suspected-aggravated-robbery-threatening-cut-off-womans-finger-arrested,2024-10-03T10:31:38Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

Police in the Dallas Metroplex have arrested a suspect believed to be part of a group of four men who allegedly forced a woman to the ground, tied her up, threatened to cut off her fingers and then walked away with more than $75,000 worth of cash and items from her home.

Manuel Hernandez-Hernandez, 28, was arrested in Colleyville on Monday and is being held on an immigration hold at the Dallas County Jail, according to an arrest affidavit.

Hernandez-Hernandez had been arrested and released in Colleyville 10 days earlier, but the arrest report didn't state what those charges were.

The arrest affidavit states that a woman pulled into her driveway in Dallas on Sept. 21, and was approached by four unknown men when she got out of her vehicle. It states she was forced to the ground by gunpoint, then forced into her home and eventually tied up with pieces of clothing in her bedroom.

She told police that the men spoke Spanish and used Google Translate to communicate with her, threatening to cut off her fingers if she didn't tell them the location of her safe.

Documents say the men fled with $75,000 in cash, the woman's phone, a Gucci purse and several coins from a wooden box.

The men allegedly took her to a bathroom and told her to wait at least 10 minutes before moving. She made it several minutes before making her way to the neighbor's house, where she called the police.

The affidavit says the woman still had some of the clothing tied to her, and that she refused transport to a hospital for medical observation.

Investigators say the woman's house was ransacked and that Hernandez-Hernandez's fingerprints were identified from the wooden box which contained the coins.

The woman was shown a lineup of men but told police she didn't remember any of their faces.

Police found video footage a few days later showing a possible suspect's vehicle and two unknown suspects approaching the woman's garage about the same time of the purported incident.

News of the incident led to social media posts claiming the men were members of the Tren de Aragua gang from Venezuela, but so far no evidence supports that.

""There is no evidence at this time to indicate that Hernandez-Hernandez is a member of the Tren de Aragua gang from Venezuela,"" the Dallas Police Department wrote in a response. ""This remains an active investigation.""

Watch: Pro-Israel influencer recovers West Bank interview with Palestinian woman he was threatened to delete,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/pro-israel-influencer-recovers-west-bank-interview-with-palestinian-woman-that-he-was-threatened-to-delete,2024-10-03T09:09:30Z,"Zach Sage Fox traveled to the West Bank to see if Palestinian people truly support the Hamas terror group, but he almost didn't make it out alive.

Comedian and pro-Israel influencer Zach Sage Fox believes an interview he filmed in the West Bank could show Americans how Palestinian civilians truly feel about Jewish people - but it took him months to recover the footage after he was threatened to delete it.

Fox has been on a crusade to educate his followers since the terror attacks of October 7. He went viral earlier this year when his ""Gaza Graduation"" video featured anti-Israel protesters in New York City struggling to correctly answer basic questions about the Israel-Hamas war and decided to take his popular man-on-the-street style interviews to the West Bank, a contentious territory that Palestinians hope to establish as an independent state along with the Hamas-controlled Gaza Strip.

Fox, a ""loud and proud"" Jewish American, told anyone who asked that he was an Italian American and was able to cross the border into the West Bank without issue, because Israelis and Jewish people are not welcomed in the region.

INFLUENCER WENT TO THE WEST BANK TO SEE IF PALESTINIANS SUPPORT HAMAS - HE ALMOST DIDN'T MAKE IT OUT ALIVE

Fox found several people walking West Bank streets who were quick to express support for the Hamas terror group and declared Israeli hostages should not be released, but things got dicey when he tried to interview a woman whose hair was fully covered. A ""very upset"" Palestinian man approached him and asked him to delete the footage.

""They're not used to anybody questioning their narrative that they've been brainwashed to believe. And you can see it ... I'm interviewing that girl just for several minutes and these men watching it, they can't even accept that you would be asking questions because it's not a free society,"" Fox told Fox News Digital.

Fox recalled the man yelling ""something about modesty,"" and that females shouldn't speak for all Palestinians. Fox attempted to ignore the man, but he only grew more agitated and started calling additional Palestinian men for support. He explained that he caved and deleted the footage when his Muslim cameraman said the angry group was threatening their lives.

Fox initially enlisted a team of IT specialists who were able to recover some of the footage, and every interview that was salvaged made the viral ""Wild West Bank"" video. But his conversation with the woman who sparked the conversation remained lost.

""Dozens of cyberhackers,"" additional IT specialists and even an Israel Defense Forces veteran with a passion for technology all tried unsuccessfully to restore the video. Fox was beginning to lose hope, but was eager to show the world what this woman had to say because she was ""emblematic of the mindset"" in the region.

She was ""clearly educated"" and spoke perfect English, dressed in designer clothes and said she was an engineer. Yet, she believed all Zionist should be killed.

FOX NEWS MEDIA DRAWS 10.4 MILLION FOR SIMULCAST OF THE CBS VICE PRESIDENTIAL DEBATE

Another technology expert caught wind of the story and offered to help recover the video. Fox thought it was impossible and was reluctant to set himself up for further disappointment but eventually said ""f -- k it"" and gave them a shot.

""A week later I got a call that they recovered almost all of it. It was a miracle,"" Fox said.

Fox then watched the footage and ""couldn't believe his eyes.""

""To see that interview back after three months was insane... I didn't know when my cameraman stopped filming, so I didn't realize, one, that you could see the men starting to pull the other men in the into the thing. I didn't realize you could see that behind me,"" he said.

""I also didn't realize that my cameraman kept the camera going long enough so that you actually saw the people cut the camera off and stop the shoot,"" Fox added. ""So, that was like wild to me.""

Fox then published ""Wild West Bank: Deleted Scenes Exploded,"" allowing the world to see the footage the angry Palestinian men tried to scrub.

VIRAL INFLUENCER ZACH SAGE FOX PUT SPOTLIGHT ON CLUELESS ANTI-ISRAEL PROTESTERS: 'NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING'

In the shocking video, the woman told him that most Palestinians support Hamas, she proudly declared being ""really satisfied"" with footage Hamas terrorists took on Oct. 7. She also denied Hamas killed babies and women during the attack and said no Israelis are ""innocent civilians."" She suggested she is a ""refugee"" despite her family living in the West Bank for multiple generations and flatly dismissed a two-state solution. Along the way, Fox politely pushed back on antisemitic claims and absurd talking points.

""I am an educated person, it's either us or us,"" she said when suggesting Jewish people need to leave Israel for good. When Fox told her there would ""never be peace"" with that mindset, she fired back, ""It's their problem.""

As a man began lurking in the background, Fox asked if she believes Zionists deserve to die.

""Cut, cut real quick,"" the man said. ""What side are you on?""

Fox calmly responded that he was simply asking questions, but the man demanded to know where he was from.

""I'm from the states,"" Fox answered as the man demanded the cameraman stop recording.

The video abruptly cuts off.

NETANYAHU RESPONDS TO HEZBOLLAH ATTACK THAT KILLED CHILDREN AT SOCCER FIELD: 'THIS WILL NOT GO UNANSWERED

Fox feels ""vindicated"" that he was able to share the footage.

""I just think this girl is really representative of how these people think,"" Fox said.

""I feel bad for her, I know that sounds crazy cause she's literally sitting there saying everyone who I love deserves to die,"" he continued. ""But my takeaway is that she's the perfect example of somebody who's not stupid. She's an engineer, she's a smart girl, but she's been brainwashed by the propaganda they're taught in Palestine.""

Earlier this year, the Department of State urged Americans to avoid the West Bank because of ""terrorism and civil unrest.""

Fox remains one of the only Americans to enter the West Bank and try to ask tough questions, but he doesn't believe State Department warnings are the thing keeping America journalists out of the region.

""I genuinely think that they know deep down, whether they want to admit it or not, that they would find... it totally negates their narrative, which is that, you know, 'Hamas is bad, but the Palestinians are separate,'"" Fox said.

""I wish that was the case. I truthfully didn't believe it myself until I went there that day,"" he added. ""They love Hamas."""

A Connecticut man has been arrested after allegedly assaulting a pregnant woman while attempting to steal her vehicle.

The East Haven Police department released a statement Wednesday following a report of an attempted carjacking in a Dunkin' Donuts drive-thru.

The incident occurred on Tuesday, October 1 when William Rodriguez, 28, pulled into the parking lot directly in front of the victim's car, according to authorities.

Rodriguez then allegedly exited his vehicle and climbed into the passenger side of the woman's car and demanded her keys. When she refused to surrender her keys, Rodriguez then began punching the woman, who was four months pregnant, before she could escape the vehicle and run inside the restaurant to seek help.

An employee working inside the drive-thru witnessed the assault and notified two coworkers, who then ran outside and restrained Rodriguez, who was attempting to flee in the victim's vehicle, according to the police statement.

When officers arrived at the scene, Rodriquez continued to struggle and after being taken into custody he bit a medic's hand.

The vehicle in Rodriguez's possession at the time of the assault, a 2016 Hyundai Elantra, had been reported stolen previously.

Rodriguez faces multiple charges of Breach of Peace, 2nd Degree Assault on Emergency Medical Personnel, Robbery in the 3rd Degree, Reckless Endangerment in the 2nd Degree, Assault on a Pregnant Person, Assault in the 3rd Degree, Interfering with an Officer and two counts of Larceny of a Motor Vehicle.

Democrat House candidate says women aren't worried about transgender athletes in their sports locker rooms,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/democrat-congressional-candidate-claims-women-athletes-arent-worried-about-transgenders-sports,2024-10-03T02:16:35Z,"Macy Petty, a Concerned Women for America legislative assistant and an NCAA college volleyball player, discusses the controversy surrounding San Jose State University's volleyball team.

As female athletes and lawmakers across the country fight to keep biological males out of women's sports competitions and locker rooms, a Democrat running for the House of Representatives says she and women athletes are not worried about the issue.

Sue Altman, who is running for New Jersey's Seventh Congressional District, told the New York Post that she and others in women's locker rooms are not worried about the presence of transgender athletes in women's sports.

""As someone who's been working to advocate for women's rights and women's sports, I promise you that in the locker rooms of women's sports teams, we're not super worried about this,"" Altman said. ""We've been worried about getting equal access to gym time, good referees, good trainers so you don't get injured, fair shake at scholarships, equal pay at the higher levels.""

Altman advocated for allowing transgenders in girls' sports at the youth level, but she suggested she would be in favor of leaving individual committees the decision to allow those athletes to compete.

""I will let individual sport[s] committees decide the highest, highest-level things, but at the very heart of it, we have to respect people of all genders and give young children, especially young people and adolescents struggling with their gender identity, the chance to compete,"" she told the Post.

""I grew up with people who are now trans, who have transitioned from boy to girl or girl to boy, and those people struggled in adolescence.""

Altman is a former women's college basketball player who played at Columbia University in the early 2000s. She ended her career there as the program's eighth-leading scorer in history with 964 points. She did this despite playing for Holy Cross her freshman year, transferring to Columbia and sitting out her sophomore year due to NCAA guidelines.

Altman also played professionally in Europe for Killester in the Irish Women's Super League in Dublin and for Medical Instinct Veilchen in Goettingen, Germany.

Almtan has said she grew up in a family of Republicans but that her time at Columbia made her more liberal. In an interview with Columbia's student newspaper in March, she cited the Bush administration's response to 9/11 as a reason for her switching allegiances during her time in college.

Now, she is running against Rep. Tom Kean Jr., R-N.J., who has more than 20 years of experience in the House of Representatives.

Altman is also running in an election year that has seen multiple lawsuits filed by women athletes and at least 24 lawsuits by state attorneys general in response to transgender athletes in women's sports and Title IX changes by the Biden-Harris administration, which some argue enable biological men into women's locker rooms and on their field of play.

In April, the administration issued a sweeping rule to clarify that Title IX's ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions.""

GOP GOVERNOR REVEALS WHY HE ORDERED SCHOOLS TO BAR TRANSGENDERS FROM GIRLS' SPORTS

The rule took effect Aug. 1, and for the first time, the law stated that discrimination based on sex includes conduct related to a person's gender identity. The Biden administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility. However, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that the proposal would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.

On Aug. 16, the Supreme Court voted, 5-4, to reject a Biden administration emergency request to enforce portions of that new rule, which includes protection from discrimination for transgender students under Title IX, after more than two dozen Republican attorneys general filed lawsuits against the administration to block its enforcement.

Meanwhile, Brooke Slusser, a member of San Jose State's women's volleyball team, joined 18 other athletes in suing the NCAA over its gender identity policies. The lawsuit alleged that Slusser, who transferred to San Jose State, was concerned for her safety after realizing one of her new teammates, Blaire Fleming, was transgender. Three of San Jose State's opponents have already forfeited games against the team since news of the lawsuit spread.

Former NCAA swimmer and OutKick contributor Riley Gaines has testified in Georgia about her experience competing against and sharing a locker room with transgender athlete Lia Thomas, a biological male, alongside four other NCAA All-American women athletes. Gaines is joined by Reka Gyorgy, Kylee Alons, Grace Countie and Kaitlynn Wheeler, all members of the Independent Council on Women's Sports, who filed a lawsuit against the NCAA in March alleging the association knowingly violated Title IX in allowing Thomas to compete.

The committee's inquiry will focus on the 2022 NCAA Division I Women's Swimming and Diving Championships, where Thomas competed for the University of Pennsylvania women's swimming team. Gaines competed against and eventually tied Thomas, who identifies as a woman, in the 200-yard championships in 2022.

Far away from Altman's constituents in the Northeast, one Republican governor has already passed an executive order to ensure schools prevent biological males from competing in women's sports.

On Aug. 28, Idaho Gov. Brad Little signed an executive order to enforce the Defending Women's Sports Act, which issued new protocols for the state's public schools to promote the exclusion of transgender athletes in women's sports. In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital on Aug. 30, Little did not rule out administering gender eligibility tests for all girls' and women's sports teams but added that ""I'd have to see really good evidence that that's necessary.""

But Altman says she wants to reduce barriers for transgender athletes to compete as women for the sake of their mental health.

""If we decide as a society that making rules about who is and who isn't female is more important than giving young children a chance to be on teams and compete and to be part of something bigger than themselves, especially young people who are more susceptible to suicide and bullying, then I think we've lost our way a little bit,"" Altman said."
College football Week 6 preview: Penn State vs. UCLA  --  trap game for Nittany Lions?,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/college-football-week-6-preview-penn-state-vs-ucla-trap-game-nittany-lions,2024-10-02T23:21:28Z,"""Big Noon Kickoff"" heads to Penn State this weekend as the No. 7-ranked Nittany Lions, fresh off a victory over Illinois, take on UCLA at Beaver Stadium (Noon ET on FOX and the FOX Sports App).

James Franklin's team is off to an impressive 4-0 start this season, relying on a balanced attack behind junior QB Drew Allar and the one-two rushing punch of Nicholas Singleton and Kaytron Allen. On the defensive side of the ball, the Nittany Lions are holding opposing teams to just 11.5 points and 226.5 yards per game, both of which rank second in the Big Ten through five weeks of the season.

On the other side, UCLA has struggled mightily on both sides of the ball in DeShaun Foster's first year at the helm. The Bruins sit at 1-3 overall and rank last in the Big Ten in total offense, and 17th in the 18-team Big Ten in total defense.

Penn State is one of five remaining unbeaten teams in the Big Ten. The Nittany Lions are set to take on UCLA this weekend before a massive three-game stretch: at No. 11 USC, at Wisconsin, home against Ohio State. What do you expect to see in this weekend's matchup, and could this serve as a potential trap game for James Franklin's team?

Laken Litman: Penn State is in pretty good shape right now heading into this week's matchup vs. UCLA. The Nittany Lions are fresh off beating an undefeated team in Illinois, which is a nice College Football Playoff résumé-booster. Their defense has been strong - the unit is only allowing 11.5 ppg and tallied seven sacks against the Fighting Illini last Saturday. Those kinds of numbers are unfortunate for a UCLA team, which has one of the worst offenses in the country and enters this game having lost its last three.

Nicholas Singleton has been one of the more productive running backs in the country (averaging 102 rushing yards per game) and quarterback Drew Allar has been efficient and has protected the ball, throwing just one interception through four games. Penn State's only weakness so far is its propensity for missing field goals. Kicker Sander Sahaydak missed both attempts last week and is 2-of-5 on the season. That's going to need to improve for when the team inevitably finds itself in a close game later on.

The Nittany Lions have a lot going for them right now, and while it's not unreasonable to call this a trap game, the Bruins have not proven to be dangerous enough to pull off an upset.

Michael Cohen: On paper, it's easy to see why this week's game against lowly UCLA could be considered a trap game for Penn State. The Nittany Lions are in a great place after beating No. 19 Illinois last week to remain unbeaten at 4-0 overall and 1-0 in the Big Ten. And two weeks from now, on Oct. 12, they'll be in Los Angeles for what should be an incredible game against No. 11 USC that might have legitimate Big Ten title implications. Both the Nittany Lions and Trojans are among a handful of programs seeking to keep pace with No. 3 Ohio State and No. 6 Oregon in the national rankings this season.

But there's almost nothing about Saturday's matchup between Penn State and UCLA that suggests the game itself will be close, as the latter struggles to adjust to life in the Big Ten. An offense under the direction of head coach DeShaun Foster and offensive coordinator Eric Bieniemy ranks 127th overall (262 yards per game), 127th in scoring (14.8 points per game), 133rd in rushing (57 yards per game), 124th in third-down conversion rate (27.9%) and 131st in red zone touchdown rate (30%). A defense under the direction of defensive coordinator Ikaika Malloe ranks 99th overall (398.3 yards per game), 105th in scoring (30.8 points per game), 127th against the passing (291 yards per game), 134th in opponent third-down conversion rate (58.2%) and tied for 94th in opponent red zone touchdown rate (23.5%). Even the Bruins' special teams units only rank 72nd in the country, according to the FEI Special Teams Ratings.

In other words, even if the Nittany Lions come out flat in Saturday's game, it's hard to imagine UCLA punishing them enough to pull the upset.

RJ Young: The only way this game turns into Admiral Ackbar exultation -- ""It's a trap!"" -- is if Penn State doesn't play like it has for the previous four games. Laken's right. Penn State's biggest weakness is its kicking game, but a kicker shouldn't be the difference in a game the Nittany Lions are expected to win by a whopping 28 points.

The danger for Penn State likely won't come with a loss to UCLA, but with a close win by Penn State. This is a team we're not sold on as a Big Ten title contender. Winning by less than the spread only gives more reason to doubt Penn State as they get set to travel to Los Angeles for the Trojans next weekend.

No. 10 Michigan will travel to Washington to take on the Huskies in a rematch of last year's national title game. These are two programs that appear to be in a very different spot than they were last year, despite the Wolverines' top-10 national ranking. Is this a simple case of attrition within both programs - players and coaches - or is there more to it?

RJ: It's not just that this was the national title game last year. It's that the teams Michigan and Washington beat to get there are the No. 1- (Alabama) and No. 2-ranked (Texas) teams in the country. But neither Michigan nor Washington look the same as they did a year ago: new head coaches, different coordinators.

Change is the only constant in the sport. Turnover on rosters is now catching up to turnover on coaching staffs, and the usual predictors for future success no longer mean as much. Adaptability, a sixth-or seventh-year player at QB, a healthy NIL war chest -- these are the new predictors for success, and UW and Michigan seemed to have learned the hard way through this cycle.

Washington lost to Rutgers. Michigan was embarrassed by Texas.

This game feels less like a play-in for the CFP and more like an artifact displayed to anthropologists decades from now to demonstrate how the game flipped over into this new era of the sport.

Michael: The 24-hour period from late last Friday evening through the end of Alabama's thrilling win over Georgia on Saturday night offered a fascinating window into the state of last year's College Football Playoff participants. It began when Washington, the national runner-up from the 2023 campaign, was upended by unranked Rutgers as a 55-yard field goal attempt by the Huskies went awry in the closing moments. It continued on Saturday afternoon as Michigan head coach Sherrone Moore sounded humbled and subdued during a postgame interview on FOX after his Wolverines nearly imploded in the fourth quarter against Minnesota, the victory aided at least in part by a botched officiating decision during an onside kick. Then came Texas' 35-13 win over Mississippi State in which backup quarterback Arch Manning, the former No. 1 overall player in the country, completed 26 of 31 passes for 324 yards and two touchdowns as the Longhorns remained unbeaten. And then there was the pièce de résistance: No. 4 Alabama sprinting to a 28-0 lead over No. 2 Georgia and then hanging on for what could be remembered as a season-defining win.

On the Big Ten side of that equation, the ongoing struggles at Michigan and Washington are showing just how difficult it is to replace generationally talented coaches in Jim Harbaugh and Kalen DeBoer. That the latter left Washington and immediately molded Alabama into a national championship contender following the retirement of head coach Nick Saban, who is arguably the greatest coach in college football history, shows just how stunningly special DeBoer really is after a mediocre rise from Sioux Falls to Fresno State and from Washington to the Crimson Tide. And all Texas head coach Steve Sarkisian did after losing nearly all of his skill players to the NFL was reload with a transfer portal class that had the highest net rating in the SEC, according to 247Sports.

That's the kind of ruthless efficiency and high-level player acquisition that new regimes at Michigan (Moore) and Washington (Jedd Fisch) have been unable to match thus far.

Laken: Certainly a case of attrition.

For Michigan, Jim Harbaugh is now coaching in the NFL and former quarterback J.J. McCarthy, though he's been out with an injury, was a top 10 draft pick. The Wolverines broke the all-time program record for the most players taken in one draft with 13 being selected. That takes a toll on most programs, unless you are built like Georgia or Alabama. Sherrone Moore, though he served in the role while Harbaugh missed games due to suspension last year, is in his first year as head coach. He doesn't have the kind of talent this team had a year ago, and desperately needs a quarterback and more playmakers on offense.

Meanwhile, Washington is still mourning losing its former coach Kalen DeBoer to Alabama. He's doing quite well, by the way, coming off a smashing SEC debut over the weekend in which the Crimson Tide upset Georgia in the type of game that usually happens when there's a trophy on the line. Now, he's the head coach of the No. 1 team in the country. The Huskies hired Jedd Fisch from Arizona in the offseason, but he hasn't gotten consistent production out of this team yet. Plus, when your program's top offensive playmakers are taken in the top 10 of the NFL Draft, you're naturally going to have setbacks if you can't immediately replace them.

Looking at this week's AP Top 25 Poll, is there one team that jumps out to you and has surprised you more than others?

Michael: There might have been folks out there who believed first-year head coach Curt Cignetti could turn Indiana around quickly after the Hoosiers parted ways with former head coach Tom Allen, who is now the defensive coordinator at Penn State. But it's unlikely that even the most ardent IU supporters were forecasting what we've seen so far from Cignetti and his reconfigured roster: five blowout victories in as many chances for Indiana, which entered the AP Poll at No. 23 this week. Perhaps even more shocking is that the Hoosiers rank third nationally in scoring offense at 48.8 points per game and 13th nationally in scoring defense at 13 points per game. Indiana is 5-0 for the first time since 1967.

Still, any legitimate conversation about the Hoosiers must include a discussion of the schedule Cignetti & Co. have played thus far. Based on their first five opponents -- FIU, Western Illinois, UCLA, Charlotte and Maryland, all of whom have a combined record of 9-14 this season -- the Hoosiers' strength of schedule ranks 119th nationally, according to Pro Football Focus, and second-to-last among programs from the Power 4 conferences ahead of Louisville. No other Big Ten programs have played schedules that rank outside the top 100 nationally, with Nebraska (99) and Rutgers (89) being the only other teams whose schedules even rank beyond the top 80.

Things will look much different for Indiana the rest of the way, however, as the Hoosiers' remaining schedule ranks 20th nationally in difficulty: at Northwestern, vs. Nebraska, vs. Washington, at Michigan State, vs. No. 10 Michigan, at No. 3 Ohio State, vs. Purdue. So, either Cignetti and his team are for real, or the IU bubble is about to burst sooner than later.

Laken: No. 17 BYU.

Nobody had the Cougars as a Big 12 contender, but here we are. BYU is 5-0 and No. 1 in the conference after impressive wins over then-No. 13 Kansas State and Baylor on the road. In the victory over the Bears last week, the Cougars ran out to a 28-7 lead before Dave Aranda's team showed some fight. While the offense has been inconsistent, the defense has been sound - after Baylor cut into the lead, the defense made three big stops, including a game-saving interception, to hold onto the W.

The Cougars still have to play Oklahoma State and Utah, but overall, have a winnable schedule and, at this rate, could find themselves playing for a conference championship in December. Kalani Sitake's team has shown early resilience, which should continue to serve them well.

RJ: No. 25 UNLV

Let's list what UNLV has done and been apart of since Week 1:

A win against a ranked opponent. The first real case of a player refusing to play because he said he didn't get paid the price he agreed to. The backup QB leading the team to a decisive victory to get the Runnin' Rebels into the top 25 for the first time in program history and off to its best start in school history. One of the schools who could tip the balance of power in the Pac-12 and Mountain West realignment quest for an eighth member to earn qualification to the 2026 CFP. The Rebels' Oct. 25 matchup with future Pac-12 member Boise State could give us the answer to who the favorite to win the Mountain West is and secure the G5 conference champ invitation to the first 12-team CFP.

Not a bad month in Vegas.

Oregon has outscored in-state rival Oregon State and Big Ten foe UCLA by a combined 56 points over the last two weeks. The Ducks are set to host Michigan State in a primetime Friday night matchup on FOX this week. After a slow start to the season, is this the Oregon team you expected to see, or do the Ducks still have room to grow?

Laken: After an underwhelming start to the season, Oregon has gotten into a better groove these last two weeks with convincing wins over Oregon State and UCLA. Last week, the Ducks' defense kept a clean sheet and the only touchdown allowed was a 96-yard pick six by the Bruins' Bryan Addison, who intercepted Dillon Gabriel in the second quarter. That was Gabriel's only interception of the season so far. By comparison, he's had nine touchdowns and is completing 81.5% of his passes, which is good for the best in the country. Now that Oregon's offensive line is gelling, Gabriel is looking more like the Heisman hopeful he's projected to be.

The Ducks should handle Michigan State on Friday. The real test comes the next week on Oct. 12 when Ohio State visits Autzen Stadium. That's when we'll know what kind of team Dan Lanning has this year.

RJ: They better learn to take the ball away before Oct. 12. With a turnover margin of zero -- 11th out of 18 in the Big Ten -- and three of their next four games against ranked opponents, I'd like to see the Ducks win Friday night with interceptions, fumbles recovered and a clean offense.

It's time the Ducks began to resemble the national title team we thought they could be in the preseason.

Michael: One aspect of Oregon's winning formula last season as the Ducks finished 12-2 and won the Fiesta Bowl during their second season under head coach Dan Lanning was an incredible turnover margin of plus-11 that ranked tied for fourth nationally. The only programs with better turnover margins last year were Northwestern (plus-13), Penn State (plus-16) and Michigan (plus-19), the eventual national champion. To get there, the Ducks weren't necessarily one of the best teams in the country at forcing turnovers -- after all, their 12 interceptions ranked outside the top 25 nationally and their six fumbles gained were tied for 79th -- but they had an incredible ability to avoid turning the ball over offensively. Quarterback Bo Nix, who is now starting for the Denver Broncos, tossed 45 touchdowns and only three interceptions last season. Oregon's ball carriers only lost two fumbles all season, tied for the third-fewest in the country.

In 2024, however, the Ducks haven't been quite as prolific with their turnover margin. The defenses' total of four takeaways -- all interceptions -- is tied for 93rd nationally. The offenses' total of four giveaways -- three of which were lost fumbles -- is tied for 33rd overall. And the net result is a turnover margin of zero that puts Oregon in a tie for 66th nationally and tied for 11th in the Big Ten.

So yes, the Ducks have room to grow.

"Two men arrested in Missouri after police discover 5 adults, 7 children in back of U-Haul: reports",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/us/two-men-arrested-missouri-after-police-discover-7-children-back-u-haul-reports,2024-10-02T21:51:16Z,"Hayley and Matthew Leach tell 'Fox News Live' what they want people to know about World Autism Awareness Day.

Missouri law enforcement officials arrested two men after discovering seven children between the ages of 2 to 13 and several adults in the back of a U-Haul box truck during a traffic stop on the interstate, according to reports.

KY3, a local NBC station out of Springfield, Missouri, reported that 31-year-old Shaikiem Bristol and 22-year-old Musa Omar were charged with seven counts of first-degree endangering the welfare of a child.

The station reported that, according to court documents, a trooper with the Missouri State Highway Patrol stopped a U-Haul box truck at about 4:30 p.m. on Sunday on Interstate 44.

Bristol allegedly told the trooper he and Omar rented a U-Haul box truck in Buffalo, New York, and drove down to Glendale, Arizona, to pick up a woman who had been kicked out of her house by her mother.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT ACCUSED IN MISSOURI POLICE OFFICER'S DEATH HAS PRIOR RAP SHEET

When Bristol and Omar were pulled over, Bristol explained to the trooper that they were on their way back up to New York from Arizona.

Two women were in the passenger seat, and Bristol said they were his sister and fiancé.

The women told police a different story -- that they traveled to Arizona to pick up some things and visit family.

In the court documents, the trooper noted there were conflicting stories being told by the suspects about the trip, leading the trooper to believe they were involved in criminal activity.

ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT BROTHERS ARRESTED IN MISSOURI IN CONNECTION WITH DEADLY CARJACKINGS

When the trooper asked to search the U-Haul, Bristol reportedly gave permission and said there were beds, clothing and five adults and seven kids in the back.

The trooper called for backup and placed the women and Bristol under arrest.

To prevent anyone from running into traffic on the interstate, police transported the U-Haul to the Webster County Jail for further investigation.

During the investigation, troopers opened the back of the truck and noticed the air was warm and there was no power or air conditioning. Troopers also said there were clothes and food containers in the back, and most of the children removed from the U-Haul had dirty diapers that had not been changed for hours, police alleged.

The occupants in the back were also reportedly sweaty because of the heat.

When questioned by troopers, Bristol allegedly said he did not know why they took the kids on the trip, knowing it was going to be hot.

""That's why we tried to stop a lot,"" Bristol told police.

He explained that he and Omar tried to stop every hour and a half to two hours during the trip, so the occupants in the back would not get hot. The two men also reportedly shared driving responsibilities, police said.

Mysterious gravestone in Virginia reveals 400-year-old secrets: archaeologists,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/lifestyle/mysterious-gravestone-virginia-reveals-400-year-old-secrets-archaeologists,2024-10-02T19:10:02Z,"John Evenson, a tugboat that sank in 1895, was recently discovered by a team of maritime experts. It was found in Lake Michigan. (Source: Wisconsin Historical Society)

Archaeologists have discovered surprising new details about the oldest tombstone in the United States, which dates back nearly 400 years.

The 1627 tombstone was set up in the Jamestown settlement and belonged to an English knight. But what exactly the tombstone was made of - and where it came from - stumped experts until now.

According to a study published in the International Journal of Historical Archaeology in September, the stone was not North American in origin.

The study, which is titled ""Sourcing the Early Colonial Knight's Black 'Marble' Tombstone at Jamestown, Virginia, USA,"" argues that the black limestone actually came from Europe - and sheds light on the trade routes of the time.

WOMAN OUT FOR WALK STUMBLES UPON ONCE-IN-A-DECADE DISCOVERY

""In seventeenth-century Virginia, USA, one of the ways affluent English colonists exhibited their wealth and memorialized themselves was with engraved tombstones,"" the article states. ""Wealthy colonists in the Tidewater region of the Chesapeake Bay at this time preferentially selected black 'marble' for their gravestones that was actually polished, fine-grained, black limestone.""

""The iconic knight's tombstone at Jamestown is one such stone.""

For more Lifestyle articles, visit www.foxnews.com/lifestyle.

Rather than being made of a fossil found in the region, the limestone was likely transported from Belgium.

""This supports the conclusions above for transatlantic trade routes from continental Europe to Jamestown,"" the study said. ""These were undoubtedly not direct, but through London.""

""We hypothesize it was quarried and cut to size in Belgium, shipped down the Meuse River, across the English Channel to London where it was carved and the brass inlays installed, and finally shipped on to Jamestown as ballast,"" the study concluded. ""This trade route was a small piece of the rapidly expanding Atlantic world of geopolitical colonial trade.""

Historians have not definitively concluded who the grave belonged to, but the study said it most likely belonged to Sir George Yeardley, who was the governor of Virginia at the time of his death in 1627.

""Assuming the knight's tombstone was George Yeardley's, then it is the oldest black 'marble' tombstone in the Chesapeake Bay region, and may be the oldest surviving tombstone in America,"" the study said.

Michigan voters sound off on JD Vance's debate performance: 'He told the truth',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/michigan-voters-sound-off-jd-vances-debate-performance-he-told-truth,2024-10-02T17:47:24Z,"'Fox & Friends' co-host Lawrence Jones takes a pulse from Michigan voters on the 2024 presidential election.

Voters in swing state Michigan praised Republican vice presidential candidate Sen. JD Vance for his debate performance against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz.

""I thought it went really well. I thought [Vance] did really well. He held his own. He told the truth,"" a voter wearing a MAGA hat told ""Fox & Friends"" co-host Lawrence Jones, Wednesday.

TOP 5 MOMENTS FROM ONLY VP DEBATE BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ BEFORE ELECTION

Jones visited Steak 'N Egger restaurant in Muskegon after Tuesday night's CBS News Vice Presidential Debate, where many watchers gave Vance the advantage over Walz.

""[Walz] did terrible in many respects, but he is just honest and truthful also. He doesn't know what he's talking about and he kind of admitted it,"" one voter said.

Another voter said Walz appeared ""too nervous.""

""[Walz is] phony. He's too plastic. He doesn't know the topics like Vance.""

A few voters at the diner, however, defended Walz's performance and argued the Democrat won the pair's only debate showdown.

""[Walz is] very articulate. He knows his facts,"" one woman said. ""JD Vance totally switched the script last night. He told untruths. He flipped the switch. He lied throughout the whole entire debate last night. What he said was untrue - his stance on abortion, his stance on housing, his stance on the finance - everything was was not true.""

The woman conceded that Vance's ""experience on public stages"" may have impacted the number of voters and pundits giving the senator the win.

TOP 5 CLASHES BETWEEN VANCE AND WALZ DURING DEBATE SHOWDOWN: 'YOUR MICS ARE CUT'

Tuesday's debate covered a variety of subjects ranging from immigration to climate change to abortion as the two lesser known politicians sought to make their introductions to American voters before Election Day.

One Michigan voter said she is voting for Vice President Kamala Harris because she likes the idea that ""we get to vote every four years instead of, 'if you vote me in, you won't ever have to vote again.'""

Another woman voiced her support for Trump ""because he's for America, and he's for me. And he's for the unborn child.""

""If you are for the person who cannot defend themselves, then you are for the rest of us,"" she said. ""And if you don't care about those that are not able to defend themselves, you certainly aren't going to be in charge of us or care for us.""

MSNBC host Nicolle Wallace claimed on Tuesday that the ""worst moment"" for Sen. JD Vance in the vice presidential debate was when he attempted to ""mansplain"" over muted mics, and argued the moment was specifically bad for female voters.

""I actually think if you're a woman, that might be the worst moment JD Vance had, because he was going to mansplain right over that mute button. He was, and again, I don't pretend to know how everyone will react to this. I think that a lot of women, in positions of authority that should command respect just by virtue of that dynamic, will see themselves and some do, the direspect of them and talked over,"" she said.

Vance called out the debate moderators, CBS' Norah O'Donnell and Margaret Brennan, during the debate for fact-checking him during the debate after he brought up migrants in Springfield, Ohio. The moderators eventually muted his microphone as he was trying to talk.

She compared the moment to the debate Vice President Kamala Harris had with former Vice President Mike Pence in 2020, when Harris said, ""I'm speaking.""

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""There was this real belief that what he had to say was more important than the debate rules and the moderators,"" she said.

Wallace also praised the debate moderators for using ""their mic muting power.""

The Trump campaign ripped Wallace in a statement to Fox News Digital, calling her an ""unhinged idiot who beclowned herself by acting like a crazy person."" ""She's a joke and nobody takes her seriously,"" Trump campaign spokesman Steven Cheung said to Fox Digital.

Brennan interjected to correct Vance after he suggested that illegal immigrants are overwhelming resources in Springfield, Ohio.

""Just to clarify for our viewers, Springfield, Ohio does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status,"" Brennan said.

""The rules were that you guys weren't going to fact-check,"" Vance pushed back. ""And since you are fact-checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on.""

While explaining the process of obtaining legal status and tying it to a Harris-backed immigration policy, the moderators again spoke over Vance, thanking him for ""describing the legal process"" before they cut off his microphone as Walz attempted to argue with him.

The media criticized Walz following the debate for what they deemed was a lack of preparation.

"Female athletes 'blindsided' on volleyball court with trans player prompts civil rights complaint, lawsuit",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/female-athletes-blindsided-volleyball-court-trans-player-prompts-civil-rights-complaint-lawsuit,2024-10-02T11:14:00Z,"EXCLUSIVE: Concerned Women of America (CWA) is leading the charge to safeguard women's sports after an athlete on the San Jose State University (SJSU) women's volleyball team was identified as a transgender player.

Blaire Fleming's towering 6-foot-1 presence on the volleyball court has assisted SJSU's Division I volleyball team to remain undefeated on the court this season.

Macy Petty, a CWA legislative assistant and a NCAA volleyball athlete, shared with Fox News Digital the organization's efforts to raise awareness of transgender players' impact on women's sports.

""We want to protect the integrity of women's sports but also the safety of these female athletes,"" she said. ""Many of these schools were unaware that there was a male athlete on this team until this news article came out in April. We just want to make sure that these schools know exactly what is going on in this athletic program because the NCAA and SJSU had not previously given them the decency to even let them know what was happening.""

""Female athletes were put in this odd position of showing up on the court and looking at the other side and realizing that something was different about this game. I've never seen an athlete play like this before, which makes total sense considering that this athlete, first of all, is not female, but the net is seven inches shorter than it should be for male players.""

AS A FEMALE ATHLETE, I DO NOT CONSENT TO PLAYING ALONGSIDE MEN IN COLLEGIATE SPORTS

Petty said players feel ""blindsided"" because the governing body - the NCAA - of the league has not informed teams of the presence of transgender players on opposing teams.

""There's no informed consent for the schools or for the female athletes here. They're totally blindsided when they walk up to the court and they see that there's a male athlete on the other side.""

""This actually happened to me. I played college volleyball, and during my recruiting process, the same thing happened to me. I walked up to the court and, with all of the college scouts standing all around me, I looked at my competition, and it was a boy,"" she said. ""I thought this is obviously cheating, but I played anyway because I didn't have this time to sit and reflect and think about the decisions that I was making. It was just kind of upon me at that moment without any respect given to me about that decision.""

Petty said athletes are faced with having to ""choose between maybe a $100,000 educational scholarship or their own safety and dignity.""

""We're not going to jeopardize our female athletes, we're not going to jeopardize their safety and dignity.""

-- Macy Petty, Concerned Women for America

""And for a lot of girls, that's a burden that is just too much to bear,"" she said. ""We're asking these schools to be proactive on this issue and simply say if there is a boy on the other team, we're not going to play. We're not going to jeopardize our female athletes, we're not going to jeopardize their safety and dignity. We're simply not playing, we're not going to do this game and have to make our female athletes suffer that burden.""

The organization's concern prompted them to file a federal civil rights complaint alleging female discrimination and arguing that the California university allowed a male athlete to hold a female roster spot as well as a female athletic scholarship.

CWA also sent letters to schools competing against SJSU, informing them of the males' participation in the sport and the potential impact on their female athletes.

SWISS COURT TAKES TRANS CHILD AWAY FROM PARENTS OVER THEIR OBJECTIONS TO PUBERTY BLOCKERS

Fox News Digital exclusively obtained a copy of the letter the organization sent to Colorado State University informing it about Fleming's presence and about safety concerns.

""We just asked a couple of questions, like, if they knew that there was a boy athlete that they were going to be competing against. We also [asked] if they are willing to compromise the integrity of your program but also the safety of your female athletes by competing in this game, knowing that there is an increased risk of harm. What are you doing to be precautionary and make sure that this doesn't happen in the future?""

On Friday, Colorado State replied to the organization's inquiry, saying it was planning to host the university as planned on Oct. 3.

""And while we do appreciate that they responded to our inquiry, we do recognize that there have been two major developments since their response on Friday. First, Concerned Women for America did file this federal civil rights complaint against San Jose State. And also Boise State pulled out of their game - a conference game - against San Jose State.""

""We're hoping that Colorado State will reevaluate our questions knowing that this is a serious problem,"" she said.

Boise State University forfeited the game's match against SJSU on Sept. 28.

""Boise State volleyball will not play its scheduled match at San José State on Saturday, Sept. 28. Per Mountain West Conference policy, the Conference will record the match as a forfeit and a loss for Boise State. The Broncos will next compete on Oct. 3 against Air Force,"" Boise State said in a statement.

BOISE STATE WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL FORFEITS UPCOMING MATCH AGAINST SJSU AMID CONTROVERSY SURROUNDING TRANS PLAYER

Idaho Gov. Brad Little commended the move, saying it was ""working within the spirit"" of an executive order he signed ""defending women's sports.""

""I applaud Boise State for working within the spirit of my Executive Order, the Defending Women's Sports Act,"" Little wrote in an X post. ""We need to ensure player safety for all of our female athletes and continue the fight for fairness in women's sports.""

On Tuesday, the University of Wyoming followed suit, forfeiting the conference game against SJSU. The news came after CWA's college organization, Young Women for America, sent a letter to University of Wyoming President Edward Seidel and Director of Athletics Tom Burman.

""After a lengthy discussion, the University of Wyoming will not play its scheduled conference match against San José State University in the UniWyo Sports Complex on Saturday, Oct. 5. Per Mountain West Conference policy, the Conference will record the match as a forfeit and a loss for Wyoming,"" they wrote in a statement. ""The Cowgirls will host Fresno State on Thursday, Oct. 3 at 6:30 p.m. in the UniWyo Sports Complex.""

The latest reports on Fleming's impact on female sports comes as a lawsuit was filed in Georgia against the NCAA.

The lawsuit is headed by former University of Kentucky swimmer Riley Gaines and includes SJSU volleyball player Brooke Slusser as a plaintiff.

In the lawsuit, Slusser, a Texas native who transferred to SJSU from the University of Alabama, said Fleming was a ""male who identifies as transgender and who claims a female identity.""

Slusser alleged that SJSU did not immediately tell her that Fleming is transgender, and the two roomed together on road trips. Slusser said she learned of her teammate's gender identity when she overheard a student call Fleming a ""guy.""

Fleming told Slusser in April 2024 that she was born male and considers herself to be transgender, according to the lawsuit.

Slusser said Fleming's spikes traveled more than 80 mph, ""which was faster than [Slusser] had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball."" Other members of the SJSU team were concerned about getting concussed by Fleming's spikes, the lawsuit said.

The lawsuit alleged that team members were instructed not to speak about Fleming's gender with people outside the team.

""Due to the NCAA's Transgender Eligibility Policies which permit Fleming to play on the SJSU women's volleyball team and which led to SJSU recruiting Fleming, giving Fleming a scholarship, and allowing Fleming to be in positions to violate Brooke's right to bodily privacy, Brooke has suffered physical and emotional injuries, embarrassment, humiliation, emotional distress, mental anguish and suffering,"" the lawsuit said.

Fox News Digital has reached out to San Jose State University for comment.

Slusser spoke to OutKick over the weekend about the lawsuit, saying she believed she was doing the right thing.

""It's crazy to say, but it was an easy decision for me to join because it's something I truly believe in,"" Slusser said. ""And it's been easy because all the support that I'm getting, 99% of it is just love and encouragement. So, for me, it shows that I made the right decision to join. This is something that so many people do care about. It's just that so many people are scared to talk about it."""

The WWE women's division is as loaded as it has ever been, with Liv Morgan and Nia Jax holding singles titles and Jade Cargill and Bianca Belair holding tag-team gold.

With the number of talents on the roster, there has been an argument for more than a year about adding another championship to the mix for the mid-card competitors. The belt would be akin to what the men's roster has in the Intercontinental and United States Championships.

In fact, NXT introduced a similar belt in June with its North American Championship. Kelani Jordan won the title in a six-woman ladder match at Battleground.

Rumors have swirled for months about a mid-card belt coming to the main women's roster.

WWE star Drew McIntyre, who is getting ready for his own war with CM Punk inside a Hell in a Cell at Bad Blood this weekend, agreed that the circumstance is ""absolutely justified.""

""That's certainly something that's going to come around in the near future,"" McIntyre told Fox News Digital in a recent interview. ""And you don't just bring titles in for the sake of bringing titles (especially) if you don't have the adequate depth on the roster. But now, to watch just how far the women's revolution has come - the revolution is such a distant memory now. The women have been killing it for years now.""

McIntyre remembered when he first got onto the main WWE roster how the women's division was far from the way it is being treated now. Since the women's revolution within the company, female wrestlers have had top billing on several match cards. Ronda Rousey, Becky Lynch and Charlotte Flair headlined WrestleMania 35 in 2019.

WWE RING COLLAPSES DURING LAST MONSTER STANDING MATCH

""And they got that opportunity years and years ago, and since then, we've had so many people come in, and it's gotten to a point where it's not a case of you want to be after any women's matches, you do not want to be after the women's match anymore because they're going to go out there, they're going to kill it, the crowed are going to be burnt out, and you're going to have to work really hard to get them,"" McIntyre added.

""To watch the talent pool grow, the roster depth grow, and the characters, more importantly, connect with the audience, because if they don't care about you, it doesn't matter if you're a man or a woman, nobody's emotionally attached to you. You might as well just sit in the back and not go out there. There's so many characters the women's division has gotten over now. We're at a point where if there's a second title introduced, it's absolutely justified.""

Zelina Vega told Fox News Digital last year she hoped a mid-card belt would come into the picture, saying it would be ""beneficial"" to have another title.

""We should have a mid-card belt for the ladies, almost like a television championship where it's not competing with the Women's NXT Championship, just to give someone else a little bit of a rub, a little bit of shine, as well as a little bit of something to work for because it always gonna be a while before you work your way to that big goal,"" he said."

It was found in Lake Michigan. (Source: Wisconsin Historical Society)

A long-lost shipwreck hidden in the depths of Lake Michigan has recently been discovered by a team of maritime experts -- nearly 130 years after it sank.

The Wisconsin Historical Society (WHS) announced the discovery of the John Evenson, a tugboat built in 1884, in a Facebook post on Sept. 20. The vessel sank during an ill-fated trip in June 1895.

The WHS told Fox News Digital on Saturday that two maritime historians named Brendon Baillod and Robert Jaeck had initially discovered the shipwreck.

The two used historical newspaper accounts and sonar images that eventually led them to the shipwreck, which sat 42 feet below the surface.

WOMAN OUT FOR WALK STUMBLES UPON ONCE-IN-A-DECADE DISCOVERY

Before becoming a shipwreck itself, the John Evenson was used to locate and salvage wrecked ships, in addition to towing other vessels and breaking ice.

""The ship was not a cargo ship, it was actually a tugboat,"" maritime archaeologist Tamara Thomsen explained. ""It would have been used to tow vessels into Sturgeon Bay, break ice or assist stranded ships.""

The WHS explained that on the fateful day, the ship was sailing after receiving some repairs when its captain ""thought it would be more profitable for the tug to return to work.""

""They waited outside the Sturgeon Bay Ship canal for the next vessel that required a tow into the canal,"" the WHS described. ""The steambarge I. Watson Stephenson with two barges in tow signaled for a tug.""

""The John Evenson ran out to the ship, and while attempting to take the line, crossed the Stephenson's bow. The Stephenson was traveling fast and hit the Evenson's stern, which swung the tug across its bow flipping it over.""

The John Evenson sank in a mere three minutes. The tugboat only carried five people in total, and four of the crew members were able to escape.

Only one person was killed, the ship's engineer -- and his remains were found not long after.

""He washed ashore about a month later, so his remains are not associated with the site,"" Thomsen told Fox News Digital.

The recent discovery is not the first time that divers have searched for the ruined ship. The ship's owners once tried to find it, but they abandoned their mission for insurance purposes.

""[The owners] vowed to raise and salvage their former tugboat, but they quickly ran into trouble,"" the WHS explained in its Facebook post. ""They had surrendered the ship as a total loss and already received the insurance payout. If the Laurie Brothers raised the tug, the insurance underwriters could claim ownership.""

Top 5 clashes between Vance and Walz during debate showdown: 'Your mics are cut',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/top-5-clashes-between-vance-walz-during-debate-showdown-your-mics-cut,2024-10-02T08:11:23Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Democratic Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Republican Ohio Sen. JD Vance took the same stage for their first and only vice presidential debate this election cycle on Tuesday evening, when the pair had a handful of fiery clashes over top voter concerns.

The CBS News Vice Presidential Debate showcased the two vice presidential candidates' platforms on issues such as the ongoing war raging in the Middle East, abortion laws and their respective tickets' economic records. Amid the 90-minute debate, Vance and Walz had a handful of clashes, including moderators turning off Vance's microphone.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR OVER ABORTION AND IMMIGRATION IN FIRST AND ONLY VP DEBATE

The CBS debate's rules included leaving microphones on for both candidates no matter who was speaking, breaking from the two presidential debates this cycle that muted microphones when a candidate was not speaking. The outlet, however, reserved the right to turn the microphones off if they felt it was warranted.

Moderators Margaret Brennan and Norah O'Donnell did mute the pair Tuesday when Vance spoke up to complain that the moderators were trying to fact-check him on his remarks regarding illegal immigrants in Springfield, Ohio.

""The people that I'm most worried about in Springfield, Ohio, are the American citizens who have had their lives destroyed by Kamala Harris's open border. It is a disgrace,"" Vance said referring to about immigration issues in a city in his home state.

After Vance and Walz both delivered responses regarding immigration, Brennan told viewers that Springfield ""does have a large number of Haitian migrants who have legal status, temporary protected status.""

Vance took issues with the on-air ""fact-check"" before he was muted.

ABC'S LINSEY DAVIS ADMITS FACT-CHECKING OF TRUMP WAS BECAUSE CNN LET HIS STATEMENTS 'HANG' AT FIRST DEBATE

""The rules were that you were not going to fact-check, and since you're fact checking me, I think it's important to say what's actually going on,"" Vance said. ""So there's an application called the CBP. One app where you can go on as an illegal migrant, apply for asylum or apply for parole and be granted legal status at the wave of a Kamala Harris open border wand. That is not a person coming in. Applying for a green card and waiting for ten years.""

Moderators tried to quiet Vance before cutting his and Walz's mics.

""Gentlemen, the audience can't hear you because your mics are cut,"" Margaret Brennan said. ""We have so much we want to get to.""

Walz was forced to answer questions regarding his travel to China during Tuesday night's debate.

Walz has said he was in Hong Kong during the deadly Tiananmen Square protests in the spring of 1989. Minnesota Public Radio and other media outlets, however, are now reporting that Walz actually did not travel to China until August of that year.

CBS News moderator Margaret Brennan asked Walz to explain the discrepancy.

WALZ FORCED TO CORRECT RECORD ON WHETHER HE WAS IN CHINA FOR THE TIANANMEN SQUARE PROTESTS

""Look, I grew up in a small rural Nebraska town, a town that you rode your bike with your buddies till the streetlights come on, and I'm proud of that service,"" a visibly shaky Walz said. ""I joined the National Guard at 17, worked on family farms and then I used the GI bill to become a teacher.""

""I came back home and then started a program to take young people there. We would take basketball teams. We would take baseball teams. We would take dancers. And we would go back and forth to China,"" Walz said, noting the trips were ""to try and learn.""

""Look, my community knows who I am. They saw where I was at. I will be the first to tell you I have poured my heart into my community, and I've tried to do the best I can, but I've not been perfect,"" Walz continued.

""And I'm a knucklehead at times.""

Brennan pushed back, reminding Walz of the question and again asking him to explain the discrepancy.

""All I said on this was, as I got there that summer and misspoke on this,"" Walz said. ""So, I will just -- that's what I've said. So, I was in Hong Kong and China during the democracy protests, went in and, from that, I learned a lot of what needed to be in in governance.""

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz claimed during the debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws after Roe v. Wade was overturned, sparking a clash with Vance.

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe v. Wade,"" he said.

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Vance shot back that a Minnesota abortion law does not require doctors to save a baby who survives an abortion.

""First of all, governor, I agree with you, Amber Thurman should still be alive, and there are a lot of people who should still be alive. And I certainly wish that she was. And maybe you're free to disagree with me on this and explain this to me. But as I read the Minnesota law that you signed into law, the statute that you signed into law, it says that a doctor who presides over an abortion where the baby survives, the doctor is under no obligation to provide lifesaving care to a baby who survives a botched late term abortion,"" he said.

VANCE, WALZ SPAR ON IMMIGRATION DURING VP DEBATE: BEEN TO THE BORDER 'MORE THAN OUR BORDER CZAR'

""That's not true,"" Walz said.

""Choice or not option that is fundamentally barbaric,"" Vance continued.

The pair also sparred over immigration a handful of times throughout the debate, including Vance slamming Vice President Kamala Harris for her handling of immigration.

""First of all, the gross majority of what we need to do to the southern border is just empowering law enforcement to do their job,"" Vance said during a discussion on the Haitian migrant surge in Springfield, Ohio, and immigration overall.

""I've been to the southern border more than our 'border czar' Kamala Harris has been. And it's actually heartbreaking because the Border Patrol agents, they just want to be empowered to do their job.""

Vance continued by saying that, ""of course, additional resources would help,"" but that the issue is mostly about the Biden administration not empowering law enforcement to say ""if you try to come across the border illegally, you've got to stay in Mexico"" and ""go back through proper channels.""

VANCE RIPS WALZ ON ECONOMY, SAYS HE'S FORCED TO 'PRETEND' TRUMP DIDN'T LOWER INFLATION

""Now, Gov. Walz brought up the community of Springfield, and he's very worried about the things that I've said in Springfield,"" Vance said. ""Look, in Springfield, Ohio, and in communities all across this country, you've got schools that are overwhelmed. You've got hospitals that are overwhelmed. You've got housing that is totally unaffordable because we brought in millions of illegal immigrants to compete with Americans for scarce homes.

Walz repeatedly argued Trump shut down a Senate immigration bill earlier this year that he believes would have made strengthened border security.

""It is law enforcement that asked for the bill,"" Walz said. ""They helped craft it. They're the ones that supported it. It was because they know we need to do this. Look, this issue of continuing to bring this up, of not dealing with it, of blaming migrants for everything.

""On housing, we could talk a little bit about Wall Street speculators buying up housing and making them less affordable, but it becomes a blame. Look, this bill also gives the money necessary to adjudicate. I agree it should not take seven years for an asylum claim to be done.""

""This bill gets it done in 90 days. Then, you start to make a difference in this, and you start to adhere to what we know, American principles. I don't talk about my faith a lot, but Matthew 25:40 talks about to the least amongst us, you do unto me. I think that's true of most Americans. They simply want order to it. This bill does it. It's funded. It's supported by the people who do it, and it lets us keep our dignity about how we treat other people.""

The pair of vice presidential candidates also sparred over the threat of censorship on Tuesday, as Walz pressed Vance on the 2020 election and Jan. 6, 2021.

""It's really rich for Democratic leaders to say that Donald Trump is a unique threat to democracy when he peacefully gave over power on January the 20th, as we have done for 250 years in this country. We are going to shake hands after this debate and after this election,"" Vance said after Walz cited Jan. 6, when Trump supporters breached the U.S. Capitol.

""We have to remember that for years in this country, Democrats protested the results of elections. Hillary Clinton in 2016 said that Donald Trump had the election stolen by Vladimir Putin because the Russians bought like $500,000 worth of Facebook ads. This has been going on for a long time, and if we want to say that we need to respect the results of the election, I'm on board. But if we want to say, as Tim Walz is saying, that this is just a problem that Republicans have had, I don't buy that, governor,"" Vance continued.

TIM WALZ SAID HE WENT TO CHINA 'DOZENS' OF TIMES, NOW HIS CAMPAIGN SAYS ITS 'CLOSER TO 15'

Walz countered that ""Jan. 6 was not Facebook ads.""

""This idea that there's censorship to stop people from doing, threatening to kill someone, threatening to do something, that's not that's not censorship. Censorship is book banning. We've seen that. We've seen that brought up,"" he continued.

Walz continued that Trump has repeatedly claimed he won the 2020 presidential election.

""Did he lose the 2020 election?"" Walz asked Vance of Trump during the last election cycle.

""Tim, I'm focused on the future,"" Vance replied. ""Did Kamala Harris censor Americans from speaking their mind in the wake of the 2020 Covid situation?""

""That is a damning non-answer,"" Walz said. ""I'm pretty shocked by this. He lost the election. This is not a debate, it's not anything anywhere other than in Donald Trump's world.""

""It's a damning non-answer for you to not talk about censorship,"" Vance shot back.

New Jersey Democrat proposes bill to create travel advisories to inform pregnant women of state abortion laws,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/new-jersey-democrat-proposes-bill-create-travel-advisories-inform-pregnant-women-state-abortion-laws,2024-10-02T07:37:38Z,"Fox News Flash top headlines are here. Check out what's clicking on Foxnews.com.

A New Jersey Democrat introduced legislation establishing travel advisories informing women of restrictive abortion laws in other states they may be visiting.

The bill, proposed by state Sen. John Burzichelli, would require New Jersey's health and state departments to launch a website that would list color codes for states depending on how restrictive their abortion laws are, according to NJ Spotlight News.

""If you're an individual, a woman, traveling across this country for business -- or if you're thinking about going to school in Mississippi [for instance] -- it will help you to know what kind of medical services are available to you should you need emergency care of some kind,"" Burzichelli told the outlet.

The color codes under the ""Reproductive Health Travel Advisory"" are blue, yellow and red.

GEORGIA JUDGE OVERTURNS STATE'S SIX-WEEK 'HEARTBEAT' ABORTION LAW, CALLS IT 'UNCONSTITUTIONAL'

Blue would mean women can exercise normal caution and access to abortion would be available without fear of civil or criminal prosecution, and yellow would mean women should exercise increased caution as abortion restrictions could result in civil or criminal prosecution. Red would mean women are urged to reconsider travel because abortion access is extremely restricted and could result in medical issues and civil or criminal prosecution.

""Right now, there's no single place to go to say, 'OK I have to travel. I have to go to Texas and then move over and go to Tennessee,'"" Burzichelli said. ""You don't have that info at your fingertips. You can find it, but it's a hodge-podge.""

""You, as an American female, do not have equal rights across all 50 states,"" he added. ""And it's important for you to know what rights you don't have when you go somewhere, because something unexpected could happen.""

JUDGE BLOCKS NY AG LETITIA JAMES FROM TRYING TO SILENCE PREGNANCY CENTERS THAT PROMOTE ABORTION PILL REVERSAL

The proposal comes after the U.S. Supreme Court reversed Roe v. Wade in 2022, returning the power to make laws on abortion access back to the states.

Following the ruling, a number of Republican-controlled states enacted laws restricting abortion access, with some exceptions such as in cases of medical emergencies, while some Democrat-controlled states have approved advanced protections of abortion access.

""It's hard to imagine we're even talking about this in 2024 in America,"" Burzichelli said. ""To think that we have to think about even doing this just speaks volumes about where we are at the moment,""

New Jersey expanded access to abortion, enacting statutory protection for abortion as a fundamental right, and the state's highest court ruled the ""fundamental right of a woman to control her body and destiny"" is protected under the state's constitution, according to the Center for Reproductive Rights.

The state also welcomes women who travel from other states for an abortion because their own states have bans in place. Additionally, the Garden State protects them from being extradited after the procedure."

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz claimed during the CBS News Vice Presidential Debate that a woman in Georgia likely died due to the state's ""restrictive"" abortion laws following the overturning of Roe, despite doctors previously denouncing such a narrative as ""fearmongering.""

""There's a young woman named Amber Thurman. She happened to be in Georgia, a restrictive state. Because of that, she had to travel a long distance to North Carolina to try and get her care. Amber Thurmond died in that journey back and forth. The fact of the matter is, how can we as a nation say that your life and your rights, as basic as the right to control your own body, is determined on geography,"" Walz said during the debate while sparring with Vance on abortion laws.

""There's a very real chance that if Amber Thurman lived in Minnesota, she would be alive today. That's why the restoration of Roe versus Wade,"" he said.

Walz joined Ohio Sen. JD Vance in New York City on Tuesday evening where the pair squared off on key voter issues this election cycle, including the economy, immigration and abortion.

OB-GYNS DECRY THE 'FEARMONGERING' ABOUT GEORGIA'S ABORTION LAWS: 'THE LIES ARE HURTING WOMEN'

Walz's remarks come after ProPublica published an article last month blaming the deaths of two Georgia women, Amber Nicole Thurman and Candi Miller, on the overturning of Roe v. Wade and the state's new abortion limits after the women received chemically induced abortions in 2022. Georgia's heartbeat law states that ""no abortion shall be performed if the unborn child has a detectable human heartbeat except in the event of a medical emergency or medically futile pregnancy.""

Members of the Democratic Party, including Vice President Kamala Harris, have cited their deaths as evidence for the need to expand abortion access following the Supreme Court's 2022 ruling on Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization.

""Good policy, logical policy, moral policy, humane policy is about saying a healthcare provider will only start providing that care when you're about to die?"" Harris said during an Atlanta campaign event last month, while citing Thurman's death.

OB-GYNs have since criticized the narrative as a misleading story that is being pushed by the media and Democrats.

GEORGIA DOCTORS SPEAK OUT TO CHALLENGE MISINFORMATION ON STATE'S ABORTION LAW, DEATH OF AMBER THURMAN

""I was not surprised to see this pro-abortion media try to point the blame at Georgia's pro-life laws, but, in fact, Georgia's laws allow doctors to intervene to save the life of the woman,"" Charlotte Lozier Institute Vice President and Director of Medical Affairs Dr. Ingrid Skop recently told Fox News Digital.

""I think the focus of the Democratic Party upon abortion as an issue is only because the American people do not understand the laws. Many times, women are hurt by abortions. It is not necessary for women to live their best life. And, of course, it's the fearmongering and lies that have led us to this place where we are today, where people even think there would be a reason to point at the law.""

Rep. Rich McCormick, R-Ga., and state Rep. Mark Newton have also come out to say they don't believe Georgia laws had anything to do with Thurman's death, but was instead caused by alleged complications from abortion pills, as doctors may have waited too long to intercede.

HARRIS CALLS FOR ELIMINATING FILIBUSTER TO PASS 'ROE' ABORTION BILL INTO FEDERAL LAW

""We never deny a woman an abortion because it's going to harm her in some way. She will always be protected,"" McCormick said in a recent interview with Fox News Digital.

""You have every right to an abortion, even with that heartbeat law,"" he continued. ""So, let's make that very clear right now. When they say there's no exceptions, there's never any law in any state where there's no exceptions. That doesn't exist. That's simply not the way it works. The mother's life is always protected. With that said, it doesn't mean it's easy to get an abortion just because you have a complication or because something goes wrong.""

"Jelly Roll was 'so nervous' at the CMAs, the singer shattered his award",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/jelly-roll-broke-his-cma-award-after-winning-new-artist-year,2024-10-02T01:26:59Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Jelly Roll's CMA award was beautifully broken, just like his new album of the same name.

The country music star, 39, told Jimmy Fallon Monday night about how, after becoming one of the oldest people to ever win new artist of the year at the awards show in Nashville last year, he immediately ""fumbled"" the glass award.

Fallon then played a clip of the sound of shattering glass during a live local broadcast from backstage at the show.

""Oh goodness, Jelly Roll just broke his award,"" WKRN-TV reporter Stephanie Langston can be heard telling another reporter. ""Yeah, he's still standing there. I'm pretty sure it's his award. He just dropped it on the floor.""

COUNTRY MUSIC STAR JELLY ROLL BELIEVES 'GOD HAD A BIGGER PURPOSE' FOR HIM

""First of all, when it first dropped, you could've heard a mouse pee on cotton,"" Jelly Roll told Fallon. ""I mean, it was dead silent, and right after you could've heard a cricket fart, you heard a bunch of people go 'Aww.'""

He explained that the weight of the award and his sweaty palms likely played a role in the unfortunate incident.

""I was just so excited and so nervous that I had the sweatiest, shakiest palms,"" he said. ""And that thing is -- I'm already not a physically fit man -- and that thing's heavy. That thing was really heavy.

""And I was so excited, and I was going to change it from one hand to the other to shake somebody's hand, and it just boomed,"" he said. ""And I was like -- this is the story of my life though, Jimmy. I finally get my life together. I win the biggest award -- best new artist -- I was one of the oldest people to ever win it. I was 39 years old. I gave a passionate speech, and then I came backstage and fumbled the ball. Just fumbled the ball!""

""No, no, be you. Never stop being you, though,"" Fallon replied.

Jelly Roll added that he ""campaigned"" for the awards show to let him keep the broken one instead of getting a new one.

""I was like, 'I think it fits me great. I'll just duct tape it together,'"" he told Fallon.

The shattered award reportedly was just a generic one though.

A CMA official told The Tennessean last year the award hadn't been engraved yet because the winners weren't known beforehand.

Jelly Roll also described a concert during his struggling artist days that only five people showed up for, leading him to invite all the attendees to party in his van.

""It was a night we played outside of Sacramento, California, in Orangeville, little place called The Boardwalk,"" he explained.

""I pulled up, there was five people, and I felt so bad for the door guy, sound guy and the concessions guy. They were all the same person. And I felt so bad for him that I was like, 'Don't even open the door.' And I brought all five people in my RV.""

He told Fallon to imagine a ""1975 Cheech and Chong RV.""

""There was smoke coming out of the hood. There was smoke coming out of the inside,"" he said of his old RV. ""It smelled like Willie Nelson and cheap beer. It was all bad, man. I actually just brought all five onto the crappy RV and we just partaked in a peaceful pipe together. And I just told them I was sorry I couldn't perform.""

He explained that he canceled the show because he felt bad for the one guy working the show ""because, at that point, we needed to put two of the five people that bought a ticket to help him. He was doing three jobs.""

Telling Fallon how he turned around his life after dozens of arrests in his teens and 20s, the 39-year-old said, ""As cliché as it may sound, [the answer] is faith, finding love. It softened my heart. I fell in love with a woman and got married. I had a daughter. It changed my whole life. She's 16 now, so that's getting interesting, but it's still really good.

""And it just made me want to be a good father and a better human. And I knew I was just a crappy person for so long, man. I just destroyed. I was just a bad human, and now I'm trying to turn that around. I'm a totally different guy, man. It's awesome.""

He also talked about how he came up with the title for his new album and tour, ""Beautifully Broken.""

""I think that we're all a little broken, but I think it's finding beauty in that,"" he said. ""And we use kintsugi for the idea that they do in Japan that if something is worth saving when it breaks, that they bring it back together with gold and they polish it. That's kind of our message, man, is everybody's worth saving."""

The University of Wyoming women's volleyball team became the third in the nation to forfeit a game to San Jose State this season.

Wyoming joined Boise State and Southern Utah, all of which did not give a specific reason for the forfeit.

""After a lengthy discussion, the University of Wyoming will not play its scheduled conference match against San Jose State University,"" the volleyball program said in a statement on Tuesday. ""Per Mountain West Conference policy, the conference will record the match as a forfeit and a loss for Wyoming.""

Blaire Fleming, a transgender female, competes on San Jose State's team. Fleming is a redshirt junior at San Jose State University, who plays as an outside and right-side hitter and played two seasons at SJSU after previously playing at Coastal Carolina.

San Jose State responded in a statement to OutKick on Tuesday.

""It is disappointing that our SJSU student athletes, who are in full compliance with NCAA and Mountain West rules and regulations, are being denied opportunities to compete. We are committed to supporting our student-athletes through these challenges and in their ability to compete in an inclusive, fair, safe and respectful environment,"" the statement read.

Brooke Slusser, a member of San Jose's women's volleyball team, joined 18 other athletes in suing the NCAA over its current gender identity policies. The lawsuit alleged Slusser, who transferred to San Jose, felt concerned for her safety after realizing one of her new teammates was transgender.

Slusser claimed she was not aware that Fleming was transgender despite sharing rooms together on team trips, per the court documents. Slusser also expressed safety concerns for opponents playing against Fleming.

""Brooke estimates that Fleming's spikes were traveling upward of 80 mph, which was faster than she had ever seen a woman hit a volleyball,"" Slusser's complaint read. ""The girls were doing everything they could to dodge Fleming's spikes but still could not fully protect themselves.""

Former NCAA swimmer Riley Gaines, who is also engaged in a lawsuit against the NCAA for having to compete and share a locker room with transgender biological male opponent Lia Thomas, commended Boise State as the second program to refuse to compete against San Jose State in a statement to Fox News Digital on Sept. 27.

""I commend Boise State's athletic department and everyone involved in the decision to forfeit their match against undefeated San Jose State,"" Gaines said in a statement to Fox News Digital.

GOP GOVERNOR REVEALS WHY HE ORDERED SCHOOLS TO BAR TRANSGENDERS FROM GIRLS SPORTS

""Some principles transcend winning on the court, and the safety and well-being of female athletes is one of them. It's encouraging to witness a growing number of institutions prioritizing fairness and athlete safety over forced inclusion. I hope to see more universities follow the lead of Boise State and Southern Utah, standing up for what's right and protecting the integrity of women's sports.""

Utah governor Brad Little also commended Boise State for its decision. Little's state of Utah has been one of the most proactive in the nation in countering transgender inclusion in women's sports.

On Aug. 28, Little signed an executive order to enforce the ""Defending Women's Sports Act,"" which issued new protocols to the state's public school to promote the exclusion of transgenders in women's sports.

In an exclusive interview with Fox News Digital on Aug. 30, Little did not rule out administering gender eligibility tests for all girls and women's sports teams, but added that I'd have to see really good evidence that that's necessary.""

""From a national standpoint, there are radical little groups that want to implement changes in the rules that we have already. I'm confident in what we have, and we will aggressively (act), as the state of Idaho, both legally and legislatively, to protect women's athletes and the great advances they've made because of Title IX.""

In April, the Biden administration issued a sweep rule that clarified that Title IX's ban on ""sex"" discrimination in schools covers discrimination based on gender identity, sexual orientation and ""pregnancy or related conditions.""

The rule took effect Aug. 1, and, for the first time, the law stated that discrimination based on sex includes conduct related to a person's gender identity. The Biden administration insisted the regulation does not address athletic eligibility. However, multiple experts presented evidence to Fox News Digital in June that Biden's claims it would not result in biological men participating in women's sports weren't true and that the proposal would ultimately put more biological men in women's sports.

But current administration's efforts have faced heavy resistance from GOP lawmakers like Little and now individual schools and teams are even taking stands.

On Aug. 16, the Supreme Court voted 5-4 to reject a Biden administration emergency request to enforce portions of that new rule that includes protection from discrimination for transgender students under Title IX.

Now, Wyoming, Southern Utah and Boise State have added to that resistance."
"Breast cancer diagnoses spiking among women under 50, new report reveals",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/health/breast-cancer-diagnoses-spiking-among-women-under-50-new-report-reveals,2024-10-01T23:29:09Z,"Fox News senior medical analyst Dr. Marc Siegel explains how early detection for breast cancer has improved with the help of artificial intelligence and discusses the factors contributing the rise in stress in America.

Although breast cancer deaths have been declining for decades in the U.S., diagnoses have been on the uptick among women 50 and younger.

That's according to a new report from the American Cancer Society (ACS) -- Breast Cancer Statistics, 2024.

The good news is that since 1989, breast cancer mortality has declined overall by 44% -- but diagnoses of the disease have been rising by 1% each year between 2012 and 2021.

BREAST CANCER SCREENINGS MAY DECLINE FOR WOMEN WHO RECEIVE FALSE-POSITIVE TEST RESULTS, SAYS STUDY

The biggest spike was seen among women younger than 50 (1.4% per year) and Asian-American/Pacific-Islander women (up to 2.7% per year), the report revealed.

The findings were published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians.

""Although the breast cancer death rate has declined by 44% thanks to advances in early detection and treatment, the continued increase in breast cancer incidence may slow progress in the future,"" lead author Angela Giaquinto, associate scientist in cancer surveillance research at the ACS, told Fox News Digital.

That is especially the case among women younger than 50, she said, whose rates are increasing by 1.4% per year compared to 0.7% per year in older women.

THESE 17 CANCER TYPES ARE MORE COMMON IN GEN X AND MILLENNIALS, AS STUDY NOTES 'ALARMING TREND'

Dr. William Dahut, chief scientific officer at the ACS, noted that women are ""a lot less likely"" to die from breast cancer, but that ""alarming disparities"" still remain -- particularly for Asian-American, Pacific Islander, Native American and Black women.

""These gaps need to be rectified through systematic efforts to ensure access to high-quality screening and treatment for every woman,"" he said in the release.

The report compiled cancer data from the National Cancer Institute's Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Program of Cancer Registries (NPCR), and the National Center for Health Statistics.

Second only to skin cancer, breast cancer is the most prevalent cancer among women.

""The reasons for the increased prevalence in breast cancer in younger patients is complicated, multifaceted and still being studied.""

This year, approximately 310,720 women will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer and around 42,250 will die from the disease, according to the ACS.

""The increased prevalence of breast cancer is not only an issue in the U.S. -- we are seeing similar trends in other countries as well,"" Dr. Christopher McGreevy, associate chief of breast surgery at Hackensack University Medical Center in New Jersey, told Fox News Digital.

""The reasons for the increased prevalence of breast cancer in younger patients are complicated, multifaceted and still being studied,"" said McGreevy, who was not involved in the report.

SENIORS AND BREAST CANCER: WHY AREN'T OLDER WOMEN TOLD TO GET MAMMOGRAMS?

One reason for early-onset breast cancer is that more patients are obese, the doctor noted.

""Excess weight, particularly after menopause, fuels estrogen production, a key driver of certain breast cancers,"" he said.

Delayed childbearing can also increase the onset of the disease, McGreevy noted, as pregnancy reduces women's breast cancer risk.

""Environmental toxins, lurking in everything from plastics to pesticides, are also suspected contributors,"" he said.

""These endocrine disruptors mimic estrogen in the body, potentially triggering abnormal cell growth.""

Genetics could also factor into the uptick, according to the doctor.

""Certain gene mutations, like BRCA1 and BRCA2, significantly elevate the risk of breast cancer, even at a young age,"" he said.

The rise among younger women could also be a consequence of the COVID-19 pandemic, fueled by delayed diagnoses due to interruptions in screening, according to the researchers.

There were some limitations associated with the study, the researchers acknowledged.

""The risk and trends in the study are for all women and are not able to account for individual patient characteristics, such as comorbidities or treatment received, or control for social determinants of health, such as insurance status,"" Giaquinto told Fox News Digital.

""We also present statistics for the broadly defined racial and ethnic groups, which mask substantial differences within these populations.""

The best means of prevention is to talk to your doctor about getting screened, according to Giaquinto.

""Early detection of breast cancer is one of the best tools we have for improving survival,"" she told Fox News Digital.

""All women should keep up to date with their recommended breast cancer screenings. This is especially relevant for younger women, as the recommended age of the United States Preventive Services Task Force was recently dropped to age 40.""

Women should also be aware of their family history and personal risk factors, Giaquinto added.

""Women can also reduce their risk of breast cancer by moderating alcohol consumption if they drink, maintaining a healthy body weight and being physically active,"" the researcher advised.

""About 30% of all breast cancers are attributed to these lifestyle factors."""

Pete Rose on MLB ban for gambling in last interview: 'Other guys will kill somebody and be back in the game',Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/sports/pete-rose-mlb-ban-gambling-last-interview-other-guys-kill-somebody-back-game,2024-10-01T19:46:03Z,"Fox News' Chad Pergram appears on OutKick's ""The Ricky Cobb Show"" to talk about MLB legend Pete Rose.

Just weeks before baseball hit king Pete Rose died at the age of 83 on Monday, he addressed his lifetime banishment from MLB for betting on games in his final TV interview.

Rose, who still holds the record for most hits in MLB history with 4,256 but isn't in the Hall of Fame amid his banishment, admitted that he was ""wrong,"" while speaking to KTLA Los Angeles on Sept. 7.

However, he also advocated for himself while suggesting other players have allegedly committed murders and returned to the field.

""It's been a long time, and there's been a lot of negative things happen in the world of baseball,"" Rose said. ""I was absolutely 110% wrong for what I did... and that's bet on baseball games, and now you're punished for the rest of your life... When other guys will kill somebody, or they'll be strung out on drugs and they'll beat their wives and stuff like that, in a couple years, they're back in the game.""

There have been no reported incidents of a player who committed homicide and was allowed to return to the major leagues. But in 1920, New York Yankees pitcher Carl Mays hit Cleveland Indians shortstop Ray Chapman in the head with a pitch, which caused Chapman to die. Mays continued playing for the Yankees until 1923, then even played for the Cincinnati Reds and Giants after that.

The most recent MLB player to be convicted of murder is former Mets and Milwaukee Brewers pitcher Julio Machado, who was imprisoned for involuntary murder in Venezuela in December 1992 for shooting a woman after a car accident. Machado's 12-year sentence was cut short as he was released in 2000, but he never returned to the majors. He did, however, coach and play in Venezuelan winter baseball leagues after his release.

Meanwhile, Rose was banned for life from MLB in 1989 after an investigation concluded that he not only gambled on MLB games but went so far as to wager on games involving the Cincinnati Reds when he was managing the team. Rose signed an agreement with Commissioner Bart Giamatti declaring him permanently ineligible for baseball but allowing him to petition for reinstatement and avoid a formal declaration that he bet on baseball. Multiple appeals by Rose for reinstatement over the last few decades have failed.

""There's nothing I can change about the history of Pete Rose,"" Rose said.

However, Rose held out hope that he may one day still get in, and brought up the fact that sports gambling has become a multimillion-dollar legalized industry that MLB and major sports brands have embraced, while it was illegal when Rose was caught doing it.

LEGENDARY SPORTSCASTER JIM GRAY REMEMBERS MLB GREAT PETE ROSE

""I keep convincing myself or telling myself, 'Hang in there, Pete, you'll get a second chance,'"" he said. ""There's a lot of people gambling on sports, there's no question about it. And ESPN makes a lot of money based on people betting on sports. Baseball makes a lot of money on people betting on sports... I have nothing bad to say about that. Baseball does what it does because it's the world of baseball and they're king.

""I don't think it makes a lot of sense to people.""

However, while sports gambling has become a lucrative and widely used industry, professional athletes across multiple leagues are still subject to discipline for gambling on their own sports. In June, former Pirates player Tucupita Marcano received a lifetime ban from MLB as well, after an investigation found that he placed 387 baseball bets totaling more than $150,000 in October 2022 and from last July through November with a legal sports book. Like Rose, Marcano was discovered to have bet on his own team while playing with them.

Marcano became the first active player since 1924 to be banned for life for such offenses, as Rose received his ban as a manager, three years after his playing career had ended.

In March, Rose commented on a gambling scandal involving Los Angeles Dodgers superstar Shohei Ohtani and his interpreter Ippei Mizuhara, after an investigation found that Mizuhara stole $4.5 million from Ohtani and bet on MLB games under the superstar's name.

""Well, back in the '70s and '80s, I wish I'd have had an interpreter. I'd be scot-free,"" Rose said in a video posted to X.

As a player, Rose won three World Series titles, two with the Reds and one with the Philllies, while making 17 All-Star games and winning NL MVP in 1973. Yet, his betting scandal has made him one of the most controversial holdouts of the baseball Hall of Fame since his retirement. He wouldn't live to see if he made it, after he was found dead at his home Monday in Clark County, Nevada.

Rose had not been in the care of a doctor at the time of his death, according to multiple reports. His home is being examined and the cause of death remains under investigation.

Rose's death came just one day after he attended the Williamson County Agricultural EXPO Park on Sunday afternoon, where he signed autographs with Ken Griffey Sr., Dave Concepcion, Tony Perez and George Foster, according to Newsday.

""He was all smiles, took photos with the fans and signed many autographs,"" said Michelle Phelps, who worked the show on Sunday alongside her husband."
The serious crisis gripping America that no one wants to talk about,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/serious-crisis-gripping-america-no-one-wants-talk-about,2024-10-01T14:15:24Z,"By entering your email and pushing continue, you are agreeing to Fox News' Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, which includes our Notice of Financial Incentive.

Children growing up without fathers in the home is one of the most serious crises facing America today. The impact is devastating on spiritual, religious, and material levels. Over 80 percent of the children in my neighborhood on the South Side of Chicago do not have a father, but this not something that can be just dismissed as a ""Black thing."" It is an American epidemic.

Across the nation, 56 percent of Black children do not have a father in the home. For Latinos that number has risen to 31 percent and for whites, 21 percent. Those figures are only snapshots and the reality is that they are getting worse, not better, with every passing year.

For perspective, 89 percent of the ""post-war generation,"" including most Black families I know, had children living in homes with a mother and a father. That number has fallen to 68% today among all American families. That's millions of children being affected.

SCHOOLS ALL OVER AMERICA ARE FAILING OUR KIDS. PARENTS, THIS MESSAGE IS FOR YOU

But I am here today not to bash fatherlessness but to talk about what happens when fathers are present. Every day, I deal with some of the most amazing women who raise their kids singlehandedly. They work their butts off to put food on the table and clothe their kids. But most, if not any, can ever replicate the influence and touch of a father.

The father is part of the creation of the child and it is only natural law that he would see the child to adulthood. This role is at once sacred and a profound responsibility, one that is a higher calling. There is nothing more precious than looking into the eyes of a child of innocence, a child that comes into this world looking for love, a child that recognizes his or her father on the deepest levels.

When a father abandons that child, that bond breaks, leaving a void. Instead of love, that child grows up with that void and that child is often left, unfairly, to deal with that void alone. Some make it. Others destruct.

WHY SOCIETY IS FAILING MEN AND BOYS

In the home where a child grows up with two parents, the child witnesses love. The circle is complete. No one's home is happy all the time, but the child does not seek happiness. The child seeks love, wants to be loved, and wants to give love in return. It is love that carries families through the good and bad times and what better lesson than that to teach the child daily?

Not only that, the child learns different things from the mother and the father. The child learns the differences and the similarities. The child watches his parents negotiate, love, fight, reconcile, discuss, debate, and the child grows up understanding inside the home the basic human skills for how to navigate the world. His or her parents' relationship serves as a microcosm for how the larger society works.

Marriage is very important. I often tell young men that the most important thing they can do is marry. They ask why?

I tell them, if you love your woman, you must enter into a holy union with her. You must declare your love before witnesses in society. In doing so, you are forming a sacred bond that also serves as a social contract. This step is the foundation of the family and provides stability for any children that should come out of this union.

When a child grows up with a married couple, not only are they often better off financially, they also come to value society through the institution of marriage. They grow up knowing that certain actions have a sacredness to them. They believe in something larger than themselves and that humbles them. The child who believes in nothing is the least humble.

A father in the home, a husband in marriage, is what America needs to be preaching these days. We are not better than the humans that came before us despite our wealth and technology. They did families better than we do today. They knew that each parent played a role and it was not about feminism or machismo -- it was all about the child. And they knew, how the child goes is how society goes."
Unzipping the truth: Fox Nation series reveals how Dr. Michael Baden's forensics turned cases on their heads,Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/media/unzipping-truth-fox-nation-reveals-michael-baden-forensics-cases-heads,2024-10-01T13:49:45Z,"Fox Nation's 'The Baden Files' follows three cases that forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden helped investigate after they appeared to go cold.

Hope and justice go hand-in-hand, and Dr. Michael Baden delivered both to some families who, at one point, had neither.

The renowned forensic pathologist also saved an innocent man from a life behind bars.

How he did it is the subject of the latest Fox Nation series, ""The Baden Files.""

""In my lifetime, I performed more than 20,000 autopsies. I've been asked by Congress to investigate the deaths of very famous people like President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., but more than 99% of my work has been on lesser-known cases,"" Baden told viewers.

COLD CASES CRACKED: HOW EXPERTS ARE SOLVING HUNDREDS OF VIOLENT CRIME MYSTERIES AFTER DECADES OF NO ANSWERS

Bringing in Baden helped reawaken some cases that had appeared to go cold with time, including one that unfolded in Council Bluffs, Iowa.

After apparent murder victim Ilene Gowan's family vowed to seek justice for her, they brought in Baden to look deeper into her case.

""One particular case brought me out to the Midwest, to an investigation that was more like a puzzle - a stolen safe, a body in a ditch, a missing cell phone..."" Baden narrated.

But none of those explained what had happened to Gowan. The piece that did help? An ordinary zipper.

The first episode of ""The Baden Files"" focuses on that unconventional piece of evidence, and how it helped unravel a devastating truth - Gowan had been strangled, and her ""undetermined"" cause of death shifted to ""homicide.""

THE ROLE OF FORENSIC SCIENCE IN SOLVING TRUE CRIME CASES

""This tells me what happened. Not who done it - that's up to the police,"" Baden said, holding up a photo of the marking.

But the investigation had quickly narrowed two suspects to one that offered a damning piece of information.

HOW DO TRUE CRIME PODCASTS IMPACT PUBLIC INTEREST IN CRIMINAL CASES?

Baden also assisted with the case of Ellen Andros, a wife and mother whose death led the community to cast suspicion on her husband, an Atlantic City cop who came home from a night of drinking and discovered her dead.

As a healthy 31-year-old woman, evidence - particularly small red markings on her face - pointed to homicide. But things weren't exactly as they seemed.

""Forensic pathology provides a way to speak to the dead from beyond the grave,"" Baden said. ""And, in this case, Ellen Andros had a lot to say to me.""

The series also follows Dr. Baden's involvement in the investigation of the ""West Memphis Three,"" a case surrounding three teen boys arrested for the murder of three eight-year-old Cub Scouts in West Memphis, Arkansas in 1993.

Years later, Dr. Baden was brought into the picture, and he arrived at a conclusion that spun the original forensic analysis on its head.

""The answers are there. You just have to know what to look for."""

Black voters across several states spoke with Fox News Digital about whether they were far better off 4 years ago under former President Trump. Voters from Atlanta, Chicago, and Detroit shared if their financial situations had improved or gotten worse since the Biden-Harris administration took over.

One Black man from Chicago said that he has been ""shaking"" under the current economy.

""[The economy has gotten] really moreso worse. A lot of stuff hasn't really been getting better,"" Emmanuel told Fox News Digital. ""Everything went up.""

""Inflation has been terrible. And the person that was in the office there, he wasn't really doing too much for us,"" Atlanta resident Marcellus said.

PHILLY VOTERS SOUND OFF ON ECONOMY: 'EVERYBODY IS STRUGGLING RIGHT NOW'

""When Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower,"" he added.

However, several voters said because Harris has not served as president, led them to believe she still has a chance to prove herself.

""Kamala, from my understanding, has never really been in office as the president like that ... she has been vice president,"" said Porter, a student at Harold Washington College in Chicago.

Porter, who lived in the Windy City his entire life, said ""I would say that I would have no answer for that. But I believe that when Kamala is elected towards office, her policies and what she believes in will better fit my needs as a person.""

Anneliese, another Chicago resident, said that she ""was absolutely not better under the Trump presidency.""

""Well, I wasn't under Kamala's leadership as president. I was under her vice presidency, so she was never president. Some people also get that messed up,"" she said. ""Ever since Trump started running, I experienced a lot more ... racial discrimination, gender discrimination. And I can't speak to the Kamala presidency because she hasn't been president yet.""

In Atlanta, Tim, raised the fact that Harris has never served as president.

""That's a question that we don't know yet. Right? Kamala not even in office yet, so we can't speak on it,"" Tim said. ""We just want to speak from what we can see, we have experience living under. So I guess you won't have to just wait for Kamala and see what Trump did.""

'HE HAS A WAY OF CONNECTING WITH OUR PEOPLE': SOUTHSIDE CHICAGO RESIDENT BELIEVES TRUMP IS GAINING SUPPORT

Over in Michigan, Black voters weighed in on whether they were better off under either candidate, with one of them saying that Harris ""did not do anything.""

Ithmamqureshi told Fox News Digital that he was better off under Trump.""Obviously, life was better and all that,"" Ithmamqureshi, a student in Detroit and Hamtramck native, told Fox News Digital. ""The economy was better ... life was better. COVID did take a hit and change everything to the fullest. But I would say life was better before 2020.""

""I want be biased, but I want to say I think its time for history to be made. I just think that its going to be a woman president,"" Detroit resident Mandela said.

""Trump. Them [stimulus checks] was fire tho,"" east side Detroit resident Keandre said. ""Definitely, when Trump was in office, it was gas prices that were lower."""

A mother hoping to compete in Miss America slammed the pageant's ""rule"" that prohibits women with ""legal dependents"" from participating.

""When I first learned about it, I just was really disappointed,"" Danielle Hazel told Fox News Digital. ""And it was unexpected for me. I didn't really know that that was a rule. So, it was really shocking to find out.""

Hazel filed a complaint with the New York City Commission on Human Rights on Sept. 16, requesting the ""discriminatory requirement"" be removed.

The former beauty pageant hopeful noted that motherhood doesn't stop one from having a job, which is what winning the competition entails.

""So, if you're a mom, it's not an obstacle that's in the way,"" Hazel explained. ""It shouldn't be an obstacle.""

2024 MISS AMERICA AIMS TO 'MESH' NEW ROLE WITH AIR FORCE CAREER TO ENCOURAGE OTHERS TO JOIN THE SERVICE

At age 19, Hazel was not allowed to compete in Miss America because she had a son.

""When I told Zion, who is now 6 years old, about these rules, he had an immediate gut reaction. He said that these rules are stupid,"" Hazel said at a press conference. ""His sense of fairness at only 6 years old tells him that this is unjust and makes no sense.""

For Hazel, filing the complaint was a way to ""make a difference.""

""Sometimes it only takes one person,"" she told Fox News Digital. ""I wanted to be able to at least have some kind of impact, even if it wasn't going to be successful. I wanted to at least show that I tried.""

Hazel's complaint was received by the New York City Commission on Human Rights, according to her lawyer, Gloria Allred. The organization chose to serve the complaint to Miss America and Miss World, and Allred said action would be taken soon.

""On a societal level, I feel like there has been a lot of - I guess it is a stigma against moms but not all moms,"" Hazel said. ""I mean, specifically, if you're a single mom, there's even a bigger stigma, because then there's this idea that somehow you're less than ... somehow you're not as worthy.""

""Even though you are powerful, and you are capable, you're still kind of seen as your value is less. I don't understand that.""

A representative for Miss America said in a statement that the complaint brought by Hazel and Allred is ""not factually accurate.""

""There is no ban against mothers. The only ban is against potential contestants with legal dependents,"" the statement reads. ""In other words, if you are responsible for the daily welfare of the child, that welfare must take precedence over wishing to compete in the contest. The rule has nothing to do with any attack on motherhood. It is solely to protect the welfare of minors dependent on their legal guardians.""

""That legal guardian could be someone who is the child's mother, or it could be someone who has become the legal guardian of the child without being the mother,"" the representative wrote. ""Someone who is a mother who has no responsibility for the child (for example, someone who gave up custody or the child for adoption, etc.) is not banned.""

""Essentially, the complaint filed with the NYC Human Rights Commission is a false document filed with a government agency,"" the statement continued. ""Paragraph 6 of the complaint, for example, is a stunningly false statement. Miss America stands apart from contests such as Miss World. There is no connection to them, and our standards are significantly different. Miss America is a more than century-old institution that observes the highest standards of conduct, ethics, etc. That puts us in conflict sometimes with those who do not share those standards. Protecting the welfare of children is consistent with those standards.""

Allred challenged a similar rule in California after a mother was denied eligibility to compete in the Miss California pageant. The pageant is part of the Miss Universe and Miss USA organizations.

After Andrea Quiroga filed a complaint with the California Civil Rights Department, Miss Universe got rid of its 70-year-old rule.

Allred slammed the beauty pageant ""rule"" barring mothers from competing in a ""business opportunity.""

""Sometimes single moms, for example, have parents who will also take care of the children. Sometimes children are in child care. And mothers, yes, are generally the ones that are responsible, especially single moms,"" Allred told Fox News Digital ""And they have the physical, emotional and often financial responsibility for children.""

""And now to block them from a business opportunity, which is what these pageants are - as well as a social opportunity, economic opportunity - to exclude them simply because of an old stereotype that mothers have to be home with children is wrong.""

Allred also represents Veronika Didusenko, a woman who was crowned Miss Ukraine in 2018. She was later stripped of her title because she had a son.

""In 2018, I lost my victory in the Miss Ukraine pageant (which is part of Miss World) because I had a young son,"" she said in a statement at a press conference. ""One of the judges at the Miss Ukraine pageant, Bohdan Yusypchuk, pointed at me live on air and said, 'She had a child at the age of 19 and then divorced. I think it's wrong to make such [a] person a role model.'""

Didusenko has since launched the #RightToBeAMother global initiative and has worked to fight the discrimination of young mothers within the beauty pageant industry."

Aside from keeping up with her career, Twain has also maintained her physique and has kept her health well. She told Fox News Digital there's ""no secret"" to staying fit as she embraces the final year of her 50s.

""I enjoy good health and I think happiness has everything to do with it,"" Twain said.

Earlier this year, Twain opened up about aging and accepting herself and her body as it is. To do so, the country music legend often looks at herself naked in the mirror.

""I decided that wherever there was a mirror, and I was naked in my house or hotel, that I would keep the lights on, and I would look in the mirror,"" Twain told The Sun's Bizarre columnist Jack Hardwick in May.

""A lot of people as they start aging - and even young people - they don't want to look at themselves in the mirror naked, and I think that is such a shame.""

Twain isn't afraid to see ""another sag"" or cellulite.

""Every month or day that I may notice another sag or another bit of cellulite, I want to know it's there,"" she explained.

""I want to be OK with it instead of thinking I have to cover it up or not to look,"" the musician added. ""I can't change it and I don't plan on changing it superficially.""

The ""You're Still The One"" singer previously revealed her pre-show routine: an all-liquid diet.

""If I eat any solids hours before the show, I'll have to burp,"" Twain previously told People magazine. ""It's just a nightmare because you have to sing around the burp, and it's distracting in itself. So, I usually don't eat any solids at all on show days until after the show, only liquids."""
"Hezbollah terrorists engaged in sex slavery, rape, mass murder of Syrians",Fox News,,https://www.foxnews.com/world/hezbollah-terrorists-engaged-sex-slavery-rape-mass-murder-syrians,2024-10-01T08:07:05Z,"JERUSALEM -- Photos of Syrians celebrating the assassination of Hezbollah terrorist leader Hassan Nasrallah last week put the spotlight on the brutal activities of the terror group's role in sex slavery, mass starvation and kidnappings in the Syrian civil war which led to the deaths of over half a million Syrians.

Walid Phares, a leading expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah has ""committed ethnic cleansing"" in Syria. He said Hezbollah ""was behind the uprooting of millions of Syrians, of all communities, mainly Sunni. They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Israel's targeted assassination of Nasrallah last weekend has prompted greater interest in the inner workings of the Shiite terrorist organization that is widely considered the de facto ruler over Lebanon.

IRAN OFFICIAL ADMITS COUNTRY'S ROLE IN TERROR BOMBING THAT KILLED 241 US MILITARY MEMBERS: REPORT

The Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorist entity is mainly known in America for bombing the U.S. Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people in 1983, and the Marine barracks bombing in Beirut also in 1983, resulting in the murders of 241 U.S. military personnel.

A new investigative video series by the Center for Peace Communications (CPC) shines a rare light on the U.S.-designated terrorist movement Hezbollah's role in sexual slavery, rape and mass murder. The shocking expose about Hezbollah's enslavement of a Syrian woman aired days after Israel reportedly launched devastating explosions of pagers held by thousands of Hezbollah terrorists across Lebanon in September.

CPC President Joseph Braude told Fox News Digital ""Hezbollah's war on Israel obscures its larger war to subjugate much of the region -- as a tyrant in Lebanon, an occupier in Syria, a mafia of sex and drug trafficking, and the nerve center of Iran's Arab empire. Millions of Arabs whose lives have been shattered by the militia want a different future. Hezbollah does not want the world to hear their voices.""

CPC's previous series, called ""Whispered in Gaza,"" which was viewed over 20 million times, led to a Fatwa being issued against Hamas by Iraqi and Pakistani clerics. It was used by Gaza anti-Hamas activists during the July 2023 street protests against the terror organization's rule.

He added ""'Hezbollah's Hostages,' an eight-part series produced by the Center for Peace Communications and presented by The Free Press, features the actual recorded testimony of Lebanese and Syrian civilians in Hezbollah's grip. To protect their identities and honor their lives, each recorded interview is accompanied visually by creative images and animation.""

One video depicts the kidnapping and sexual enslavement of Alya, a married 20-year-old woman from the northern Syrian city of Raqqa. She reveals how Yusuf, a member of Hezbollah, ""stalked"" her for months and eventually took her hostage.

Hezbollah took the side of the Syrian dictator Bashar Assad after civilians launched a protest movement in 2011 to secure democracy in the highly repressive nation.

Hezbollah terrorists aided Assad in his scorched-earth campaign to wipe out opposition to his regime, resulting in the killing of over 500,000 people. Syria is now a fragmented and war-ravaged country.

HEZBOLLAH BIGGER CHALLENGE THAN HAMAS TO ISRAEL: 'CROWN JEWEL IN THE IRANIAN EMPIRE OF TERROR'

""They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Hezbollah's ally, the Sunni terrorist movement Hamas, engaged in rapes and sustained sexual assaults of Israeli women and men after the jihadi terrorist organization invaded Israel on Oct. 7.

Hezbollah joined Hamas' war against Israel on Oct. 8 when it launched rockets into northern Israel. Hamas slaughtered nearly 1,200 people on Oct. 7, including over 30 Americans.

The fundamental corruption and mafia-style criminality of Hezbollah's global organization has been examined by Matthew Levitt, the director of the Reinhard Program on Counterterrorism and Intelligence at The Washington Institute.

He published a 2018 report on ""Hezbollah's Corruption Crisis Runs Deep."" Levitt noted that ""some prominent figures in Hezbollah are involved in horrific criminal enterprises, including trafficking in sex and human beings."" He cited the example of Hezbollah official Ali Hussein Zeaiter, who according to media reports, was linked to ""a large prostitution network, mainly employing Syrian women.""

Hezbollah's criminal enterprise and terrorism continue to impact Americans.

HOW LEBANON'S HEZBOLLAH GROUP BECAME A CRITICAL PLAYER IN THE ISRAEL-HAMAS WAR

Zoya Fakhoury, executive director of the Amer Foundation, told Fox News Digital that ""Hezbollah is a proxy group of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps that has the blood of thousands of innocent individuals, including American citizens, on their hands. The death of Hassan Nasrallah is a significant step towards accountability for many individuals but particularly for my family. My father, Amer Fakhoury, was a former U.S. hostage unlawfully detained under direct orders from Hassan Nasrallah.""

She continued, ""He was used a political pawn by Hezbollah and died because of the torture he faced in Lebanon. We hope to see the Lebanese government take this opportunity of the dismantling of Hezbollah to free Lebanon from the occupation of the Islamic Republic and work towards a path of peace.""

In August, Fox News Digital reported the new book by Fakhoury's four daughters covering a first-hand account of his detainment and the harrowing rescue operation to bring him back home to the United States in their book, ""Silenced in Beirut: American Businessman Amer Fakhour's Six-Month Ordeal as a Hostage In Lebanon.""

Walid Phares, a leading expert on Hezbollah and Lebanon, told Fox News Digital that Hezbollah has ""committed ethnic cleansing"" in Syria. He said Hezbollah ""was behind the uprooting of millions of Syrians, of all communities, mainly Sunni. They have perpetrated rape. They have perpetrated mass sexual abuse, including keeping sexual slaves.""

Phares, who has advised U.S. presidential candidates on Mideast foreign policy, said the Hezbollah jihadis defend their hostage taking of women as under Islamist Sharia law that they can take women from the ""enemy camp.""

ISRAEL DEGRADES IRAN-BACKED HEZBOLLAH TERRORISTS IN SPECTACULAR PAGER EXPLOSION OPERATION: EXPERTS

He said there is no doubt that if Hezbollah captured Israeli women, they would treat them the same way as the enslaved Syrian women. Phares added that if Hezbollah captured a kibbutz, village or town in Israel, one ""can expect that they will kill the males and the capture the women. Some would be raped and killed and other Israeli women would be kept by Hezbollah.""

Hezbollah is not different from the Islamic state in applying jihadi ideology, said Phares. Hezbollah ""is a global threat. Look at how they treat their own women and how they separate them and organize them in the service of jihadists.""

Braude said that ""'Hezbollah's Hostages' debuted on Sept. 16, one day before pagers exploded across Lebanon. A new episode debuts every Monday through Nov. 4. In forthcoming episodes, we will probe the Hezbollah stronghold of Dahiyeh, just outside Beirut, with help from Shi'ite civilians who live there.""

He added ""Dahiyeh is the shadow capital of Lebanon -- home of Hezbollah's intelligence apparatus, politburo, and prisons -- as well as the central node to all Iran's proxies in the region, from the Houthis of Yemen to Iraq's militias to Palestinian Islamic Jihad and Hamas. Yet the same landscape is also home to some of Hezbollah's many opponents - and in later episodes, we meet them too: Shiite veterans of the countrywide 2019 street protests, who dared to demand a different future; civic activists striving to end the war on Israel, liberate young minds, and restore the rule of law in Lebanon."""
"Who Is Peter Todd, The Man Named By HBO As Bitcoin's Mystery Creator Satoshi Nakamoto?",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/08/who-is-peter-todd-the-man-named-by-hbo-as-bitcoins-mystery-creator-satoshi-nakamoto/,2024-10-08T22:05:17Z,"Satoshi Nakamoto -- the mysterious, anonymous creator of bitcoin -- has successfully kept their real identity hidden since they published bitcoin's white paper in 2008.

Bitcoin has become a $1.2 trillion asset (though one Wall Street giant has predicted it could be about to go far higher) over the last 15 years -- making the man, woman or group known only as Satoshi Nakamoto worth almost $70 billion if they still control the 1.1 million bitcoins they're believed to hold across a series of wallet addresses, pieced together by blockchain sleuths.

Now, HBO documentary film maker Cullen Hoback has named Peter Todd, a bitcoin core developer who has been involved with bitcoin since 2010, as who he believes to be the real-world identity of Satoshi Nakamoto.

Sign up now for the free CryptoCodex -- A daily five-minute newsletter for traders, investors and the crypto-curious that will get you up to date and keep you ahead of the bitcoin and crypto market bull run

""What if the real reason for using the name Satoshi, for the anonymity, was so that people could take bitcoin seriously, so they could believe it was created by [a famous cryptographer] and not some kid still in school,"" Hoback said during the Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery documentary on HBO before putting his theory directly to Todd -- who was in his early 20s and finishing a fine arts degree in 2008, the year Satoshi Nakamoto published the bitcoin white paper.

""Here's what I think happened, possibly,"" Hoback said, speaking on camera to Todd and Adam Back, the chief executive of bitcoin development company Blockstream that Todd has worked with since the earliest days of bitcoin.

""I think that John Dillon [an anonymous BitcoinTalk contributor that some believe to have been linked to the intelligence community] was created so you would have an excuse to make replace-by-fee, a concept you had envisioned years earlier but needed some kind of cover in order to make, and you also needed some cover for the 2010 post,"" Hoback told Todd, referring to the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal 125 introduced by Todd in 2015 and a 2010 BitcoinTalk post replying to Satoshi Nakamoto that Hoback believes was accidentally posted using Todd's profile.

Hoback's theory relies on a chat log message written by Todd in which he claims to be the ""world's leading expert on how to sacrifice your bitcoins ... I've done one such sacrifice and I did it by hand,"" Todd wrote.

Hoback characterized the message as an ""admission"" by Todd that he destroyed his ability to access the 1.1 million bitcoin believed to be held by Satoshi Nakamoto, something Todd denies.

""It's ludicrous,"" Todd told Hoback, also denying he's John Dillon. ""This is going to be very funny when you put this into the documentary and a bunch of bitcoiners watch it.""

Ahead of the documentar airing, leaked clips appeared online, spreading on the social media site X.

In a statement to Coindesk, Todd denied he's Satoshi Nakamoto, saying Hoback is ""grasping at straws.""

Todd is a Canadian who started contributing to bitcoin's code in 2012 and describes himself as a ""cryptochronomancer"" on X.

During bitcoin's so-called blocksize war, waged from August 2015 to November 2017, Todd was on the side of the ""small blockers"" -- along with Adam Back and Blockstream -- who wanted to keep bitcoin's 1 megabyte limit, arguing against the ""big blockers"" who wanted to increase the block size to enable cheaper and faster transactions.

The small blockers won, forcing those who had opted to increase the blocksize to ""fork"" from bitcoin, creating the bitcoin cash cryptocurrency.

Todd is the founder of OpenTimestamps, an open-source project designed to provide a standard format for blockchain timestamping.

He has worked on so-called ""bitcoin 2.0"" projects, including Counterparty, Mastercoin and Colored Coins and was involved in the launch of privacy coin zcash in 2016 alongside NSA whistle blower Edward Snowden -- publicly destroying the computer he used to create the cryptocurrency.

In 2019, Todd was accused of sexual misconduct by privacy-tech expert Isis Lovecruft, a developer of the Tor identity-masking onion browser, settling his defamation suit filed in response to the allegation in 2020."
Inside Project 2025 And Its Connection To Donald Trump,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikepatton/2024/10/08/inside-project-2025-and-its-connection-to-donald-trump/,2024-10-08T20:15:42Z,"There has been a lot of discussion about Trump's connection to Project 2025, a 922-page document, written by the conservative think tank the Heritage Foundation. Is the Democrat's assertion that Trump is connected to the effort, correct? What does Project 2025 actually say? Project 2025 contains a multitude of items, more than we can cover in this article.

Is Trump connected to Project 2025? According to the slightly left leaning newspaper USA Today, this is a false assertion (read more here). The slightly right leaning NY Post also refutes the notion that Trump is connected to it. CNN has gone on record to say that Harris has made false claims about Trump and Project 2025. She said Trump, if elected, would cut Social Security. While the document says very little about Social Security, it does not propose cuts in the program (read more here).

Why then are Democrats claiming a Trump connection to Project 2025? In this hotly contested political race, each party is looking for ways to attack the credibility of the other and instill fear in the electorate to garner votes. To accomplish this, each party has made assertions about their opponent with the hope that it will resonate in the minds of undecided voters. While there may be several reasons to be hesitant about a second Trump presidency, his connection to Project 2025 or lack thereof, isn't one of them. What is true about Project 2025? Here's what I found after reading much of the 922-page document.

The Heritage Foundation published Project 2025 in 2023. There were 34 authors, 276 contributors, and 2 editors. Among the contributors, about 71% of them worked for the federal government during the first Trump administration. Some worked closely with Trump himself.

What prompted the creation of Project 2025? The premise behind it is that the federal government is far too powerful and too inefficient. This is a widely held belief among Americans. However, there are a few items in the document that run contrary to the Democrats agenda. For example, Project 2025 would restore the definition of ""sex"" as ""biological sex at birth"" instead of ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" According to a Pew research poll from May 2022, 60% of those polled believe gender is determined by the sex assigned at birth. Yet, Democrats continue to define sex as ones ""sexual orientation and gender identity."" Thus, the document states, ""The CDC should immediately end its collection of data on gender identity, which legitimizes the unscientific notion that men can become women (and vice versa)...""

Another example involves abortion. Liberals promote abortion as health care. The Project 2025 document (page 455) states, ""It should fund studies into the risks and complications of abortion and ensure that it corrects and does not promote misinformation regarding the comparative health

and psychological benefits of childbirth versus the health and psychological risks of intentionally taking a human life through abortion."" Conservatives see the issue as more than a woman's right to choose. They see abortion as the taking of life. In general, conservatives are against abortion but do believe exceptions to protect the life of the mother, rape, incest are appropriate.

Project 2025 also exposes some conflicts of interest in the federal government. One such conflict is found in the National Institute of Health (NIH). It states, ""In 2018, it was revealed that a $100 million NIH study on the benefits of moderate drinking was funded by the beer and liquor industry."" It also points out how the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) owns half of the patent for the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine, among thousands of other pharma patents. It goes on to say that several NIH employees personally receive up to $150,000 per year from Moderna vaccine sales.

Project 2025 does have some controversial items within the document, but its overarching theme is that government has become too large, too inefficient, and there are too many agencies whose actions go well beyond their charter. In short, the document makes suggestions that would reorganize the federal bureaucracy, returning agencies to their original mandates.

Democrats have suggested Trump will enact its provisions if elected in November. While Trump may indeed implement some of the provisions of Project 2025, many of them are standard conservative ideals and not something from a horror movie as Democrats have suggested."
Taylor Swift Becomes World's Richest Female Musician: Here's Who Is Right Behind Her,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/08/taylor-swift-becomes-worlds-richest-female-musician-heres-who-is-right-behind-her/,2024-10-08T18:05:15Z,"Taylor Swift leapfrogged singer and beauty mogul Rihanna to become the world's richest female musician following the blockbuster success of her Eras Tour, as other female artists, including Madonna and Beyoncé, rank just outside the billion-dollar club.

Swift, 34, became the first musician to become a billionaire solely based on the value of songs and performances in 2023. Forbes estimates her music catalog is worth $600 million, and her tours and royalties have pocketed her another $600 million. She also owns an estimated $125 million in real estate. Her jump to billionaire status was driven largely by her ongoing Eras Tour, which began in March 2023 and is set to conclude in December. Last year, Forbes estimated the first leg of the Eras Tour alone earned her $190 million. The Eras Tour became the first ever concert tour to surpass $1 billion in total gross, Pollstar reported in December.

Rihanna, 36, became a billionaire in 2021, Forbes estimated, largely because of the value of her stake in Fenty Beauty, the cosmetics company she launched in 2017. She owns a 50% stake in the company, as well as an estimated 28% stake in lingerie brand Savage X Fenty. Both companies are named after the singer, whose real name is Robyn Fenty. She launched her latest beauty line, Fenty Hair, in June. Forbes ranked Rihanna as the 74th most powerful woman in the world in 2023. The rest of her wealth comes from her music catalog -- she has 14 Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits, the third-most of any artist, only behind The Beatles and Mariah Carey. She performed at the Super Bowl halftime show in 2023, a brief break from her years-long hiatus from her music career. She hasn't released an album since her 2016 album ""Anti.""

Jay-Z is the richest musician on the Forbes billionaire list, with an estimated net worth of $2.5 billion. He's the first rapper to make the ranks. His wealth largely comes from his liquor business: He sold a 50% stake in his champagne brand, Armand de Brignac, to French luxury goods company LVMH in 2021 for at least $300 million, and a majority stake in his D'Usse cognac brand to Bacardi for $750 million in 2023. Forbes ranked Jay-Z as the fifth-richest celebrity in the world in April. Forbes reported Bruce Springsteen became a billionaire in June, with an estimated net worth of $1.2 billion. The New Jersey legend made much of his wealth from his music catalog, which he sold to Sony in 2021 for $500 million. Outside of music, Kim Kardashian ($1.7 billion) and Oprah Winfrey ($3 billion) both rank ahead of Swift and Rihanna as the world's richest female celebrities.

As Swift's wealth and fame have ballooned, so has her reputation as one of the world's most powerful people. Forbes ranked her the fifth most powerful woman in the world in 2023 -- making her the highest-ranked entertainer, and putting her in the company of the world's most influential political and business leaders -- citing the impact her Eras Tour has had on local economies and the dedication of her fan base, known as Swifties. Swift was also named the 2023 Time Person of the Year, and she has been considered an influential figure in politics. Her endorsement of Vice President Kamala Harris was credited with a spike in visits to vote.gov, a voter registration website.

It serves as a platform to advocate for equal opportunities in education, healthcare and leadership, aiming to create a brighter, more equitable future for girls everywhere.

As we celebrate this day, the inspiring stories of everyday women can remind us of the power women have to make change in their communities and beyond. Each of these entrepreneurs has forged her path through resilience, creativity and a commitment to empowering others. Their journeys exemplify the limitless potential of women who pursue their passions while uplifting those around them.

PIZZA + PURPOSE

Caroline D'Amore's career trajectory has taken her from DJing around the world to walking the runways of Diane von Furstenberg to becoming a finalist on Gordon Ramsey's ""Food Stars"" in 2023, to now being known as the pink-haired activist Pizza Girl,

Prior to the pandemic, her products were sold in over 100 stores, but given the challenges that came with sourcing organic ingredients during the pandemic, she had to stop production.

D'Amore credits her daughter with inspiring her to re-launch Pizza Girl in 2021. D'Amore now has built a successful brand of pasta sauces and a countertop pizza oven, which sold out within days of the launch. She opened a store in Venice Beach, California, with a second location slated for early 2025. Her company champions quality, authenticity and social responsibility. She challenges the status quo, showing that women can lead in any industry they choose, from the boardroom to the kitchen and beyond.

D'Amore didn't always feel this confident. ""Pizza Girl started out of the frustration of not feeling heard as a young girl in my Italian pizza family,"" she explained. She was even admonished not to put the word ""Girl"" in the name of her company. Her response? Not only is it called ""Pizza Girl,"" everything from the pizza boxes to the ovens are pink.

D'Amore started using her Instagram platform to talk about more than just pizza after the Hamas-led attack on Israel in October 2023. By sharing personal experiences from her visits to Israel in December 2023 and February 2024, D'Amore has used her business platform for broader social impact. Her dedication to justice and stance against hate form a core theme, inspiring audiences and showcasing a powerful model of purpose-driven business leadership, ""Standing up for what's right against all forms of hatred is crucial because it inspires others to be courageous in the face of injustice,"" she said.

D'Amore's story serves as an inspiring reminder that every girl has the potential to become a changemaker. She can be found on Instagram @pizzagirl and @carolinedamore and also as a guest on podcasts and stages around the world. Sharing her entrepreneurial journey and standing up against hate, D'Amore provides inspiration for girls everywhere. As she put it: ""Being able to inspire others has given my time on this earth more meaning than I ever thought possible, and it all started with one little video on Instagram asking the world to stop the hatred and calling it out as I saw it unfolding. There is no voice too small. Speaking your truth can take you places you never even imagined.""

ROOTED IN FAMILY

Chelsea Bowers and Emily O'Neill, two native Montanans, are forging their own path. Growing up with strong entrepreneurial spirits, both had businesses rooted in hard work and long hours -- Chelsea with a professional house-painting business and also assisting with hunting trips, and Emily with a catering and Dutch Oven camp cooking venture. When Chelsea married Emily's brother Phillip in 2010, the two became not only sisters-in-law but also powerful business partners.

In 2017, Chelsea and her mother, Denise, decided to start a flower shop in Livingston, Montana. The venture soon blossomed into Rooted in Montana. Though Denise eventually left due to health issues, Chelsea and Emily took a leap of faith. They credit prayer, perseverance and adaptability for helping them transform Rooted in Montana into a thriving business.

Since its inception, Rooted in Montana has expanded to offer houseplants, event florals and custom wedding designs. The sisters-in-law, now seasoned entrepreneurs, have designed flowers for almost 300 weddings and overcome challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, which required them to step up their leadership and advocate for themselves and their customers.

O'Neill remembers that time: ""We were persistent when it came to the covid shutdowns in our little town. I actually called the governor's office and said that I thought that our business was an 'essential' business. This was after I got off the phone with a woman whose father passed away in Livingston, and they lived on the East Coast and weren't able to fly."" O'Neill wanted to help the woman honor her father's memory at a time when life was greatly disrupted.

Residents of the town of Livingston were adamant that businesses should be open while being respectful about safety concerns. Eventually, O'Neill heard back from the governor's office that while they could not have customers in their shop, they could offer contactless delivery. ""That was a really good day,"" recalled O'Neill.

Chelsea Bowers and Emily O'Neill's journey embodies the determination that defines so many women entrepreneurs. Their story is a powerful reminder on International Day of the Girl of how important it is to empower young girls to dream big, take risks and forge their own paths in business and beyond.

HITTING THE AIRWAYS

Julia Howe, the inspiring teen founder of the podcast Hitting The Wall, is a powerful example of how young women can make an impact in today's world. While enrolled in WIT - Whatever It Takes, a mentorship and training program for teenage entrepreneurs, Howe created the podcast to shed light on issues that often go unnoticed -- mental-health struggles, societal pressures and the importance of self-care, especially among young women.

Howe's stories of being an endurance athlete fuel meaningful conversations and demonstrate the resilience and strength that align with the values celebrated on International Day of The Girl. Her mission resonates with young girls worldwide, encouraging them to embrace their vulnerabilities and turn them into strengths. Howe's work was recently recognized as a ""force for good"" by Frigo Cheese Heads Build a Bright Future program.

Through Hitting The Wall, Howe provides a platform for voices that are often silenced. Not only does she share her own experiences on the podcast, but she also invites experts and advocates to provide listeners with practical advice and support, particularly connected to self-worth tied to body performance and appearance.

In sports, many girls push beyond their limits, with 8 in 10 showing signs of Relative Energy Deficiency, including disordered eating, menstrual issues, and risks to cardiovascular and bone health. This harmful cycle forces them to prioritize performance over well-being, leading to unhealthy training habits.

By equipping the Hitting The Wall audience -- primarily young women -- with the knowledge and tools to navigate these complexities, Howe is inspiring a global community of young women. Her work embodies the spirit of International Day of The Girl, which focuses on advocating for girls' rights, challenging gender norms, and ensuring that young women everywhere are heard, valued and empowered to make a difference. Howe explained, ""On the podcast, we talk about the things people often shy away from: disordered eating, burnout, body image. We show girls that they aren't alone in these experiences but also give them strategies to navigate them. What we most want to show these girls is that strength doesn't just come from winning races. True strength is knowing when to prioritize your health, your mind, and your well-being.""

In a world that still grapples with gender inequality and societal expectations, the achievements of these women serve as powerful reminders of the importance of empowering young girls. Their stories reflect not only personal triumphs but also a collective movement toward a future where women can lead in any industry they choose. As we honor the International Day of the Girl, let us take inspiration from these change makers and strive to create a supportive environment where every girl can dream big, embrace her unique journey and become a catalyst for change."
'Joker 2' Flop In 2024 Threatens Worst-Case Future For DC Studios,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/markhughes/2024/10/08/joker-2-flop-in-2024-threatens-worst-case-future-for-dc-studios/,2024-10-08T15:55:00Z,"As I forecast for you yesterday, Warner Bros. Discovery's and DC Studios' Joker: Folie à Deux came in below the widely projected $121.1 million worldwide box office. Expected to be among the year's biggest blockbusters, does the films status as 2024's biggest flop threaten a worst-case future for the rebooted DC cinematic universe?

The $119 million worldwide opening weekend for Joker: Folie à Deux, combined with terrible audience scores and equally bad critical reviews, means it will probably suffer above-average weekly declines, so don't expect the sub-50% drops other successful tentpoles like Deadpool & Wolverine and Inside Out 2 have enjoyed this year.

At this point, signs point toward a final cume in the $250-275 million range, depending a lot on weekday numbers, China's and Japan's contributions when the film opens in those markets, and exactly how bad the second weekend drop is.

I modeled based on a modest 60% decline, but if the bottom falls out at 70% for example then all bets are off and we are probably looking at right around a $200 million finish.

As bad as all of this already looks at face value, the result is worse when compared against Joker: Folie à Deux's enormous budget. Summer tentpole superhero team-up blockbusters typically have equal or lower budgets than this film's pre-deductions $200 million bill, and that's before marketing (although the studio avoided equivalent summer tentpole promotional costs, for better or worse).

A significant portion of Joker: Folie à Deux's budget -- approximately $52 million, according to The Hollywood Reporter -- went to Todd Phillips', Joaquin Phoenix's, and Lady Gaga's salaries alone (albeit to different degrees, as Gaga reportedly earned $12 million while Phoenix and Phillips split the rest at $20 million each).

Compared against the roughly $4-5 million Phoenix received for Joker back in 2019, the pay raises for the top three names explains a lot of inflation from the first film's $70 million budget to the sequel's nearly $200 million budget.

The significance of Joker: Folie à Deux's financial pain is separate from its artistic merit and reception, obviously, and even the fact it was widely panned by critics and audiences alike is likewise still not an objective measure of its value or merit as a film. But it's not insignificant when every measurements align to tell us a film is widely deemed an expensive swing and a miss.

The value in studios funding artistic swings and misses is another discussion, of course, and there's value in discussing it apart from the nuances and particulars we debate over anything else about the films.

But for DC Studios and WBD, right now these are characters, source material, and projects that cost a lot of money to bring to the big screen, and it's an investment within a profit-driven private corporate entity, competing for audience attention and dollars against similar projects by other corporate entities.

That might sound cynical, but I don't actually mean it that way -- it's simply the reality of cinema, and it's always been the reality, however much we often pretend toward some rose-colored idealized Hollywood past.

And however impersonal and cold that math sounds, remember that it represents ultimately the artistic assessments, opinions, discussions, and recommendations among worldwide professional critics of cinema and a mainstream global public. It would be unfair to disregard numbers legitimately reflecting widespread public opinion and reaction to cinematic art created exactly for those audiences and to elicit their reactions. Certainly nobody was insisting that the reviews, audience reactions, box office, and awards were irrelevant with regard to the first Joker film, right?

Negative reviews and bad box office don't take away from the value of Joker: Folie à Deux for anybody else. Measurements of it are relevant to understanding and discussing not only artistic value, but also financial merits of investing in specific films. Especially since Joker: Folie à Deux's reception could play a role in influencing audience reception of forthcoming DC projects, and how the studio might react if they anticipate audience backlash.

Without diving too deeply into the past, WB isn't exactly a stranger to reactive studio leadership abruptly changing course when facing box office adversity. The results of that are precisely why Warner is now starting from scratch next year with writer-director (and DC Studios co-CEO alongside Peter Safran) James Gunn's Superman.

Since Aquaman swam to $1.1 billion in 2018, eight of the nine DCEU superhero movies have failed to reach even $400 million, with half of them taking less than $200 million in total worldwide box office, and two others failing to reach $300 million. The only bright spots for DC on the big screen for the past six years have been Joker in 2019 and The Batman in 2022.

I'm not rubbing salt in the wound, I'm trying to apply some light and some blunt diagnoses, to determine what it tells us about the risk of reopening the same old wounds again compared to healing and moving on. The DCU has the potential for both, depending very much on how WBD and DC Studios leadership react or don't react to Joker: Folie à Deux's failed launch.

Quality is always a factor, but it's also the hardest to measure and most subjective to determine. So while it's true that studios must commit to taking material seriously making sure everyone involved delivers the best film possible, it's also true that everyone involved in Joker: Folie à Deux feels pretty certain they did exactly those things, and they felt they succeeded.

One recurring lesson I've seen across the past 20 years is that audience are less interested in deconstruction of superhero cinema outside of effectively established and recognizable popular iteration first. Because DC did more of the former in their films, it's a lesson most visible in audience reception of DC movies.

Look at the well-received and financially successful DC films over the past 20 years -- Batman Begins, The Dark Knight, Man of Steel, Suicide Squad, Wonder Woman, Aquaman, Joker, The Batman. Those films pretty much delivered (to varying degrees) the expected, recognized versions of superheroes, conforming mostly to audience preferences for those characters and/or superheroes in general.

So the lesson ""make good movies"" is really pointless beyond that. Even claiming ""listen to what people prefer"" suggests pandering and not taking risks, which isn't the right lesson either.

But what is true, and what is a good lesson, is to understand the reasons audiences rejected the deconstructions, the reasons they felt uninterested or ""cheated.""

And that's part of the larger lesson at the heart of all of this: knowing your audience, knowing not only what they prefer and expect but also why they do, and knowing the characters and stories well enough to be able to deliver what audiences prefer and expect in interesting ways that still challenge the audience and even eventually subvert their expectations because you've earned it.

If you prove to audiences that you understand the characters and understand why the characters matter to them, you earn their permission to deconstruct the characters. And like it or not, you need viewer ""permission"" if you want audiences to buy in.

You also need to be sure you established which version you're deconstructing. Because when the approach goes an extra layer deep by deconstructing an incarnation that is itself a deconstructed iteration of the character, then you're asking audiences to take two big leaps of faith with you, beyond even the built-in leaps of faith you're asking when you tell fantasy-sci-fi myths in the first place.

I love deconstruction. Mainstream audiences do, too. They just want to see it within the framework of something larger to care about on the front end, and particularly through a more recognizable version that they care about to begin with (or the deconstruction is pointless).

Whether it's done across several films (the way Marvel Studios set up their shared universe before deconstructing it), or within a single but effective story (such as Zack Snyder's Justice League did for Cyborg, or Barry Allen's arc in The Flash), it usually needs to happen in some semblance of that format when you're making movies about existing pop culture icons.

Marvel did it on the front end and largely avoided the problem of audience backlash. But Warner's DCEU moved quickly into deconstructive territory, rooted in incarnations of certain characters that were already edge cases leaning toward deconstruction. Anyone's personal opinion and preferences regarding the quality and value of that is beside the point, at this level of the discussion. It created a two-point barrier for audiences, and while it only initially slowed mainstream buy-in, it didn't take long to turn audiences off entirely.

Financially, Man of Steel was a success at $668 million, despite slightly underperforming. Batman v Superman did blockbuster business with $874 million, but it underperformed as well and obviously quickly lost audience interest. Then, Suicide Squad did well to the tune of $749 million, and Wonder Woman was a huge hit that grossed $823 million. Justice League failed at $661 million, but Aquaman rebounded as the biggest hit of the DCEU with $1.1 billion.

Wonder Woman and Aquaman were widely accepted by audiences and critics alike, but the rest of those films -- despite being generally financially successful -- had mixed reviews and (mostly) so-so audience scores.

A new DC superhero shared world kicked off with the biggest and most popular versions of DC heroes, at a time when the MCU and the Nolan TDK trilogy put superhero cinema at the top of the charts, was always going to attract initial attention from audiences. But all of the signs of trouble were clear, and studio executive leadership's hands-on approach not only didn't help, it resulted in the franchise-killing Justice League fiasco.

I've already recounted the subsequent nine-film collapse, so I won't repeat that. But what it reflected was audiences having decided the DCEU wasn't what they wanted, and they were mostly done giving it more attention or money.

Now look closely at which of those early films did best, and which underperformed. The films that were generally what audiences expected and prefer in foundational superhero franchises were all successful -- Man of Steel (mostly), Suicide Squad (theatrically, it delivered most of what the trailer reflected), Wonder Woman, and Aquaman.

Before them, it was the TDK trilogy and its moody faux-realism approach that reflected what's always been most popular about Batman -- the notion he's got no powers, he's just someone with resources who trained and wants to save his city. Batman Begins set up the Batman audiences love best and leaned into that. Then, in The Dark Knight, the series deconstructed Batman's assumptions right in front of him, and then in The Dark Knight Rises they tore it all down and showed us its strengths and weaknesses before rebuilding it into something stronger in the end.

But the new DCEU only set up the idealized popular heroes in a few instances, while starting off with deconstruction when it came to some of the biggest and most important foundational characters and films.

The deconstructive elements in Man of Steel, and then the more pronounced deconstruction evident in Batman v Superman and Justice League, seem to have been a case of too much too soon for mainstream audiences.

The studio also felt that audiences knew these characters well enough not to need establishing them more popularly and positively, that deconstruction was possible out the gate. Which it is, and I liked and loved most of the early DCEU films, but being possible and liked by a portion of audience willing to bring their own awareness and preferences of the characters to the table is different from whether it's a good idea that will be successful and embraced by the mainstream.

From there, those underlying disconnects from the audience mixed with soft critical reception and the unfortunate comparison to Marvel's well-received sequels and new franchises. The comparison became all the more relevant at this particular point in time, because Marvel's success was precisely because they were telling stories that mixed the overwhelmingly popular superhero origin template, with deconstructive elements arising later within the larger connected story elements.

After several years of the same sort of stories mostly signaling a lack of appreciation for what the viewers wanted, it seems audiences gave up giving DC a chance -- with two exceptions, that is.

When a new Joker origin film appeared on the radar, audiences saw all of the signs that it was the sort of Joker we know the public prefers, presented in the sort of film audiences tend to favor for Batman and Batman-adjacent movies -- namely, what Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight trilogy did. And what Joker did. And what The Batman did (and what The Penguin is currently doing).

Joker: Folie à Deux suffered because of early mixed to negative reactions at festival, from marketing that hid its musical nature while word of it being a musical spread anyway (thus creating buzz that the studio was hiding the musical nature because they feared audiences wouldn't like it), and (mild spoiler) it winds up making many feel like they were cheated or that the film retroactively makes both films pointless.

It shouldn't be hard to look at the films that succeeded, the ones that failed, and learn the right lessons. The only question now is, will audience show up?

My fear is that we are in a mirror of the same moment WB faced in 2013, with a new Superman movie launching a new shared universe, a solo Batman franchise that's a rare bright spot after many rocky years for DC on film, changes in studio leadership, and a rising popular Marvel (again!) defining audience expectations for the genre going forward.

The final mirroring factor to consider is that we also just had a return of the 1990s cinematic Batman, in a film that was widely derided and failed at the box office (akin to Batman & Robin killing off the franchise in the 1990s).

There is a loud warning in all of this, and Batman is sort of the canary in the coal mine. It's not that Batman is a ""tainted brand,"" it's that the DC brand has become so tainted that with the failure of The Flash last year and Joker: Folie à Deux this year, for the first time since the 1990s Batman isn't able to draw built-in audience trust and interest. Joker's own box office draw has been firmly established since 1989, with even Jared Leto's oft-criticized Joker enjoying great financial success in his one-film appearance.

Is the Batman brand no longer safe? Will audience distrust of the DC brand carry over in coming years to even otherwise good or great Batman projects? If Joker's sequel to a billion dollar origin story can't generate enough audience interest and trust to at least have a decent opening weekend, should we be concerned about the future of Batman movies, solo or in the DCU?

I'd like to think audiences will reward The Batman - Part II with another huge box office cume, and that as long as WBD and DC Studios don't meddle or cancel it, the Matt Reeves Batman world could be immune to the other pressures working against DC's shared world stuff. Perhaps the DCU's upcoming new Batman and Robin movie has something to worry about, but surely not the newly established solo Batman?

Sadly, the fact is I also thought Joker's success and its proximity to Batman -- especially as a ""grounded and gritty"" continuation -- was a safe bet. But audiences have told us loud and clear -- there are no safe bets anymore."
Household Money: What Could The Autumn Budget Mean For Your Finances?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/uk/advisor/personal-finance/2024/10/08/autumn-budget-2024/,2024-10-08T15:49:53Z,"If you require any personal advice, please seek such advice from an independently qualified financial advisor.

Commentators are predicting that Rachel Reeves will unveil a clutch of tax hikes to fill a £22 billion 'black hole' she has identified in the public coffers, when she delivers her Budget speech on Wednesday 30 October, writes Kevin Pratt.

She'll also want to raise additional funds to underwrite the government's spending plans.

The decision to axe Winter Fuel Allowance payments to around 10 million pensioners this winter has demonstrated that Reeves - the first woman to hold the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer - is not afraid to make unpopular decisions.

She's received unwavering support from Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer in the teeth of protests from across the political spectrum, so it's reasonable to assume she's not going to pull any punches.

Reeves has reiterated Labour's manifesto commitment not to increase the rates of three key government revenue-generators - the holy trinity of income tax, National Insurance Contributions and VAT (although VAT is being introduced on private school fees).

The Chancellor could, however, maintain the freeze on income tax thresholds, which would result in more people becoming taxpayers or ascending into higher tax bands as their pay increases - something known as 'fiscal drag'.

Say, for example, your income is £12,000 and you have no other taxable income. This amount falls within the £12,570 standard personal tax allowance, so you do not pay income tax.

But if your pay increases and you earn more than £12,570, you would then be taxed at 20% on the amount above the allowance.

The same scenario applies with the threshold between the 20% basic rate of tax and the 40% higher rate (£50,270), and between the higher rate and the 45% additional rate (£125,140).

Couple of points to note here: if your taxable income is over £100,000, you lose £1 of your personal allowance for every £2 of income above the £100,000 level. This means by the time you get to £125,140, you don't get any personal allowance and are taxed on everything you earn.

If you live in Scotland, there are six thresholds rather than three, set at different levels with different rates of tax applying. Any changes here will likely be announced in December.

Under the Tories, the thresholds in England, Wales and Northern Ireland were already due to remain frozen until 2028, but it is conceivable that the Chancellor might extend this date to help balance the books over a longer forecast period.

The decision to axe Winter Fuel Allowance payments to around 10 million pensioners this winter has demonstrated that Reeves - the first woman to hold the post of Chancellor of the Exchequer - is not afraid to make unpopular decisions.

The prime candidates for a tax hike in the Budget are:

We may also see changes to the rules affecting 'non-doms'. These are individuals who live in the UK but who are non-domiciled for tax purposes, meaning they can avoid or reduce the tax they pay on overseas earnings.

If the Chancellor is feeling particularly combative, she could introduce a wealth tax on the super-rich, although this would be immensely complicated as well as deeply controversial as it would seek to harvest revenue from illiquid assets such as property and other possessions."
"WWE Raw Results, Winners And Grades After Bad Blood 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alfredkonuwa/2024/10/07/wwe-raw-results-winners-and-grades-after-bad-blood-2024/,2024-10-08T02:04:03Z,"WWE Raw, the first two-hour Raw since 2012, advertised Jey Uso defending the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Xavier Woods and GUNTHER defending the WWE World Championship against Sami Zayn.

Raw is the fallout show from WWE Bad Blood 2024 where CM Punk defeated Drew McIntyre in an instant classic Hell in a Cell match. Meanwhile, The Rock returned and Kevin Owens turned heel on Cody Rhodes off-camera.

Last week's broadcast of WWE Raw garnered 1.516 million viewers.

CM Punk cut a promo thanking his fans and his haters. Addressing his detractors, Punk said he turned their hate into cash. Punk then said he hadn't seen his wife in five weeks, so he was going home and didn't know when he would be back.

CM Punk was interrupted by Seth Rollins, who exchanged a glare with Phil and headed to the ring. Rollins instructed fans to applaud Punk and said he wanted CM Punk to get well soon so he could retire him.

Rollins mentioned Kevin Owens' heel turn on Cody Rhodes (which did not happen on TV) and it didn't get much of a reaction. It seemed as if many of these fans were not aware of the social media angle, which I thought was brilliant by the way.

After vowing to destroy Bronson Reed, Rollins pretty much previewed Raw and recapped Bad Blood before he was interrupted by Jey Uso. WWE had to squeeze three segments into one because they only have two hours now.

Fans booed Xavier Woods during the ring introductions, and cheered top babyface Jey Uso. Xavier Woods is heel and he hasn't even turned yet.

Woods dominated most of this match before making a misstep and suffering a loss to Jey Uso. It was a quick match in the two-hour era. Woods refused a handshake, opening the door for Bron Breakker to Spear the hell out of Jey. Woods wanted no part of helping Uso, so Kofi Kingston tried and was speared for his efforts. Breakker then hit a Super Spear on Woods, who is set to officially turn heel any (new) day now.

Joe Tessitore noted this was only the fourth Good Old-Fashioned Donnybrook in WWE history.

Sheamus hit an awesome White Noise from the barrel through the tables. It was a sight to behold and earned well-deserved ""holy s -- t"" chants, followed by ""this is awesome!""

Surprisingly, Dunne kicked out of a Celtic Cross and fans were shocked.

After using a cricket bat, Dunne zip-tied Sheamus and hit a running knee. Not only did Sheamus kickout with his hands tied behind his back, he hit a Brogue Knee followed by a Brogue Kick for the win. As much as Dunne shined in this match, he couldn't have looked weaker with that finish.

The participants in this match were Natalya, Katana Chance, Kayden Carter, Zelina Vega and Lyra Valkyria vs. Pure Fusion Collective and the Unholy Union. This felt like another symptom of the two-hour era as WWE tried to squeeze as many women into one segment as possible.

Early on, the 10-woman tag broke down into an all-out brawl.

Lyra won the match with a flying leg drop to the back of Sonya Deville's head. Considering all the moving parts in this match, they did a solid job.

WWE showed a promotional poster for Crown Jewel showing Cody Rhodes vs. GUNTHER in the Crown Jewel Championship match, but Joe Tessitore mentioned this could change as the graphic changed from GUNTHER to Sami Zayn as world champion.

Zayn and Cody Rhodes had an exchange backstage. Before Zayn could apologize on behalf of Kevin Owens, Cody cut him off and wished him luck against GUNTHER.

GUNTHER vs. Sami Zayn started at 6:40 pm PST. WWE's final commercial break was at 6:51.

GUNTHER was chopping the maple leaf out of Sami Zayn's chest during break, which is a shame because they sounded loud as hell.

GUNTHER hit a brutal clothesline on Zayn, and Zayn kicked out at the last possible second. Zayn then kicked out of a power bomb as fans went into a frenzy rallying behind him. The match reached a fever pitch after Sami kicked out of another power bomb at one. GUNTHER finally won with a rear-naked choke."
How To Be A Supercommunicator,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kevincoldiron/2024/10/07/how-to-be-a-supercommunicator/,2024-10-08T02:03:52Z,"Communication is a human superpower. We do it with art, music, words, gestures and even emojis.

Charles Duhigg should wield this power better than most. He is a professional journalist, a New York Times bestselling author and owner of an MBA from Harvard Business School.

Despite these credentials, he reached a point a few years ago where he had ""become someone who couldn't seem to read cues or hear what others were saying"". He sometimes ""only half-listened to my wife"", ""failed to empathize with coworkers"" and ""spent meals talking about myself instead of asking about others"".

I've done the same myself.

Duhigg decided to do something about it. He began a quest to figure out why some people were able to tap into their superpower, and become experts at building connections, while many of us struggle. These efforts culminated in his latest book: Supercommunicators: How To Unlock The Secret Power of Connection.

Duhigg says there are three types of conversation - practical, emotional and social. The first step to satisfying communication? Make sure both parties are having the same conversation.

If you initiate a conversation, take time beforehand to think about the type of response you want. For example, if you're talking to a friend about work problems are you looking to vent or do you want them to suggest solutions?

If someone begins talking to you, figure out what they want. Ask a question about what they've said. When they answer, repeat it back in your own words and then ask if you got it right. That last bit is key - it signals you care about understanding and helps you figure out what they want from the conversation.

The best questions are not about the facts of someone's life (what do you do for a living?). Instead, ask how they feel about their life (what do you like about being a lawyer?). This isn't wokeism, it's getting to values - how someone sees the world, what type of mindset they are in. When you get an answer, reciprocate with a response that reveals something about your own values.

There may be differences, perhaps large ones. That's fine. Follow up by asking why they feel that way, then respond with your own why. There is an astonishing section in the book where people of opposed views on gun control discover their beliefs developed for the same reason - tragic events had left both of them feeling unsafe. They understood each other better after the conversation because they had uncovered a desire for the same outcome, even though they disagreed on how to achieve it.

I mean this literally. We all know about the dopamine hit we get when someone likes our social media posts. That hit - or even just the anticipation of it - keeps us relentlessly checking our devices. It's an addictive process, and one that's wreaking havoc on our mental health, particularly for kids.

Turns out that great conversations also produce a dopamine hit. But the good feeling lasts longer and, more importantly, builds deeper bonds as opposed to stoking anxiety. Imagine if we got addicted to conversing and connecting in the same way we've become addicted to social media.

I don't think that's a crazy idea. Duhigg has laid out a path I think we can follow because it's not fighting our nature, but tapping into it.

One barrier to great conversations and connection is the use of single identities to characterize people. Labeling someone based on a single identity can easily trigger a fight or flight response. Neither state is great for communicating.

Why does this happen? The person being assigned to an identity might not want to be part of that group. Or they may feel the identify excludes them from another group that they want to be part of.

We all have multiple identities, expand the conversation until you find overlap.

I got a chance to put all this into practice this summer when I attended a conference with the theme 'Being Human in the Age of AI'. I knew the conference organizers - Ben Hunt and Rusty Guinn of the excellent website Epsilon Theory - but no one else. Because of this I found myself scanning around for another loner to speak with during breaks. At lunch on the final day, I asked a woman who was sitting by herself if I could join her. Within minutes of chatting it was clear that we were on opposite sides of all the usual divides. I started to feel tense, frustrated, even a smidge angry.

But we both shared a desire to connect - the conference was literally titled 'Epsilon Connect'. So...we worked at it. Turns out we did have common ground - we were both parents, spouses, somewhat north of 50. We had similar frustrations at work! My son had spent a couple of summers near her hometown, even though we lived 3,000 miles apart. We shared our perspectives, listened...connected. At the end of lunch she said, ""well I'm glad we talked, I learned some things I didn't know."" I repeated those sentiments to her.

And the good feeling from that conversation lasted far longer than the dopamine rush from the (35!) likes of my most recent Facebook post about the $46 grilled cheese sandwich I had come across in Napa.

Give it a try (conversation that is, not the sandwich)."
Keren Nechmad & Swell Ariel Or Dive Into Netflix's 'Kissufim'  --  The Israeli 'Dazed And Confused',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshweiss/2024/10/07/keren-nechmad--swell-ariel-or-dive-into-netflixs-kissufim---the-israeli-dazed-and-confused/,2024-10-07T21:01:28Z,"Keren Nechmad didn't set out to make Israel's answer to Dazed and Confused, but that's exactly what she's done with Kissufim.

""It's a happy coincidence,"" the first-time director, a graduate of NYU's renowned film school, tells me over Zoom when I bring up the comparison between her unforgettably confident feature debut and the Richard Linklater classic. ""My intention was just to give an understanding of what it is to live on a kibbutz and how time doesn't really move much. You're just going through life. I really wanted to do an ensemble as well; to show the different types of people there are in Israel.""

Now streaming exclusively on Netflix, the coming-of-age drama takes place on the titular, Gaza-adjacent kibbutz (a collective, agrarian-based community rooted in the country's founding Socialist principles), circa 1977, where a tight-knit group of young soldiers confront an uncertain future as they finish up their requisite military service through the volunteer program known as Nachal.

Grappling with the physical and psychological trauma of the Yom Kippur War four years prior, the soldiers dream of lasting peace with their neighbors, particularly in the wake of Egyptian President Anwar Sadat making a historic détente visit to Jerusalem. Embodying that sense of optimism is Eli, a free-spirited young woman loosely based on real-world terror victim, Elian Gazit, and portrayed by Swell Ariel Or (The Beauty Queen of Jerusalem). ""It's not a war film, except at the end,"" she says. ""You don't see blood and explosions and armies fighting each other. It's very delicate and it's more around the experience of Israelis. It's a film that humanizes Israelis without even trying.""

When it came to playing a real person, Or says she wanted to capture ""the essence"" of the individual rather than get bogged down in minutiae. ""It was more important to share her heart and how she would have lived her life if she didn't die. I focused more on that and after the film came out, her mother and sister approached me. That's the most important thing when you play a character based on [a real person] who still has living relatives; when they reach out and are moved by what you did.""

Like any great Bildungsroman put to screen -- whether it's American Graffiti or Dazed and Confused -- Kissufim eschews the traditional character arc format in favor of an anti-plot comprised of laid back vignettes centered around the bittersweet, yet intoxicating, milestones along the road to adulthood: first love, crushing heartache, wild rites of passage, playing pranks on friends, mocking authority figures, boozy parties, and everything in between. ""It worked against everything I learned and I loved it,"" Nechmad says of the unorthodox screenplay she co-wrote alongside Hadar Arazi and Yonatan Bar-Ilan. ""It freed me from the structure I was taught.""

To foster an organic sense of camaraderie that would show up on-camera, Nechmad made her cast spend as much time together as possible. ""I blamed Covid-19 and said, 'We need to be safe, so we need to just spend time with each other and nobody else,'"" she reveals. ""And they listened. Everybody was getting along so well and they became a core group. Because we spent a week-and-a-half filming on location [on the kibbutz], we all lived in the same cabins. Every night, we would sit together after filming and talk until someone came out of their room and shushed us.""

""It was a summer camp for grown-ups,"" agrees Or, ""which included a lot of going out and going to the beach and drinking and dancing. It was really fun.""

The key difference between this film and its genre predecessors, of course, is that these main characters are reluctantly forced to grow up before their time, having been born in one of the most embattled regions on the planet. It's something Nechmad hopes to impress upon viewers from countries lucky enough to avoid the specter of regular conflict.

""I grew up listening to my father's stories and, as child, I was like, 'Oh, another story from the army, another story of you growing up,'"" she recalls. ""But then I went to the army and I was like, 'Wait, all the stories he told me are resonating with what I'm going through.' This story of young people trying to find adulthood in Israel and maturity in the face of war is a multigenerational thing. You put your dreams on hold or process them in a different way and grow up and learn responsibility; learn there's something bigger than you -- for the good and the bad.""

To that end, Kissufim was always meant to be a timeless story. Despite its late '70s setting, Nechmad wasn't too worried about using period-specific lingo or music. ""I wanted the old meets the new to come to life in the film because it's telling a story that's outside of the timeframe in a sense. It could be anywhere, anytime. I think I could [set] it anywhere,"" the director adds. ""I think I could put it in 2050 -- I hope I'm wrong -- and it could resonate with that generation, [too].""

While it was originally filmed in 2021 amidst the Covid-19 pandemic, Kissufim retroactively took on a tragic significance following the Hamas terror attack in the south of Israel last October, not least of all because the eponymous kibbutz was among the affected communities. As a result, the movie's release was delayed from fall 2023 to summer 2024. ""It's been very strange to see how close to reality it came, especially in Kissufim itself,"" Nechmad admits. ""I kept waiting for a phone call [from Netflix saying], 'Listen, it's too political -- we can't do it.'""

""I think they're probably the bravest streamer in the market right now in terms of films and shows that they're buying and broadcasting,"" echoes Or, who hopes the film can broaden ideological horizons beyond the echo chamber of news networks and social media. ""You get so many different accounts telling you so many different things. But if you read a book or watch a film or listen to an album ... the effort [to make them was enormous]. It took so much work to create this thing, that it's probably a little bit more truthful than a short video on TikTok.""

""We consume art from people that might not think the same way we do,"" Nechmad concludes. ""Our opinion changes all the time. It's not like we're constructed to one thing."""

At times, it's even really good. When he is not the focus of the show, it's pretty bad. At times, even really bad.

This judgement is sweeping. When the focus of the series is on Carol (Melissa McBride) for instance, it's been pretty bad. That's not because I dislike Carol, though I'm not a Carol fan largely because of how she's been written for so long and is once again written in this show, but because of the goofiness of the plot so far.

Carol and Ash (Manish Dayal) flew out of the burning compound last week and this week land in Greenland. Here begins our adventures in absolute preposterous nonsense. As of right now, in the real world, about 56,000 people live in Greenland. It is an island over 836,000 square miles large. That's roughly one quarter the size of the lower 48 states. The likelihood of our intrepid flyers running into humans or zombies when they landed on an island over three times the size of Texas, with less than a percentage point of the population of that state is, well, just about as close to zero as you can get.

But within moments of landing, Carol spots zombies approaching. And moments after that, she's saved by a pair of scientists that happen to have a research station nearby. The zombies are as cool as ever, and I liked that they came out of the turf like snipers in the grass, but everything else around this subplot is just ridiculous -- Fear The Walking Dead levels of absurdity. ""But it's a zombie show, Erik! Why do you expect it to be plausible?""

There are two words we must discuss in today's review. The first is verisimilitude. This is an interesting word and one that I wish more people who consumed media understood, because I would get fewer complaints like the one above. What verisimilitude means, when it comes to storytelling, is that within a fictional world or story, the things that happen feel true to that fiction. We can accept, for example, dragons in Game Of Thrones. But if Jon Snow were to show up wearing a jetpack and blasting fools with a plasma rifle, that would be implausible -- even within a fantasy setting (or perhaps especially within that setting).

Likewise, if a group of survivors who have never flown a plane before, decide to fly one to help another survivor because for some reason they can't just drive across Texas and then they crash and have to fix the plane, despite not being engineers or knowing how to fix a plane, we might find this a bit ludicrous and unbelievable even though it takes place in a zombie apocalypse. I am describing one of the goofy plots in Fear The Walking Dead, by the way.

Every story is different, of course. And there are times when breaking verisimilitude can be an effective storytelling technique. For instance, in the excellent series Giri/Haji, toward the end we get a scene that completely changes the tone and approach of the entire show up to that point, when the characters suddenly begin dancing as if they're in a musical. It's almost dreamlike. Nothing up to that point in the series was at all like it, and I suspect some viewers were rather put off by it, though I found the segment quite beautiful and evocative.

But most of the time, there's a good reason why writers should make certain not to break a show's internal logic, and focus instead on presenting scenarios that feel plausible and true within the fictional world. The Walking Dead was always most effective when it was a gritty and plausible version of what a zombie apocalypse might be like. It eschewed the crazy over-the-top post-apocalyptic super-vehicles you might find in some zombie movies. Characters were flawed and vulnerable. Over time, efforts to maintain a sense of realism have fallen by the wayside.

Of course, Carol's saviors turn out to be bad guys but in the most convoluted way possible. One of the women thinks the apocalypse is Mother Nature's way of cleansing the earth and tells them this while making crazy eyes; I have no idea why Carol let's her load the crossbow instead of stopping her. The other seems nice. She hugs Ash when he tells her of his dead son. But wait! She's actually the crazy one. She tries to force the first woman to kill Carol so that they can . . . breed with Ash? Really? This is the best story they could come up with?

There's no tension here, of course, because Carol wears plot armor so thick it could deflect a nuclear bomb, and Ash -- while likeable -- has to survive because he's the pilot. I'm just not sure why they couldn't have had the pair land at an outpost they saw from above, making their encounter with these women more believable. Then, instead of making them crazy, have the two try to steal the plane -- a perfectly understandable motivation given their isolation and desperation. It's okay to give characters human motivations that don't involve some bizarre ""repopulate the earth"" via what can only be, eventually, incest.

Carol and Ash then fly to France (though logistically I believe they would need to refuel in Iceland and/or Scotland prior to making that far of a flight) and Carol makes Ash wait with the plane while she goes off to find ""her daughter."" In France.

France, I will just point out quickly, is a country roughly the size of Texas (about a quarter of the size of Greenland). In the real world nearly 68 million people live there. Finding Daryl in France would be enormously difficult, right?

No, it's super easy. Barely an inconvenience.

Within this very same episode, in fact, Carol is captured by Genet's soldiers and taken to her compound, and of course people there will know of Daryl. She hasn't found him yet, but it took her all of five minutes when landing in France to make serious headway. What great fortune that she and Ash landed a short walk away from Daryl's enemy! That might be bad news, if Carol didn't have her plot armor on, but since she's invulnerable from any real threats or harm, it's just a stroke of good luck.

The writers of this show do not have the patience or the skill to craft believable scenarios. The only consideration here is getting from point A to point B, and the details are simply irrelevant. I find this incredibly frustrating, because it very badly ruins my ability to immerse myself in the story when I'm rolling my eyes this much.

Back in France, at the Nest, Daryl Dixon returns with the people he rescued. Laurent continues to receive his education, learning language and science and philosophy as Losang and his acolytes attempt to fulfil this silly prophecy and make him some kind of New Messiah.

But my favorite parts are the quiet moments. Daryl teaching Laurent how to play baseball was really nice, and I wish they'd lingered on that longer. While I enjoyed this section of the episode, I still find all of it too rushed.

Losang (Joel de la Fuente) and his collaborator, Jacinta (Nassima Benchicou) need to get Daryl out of the way so they can ""test"" Laurent. Losang's plan is to make it appear as though Laurent has been kidnapped, sending Daryl off on a wild goose chase while they have Laurent bitten by a zombie to prove that he's immune (**waves at The Last Of Us**).

Jacinta has other plans. Behind Losang's back, she orders their men to kill Daryl, removing him from the equation permanently. What neither of them expected was for Isabelle (Clémence Poésy) and Fallou (Eriq Ebouaney) to accompany the expedition. This puts a bit of a wrinkle into the plan, and Daryl and the good guys manage to fight their way out of the trap. Unfortunately, Jacinta managed to turn their friend, Emile, against them and Isabelle is forced to kill him.

They return to the Nest, which is an island just off the coast that's unreachable based on the tides, and there's a very pretty shot of Daryl and Isabelle looking out at the setting sun. These are the best parts of the show, when it allows itself to slow down and give us some character moments and sweeping cinematography, giving us a richer sense of the world Daryl finds himself in.

It's here, when Isabelle tells him that she and Laurent will come with him, that we get the kiss. The two look at one another and then lean in, tentatively at first, before they kiss. There's a pause, but no words are spoken, and Daryl moves in for another. It's quite tastefully done, actually. Moments like this stand in such stark contrast to earlier bits, I get a bit of whiplash watching. This isn't a straight-to-bed type of kiss, but rather one of exploration and discovery. Daryl and Isabelle might become a thing, but they're in no hurry.

I'm glad it happened. And I'm glad the show has taken its time to make it happen. Historically, The Walking Dead has handled its romances very poorly, but hope springs eternal, and I hope that Daryl and Isabelle find solace in one another, and that Carol doesn't swoop in and ruin everything.

Yes, I worry more about Carol ruining things than our wine-slurping villainess, Marion Genet. While our heroes have plot armor, they also function a lot like ticking time bombs, ready to implode and take out everything around them, including innocent bystanders.

Speaking of innocents, it appears the vipers in the Nest -- the religious zealot counterparts to The Last Of Us's Fireflies -- are really going to try to test Laurent, which makes me feel bad for the kid despite really not caring for him or the storyline at all. Of course, it seems wildly unlikely that their evil plan will go through, now that Daryl and Isabelle are coming to save the day, but I'm honestly hoping it does and that Laurent is actually immune, and that this could lead us to a story I've been hoping for ever since Eugene revealed that there was not, in fact, a cure. I still believe that at its foundation, The Walking Dead suffers the most because there is no end-game. We need something to work toward beyond this endless cycle of survive, find community, destroy community, rebuild community, fight enemies, survive, rebuild, etc. etc. ad nauseum.

Overall, this was a much better episode than last week's, though I remain completely disenchanted with the Carol storyline and its wild conveniences and implausible, well, everything. With only the barest effort, just about every scenario Carol has found herself in could have been tightened up and made more believable, and I remain at a loss why the writers hand-wave so much when it comes to creating a more immersive and realistic world."
Sasha Cohen On Why U.S. Women Skaters Haven't  Medaled Since 2006,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2024/10/07/sasha-cohen-on-why-us-women-skaters-havent--medaled-since-2006/,2024-10-07T20:04:13Z,"It's been nearly two decades since an American ladies individual figure skater has stood on the Olympic podium. Given America's past dominance in skating, why?

Believe it or not, it's been 18 long years since an American individual ladies figure skater has stood on the Olympic podium. The last was Sasha Cohen, at the Torino Winter Olympics in 2006, where she won the silver medal. Given America's prior dominance in ladies figure skating - Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Kristi Yamaguchi, Tara Lipinski, Sarah Hughes, Nancy Kerrigan and Michelle Kwan, to name a few - the omission is hard to understand.

Cohen is about to turn 40 this month. A graduate of Columbia University with a BA in general studies, and working now for a major investment house while raising two young children - Dash and Paloma - she maintains a very different lifestyle from her intense athletic regimen two decades ago. We thought it would be interesting to drop in on her to get some perspective on her current life, and on the American ladies figure skating program in general. Following are edited excerpts from a longer conversation.

Jim Clash: You're the last individual American ladies figure skater to stand on the Olympic podium, and that was way back in 2006. Surprising?

Sasha Cohen: It's definitely surprising. Things change, training programs change and different countries tend to dominate at different periods of time. The U.S. still has amazing talent, excelling tremendously in dance and men's single skating but, as you say, we haven't been able to put a woman on the podium since 2006. It's sad as a former athlete and someone who roots for the U.S.

Clash: It seems to me, as a layman, that the judging has become more about jumps, and less about style. Is that a fair assessment?

Cohen: You're not wrong. The sport has definitely shifted towards rewarding higher technical difficulty and certain types of moves, certainly quadruple jumps. Because of that, skaters don't have time to develop their choreography in a way that highlights their personalities and artistry. They have to pack in all kinds of technical things from the beginning to the end of their programs because that's what's reflected in the scores, which ultimately determines whether they are on the podium.

In the U.S. heyday, the whole package was considered, and the women had a chance to develop into mature figure skaters. It wasn't just about jumps, it was also the artistry on the ice that made it so much fun and dynamic to watch.

Clash: When you competed, how did you balance the attention that comes with fame - the autographs, photos and interviews - with the things you had to focus on - ie, the business of skating?

Cohen: It's helpful to have a coach or team leader that can be the one who says, ""No more autographs, let her focus."" Then you don't have to be the bad guy [laughs]. But it's hard because you see these people who have been following your career, and they finally have this chance to get an autograph or a picture.

When you're touring, the stakes are much lower, and it's really nice to have that one-on-one moment with someone who has been watching you since you were a young kid. What we do is not in a vacuum. It's not just a race, it's a performance to music with an emotional component. So it means a lot more to the audience and fans. It's a very dynamic experience.

Clash: Let's go back to the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in 2002. Didn't President George Bush sit next to you during opening ceremonies?

Cohen: After the ceremonial lap, all of the different countries began to take their respective spots on the benches to watch the opening ceremonies. Within two minutes of sitting down, two Secret Service agents came over, put down this blanket, and started telling people to scoot over. We're all like, ""What's happening?"" They said that the President was going to sit there. I called my mom and said, ""Mom, mom, President Bush is going to sit next to me!"" She laughed and said, ""Oh honey, I'm sure you're mistaken. I don't think so.""

Fifteen minutes later, when the President did sit beside me, I asked him, ""Can you talk to my mom, will you say hi? She doesn't believe that you were going to sit next to me."" He said, ""Sure,"" and actually chatted with her for a minute, minute and a half, saying how much he loved the opening ceremonies and how nice it was to chat with me. My mom later told me that she almost fell off of her chair watching from some restaurant bar in Salt Lake City. That was definitely a fun moment in those games.

Clash: You're a mom yourself now. How do you balance that with your job and doing things like this interview?

Cohen: You have to do things quickly [laughs]. I go to yoga, and that helps me re-center, have a little peace, because it's pretty hectic the rest of the time. One thing that's really difficult is to meet all of the demands but never being able to fully do anything well. There's a quote I once read about motherhood: ""You can be great at your job, great with your kids, great at this and that, but not all at the same time."" You have to choose. That's hard, but knowing that many other women are in the same spot is comforting. It's a privilege to be a mother and to be involved in the world - a give- and-take, a balance.

But as my kids are getting older, I'm realizing how fast time is passing. It's becoming increasingly important for me to be there to influence them, to play with them, to learn from them. You show up every day and try to be as present as you can, listening to that inner compass which tells you what's really important."
"Katie Grimes, Two-Time Olympic Swimmer, Commits To Virginia For 2024",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/caseymurphy/2024/10/07/katie-grimes-two-time-olympic-swimmer-commits-to-virginia-for-2024/,2024-10-07T18:52:56Z,"Two-time Olympic swimmer Katie Grimes has recently announced her commitment to the University of Virginia for the NCAA 2024-2025 season. Based on her best times, Grimes, the youngest U.S. Olympic swimmer at the 2020 Tokyo Games, would have won both the 500 freestyle and the mile at last year's NCAA Championships. She will join Alex Walsh, Gretchen Walsh, and Emma Weber at Virginia, all of whom represented the United States in Paris. Regarding her commitment, Grimes wrote on Instagram:

""After much thought and consideration, I am more than excited to announce my commitment to University of Virginia!! Thank you to all of the coaches for your patience with me during this process. I am extremely grateful for my family, friends, and faith for guiding me to this point. Huge thank you to my team, Sandpipers, and Coach Ron for everything. I also want to give thanks to the team and staff at UVA and Coach Todd for all the support.""

Grimes is from Las Vegas and trained with the Sandpipers of Nevada. She is known to be a versatile swimmer with the potential to make an impact in several events. In fact, she held the top times for the 2024 class in the 200 freestyle, 500 freestyle, 1000 freestyle, mile, 200 butterfly and 400 IM. At just 15, she placed second behind Katie Ledecky in the 800 freestyle at the 2021 Olympic Trials in Omaha, Nebraska, and at the Tokyo Games, she finished fourth in that event.

At the 2024 Paris Olympic Games, Grimes became the first woman in U.S. history to compete in both pool and open water events during the same Olympics. She earned a silver medal in the 400 IM and placed tenth in the 1500 freestyle. In her 10 km freestyle open water race, she earned fifteenth. After her open water race in Paris, she said, ""That was the hardest thing I've ever done, ever, I think, with just the current.""

The University of Virginia's women's team has won four consecutive NCAA Championship titles since 2021. Last season, the University of Virginia, known as the Cavaliers, scored 527.5 points, while Texas finished second with 441 points. This makes UVA the third program in history to achieve four consecutive titles in NCAA swimming, and the first since 1996.

Virginia's head coach, Todd DeSorbo, was selected as the head coach of the U.S. women's swimming team for the 2024 Paris Olympics. Twenty-five percent of the women's roster consisted of swimmers from UVA, including Kate Douglass, Paige Madden, Alex Walsh, Gretchen Walsh and Emma Weber. This will be DeSorbo's eighth season coaching the Cavaliers.

The odds of Virginia earning their fifth consecutive NCAA title this season are strong. Claire Curzan, who helped secure a silver medal in the 4x100 medley relay at the Tokyo Games, is also on the roster this season. In 2023, Curzan won the 200 backstroke at the NCAA Championships while representing Stanford. Her best time in the 200 backstroke would have been the fastest at Virginia last season."
'Love Next Door': 7 Things You May Have Missed In Episodes 9 And 10,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/reginakim/2024/10/07/love-next-door-7-things-you-may-have-missed-in-episodes-9-and-10/,2024-10-07T16:15:25Z,"The hit K-drama Love Next Door has come to an end, and yes, I know I'm behind on these explainers (apologies for the delay, and thank you for your patience!). If you haven't read my previous pieces where I break down some of the cultural references and wordplay found in the first eight episodes, feel free to check out the articles below:

To be perfectly honest, I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I started these explainers LOL. I'd simply noticed that there were some things in the series' first few episodes that I thought might be confusing or surprising to some viewers, so I decided to try explaining them as best as I could. And then when I received requests from readers to do similar explainers for the rest of the series, I thought, ""Well, why not?""

But the deeper I delved into the show, the more I realized just how smart and nuanced the script really is, with all its jokes, puns and historical and cultural references that would surely resonate with Korean audiences but might be lost on viewers who didn't grow up in Korea. And while it's certainly been a time-consuming endeavor to research, interpret and fact-check this information, I have to admit that this exercise has made me appreciate the show even more, and I hope that these explainers will do the same for you.

Below I've tried to explain some of the references and common Korean expressions found in episodes 9 and 10. I initially intended this piece to cover episodes 11 and 12 as well, but the list was so long that I decided to split it into two. (The link to my explainer for Episodes 11 and 12 will be added shortly to the bottom of this piece.)

Again, please keep in mind that this is nowhere near a comprehensive list -- I simply picked out some examples that I felt could benefit from a bit more context or that I thought might be particularly interesting for viewers.

1. As many K-drama fans already know, the expression 라면 먹고 갈래? (""Do you want to eat ramyun before you go?"") is often used as an indirect way of asking, ""Do you want to sleep with me?"" (i.e., basically the Korean equivalent of ""Netflix and chill""). The phrase was first popularized in the 2001 film One Fine Spring Day, where Lee Young-ae's character invites Yoo Ji-tae's character to spend the night at her place (though the exact phrase she used in the movie was ""라면 먹을래요?"" or ""Do you want to eat ramyun?""). Since then, ""Do you want to eat ramyun before you go?"" has appeared in a number of Korean films, shows and songs and has become a well-known meme among Koreans and K-culture fans.

Love Next Door pokes fun at this meme a couple of times, first in the above scene involving Seung-hyo's parents and then later in Episode 11 when, in a clever variation of the original phrase, Seok-ryu asks Seung-hyo, ""Do you want to go drink banana milk with me?""

2. When Seung-hyo notices that the pomegranate tree that Seok-ryu gave him is dying, he visits a florist and asks her, ""Can you save my tree?"" He actually says in Korean, ""우리 석류 좀 살려 주세요,"" which translates to ""Please save my Seok-ryu/pomegranate."" Since Seok-ryu's name means ""pomegranate,"" his plea can be interpreted as both ""Please save my pomegranate tree"" and ""Please save my Seok-ryu."" Later in Episode 10, we see Seung-hyo talking to the plant as if he were talking to Seok-ryu.

3. Many Korean viewers praised Jung Hae-in for his spot-on impression of the award-winning actor Han Suk-kyu, who -- besides being famous for starring in a number of classic Korean films -- is known for having a soft, low-pitched voice and a very distinctive cadence to his speech.

Here's a funny clip of his co-stars from the 2013 movie The Berlin File mimicking his manner of speaking (all in good fun, of course). Han tells them, laughing, ""You're imitating me, aren't you?"":

Here's a scene from the K-drama Dr. Romantic 2 where you can really pick up on Han's trademark vocal register and speech pattern (turn on the subtitles and notice especially the inflection in his voice when he says, ""Why do you keep giving me an irrelevant answer for my question?""):

And below is the moment in Love Next Door when Jung Hae-in nails his impersonation of Han:

As Seolran Won, a PR manager at Studio Dragon (the production powerhouse that co-produced Love Next Door) points out, the lines that Jung Hae-in says here are a reference to an iconic scene from the 2000 K-drama Autumn in My Heart (or Autumn Tale), in which Won Bin's character asks Song Hye-kyo's character how much it would cost to buy her love:

This famous scene was parodied many times in Korea over the years, explains Won.

4. In the closing title sequence, the Korean word for ""cancer"" (암, pronounced like ""ahm"") changes to 삶 (pronounced like ""sahlm"" or ""sahm""), which means ""life.""

The writer probably chose these words because the endings sound the same. Of course, the words ""cancer"" and ""life"" do not sound similar at all in English, which is likely why the subtitles display something entirely different.

5. When Mo-eum bursts into Seok-ryu's room, angry that her friend didn't tell her that she had stomach cancer, Seok-ryu admits that she kept it a secret from her. According to the English subtitles, Mo-eum later replies, ""What are you doing? Are you turning yourself in?"" Though the subtitles convey the gist of what she says, Mo-eum actually says in Korean, ""뭐냐, '자수하여 광명 찾자'냐?"" which roughly translates to, ""What, so you're turning yourself in to find a brighter future -- is that it?""

Here Mo-eum is referring to the saying, ""어둠 속에 떨지 말고 자수하여 광명 찾자"" (Don't tremble in the dark; turn yourself in and find a brighter future.), a slogan that was popular in South Korea for several decades. While a shortened version of the phrase has been used in different contexts -- for example, to urge criminals to turn themselves in and receive a lighter punishment -- in the past it was primarily directed at North Korean spies who had infiltrated South Korean society. In the 1960s and 1970s, flyers with this anti-communist slogan were plastered on electric poles and walls throughout South Korea and were meant to encourage North Korean spies to stop conducting espionage, turn themselves in and start a peaceful life in South Korea. (Fun fact: South Korea to this day has a hotline you can call to report suspected spies. Residents can dial 113 to report espionage -- including industrial espionage -- and acts of terrorism to the Korean National Police Agency.)

All this to say, Mo-eum is using this famous expression in a sarcastic way to imply that Seok-ryu is admitting her fault in the hopes that Mo-eum might go easy on her.

6. For Seok-ryu's belated welcome home party, her father makes her 궁중떡볶이 (pronounced like ""goong-joong tteok-bokki""), or Korean royal court rice cakes. Originally served during the Joseon Dynasty, gungjung tteok-bokki is the earliest form of tteok-bokki, the popular Korean dish that's now more widely known as a spicy street food. Unlike the fire-red modern version that's flavored with gochujang (Korean red pepper paste), gungjung tteok-bokki was prepared by seasoning meat, vegetables and rice cakes in soy sauce and was considered a delicacy served to the king (hence its name). Though it has ""tteok-bokki"" in its name, it's actually more similar to another rice cake dish called tteok-jjim (떡찜).

7. Remember the Korean legend of Ungnyeo (""Bear Woman"") that Seok-ryu alludes to in Episode 3? It makes a reappearance in the episode's closing title sequence, which starts with the words 동굴의 곰, meaning ""Bear in the Cave."" Then the last word in the phrase, 곰 (which is pronounced like ""gohm"" and means ""bear""), is turned upside down to spell 문 (pronounced like ""moon""), the Korean term for a door, gate or entrance (in this context, it's referring to the mouth of a cave).

The episode's final scene and closing title sequence are particularly powerful in their symbolism. Like the bear in Korea's creation myth who endured many days inside a dark cave but later emerged from it as a transformed being, Seok-ryu -- with the help of her family, Mo-eum and, of course, Seung-hyo -- is finally able to step out of the darkness and isolation that she's been trapped in for so long. And just like how Ungnyeo had to shed her former self when she left the cave, Seok-ryu closes a chapter of her life by bidding goodbye to her ex-fiancé and walking out of the airport with Seung-hyo."

Hugo Basilotta and his wife, Cristina Fernández, run Guaymallen, the Argentinian snack brand that her father started in 1945. Basilotta, 72, says he has received multiple buyout offers but refuses to sell the family business, which now employs members of the third and fourth generation. The company produces almost 3 million sandwich cookies -- called alfajores -- per day and exports to the U.S. and Europe.

Onetime U.S. Open champion Dominic Thiem announced in May that he will retire from tennis by the end of the year. The 31-year-old, whose career earnings exceed $30 million, says he is ""full of energy"" for his career off the court. His business endeavors include a line of sunglasses, investment in a healthier chocolate brand called Neoh and ongoing sponsorship deals with Adidas and Rolex. He has also recently teamed up with solar energy startup Solah to start selling electricity generated from housetop solar panels via ThiemEnergy.

Kate Kallot, whose family hails from the Central African Republic, appears on the cover of Forbes Afrique for her Kenyan data-collection startup, Amini. Kallot, 34, has raised $6 million and hired a team of 24 since 2022 to gather and distribute reliable information that can inform and democratize decision making across the continent. ""If data is the new oil, we need to extract value from it here [in Africa],"" she says. Amini's AI technology has analyzed satellite imagery to identify areas of drought in East Africa where irrigation solutions can reduce farming losses and insurance costs. Kallot previously worked for Nvidia in New York on expansion into emerging markets.

After nearly 25 years as a marketing executive at Colgate Palmolive and Coca-Cola, Pierangela Sierra launched an e-commerce business in 2018 with her husband. Called Tipti, it markets to busy women like Sierra who want their groceries and household goods delivered. (The name comes from ""time for you"" in Spanish.) With 800 employees and delivery available in 45 cities across the country, sales for 2024 are projected to reach $85 million.

The grandson of India's richest woman, Savitri Jindal, and son of steel group JSW chairman Sajjan Jindal, Parth Jindal formed JSW Sports in 2012 to raise the profile of his family's conglomerate. JSW Sports recruits the country's most promising athletes to its training facility in the southwestern state of Karnataka and helps them with nutrition, coaching and arrangements for international competitions. The company, which sponsored the Olympic uniforms for the Indian delegation this summer, supports 41 of the 117 athletes from India who qualified for the 2024 Paris Olympics.

After Hamas' deadly attack on Israel in October 2023, Forbes Israel postponed its tenth annual ""Best Doctors"" list that had been scheduled to publish that month. The ranking was then reimagined and released in mid-2024 highlighting ""angels in white"" -- brave medical professionals working amid the ongoing regional conflict. Dentist Esi Sharon-Sagie (right), for instance, has been appointed by Israeli police to lead dental forensics and help identify human remains through oral examinations.

Forbes Korea calls Soojong Kim the ""Rocket Man"" of South Korea. His company, Innospace, which makes small satellite launch vehicles, is scheduled to begin commercial flights in 2025, with a total of 17 planned through 2026. ""Demand for satellites from general companies such as telecommunications is skyrocketing,"" CEO Kim says. One of his Hanbit Micro launch vehicles can send three 100-pound satellites into orbit -- a fraction of the payload of U.S.-made counterpart Falcon-9. ""If SpaceX is a bus, we are a taxi,"" Kim explains. Innospace raised $41 million this summer in its debut on the Korean stock exchange; shares of the company fell more than 50% during its first six weeks of trading.

Chinese tire maker Sailun has diversified its manufacturing base into other nations, while bracing for potential U.S. tariffs. Its largest international facility -- which opened in 2013 in Vietnam's southeastern Tay Ninh province -- employs 7,000 workers. The company has poured more than $1 billion into Sailun Vietnam, which is led by Cao Guoqiang. The unit now accounts for 25% of the parent company's $3 billion-plus annual revenue.

Forbes Africa focuses on the movie industry leaders who are bucking stereotypical portrayals of Africans as poor, hungry and disease-stricken. Actress and playwright Danai Gurira, who spent most of her childhood in Zimbabwe and now splits her time between New York and Los Angeles, talks about accepting big-screen roles that portray authentic African narratives. She has appeared in Marvel's two Black Panther blockbusters centered on a superhero of African descent, as well as in two Avengers flicks."

Gauff won the WTA 1000 title in Beijing on Sunday after beating U.S. Open semifinalist Karolina Muchova 6-1, 6-3 in the final. It was Gauff's second WTA Tour title of the season after her successful title defense at the ASB Classic in Auckland, New Zealand in January.

According to the WTA website, Gauff is the first woman in the Open Era to win her first seven WTA hard-court finals.

Interestingly, Gauff had no plans of playing in the China Open after suffering a fourth-round exit during her U.S. Open title defense last month. But the 20-year-old, who made changes to her coaching team, believed she needed to compete instead of taking a training break.

The youngster, who became the second American champion in Beijing after Serena Williams' title runs in 2004 and 2013, took a relaxed approach to the tournament in Beijing and kept her expectations low.

Ultimately, that proved to be helpful.

""I think last year, I won U.S. Open and I was like, the rest of the season, I want to do well, but whatever -- just play and see what happens,"" Gauff told WTA Insider.

""And then this time it was like, well, I haven't done so well. The tournaments that I really wanted to do well in, the Slams, that was over. So it was kind of, let's just see what happens here.

""I always think that this part of the season will always just be more relaxed for me.""

Her route to the trophy wasn't easy as Gauff had to bounce back from a set down in three consecutive matches to make the final. But she was proud of sticking to her plan.

""I think the result is now reassurance that I am in the right direction,"" she added.

The world no. 6, who won the U.S. Open in 2023 and reached the French Open final in 2022, expressed pride in her journey so far and added that there is still room for improvement.

""A lot of times people forget that I'm still in the developmental phase of my career and nothing is going to be great,"" Gauff said. ""Most of the people doing well are 25 [years] and older in the Top 10, maybe with the exception of Iga [Swiatek].

""We have a long way to go and I still have a lot that I need to work on and I'm proud of myself thus far,"" she said.

""I didn't have a complete game at 15 and I don't have one right now, but I've been on tour playing every week almost, trying to be better. I'm just super proud of that."""
Why Society Never Put Self-Reliance On A Pedestal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mahaabouelenein/2024/10/07/why-society-never-put-self-reliance-on-a-pedestal/,2024-10-07T11:10:28Z,"I wrote a whole book about practicing self-reliance. I didn't write it because I am a strong, independent woman, which I am; I wrote it because I feel society has gone soft, and too many people are waiting for permission from 'others.' The truth is, if you know the skills and have the tools to rely on yourself, not only will you be happier, but you will also become a valuable contributor to society, your family, your community and your relationships.

Parents are swooping in to save their children so much that not only are children not capable of doing things for themselves - they don't want to and have become entitled. Some younger generations lack the ability to make their own decisions and rely on mom and dad to save them instead of having to figure things out on their own. The reason? They haven't been taught the importance of self-reliance. They rely on their phones, on their parents, on social media instead of relying on themselves. And then they are entering the workforce, with skewed expectations of what they want their employers to do for them.

Too often:

Self-reliance is a superpower. It not only makes you valuable, but it also makes you indispensable to others. Society, however, has never put self-reliance on a pedestal and rarely celebrates it. The term often gets a bad rap, and is seen as synonymous with independence or selfishness, as though self-reliant people don't need anyone else. This misunderstanding is why self-reliance needs both a redefinition and a rebrand. My definition of self-reliance has nothing to do with independence.

It has everything to do with investing in yourself, betting on yourself, and trusting yourself. It's about making yourself the most powerful asset you can be a meaningful contributor to society. When you focus on your growth, and bring your best self and power to the table, you become a net positive to the world around you.

What if we all focused on improving ourselves first? Too often, we blame others for our unhappiness, when the truth is, we alone are responsible for our outcomes. It's time to recognize the value of our own potential and invest in it.

The new narrative of self-reliance is about:

Self-reliance breeds strong individuals, which in turn creates strong workplaces, communities, and a vibrant, self-actualized society.

Imagine a world where we are all programmed to trust ourselves, invest in our growth, and confidently take ownership of our decisions."
Influencers Are Telling Teens That Selling Their Eggs Is Easy Money. It's Not That Simple.,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexandralevine/2024/10/04/influencers-eggs-donors-money-teens-tiktok/,2024-10-07T10:34:32Z,"The United States has few rules governing egg and sperm donation, a Wild West being supercharged by influencers touting it as a cash-cow to millions of young followers. Americans conceived through donors are using social media to fight back.

few weeks ago, a 19-year-old influencer announced a new hobby to scores of TikTok followers: egg donation. Selling her eggs to women or couples looking to get pregnant was a fast and mostly painless way to make gobs of money, she thought.

""This girl just said she donated her eggs and got a quick $20,000 -- and I immediately started looking it up and decided that's going to be my next hobby,"" TikToker Gigi Juliana, holding a Starbucks iced coffee, told her audience of 137,000. She claimed the side effects from the invasive surgical procedure are no different than what she already feels after a trip to the med spa (where customers go for botox and filler), so why not? ""If you see like 30,000 of my children running around because I'm going to donate eggs like crazy... don't be alarmed,"" she quipped.

Posted on August 20, the video has been watched more than 24 million times, liked 4 million times, shared hundreds of thousands of times and drawn 18,000 comments -- many from others who say they, too, are eager to donate their eggs to buy that new car, fund a vacation or, like Gigi, just cash in. (Egg donors often make around $12,000 per cycle, though some can earn as much as $25,000. Repeat donors can rake in more than $70,000 for multiple rounds.)

""Basically a normal day for me...except that I will be richer...sign me up,"" wrote one commenter named Lizzy.

""Imma donate my sperm cuz I'm 6""2 and highly educated with no medical problems. Gonna make BANK,"" said a male follower. (Some cryobanks offer healthy men up to $1,500 a month.)

But the viral clip also prompted outcry from a vocal and growing online community of donor-conceived people -- those born from donated eggs or sperm -- who are increasingly using social media to push for laws to better protect kids conceived in this little-regulated space and sound the alarm on the issues that rhetoric like Gigi's can create.

For one, mass donors can put offspring at risk of accidental incest by donating many times in the same geographic area. Unlike several other countries, the United States has no federal laws limiting the volume of donations one person can make (there are only recommendations from the nonprofit American Society of Reproductive Medicine). Having dozens or hundreds of siblings can also be traumatic for parents and children -- issues highlighted in the recent Netflix documentary ""Man With 1000 Kids,"" about a serial sperm donor who lied his way into donating to hundreds of families around the world before a Dutch court last year barred him from ever doing so again.

There are also safety concerns and potential long-term health consequences for egg donors -- especially those who donate repeatedly and therefore inject themselves with high levels of hormones over a prolonged period of time -- that have not been thoroughly studied and are near impossible to explain in a seconds-long social media post, which can mislead the teens and 20-somethings who are often the target audience (Gigi was 18 when she made her viral TikTok). The American Society of Reproductive Medicine recommends egg and sperm donors to be at least 21, and that donors younger than that undergo a prior psychological evaluation.

Finally, big payouts may incentivize donors to lie or omit information on their applications, advocates argue, exploiting loopholes in a legal Wild West and lax screening processes where donors self-report any medical issues and are usually not fact-checked by the banks. (They do undergo basic genetic testing.)

""Not everything should be monetized. Not everything should be content.""

""All of these influencers -- including this person -- are looking at this as a money-making opportunity but not thinking about it long-term,"" Laura High, one of the most-followed donor-conceived creators on TikTok, with an audience of nearly 700,000, told Forbes. ""This is not an egg that's going to sit in a petri dish; this is going to become a full-fledged human being. That full-fledged human being is eventually going to see that video. And the fact that this person is treating egg donation, as they said, as a 'hobby' is not just dangerous, it's predatory.""

""I'm totally supportive of donor conception. ... I am for ethical donor conception, and that's the problem, and that's what we're not seeing, and that's what social media is helping perpetuate: the unethical side of it,"" High added. ""Not everything should be monetized. Not everything should be content."" A week after Gigi's viral TikTok, she followed-up with a video plugging an agency and egg bank in Southern California. The post was a paid collaboration.

""This was my first time speaking/pondering the topic so I didn't do any research before posting,"" Gigi said in an email.

""After reading through the comments I feel I have a deeper understanding for donating eggs,"" she continued. ""I didn't realize the qualifications were so strict, that realistically not even I would be accepted as a donor. While I do understand it is a very rigorous process that takes a huge toll on our bodies, I think that it is beautiful we can give the gift of families to other women that don't have that ability. While it definitely would not work for everyone, it's sweet that I could've possibly reached someone who helped create a family.""

ocial media is dramatically changing conversations around reproductive health and family-building in America, pushing once-private discussions about infertility into the open and normalizing alternatives like in-vitro fertilization (IVF), surrogacy and donors that can help those struggling, as well as singles and same-sex couples, become parents. They're topics that have become politicized in the post-Roe v. Wade era -- a flashpoint in the 2024 presidential race, a target for states like Alabama that have sought to designate unused frozen IVF embryos as human beings, and a partisan lightning rod for Republicans in Congress who've repeatedly blocked legislation guaranteeing the right to IVF nationwide. At the same time, the debates are raising awareness around the growing need for these services, protections for them and policies that would make them more accessible. (IVF, a process used with donors, where sperm and egg are mixed in a lab and then implanted in a woman's uterus to try to make a baby, is not an option for many Americans; a single round can cost more than $30,000 and is generally not covered by insurance.)

But while social media is helping to destigmatize these problems and procedures, it's also having an unintended consequence: Recasting a serious medical procedure that's not without risk as something that's no big deal -- even fun, glamorous and above all, highly lucrative. TikTok and Instagram influencers are making trendy ""get ready with me"" and ""day in the life"" videos about donating their eggs; sharing viral videos during the retrievals using hashtags like #rich and #money; and in some cases getting paid to post their journeys without disclosing it. The industry contributes, too, as agencies, clinics and egg and sperm banks recruit donors with marketing about the luxury cars and designer bags one can buy by selling their genetic material. (A TikTok from Fairfax EggBank, one of the country's largest, touted Chanel and Louis Vuitton purses that would be up for grabs with the $48,000 earned. The video, set to Britney Spears' ""Oops! I Did It Again"" and liked hundreds of thousands of times, has since been taken down. The bank did not respond to a request for comment.)

The intentions -- attracting donors to give more people the opportunity to have families -- are commendable. Donating can also open doors for some who use what they earn to help cover tuition or pay off student loans, and many do it altruistically. But some donor-conceived people and experts say the vast majority of social media content that lures donors with fat checks and fancy things is doing more harm than good to the fertility world, violating moral codes by downplaying what's at stake for donors, recipient parents and future children when creating a human life.

Egg donation is generally low risk, but the risks involved are nonetheless ""real and potentially severe,"" according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. Some donors suffer from ""ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome,"" when the hormone medications and retrieval procedures cause excessive swelling of the donor's ovaries, which can result in severe abdominal pain, shortness of breath, vomiting and rapid weight gain that may land them in the hospital. Acute complications like infection, bleeding, loss of an ovary or damage to another reproductive organ could also threaten that woman's own ability to get pregnant (and it's not always clear who pays for medical treatment if something goes wrong).

Beyond possible health effects, the get-rich-quick messaging being amplified by influencers and industry alike has also left many donors brushing off or outright ignoring the implications of one day being tracked down by their biological children -- a feat now made easier than ever with social media, and commercial DNA tests like 23andMe and Ancestry, that together have all but done away with donor anonymity.

Illustrating a fuller picture and disclosing the risks at the outset is vital to donors' informed consent, according to Jamie Spiers, director of LGBTQ+ family advocacy at the U.S. Donor Conceived Council, a nonprofit that advocates for the community and has been central to legislative efforts to protect it.

""We're not against [donor] compensation -- it's just there's a balance between how much somebody's getting compensated, and the course of nature, and the ethical concerns, so we just want to... make sure that that's not the sole thing being highlighted when people are being recruited,"" Spiers told Forbes. ""Especially early on, it needs to be a more balanced understanding of what they're getting into.""

Rachel Schiff, the council's director of marketing, added that the types of posts catching fire on social media prey not only on the donors, but also on the emotionally vulnerable recipients desperate to do whatever they can to have a family.

""There is a lot of misinformation that can get thrown around,"" they said. ""And just because people want a baby so badly, they'll read it and take it at face value.""

omi Slossberg and her wife used a sperm donor to become mothers. After finding Seattle Sperm Bank through Google, Slossberg chose the biological father of her future children based on a small file -- a short bio and audio interview, basic genetic testing, yes-or-no answers to medical questions as simple as whether anyone in his family had worn glasses, and a baby photo that she had to trust was really him.

She spent $10,000 on the donor -- on top of $80,000 on fertility treatment and surgery where she lives in Colorado -- to conceive, only for her daughter to be born deaf in one ear. Slossberg has since tracked down more than a dozen half-siblings, including one who has hearing loss and another who was born missing an arm. When she eventually found the donor through a DNA test, he disclosed that his own sister had the same condition as her daughter (microtia, a birth defect resulting in a malformed ear). Doctors said there was no way of knowing whether the donor was the cause without deeper investigation, and a perfect outcome is never guaranteed in any pregnancy. But the experience led Slossberg to question whether donors are fully and truthfully disclosing their histories.

""The medical records that I was sold did not match the actual medical history of the donor,"" the 32-year-old creator, now a mother of two, told Forbes. Today she uses Instagram -- where she's built an audience of 37,000 -- to advocate for the rights of donor-conceived people, demanding more regulation around donor transparency and verification of their health documents.

""You're spending money thinking that you're buying something, and the description of the product is accurate, and then years later, you find out that it wasn't,"" she added. ""Obviously, at the end, the result is you have your children. But if they're sending you something for that amount of money, they should give you accurate information.""

High, the popular creator who calls herself ""your donor-conceived person of TikTok,"" was born in 1988 through a sperm donor after both her parents struggled with infertility. At the time, couples didn't typically pick their donors; clinics would instead choose the sperm donor that most closely matched the father's hair and eye color, ethnic background and religion. The man who'd be raising her was Irish, Scottish, Norwegian and Catholic, and they were told the donor would be just like him.

When High was 26, she learned through an Ancestry DNA test that the donor was, in fact, 100 percent Ashkenazi Jewish. (She said she looks ""very Ashkenazi"" and had long been a target of antisemitism without understanding why.)

""If the clinic lied about this, what else could they have lied about?"" she said.

Contacted by High, the doctor, who is still practicing in New York City, told her the medical records from more than three decades ago were gone and that the donor had been healthy. But the host of health issues High has grappled with, which now include infertility, have left her skeptical and eager for answers.

""I don't know what I should be expecting for my life. I'm about to have a kid. I have no idea what could potentially be a quarter of them, and it's scary,"" she told Forbes. ""How susceptible am I to cancers? To Parkinson's? To Alzheimer's? To heart failure? And these are all things that, with proper screening, could be prevented. ... I don't even know if breast cancer runs in his family. I don't even know if I should be getting mammograms early, and an early mammogram wouldn't be covered by health insurance because I don't have a 'family history' of it.""

""Unless you've gone through medical emergencies like this, it's something that you don't understand,"" she added. ""And if you don't understand why having a complete medical history is imperative, consider yourself very privileged that you have not been put in that situation.""

At 29, using Ancestry and Facebook, High found her biological father. She wrote him a letter, asking for a conversation and some medical information, and hand-delivered it to his office in New York City. Seven years later, she hasn't heard back.

here are few laws governing how all this works in the U.S. And though the American Society of Reproductive Medicine, which represents the fertility industry, has issued ethical guidelines, whether and how to follow them is up to those providing services or care. (The Society declined to comment for this story, instead sending Forbes a link to its recommendations, which predate TikTok's explosion in the U.S.)

Still, creators' advocacy on and off social media has helped lead to the passage of a number of state laws, and the introduction of federal legislation, that would place guardrails on the space.

In 2022, the nonprofit donor-conceived council and Slossberg, the influencer and recipient parent from Colorado, helped the state become the first and only in the country to ban anonymous sperm and egg donations, granting donor-conceived kids the right to know their donor's identity at 18 (the United Kingdom and Sweden have similar mandates). It's also the first and only U.S. law to limit how much one donor can donate, preventing them from giving to more than 25 families and capping egg donors at six cycles. The Colorado law, which will also set the minimum donor age at 21 and create rules for accessing and updating their records and medical history, takes effect in January.

In 2023, High, the top TikToker, helped usher the introduction of a federal bill that would criminalize so-called ""fertility fraud,"" where providers misrepresent whose DNA they're using for IVF or assisted insemination. The issue drew national attention with the Netflix documentary ""Our Father,"" which tells the story of one of dozens of fertility doctors in the U.S. who've been accused of implanting their own sperm in their patients. The legislation is unlikely to move in an election year but has picked up 53 bipartisan cosponsors, and about a dozen states already have similar laws on the books thanks in part to influencers' advocacy.

And next weekend, for the second year in a row, donor-conceived advocates including Slossberg will gather at the largest meeting-of-the-minds in reproductive health, the Society's annual ""Scientific Congress & Expo"" in Denver. Their goal is ""advocating for the equivalent of seat belts to the fertility industry,"" said High, who protested outside last year's event with others from the community.

""This is not an industry that creates tables, creates shirts; they're literally making babies,"" she said. ""They should be held to the highest standard. And the fact that we don't have the equivalent of a seat belt should terrify everybody."""
"'FROM' Season 3, Episode 3 Recap And Review: A Murder Of Crows",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/10/06/from-season-3-episode-3-recap-and-review-a-murder-of-crows/,2024-10-06T19:18:22Z,"The latest episode of FROM is yet another banger in Season 3's gripping early run. It's honestly a bit tortuous to have to wait an entire week between episodes, though I'm still glad Amazon and MGM are releasing it this way. Good shows ought to have a chance to marinate, to get that glorious watercooler talk week after week. I'm old-fashioned like that, and FROM is the perfect show for discussion of fan theories, unpuzzling mysteries and occasionally griping about ridiculous character choices.

Let's go over what's happening with each of our primary characters / groups this episode beginning with . . . .

Jade, Kenny, Kristi, Dale and a couple other Fromvillians from the big house all head out to the little abandoned homestead with the creepy mannequins to gather more food from the lake, though snow has fallen and things are considerably less hospitable than they were before. It's a wonder any vegetables are harvestable at this point, though they also find berries.

Jade is in a bad mood, and after some squabbling stomps off on his own to relieve himself, when he comes across some strange red boulders. It's here that he sees his first vision: A man on a tree, his face mangled. When others show up, the man disappears, but Jade is at his wit's end and despite warnings that he'll never make it back to town before dark, he sets off on his own. Kristi follows, trying to stop him, and steps into a bear trap.

As darkness looms, the rest of the group scrambles to get her free. Jade and the always unpleasant Dale rush back to the mannequins, which were built with a combination of wood and metal bars. They grab the latter and are able to free Kristi, though her ankle has seen better days. As they work to reset her foot, Jade's vision reappears, gruesomely, only vanishing again when Kristi tells him to focus. They rush her back to the homestead to take shelter for the night. Meanwhile . . .

Perhaps the most dread-inducing storyline of Season 3 revolves around Fatima and her ill-fated pregnancy. We've already learned that she can't keep normal food down and has resorted to eating -- ravenously -- the rotten crops that have now been piled up outside the big house.

She does this in an almost feral manner, and while she doesn't want to be seen it's as if her hunger outweighs her need for secrecy. Tillie -- who I still find unsettling -- spots her and tries to talk to her about the oddities of pregnancy. She also offers a Tarot card reading, which Fatima at first rebukes.

When Tillie reassures her that it's not a game, but something that's helped her in life, she relents and the two sit down. But just as they're about to begin the reading a crow flies into the window. They're startled but continue to start the reading, when suddenly another crow smashes through the window and begins to fly around the house, bloodied and cawing. It's honestly terrifying -- as though the evil presence that rules the town was genuinely afraid of what they might discover in the cards. Will they return to this or have they been too unsettled to continue? What will the cards tell old Tillie about Fatima's baby? And is it even a baby inside her? I think it's clear that something is very, very wrong.

But things aren't going so well back in the real world, either.

In Maine, Tabitha has convinced Henry she's telling the truth. She's studied all the paintings, and still hasn't found anything helpful. Henry tells her about the bottle tree, and shockingly enough his wife had hung bottles from the tree in their yard, just like the Faraway tree she entered to get to the Lighthouse.

But this isn't the original tree, he tells her. Victor's mother did another one first, back in town. So they hop in the car and head to the park. This is really interesting because in Fromville there are also two bottle trees. There's the one Victor took Tabitha to, but there's another that Boyd found earlier in the series. I wonder, are they the same distance apart that these two trees in the real world are? This must be significant, but we're never shown the second tree. Tabitha and Henry never make it.

On their way to the tree, Tabitha finds a bracelet just like the one she gave Jim and suddenly she realizes -- or at least she believes -- that all of this is in fact a lie. She's not in the real world at all. She tells Henry to pull over, she needs to get out of the car, she's panicking. But Henry isn't willing to just give up after everything she's told him and he pulls the car out into the street without looking. A car crashes into theirs and the next thing Tabitha knows, she's in an ambulance. Henry is unconscious next to her.

And this is when things go from bad to worse. The ambulance has two medics and a police officer, and none of them will let her go. They've been looking for the mysterious woman who just walked out of the hospital the day before, and they're understandably worried that she isn't well. And then they come to a tree in the road. Tabitha looks on with horror.

Elsewhere, we have Boyd trying to come up with a plan. He wants to catch one of the monsters, and he goes to Randall's bus and offers to switch places for the night. Not everyone is onboard with this plan, but Boyd is tired of just waiting around. The creatures have changed. Things are getting worse, but there's nothing worse than just sitting around waiting for the next horror.

I'm genuinely enjoying this season a lot more than Season 2. It really feels like we're getting some forward momentum, and while we haven't gotten any big answers yet, you can almost taste them on the wind. Tabitha's journey to the real world is a big deal, and her return to Fromville -- along with Victor's dad -- will make waves among its residents.

I've also noted that we seem to be getting fewer F-bombs, and characters are communicating a little bit better than in seasons past. We'll see if that continues, but so far I'm just really hyped for this season and can't wait for each new episode. It's awfully grim, but it's really gaining steam and everything feels a bit less stuck in place narratively -- though our heroes remain as stuck as ever in this dreadful nightmare."
"Dana White Slams Rival After UFC 307: 'They're Drowning, They Suck'",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/10/06/dana-white-slams-rival-after-ufc-307-theyre-drowning-they-suck/,2024-10-06T14:32:01Z,"During the post-event press conference following UFC 307, Dana White was asked about the Professional Fighters League using Kayla Harrison's fight on Saturday night at UFC 307 as an opportunity to hype Larissa Pacheco, the woman who handed the two-time Olympian her only professional loss as a mixed martial artist.

Harrison had defeated Pacheco twice before her loss in 2022, but the organization had hoped the former would re-sign for another fight with the latter and potentially Cris Cyborg. White didn't hold back his harsh opinions on the world's second-biggest mixed martial arts organization.

The UFC President said bluntly, ""They're drowning. They suck. They're not good at what they do.""

Here is a look at the clip.

White and PFL President Donn Davis have been engaging in a war of words over the past year that has gotten increasingly more consistent. White uses the promotion's name more than he used to, which could signify that the PFL is becoming a more formidable player in the mixed martial arts landscape.

I do not believe the PFL is a legitimate threat to the UFC yet. Still, the promotion's ability to sign solid young fighters like Paul Hughes, Dakota Ditcheva, and other top prospects speaks to their legitimacy.

Quite honestly, it all began with the PFL being able to pry Francis Ngannou away from the UFC. That move was monumental in combat sports, and we're still learning about its full impact.

As it is, UFC 307 was a significant financial success, according to the records that were shared following the event. The PPV drew more than 18,000 fans at the Delta Center in Salt Lake City, Utah, and the gate exceeded $5 million.

Harrison won her fight and should be the next challenger in the women's bantamweight championship. The win over Ketlen Vieira pushed Harrison to No. 2 in the UFC's women's bantamweight rankings.

That title changed hands on the card as Julianna Pena dethroned Raquel Pennington in a hard-fought co-main event fight.

We'll see if the PFL has something cooked up for the next time Harrison fights. Here is a look at all of the results from the UFC 307 card."
'Agatha All Along' Has Set A Marvel TV Series Record,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/06/agatha-all-along-has-set-a-marvel-tv-series-record/,2024-10-06T13:00:22Z,"This article was published on 10/4 and republished on 10/6.

Agatha All Along is a hit, thanks to decent viewership compared to an extremely low budget. But Disney is also celebrating its success in another way.

One important metric when it comes to the reception and renewal of streaming series is ""continuation rate,"" whether that's how far you get through a Netflix binge, or if you keep following along week-to-week. A low completion rate means people are less likely to show up for season 2, hence why it's a big factor in why shows get cancelled.

Well, Marvel TV's Brad Winderbaum has now confirmed to Variety that so far, Agatha has the best continuation rate of any Marvel show they've released after four episodes here. Meaning week to week, it has retained the largest percentage of viewers, though he does not get into specifics, perhaps because he doesn't want the other shows to look bad. As a reminder, here are all the Marvel series that have aired so far, and it's better than all these:

Marvel TV is pretty goofy considering out of every show on that list, only What If...? and Loki got a season 2. Falcon and the Winter Soldier, WandaVision and Secret Invasion were supposed to be miniseries. She-Hulk is for sure cancelled, but Moon Knight, Ms. Marvel, Hawkeye and Echo are in limbo. Moon Knight may be the closest to getting a second season, but it hasn't been announced.

So, a solid completion rate is great for Agatha? I mean yes, but it's...another miniseries, so it's not looking for a season 2 renewal anyway. However, the success of Agatha may mean the following:

This is all great news, and the show has also largely avoided the kind of culture wars you might normally see from a mostly-women-led, LGBTQ project like this. It's performing great, and hopefully the rest of the series continues to keep this quality bar.

Update (10/6): In this same interview about the retention rate, Brad Winderbaum spent a while talking about the budget, where he confirmed it has the lowest of any Disney Plus show, which puts it underneath the $40 million Echo. It's supposedly part of a new philosophy that leans away from high-budget spectacles starring (expensive) actors from the films, something that Agatha lacks (at least until Scarlet Witch shows up, perhaps). Here's Winderbaum on the future budgets:

""I think it's about how you use the effects, as opposed to the scale of the effects,"" he said. ""And we're responding to to our own recent history here, and how effective effects really are in increasing the value of a story.""

But Winderbaum is also quick to praise Agatha's showrunner as the driving force behind why the series, like WandaVision, is a hit:

""Jac is unbelievable,"" Winderbaum said. ""Any chance I get to walk around that woman's imagination is like a gift. She's an absolute genius storyteller. And I can tell you like there are so many twists and turns left to come in 'Agatha.'""

I feel like I know a few of those twists or turns already, but that doesn't mean the journey is still going to be fun for another five weeks here."
"Movie Flashback: 'Pillow Talk,' Starring Doris Day And Rock Hudson, Turns 65",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/marcberman1/2024/10/06/movie-flashback-pillow-talk-starring-doris-day-and-rock-hudson-turns-65/,2024-10-06T12:30:41Z,"The year was 1959. The stars were Doris Day and Rock Hudson. And the movie was Pillow Talk, the first of their three romantic comedies together.

Today the still irresistible Pillow Talk turns 65.

Pillow Talk tells the tale of a New York interior decorator named Jan Morrow (Doris Day) who, sight unseen, takes an enormous dislike to Brad Allen (Rock Hudson), a playboy song writer who shares her party-line phone. A party-line, of course, was a telephone line shared by multiple subscribers. And this song writer, who constantly ties up the line to woo his romantic conquests, learns by accident that his angry phone-sharer is the kind of woman he would like to know better. Being fully aware that his real identity will get him nowhere, Brad wangles an introduction under an assumed name and personality.

The set is now staged for some romantic hijinks, which as expected has a happy ending.

This was Hudson's first comedy following a slew of dramas on his film resume. And, for Doris Day, Pillow Talk transformed her image from ""the girl next door"" to sudden sex symbol.

The supporting cast of Pillow Talk includes Tony Randall, Thelma Ritter and Nick Adams. And the reviews were mostly positive, with five Academy Award nominations (resulting in a win for Best Story and Screenplay - Written Directly for the Screen). Day and Ritter, who played much the same role that she played in Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window -- the dour, wisecracking working-class woman - were nominated in the categories of Best Actress and Best Supporting Actress, respectively.

Pillow Talk was a box office hit, grossing approximately $18,750,000 domestically (which translates to over $202 million today). It was number one at the U.S. box office for seven consecutive weeks. And, in 2009, Pillow Talk was entered into the National Film Registry by the Library of Congress for being ""culturally, historically or aesthetically"" significant and preserved.

Fun factoid: Ross Hunter, who produced Pillow Talk, claimed that theater managers did not want to book it. Popular movie themes at the time were war films, westerns, and spectacles. They felt the ""sophisticated comedy"" format was out of style. And they were concerned that both Day and Hudson had already peaked."

The renowned festival hosts a month of photo-related celebrations that converts the medieval city in the heart of Tuscany, Italy, into the international capital of photography for participating professional photographers, amateurs, emerging talents and enthusiasts.

The festival offers exhibitions of the winners of the Drone Photo Award, the Creative Photo Award and the International Photo Award (SIPA) competitions, among others.

Tender images of animals, beautiful nature shots, gut-wrenching photos of human despair, fascinating faces and striking sport feats are among the great pictures on display at this year's Siena Photo Awards.

The Siena photo contests are open to professional, amateur and student photographers worldwide.

Lurdes Santander from Asturias, Spain, took the title for the Photograph of the Year at the Creative Photo Awards with her image ""Dreaming Above the Universe,"" a heartwarming photo depicting a mother bear and her three cubs nestled under the starry Milky Way.

Lurdes' captivating work, along with the other awarded entries from the Creative Photo Awards, will be showcased in the exhibition ""I Wonder if You Can"" at the Siena Awards Festival.

The mysterious portrait, seemingly carved into the basalt rocks, is reminiscent of the world of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the dark land of Mordor. This white Swiss Shepherd symbolizes the white spirit, a white wizard, a protector -- and hope that springs eternal.

What Does The Future Of Leadership Acquisition Look Like?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/rhettpower/2024/10/06/what-does-the-future-of-leadership-acquisition-look-like/,2024-10-06T11:06:12Z,"The stakes for securing top executive talent have never been higher. According to Gallup, companies get executive hires wrong an astounding 82% of the time. With this in mind, the role of executive search firms has evolved from merely filling vacancies to a more nuanced practice that combines the art of assessing character and the science of data-driven decision-making.

This strategic approach ensures that leaders meet technical qualifications and align seamlessly with an organization's culture and long-term objectives. In an increasingly competitive market, the key to success lies in securing leaders who are the right fit to drive organizational success.

Uncovering Hidden Potential Beyond the Resume

Evaluating a candidate's resume is only the beginning. The true challenge lies in uncovering the potential beyond bullet points and job titles. Shawn Cole, a seasoned expert in executive search, emphasizes the importance of understanding a candidate's character and leadership potential, which are often shaped by the environments in which they have worked.

""We believe strongly in the idea that 'the environment makes the man or woman,'"" says Cole. ""By closely examining where a candidate has worked and how they have navigated those environments, we can gain critical insights into their potential as a leader."" Top-tier firms look for patterns of success in candidates who have thrived in demanding environments, sometimes referred to as ""honey holes"" -- organizations known for producing exceptional leaders. These candidates bring a proven track record of overcoming challenges and achieving results in high-pressure situations.

This approach goes beyond qualifications, focusing instead on identifying the intrinsic qualities that differentiate a good leader from a great one. By leveraging tools like personality assessments, references, and behavioral interviews, search firms can gain a comprehensive understanding of a candidate's leadership potential, ensuring that they are well-suited to drive success in their new role.

Cultural Fit is The Secret Sauce of Success

In executive search, cultural fit is often the determining factor between a good hire and a great one. While technical skills and experience are crucial, they are not sufficient on their own. Successful placements require a deep alignment between the candidate's values, leadership style, and the organization's culture. This alignment ensures the leader can thrive within the company and drive the team toward shared goals.

Shawn Cole highlights the importance of an objective approach to assessing cultural fit, emphasizing that it's not about gut feelings but measurable factors. ""We start by thoroughly understanding the client's core values, mission, and work environment,"" says Cole. ""This allows us to identify the specific qualities a candidate must possess to succeed within that culture.""

To achieve this, firms conduct cultural alignment checks, comparing the candidate's past work environments with the client's organizational culture. Behavioral interviews are another indispensable tool, helping to assess how candidates have handled situations that reflect the client's cultural priorities, such as fostering collaboration or managing conflict. In some cases, firms may even use simulations or role-playing scenarios to observe how candidates interact in settings that mimic the client's work style.

An example of this is the successful placement of an executive in a complex, multi-billion dollar, employee-owned company. The candidate's ability to navigate the unique culture of employee ownership -- a long-term, employee-first approach -- was critical to their success. By ensuring a strong cultural fit, the placement not only met but exceeded the client's expectations, demonstrating the impact that cultural alignment can have on long-term success.

Future-Proofing Your Leadership is the Key to Sustainable Success

In a rapidly evolving business landscape, the ability to adapt is just as important as experience. Future-proofing leadership means identifying candidates who not only excel in their current roles but also have the potential to thrive amid industry changes and new challenges. This focus on adaptability ensures that organizations are led by individuals who can steer them through both anticipated and unforeseen shifts.

Shawn Cole explains that the key to future-proofing leadership lies in prioritizing candidates who have been ""battle-tested"" in dynamic environments. ""We look for leaders who have demonstrated resilience and success in fast-paced, ever-changing settings,"" Cole notes. ""These individuals have a proven ability to adapt, which is essential for long-term success in today's business world.""

To assess this adaptability, firms employ a combination of personality assessments, behavioral interviews, and an in-depth review of a candidate's past performance. By focusing on leaders who have already navigated significant industry changes, firms reduce the risks associated with hiring unproven talent. This approach minimizes potential setbacks and ensures the leadership team can guide the organization through future challenges.

In essence, future-proofing leadership is about looking beyond the immediate need and ensuring that the leaders of today can also be the visionaries of tomorrow, driving sustained success in an ever-changing environment."
'It's Bunk' -- Legend Of Bitcoin's Mystery Creator Satoshi Nakamoto Suddenly Deepens As Price Braces For A Bombshell,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/06/its-bunk-legend-of-bitcoins-mystery-creator-satoshi-nakamoto-suddenly-deepens-as-price-braces-for-a-bombshell/,2024-10-06T10:48:43Z,"Bitcoin's mysterious creator Satoshi Nakamoto -- who disappeared in 2011 -- has become one of the most fascinating legends of the modern age.

The identity of Satoshi Nakamoto has remained a mystery even as bitcoin has won over the likes of Wall Street giant BlackRock, Tesla billionaire Elon Musk and world leaders.

Now, as some fear Satoshi Nakamoto's unmasking could destroy bitcoin completely, a new documentary out this coming week is claiming to have solved the biggest mystery on the internet -- who created bitcoin?

A new HBO documentary titled Money Electric: The Bitcoin Mystery is set to air on Tuesday at 9pm ET, with producers claiming to have cracked the mystery of bitcoin's anonymous creator Satoshi Nakamoto, it was this week reported by Politico.

In an email, a publicist drumming up press for the film claimed it will ""present a compelling case for who Satoshi Nakamoto may be"" without going so far as to claim any sort of proof of Satoshi Nakamoto's true identity or new evidence.

Interest in Satoshi Nakamoto's identity has increased along with the value of the 1.1 million bitcoin the anonymous man, woman or group is believed to control, now worth around $66 billion at current prices.

Speculators on the Polymarket betting platform think it's most likely that Len Sassaman, a cypherpunk who took his own life in 2011, will be named as Satoshi by the HBO documentary, attracting 38% of punters.

However, Twitter posts written by Sassaman from bitcoin's earliest days show he was unimpressed by the technology.

""Personally, I think bitcoin is overhyped, but the hype itself is interesting,"" Sassaman posted, adding in a separate post that ""digital cash experts I've talked to [say] that it's bunk.""

Other names tipped as possibilities include Hal Finney, who received the first bitcoin transaction before he died in 2014, bit gold developer Nick Szabo and Blockstream chief executive Adam Back.

However, the prediction market site is also putting an 90% likelihood of Satoshi's identity not being proven in 2024.

Adding the excitement, early bitcoin wallets from the Satoshi era -- when they were still posting on the BitcoinTalk forum -- have recently woken up and begun moving coins, it was recently reported by Bitcoin Magazine.

Some 250 bitcoin worth around $15 million have been moved from wallets over the last two weeks.

If any of the bitcoin believed to be directly linked to wallets used by Satoshi Nakamoto is moved, it's expected to trigger a market crash as traders scramble to sell ahead of what could be a tsunami of bitcoin flooding the market.

U.S. cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase warned ahead of its 2021 Nasdaq market debut that the unmasking of Satoshi Nakamoto is a major risk to its business.

""The identification of Satoshi Nakamoto, the pseudonymous person or persons who developed bitcoin, or the transfer of Satoshi's bitcoins"" as a risk factor,"" the company's prospectus read.

Meanwhile, new research carried out by X user Wicked has suggested Satoshi Nakamoto conducted a 51% mining attack on the bitcoin network in its first year of existence, ostensibly to test what would happen if a single miner gained full control.

A 51% attack involves a bitcoin miner gaining majority control of the bitcoin network by ""out hashing"" other miners with sheer computational power. If a miner is able to do so, they would be able to reorder the network, triggering a likely fatal crisis of confidence"
UFC 307 Results: Kayla Harrison's Wins Sets Up Title Shot,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/brianmazique/2024/10/06/ufc-307-results-kayla-harrisons-wins-sets-up-title-shot/,2024-10-06T04:33:30Z,"Kayla Harrison won unanimously over Ketlen Vieira to open the UFC 307 pay-per-view portion. The victory featured a challenging moment in the second round for Harrison, but the win positions the former Professional Fighters League champion for a shot at the UFC women's bantamweight title.

Harrison's wrestling and the skills she has honed from her years as a two-time Olympic gold medalist in judo were the difference. Vieira had some success in the second round, as she stayed off the ground for prolonged periods.

Vieira opened a cut on Harrison's forehead in the center of a golf-ball-sized hematoma with an elbow. Harrison said it was the first time she'd ever bled in a fight as a professional mixed martial artist.

Harrison solidified her dominance in the third by taking Vieira down and controlling the Brazilian on the ground. Harrison delivered tons of damage from the top position and removed any doubt about which woman was the better fighter.

After the fight, Harrison warned Raquel Pennington and Julianna Pena. Pennington is defending her title against Pena in the co-main event, and Harrison announced she was coming for the winner in search of her second title in as many promotions.

If Harrison completes her mission, she will be the first fighter to win a UFC and PFL title. Last week, PFL owner Donn Davis expressed his disappointment in Harrison's decision to head to the UFC rather than stay with the promotion where she started her career.

The promotion had fights against Larissa Pacheco and Cris Cyborg lined up for Harrison. However, Harrison said in her post-fight interview with Joe Rogan that she came to the UFC because it was the best organization with the best fighters. She'll get a chance to prove she belongs in her next fight."
European Court Of Justice: Gender And Nationality Sufficient To Grant Afghan Women Asylum,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ewelinaochab/2024/10/05/european-court-of-justice-gender-and-nationality-sufficient-to-grant-afghan-women-asylum/,2024-10-05T17:54:31Z,"On October 4, 2024, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled that gender and nationality alone are sufficient for a country to grant asylum to Afghan women. The ECJ, the supreme court of the European Union, rules on matters of European Union law. The case, brought before the ECJ, concerned Afghan women who were seeking international protection in Austria, and their asylum applications were rejected in 2015 and 2020.

The ECJ was asked to provide clarification in relation to two important questions. First, the referring court sought to establish whether the measures taken by the Taliban in respect of women are sufficiently serious to be classified as an ""act of persecution"" within the meaning of Article 9(1) of Directive 2011/95. The measures considered by the court included that women ""are denied participation in political office and political decision-making processes; are provided with no legal means to be able to obtain protection from gender-based and domestic violence; are generally at risk of forced marriages; (...) are not allowed to engage in gainful employment or are allowed to do so only to a limited extent, mainly at home; have difficulties in accessing health facilities; are fully or largely denied access to education; are not allowed to be or move about in public without being accompanied by a man (who must be of a certain family relationship) or, at most, are permitted to do so only a certain distance from home; must completely cover their bodies and veil their faces in public; may not take part in any sports."" Second, the court further sought clarification whether it is sufficient, for the granting of [refugee] status, that a woman is affected by those measures in the country of origin merely on the basis of her gender, or is it necessary to assess a woman's individual situation in order to determine whether she is affected by those measures.

The ECJ found that the directive ""must be interpreted as meaning that an accumulation of discriminatory measures in respect of women (...) adopted or tolerated by an 'actor of persecution' within the meaning of Article 6 of that directive comes within the concept of 'act of persecution', since those measures, by their cumulative effect, undermine human dignity as guaranteed by Article 1 of the Charter.""

It further added that in the case of Afghan women, ""the competent national authorities are entitled to consider that it is currently unnecessary to establish, in the individual assessment of the situation of an application for international protection, that there is a risk that she will actually and specifically be subject to acts of persecution if she returns to her country of origin, where the factors relating to her individual status, such as her nationality or gender, are established.""

The ECJ further found that the directive must be interpreted as not requiring the competent national authority to take into consideration, in the individual assessment of her application, factors particular to her personal circumstances other than those relating to her gender or nationality.

This judgment aligns with the responses to the first Taliban regime, namely between 1996 and 2001. At the time of the first Taliban regime, the court ""held that the overall situation of those women in Afghanistan had to be deemed sufficiently serious to find that the discriminatory measures targeting them constituted, in themselves, persecution under the Geneva Convention. Therefore, at that time, an applicant for international protection was granted refugee status on the sole ground of being an Afghan woman."" This approach was changed after the fall of the first Taliban regime and the individual circumstances had to be considered. However, the return of the Taliban in August 2021 meant that this approach was not adequate anymore and similar responses as those to the first Taliban regime were needed.

The ECJ judgment also reflects the UNHCR 2023 statement concerning the concept of persecution on cumulative grounds in the light of the current situation for women and girls in Afghanistan - that there is a presumption of recognition of refugee status for Afghan women and girls, given the acts of persecution carried out against them by the Taliban solely on account of their gender.

As it stands, Sweden, Finland and Denmark already grant refugee status to all Afghan women seeking asylum, recognizing the severity of the persecution of women in Afghanistan - because of their gender.

The ECJ judgment is an important assessment of the nature and severity of the persecution of women in Afghanistan - persecution that requires adequate responses, including international protection."
The 10 Best New Movies On Netflix In October 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/travisbean/2024/10/05/the-10-best-new-movies-on-netflix-in-october-2024/,2024-10-05T16:07:09Z,"My favorite time of year is upon us: Halloween season. Not only do I embrace the festivities involved with the year's spookiest time, but I absolutely love watching nothing but horror movies for the entire month. But I do know horror movies aren't everybody's cup of tea, which means this list I compile each month needs to pack lots of different options. Luckily, Netflix provided subscribers with an eclectic array of films in October 2024, including an outrageous multi-character body-swapping experience from the Sundance Film Festival, an Oscar-winning biopic about one of the our most accomplished thespians, and a sequel to one of Netflix's most-watched movies of all time. No matter your movie taste, Netflix has something for you this month.

So which movies should you be watching? Below, I've compiled a list of ten films that should be on your radar in October. And at the end of the article, you can find a full list of every single movie coming to Netflix this month. Hopefully my notes on each movie can help you decide what to watch on your next movie night.

Note: this list covers all releases leading up to Oct. 6, 2024.

Just when we thought we had escaped the grim and brutal world of ""the pit,"" the hellish prison outfit came back with a vengeance. A sequel to one of the most-watched films on Netflix, with its cult status secured thanks to its outrageous dystopian setting appealing to the confined audience of the COVID-19 pandemic, The Platform 2 continues the story of the ""Vertical Self-Management Center,"" an underground prison that houses a cruel food distribution system in which a platform descends daily, filled with food for hundreds of floors of inmates. As the platform goes lower and lower, there's less and less food available, creating for survival-of-the-fittest environment driven by our deepest primal instincts. This sequel finds its characters -- specifically, Milena Smit as Perempuan and Hovik Keuchkerian as Zamiatin -- driving a rebellion against the Pit's oppressive system, confronting the rise of a totalitarian ruler who imposes strict rules on the inmates. Directed once again by Galder Gaztelu-Urrutia, The Platform 2 builds on the unsettling and dystopian atmosphere of its predecessor in grim-yet-absorbing fashion.

Body-swapping movies are a dime a dozen in Hollywood, with their stories often feeling stale and uninspired, following the same beaten path over and over. But that's exactly what makes It's What's Inside so intriguing: this Sundance Film Festival hit explored the formula in a new, irreverent ways that are both hilarious and thought-provoking. The film starts off with a seemingly normal pre-wedding party, but before long descends into pure chaos thanks to a mysterious suitcase that contains a ""body-swapping game."" What starts as a casual experience quickly unravels into an existential nightmare as this ""game"" becomes a reality and characters are forced to navigate a psychological maze burdened by an atmosphere that first-time director Greg Jardin would describe as ""anxiety chic."" The cast of It's What's Inside features Brittany O'Grady as Shelby, James Morosini as Cyrus, Alycia Debnam-Carey as Nikki and Devon Terrell as Reuben. It's What's Inside wants nothing more than to entertain you, and boy does it ever.

There are a lot of great horror gems hidden throughout Netflix, and See for Me sits at the top of that list. This tense thriller follows our main character, Sophie (played by Skyler Davenport), a young blind woman who finds herself trapped inside a remote mansion during a home invasion. With her safety compromised, she relies on a phone app called ""See for Me,"" through which a remote assistant named ""Kelly"" (voiced by Jessica Parker Kennedy) guides Sophie through the house using the phone's camera. Adopting a minimalist style that employes lots of tight framing, director Randall Okita and his cinematographers (Jordan Oram and Jackson Parrell) use the camera to mirror Sophie's impairment, creating for a claustrophobic and disorienting aesthetic. And because our protagonist is blind, the film heavily relies on its intricate sound design to convey information and build tension, resulting in a full sensory experience that places you directly in Sophie's shoes. The result is a film that keeps you feeling enveloped by its terror throughout.

I tried my best to choose movies that were less well known for this list, but it's hard to pass up including Bridesmaids on any sort of ""best of"" list when it's available. This classic ensemble comedy directed by Paul Feig and written by Kristen Wiig and Annie Mumolo revolves around the misadventures of Annie (played by Wiig), a single woman whose messy, directionless life further unravels as the stresses and absurdities of being the maid of honor for her best friend's wedding mount. The biggest complication? The bride, Lillian (Maya Rudolph), has another good friend named Helen (Rose Byrne) who is possibly scheming to steal the maid of honor duties away. You'll come for the incredible supporting cast, which includes Melissa McCarthy (in her first big breakout role), Endy McLendon-Covey, Ellie KEmper, Chris O'Dowd and Jon Hamm, enjoy the endlessly quotable quotes (""I'm glad he's single because I'm going to climb that like a tree""), and stay for the raunchy and outrageous humor that isn't afraid to shy away from genuinely affecting heartfelt moments. This movie hasn't aged one bit since its release.

I might catch some heat for this one, but I'm not afraid: I love the Point Break remake. Don't get me wrong, I love the original more, as touches the chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Patrick Swayze. It's one of the movie's I'm most nostalgic for. But the 2015 version of Point Break is a completely different experience that can be enjoyed for trying something much different. In this update, directed by Ericson Core, FBI agent Johnny Utah (Luke Bracey) still infiltrates a crime-committing outfit ran by Bohdi (Édgar Ramírez). But instead of local bank robberies, Bohdi's team of extreme sports enthusiasts commit incredibly high-stakes crimes that involve wingsuit flying, snowboarding and rock climbing, all in an effort to raise awareness about man's relationship with Mother Earth. While the original Point Break adopted a more playful and rebellious spirit, using a central romance to drive the story, the remake takes on a much more serious, philosophical tone, capturing how one overcomes existential trauma and finds freedom spiritually. Plus, the movie performs some of the most impressive practical stunts you'll see in modern filmmaking. It's all part of its exhilarating aesthetic built around searching for one's purpose.

As the years have worn on, several horror movies have lost their touch, their pizazz, their ability to excite a modern audience that's seen everything there is to see from the genre. But every time I watch Psycho, I can't help but think, ""Man, this movie's still got it, and still feels refreshing and different."" This unmatched psychological horror film follows Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), who, after stealing money, encounters the enigmatic Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) at the eerie Bates Motel. What follows from there in this meticulously crafted black-and-white thriller is anything but an ordinary cinematic experience. Director Alfred Hitchcock creates this voyeuristic effect that aligns viewers with the characters' perspectives, often making them complicit in the narrative's tension. The story seamlessly shifts between quiet, mundane moments of everyday conversation that reveal the psychology of the characters and explosive moments of stylistic flourish that capture the sheer potential madness of the human mind. These abrupt transitions create a rhythm of tension and release, constantly keeping you on the edge of your seat. In the end, the movie questions our relationship with psychosis -- what it means to be ""mad"" and how we understand those that have lost touch with reality.

While a lot of the movies on this list, as would be expected from Netflix's usual October lineup, contain horror and high-octane action, there are much more graceful, exquisite experiences to be found in wonderful movies like Being Julia. A drama-comedy set in 1930s London, the film focuses on life of celebrated stage actress Julia Lambert (Annette Bening). Currently in the midst of a mid-life crisis, Julia loses touch with her husband, Michael (Jeremy Irons), and embarks on a whirlwind love affair with a younger man named Tom (Shaun Evans), sparking a journey of self-discovery and reinvention. Director István Szabó crafts an elegant aesthetic that feels very reminiscent of 2000s period pieces, flush with fluid camera movements and long, sweeping shots that capture the opulent settings of London's theaters, grand homes and lavish parties. The tone of the movie is both sophisticated and playful, delivered with a sense of self-awareness that echoes the high-spirited nature of theatrical comedies. This great mix of comedy and drama is bolstered by the all-star acting being performed by some of the movie industry's best thespians of the time.

My instinct was to just recommend the first 21 Jump Street, but if you haven't seen this movie's sequel as well, then you really should take this opportunity to watch one of the best comedic duologies ever. Because 22 Jump Street isn't just a sequel -- it's a mega-meta dissertation of what we come to expect from sequels, with the characters themselves essentially realizing they're in a movie that follows all the patterns expected from the Hollywood machine. These action-comedy films reinvigorate the buddy cop genre with a self-aware, irreverent style through its two bumbling police officers, Schmidt (Jonah Hill) and Jenko (Channing Tatum), who go undercover as students in both high school (21 Jump Street) and college (22 Jump Street) to bust drug rings. Directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller adopt a colorful, high-energy style that not only has fun with the formula, but is exhilarating to watch, balancing moments of impressive choreography with laugh-out-loud jokes. To boot, the story is genuinely affecting, as Schmidt and Jenko's relationship builds and morphs into a bona fide life-affirming friendship. As a pair, these movies collectively result in one of the best comedic experiences Hollywood has offered in the 21st century.

I know there's temptation to roll your eyes when the genres ""found footage"" and ""horror"" come together, especially since half of these types of movies are budget-constrained cash-grabs are filled with cheesy jump scares and bad acting. But As Above, So Below is one of those found footage movies that transcends, that feels as though it's carrying the genre's aesthetic to new immersive grounds. The story follows a group of explorers (played by actors Perdita Weeks, Ben Feldman, Edwin Hodge and François Civil) as they navigate the treacherous catacombs beneath Paris in search of the legendary Philosopher's Stone. The Parisian catacombs are central to what makes the film transcend what's typical from the genre, with the narrow, winding tunnels captured in tight, confined shots that evoke a heightened sense of claustrophobia that eclipses what found footage movies are typically capable of. The characters' lack of lighting furthers this suffocating aesthetic, as many scenes are cloaked in darkness and deep shadows that restrict our field of vision, leaving much of what's happening shrouded in mystery -- a bizarre experience for a movie. The story beats might be typical of your average found footage flick, but the technical achievements are anything but. If you're looking to be scared this Halloween season on Netflix, this is your chance.

There was no actress quite like Judy Garland -- a mesmerizing vaudevillian who rose to international stardom for both her musical and dramatic talents, from her childhood prodigy days on the stage to her award-winning performances on screen in movies like Meet Me in St. Louis, A Star is Born and The Wizard of Oz. The biopic Judy centers on the final year of the legendary singer and actress's life as she performs a series of concerts in 1969 London, all while detailing Garland's personal struggles with addiction, loneliness and the burden of fame as she showcases her enduring talent and charisma. The cast is outstanding in this one, with Garland played to perfection by Renée Zellweger, who won her second Academy Award for her performance (the first win was for Cold Mountain), as well as other great showings coming from Jessie Buckley, Finn Wittrock, Michael Gambon and Rufus Sewell. Interspersed with flashbacks to Garland's early years in Hollywood, this raw, nuanced examination of the legendary actress's character is both celebratory and bittersweet, highlighting the contrast between Garland's moments of triumph on stage and her personal battles behind the scenes."
WWE Bad Blood 2024: Roman Reigns Losing And 5 Smart Booking Decisions,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/blakeoestriecher/2024/10/05/wwe-bad-blood-2024-roman-reigns-losing-and-5-smart-booking-decisions/,2024-10-05T15:34:10Z,"WWE Bad Blood 2024 will mark the culmination of the long-running feud between CM Punk and Drew McIntyre as well as the latest storyline twist in The Bloodline saga.

Headlined by Punk vs. McIntyre and an unlikely tag team match pitting Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes against Jacob Fatu and Solo Sikoa, Bad Blood in Atlanta is expected to be yet another sellout for WWE as the company looks to extend its streak of stellar pay-per-views. August's Bash in Berlin was the highest-grossing arena event in company history while just a few weeks prior SummerSlam had its largest crowd of all-time.

Perhaps just as importantly, both shows delivered strong in-ring performances from top to bottom and featured major storyline occurrences, such as Reigns' return at SummerSlam or Punk's first singles victory in a decade at Bash in Berlin.

And Bad Blood? Well, The Wrestling Observer's Dave Meltzer (h/t Wrestling Inc) said the show nearly sold out immediately and ranks ""among the most in-demand tickets in pro wrestling history,"" after the secondary market ""exploded."" WWE's tried-and-true formula of five-match pay-per-view cards has been a hit, with fewer matches but, overall, more bang for your buck. Bad Blood should be no different.

As one of only three PPVs left in 2024, Bad Blood will also have many major storyline ramifications heading into Survivor Series and Royal Rumble season. With just five matches yet again, the booking of those bouts is even more important.

Here are five smart creative decisions WWE must make at Bad Blood 2024.

Even as a former Universal and NXT Champion, Finn Balor hasn't been pushed all that well as a single star in WWE over the past few years, largely losing to other stars slightly above him on the card.

Now, he finds himself in a similar situation with Damian Priest, his former Judgment Day stablemate who's now his archnemesis. Priest, settling in nicely as one of Raw's top babyfaces, currently appears to be a bigger priority than Balor in the eyes of the creative team, but there is still plenty of time left in this storyline.

In lengthy feuds between bitter rivalries that extend for months and result in numerous matches, the best and most logical booking is to stack the odds against the babyface. That's why at Bad Blood there isn't much logic behind Priest beating Balor clean as a sheet in their first major match. If that happened, where would WWE go from there? Exactly.

The best scenario here is for the Judgment Day's advantages in the numbers game to get the best of Priest, with outside interference costing the one-time World Heavyweight Champion the win.

Liv Morgan has held the Women's World Championship since May's King and Queen of the Ring, and yet, the timing simply isn't right for a title change.

Morgan's feud with Rhea Ripley is carrying the Raw's women's division, which has struggled to create compelling storylines outside of their wildly entertaining rivalry. With marquee names like Asuka sidelined while Becky Lynch remains a free agent, WWE needs to continue Ripley vs. Morgan for the foreseeable future.

And why not? The feud, despite going on for most of the year, is still red hot, and truth be told, there aren't many other options right now for either woman as champion. The best way to keep Ripley and Morgan as relevant as they are is to have them continue their rivalry.

The ultimate climax of Ripley vs. Morgan is clearly going to be Ripley's big win, and with both Crown Jewel and Survivor Series taking place just next month, WWE can easily extend this rivalry by holding off on Ripley's win. Similarly to Priest vs. Balor, booking the heel to win via help from Judgment Day is a sensible booking move that could lead to another match in the near future.

Nia Jax has been a dominant WWE Women's Champion on SmackDown, and her biggest potential rivals are currently in the tag team division.

It's clear that Jax is being built up as such an unstoppable champion in order to set the stage for a blockbuster match with Bianca Belair or Jade Cargill. Beyond those two stars, there really isn't much depth to the SmackDown women's division, save for a potential return from Charlotte Flair.

Still, the biggest rivalries lying ahead for Jax don't involve her Bad Blood opponent Bayley. This instead feels much more like a stopgap rivalry before something bigger down the road, which necessitates a win for Jax at Bad Blood, where she will enter as the overwhelming favorite.

That's the way it should be, too. Jax has been great as SmackDown's top titleholder, and there's no need to take the title off her until the time is just right.

CM Punk vs. Drew McIntyre is one of those historic rivalries that can easily be revisited down the road, but with their Hell in a Cell match also serving as the rubber match, Bad Blood is almost assuredly going to serve as the end of this feud.

An argument could be made that both stars could use the win, but who needs it more? Consider this: Punk is in the midst of his first major rivalry in WWE more than a decade, and the former WWE Champion is reportedly in line for a potential World Heavyweight Championship feud with Gunther at Survivor Series.

Then, it becomes clear that Punk needs to win at Bad Blood. McIntyre, after all, has been absolutely tremendous as a heel, and after recently re-signing with WWE, his strong performances as Raw's top villains figure to keep him in a prominent role at or near the top of the card. What's more, a loss at Hell in a Cell could also force McIntyre to become an even more detestable heel in the weeks and months ahead.

Punk, on the other hand, is the beloved babyface who is likely going to be involved in a significant match at Survivor Series and, long-term, will play a sizable role during WrestleMania season. He needs the win at Bad Blood and the momentum boost it will give him more than McIntyre, a tremendous villain who can become a bigger one with an ""L"" in Atlanta.

Roman Reigns and Cody Rhodes have formed an unlikely alliance as a 2024 version of The Mega Powers, but given their long and storied history, how much will they really get along at Bad Blood?

It was initially suggested that Punk vs. McIntyre would headline Bad Blood, but the latest report is that Rhodes and Reigns vs. Fatu and Sikoa will main event the show instead. Thus, it should come as no surprise if the placement of this match on the card plays a role in the outcome of the bout.

If this Bloodline tag team match indeed closes out Bad Blood as expected, there is likely going to be a major cliffhanger-type angle at the top of the show. That could range from a shocking return, like Jimmy Uso, Paul Heyman or even -- gasp -- The Rock, or maybe a heel turn from Kevin Owens. Regardless, the question here is: who needs the win the most?

The answer? Fatu. The clear star of the new-look Bloodline, Fatu will be participating in the biggest match of his young career, and given the star power involved on the babyface side, the easiest possible decision would be to have Reigns and Rhodes win in resounding fashion.

But how about taking a risk? Fatu has been an immediate hit so far, and WWE needs to ride that wave, which means that Reigns and Rhodes need to suffer a rare loss at Bad Blood -- one that can easily be booked in a way that protects both stars, especially if someone like Heyman or even The Rock shows up in shocking fashion."
What Does Abortion Look Like In Your State? An Alphabetical Guide,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/evaepker/2024/10/05/what-does-abortion-look-like-in-your-state-an-alphabetical-guide/,2024-10-05T13:36:04Z,"In exactly one month, voters across the United States will cast their ballots - and for residents of 10 of those states, those ballots will include questions about the future of abortion. For nearly 50 years, the U.S Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade established that a person's individual right to an abortion was protected by the U.S Constitution. The U.S Supreme Court's decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization in 2022, however, overturned that prior ruling, leaving states with the power to regulate abortion.

Since then, 20 states have banned or restricted abortions, seven states have already voted on abortion rights, and multiple states have abortion-related laws and guidelines that simply aren't clear. For example, four states (Arkansas, Mississippi, Oklahoma, and South Dakota) allow abortions only to save a pregnant person's life but not to improve her health. Healthcare professionals then have to decide - sometimes in the middle of a medical emergency - whether an abortion would qualify as life-saving or, in other words, legal or not. They are then liable if they have found to have broken the law and could face punishments such as fines, jail sentences, loss of license, or a combination of the three.

This state-by-stage guide aims to clear up some unknowns about abortion, such as where it is legal, what exceptions might exist, what lawsuits or laws are pending, and what voters - and the rest of the U.S population - should know in advance of Election Day.

Alabama: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or health: both physical and mental. Alabama is actually the only state that explicitly includes mental health concerns as an exception to its abortion ban but requires that a psychiatrist both to diagnose the pregnant individual with a ""serious mental illness"" and to document that her mental health condition could cause her to engage in behavior that might threaten her life or that of the fetus.

There are no exceptions to the abortion ban for fatal fetal anomalies or in cases of rape and/or incest.

Alaska: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Arizona: Abortion is legal up to 15 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission before the abortion.

In September 2024, Democratic Governor Katie Hobbs signed the legislature's repeal of an 1864 near-total abortion ban.

Arizona residents will be also be voting on Arizona Proposition 139, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" will amend the state Constitution to provide the fundamental right to abortion before the point of fetal viability (which is usually between 22 and 26 weeks and marks the point where the fetus has a high chance of surviving outside the uterus without any significant medical intervention) unless ""justified by a compelling state interest"" (such as improving or maintaining the health of the individual seeking an abortion). Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Arkansas: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exception to this ban is to save a pregnant person's life. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

Arkansans for Limited Government tried to get an abortion rights amendment on the ballot in 2024. If passed, the amendment would've legalized abortion up to 18 weeks and protected abortion access after that time period in the cases of risks to the pregnant person's life or health, for fatal fetal anomalies, and for rape and/or incest. In August 2024, the Arkansas Supreme Court ruled that Arkansans for Limited Government had failed to file the paid canvasser training certification and had failed to comply with state law so the amendment wouldn't appear on the 2024 ballot.

California: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

In 2022, California residents passed California Proposition 1, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment, which supported amending the state Constitution to prohibit the state from interfering with or denying an individual's reproductive freedom, including the right to an abortion. The Proposition passed with 67% support.

Colorado: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian or adult relative (if the minor lives with that relative and not with one or both parents) must be informed at least 48 hours before the abortion.

Next month, residents will vote on Colorado Amendment 89, the Right to Abortion and Health Insurance Coverage Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would both enshrine a right to abortion in the Colorado Constitution and allow the use of public funds for abortion. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would uphold a current constitutional provision that bans the use of public funds for abortion.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, there is no parental/guardian involvement required.

Delaware: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors under 16, a parent/guardian, grandparent, or mental health professional must be notified.

Florida: Abortion is legal up to six weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified at least 48 hours before and must give permission.

Next month, residents will vote on Florida Amendment 4, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would both enshrine a right to abortion in the state Constitution up to fetal viability (or when necessary to protect a pregnant person's health, as determined by their healthcare provider) while maintaining the current law that requires that a parent/guardian be notified if a minor is seeking an abortion. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. (They do not have to receive that information in person; it can be mailed to them or read over the phone to them.) For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified.

In September 2024, Georgia Judge Robert C.I. McBurney struck down the prior state law, which prohibited most abortions after six weeks. Georgia's Republican attorney general has already appealed this ruling, though, and the Georgia Supreme Court will likely make the final decision.

Hawaii: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Idaho: Abortion is illegal as of August 25, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life and physical health or for rape and/or incest.

The Idaho Supreme Court ruled in 2023 that there is no constitutional right to an abortion in the state. Since then, two consolidated court cases (Idaho v. United States and Moyle v. United States have argued that healthcare professionals should be able to perform emergency abortions to preserve a pregnant person's physical health - not just save her life. The Supreme Court received this case but dismissed it in June 2024, sending it back to the federal appeals courts for further litigation. Until a decision is made, the exceptions to the abortion ban do currently include preserving the pregnant person's physical health.

In cases of rape and/or incest, an abortion can be legally performed up to 14 weeks but requires a police report or report from child protection services.

There are no exceptions to the ban for fatal fetal anomalies.

Illinois: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Indiana: Abortion is illegal as of September 15, 2022.

In 2023, the Indiana Supreme Court ruled that the state Constitution doesn't include a right to abortion with three exceptions. Abortions can be performed at any time to preserve the life and health of the pregnant person; up to 20 weeks for fatal fetal abnormalities; and up to 12 weeks gestational age for rape and/or incest .

Four residents and the group Hoosier Jews for Choice have argued that abortion is an exercise of religion; banning abortion thus violates Indiana's 2015 religious freedom law. The Indiana Supreme Court is expected to hear the case soon.

Iowa: Abortion is legal up to six weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian or grandparent must be notified at least 48 hours before.

Kansas: Abortion is legal up to 22 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, both parents/guardians (or a singular parent/guardian if that individual has sole custody) must give permission.

Kansas was the first state to vote on abortion rights following Dobbs. In November 2022, its residents rejected the Value Them Both Constitutional Amendment, which would have ruled that there was no right to abortion in the state Constitution, subsequently enacting a near-total ban on abortion. 53% of voters rejected that proposed amendment.

Kentucky: Abortion is illegal as of June 15, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health (with affirmative defense). There are no exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies or for rape and/or incest.

In November 2022, Kentucky residents rejected Kentucky Constitutional Amendment 2, the No Right to Abortion in Constitution Amendment, which would have amended the state Constitution to say explicitly that it doesn't protect the right to abortion. 52% of voters rejected that proposed amendment.

In February 2023, the Kentucky Supreme Court rejected a request to block the state's abortion ban, ruling that abortion providers lacked the standing to challenge the state's abortion ban. The Kentucky Supreme Court, though, didn't elaborate whether or not the state Constitution secured abortion rights, and abortion remains banned in the state as a result.

In late February 2024, Republican Rep. Ken Fleming of Louisville introduced House Bill 711 that would make abortions legal up to six weeks in cases of rape and/or incest, of fatal fetal anomalies, or of fetuses who died in the womb. No action has been taken on the bill since then.

Louisiana: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health or in limited cases of fatal fetal anomalies. There are no exceptions for rape and/or incest.

Maine: Abortion is legal until fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Maryland: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified unless the minor doesn't live with a parent/guardian or reasonable efforts to give notice to a parent/guardian are unsuccessful.

Next month, residents will vote on Maryland Question 1, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Amendment. Voting ""yes"" would support amending the state Constitution to establish a right to ""reproductive freedom"". Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment.

Massachusetts: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors under 16, a parent/guardian must give permission.

Michigan: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

In 2022, Michigan residents passed Michigan Proposal 3, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative, which supported providing a constitutional right to reproductive freedom, including the right to an abortion. The Initiative passed with 57% support.

Minnesota: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Mississippi: Abortion is illegal as of July 7, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life, for a limited number of fatal fetal anomalies, and for rape and/or incest. For the latter, an abortion can be legally performed up to six weeks gestational age but requires documentation from law enforcement. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health.

Missouri: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health (with affirmative defense). There are no exceptions for fatal fetal anomalies or for rape and/or incest.

Next month, residents will vote on Missouri Amendment 3, the Right to Reproductive Freedom Initiative. Voting ""yes"" supports amending the Missouri Constitution to provide the right to ""reproductive freedom"" and allowing the state legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion only after fetal viability. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would oppose allowing the state legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

Montana: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required. In August 2024, Montana's Supreme Court ruled that the law requiring parental/guardian permission for a minor seeking an abortion was unconstitutional.

In 2022, Montana residents rejected Legislative Referendum No. 131 which would've required medical care for ""infants born alive"", such as those born prematurely or those who were born due to a botched abortion. 53% of voters rejected that proposed referendum.

Next month, residents will vote on Montana CI-128, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" supports amending the Montana Constitution to provide the right to ""make and carry out decisions about one's own pregnancy, including the right to abortion"" and allowing the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would oppose allowing the state legislature to enact laws that regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

Nebraska: Abortion is legal up to 12 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. (They don't have to receive that information in person; it can be mailed to them or read over the phone to them.) For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

Next month, residents will vote on both Nebraska Initiative 434, Prohibit Abortions After the First Trimester Amendment and Nebraska Initiative 439, Right to Abortion Initiative.

Voting ""yes"" on Initiative 434 would support amending the state Constitution to ban abortions after the first trimester except to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health or for rape and/or incest. Voting ""no"" would oppose banning abortions after the first trimester.

Voting ""yes"" on Initiative 439 would support amending the state Constitution to provide a right to abortion until fetal viability. Voting ""no"" on Initiative 439 would oppose adding this Amendment.

Nevada: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

Next month, residents will vote on Nevada Question 6, the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" supports amending the state Constitution to protect the right to an abortion and to allow the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability. Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this Amendment and would oppose allowing the state to regulate abortion only after fetal viability.

New Hampshire: Abortion is legal up to 24 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before 24 weeks have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified.

New Jersey: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Next month, residents will vote on New York Proposal 1, Equal Protection of Law Amendment. Voting ""yes"" would support adding language to the New York Bill of Rights that would give prevent discriminating against all persons, including due to ""pregnancy, pregnancy outcomes, and reproductive healthcare and autonomy"". Voting ""no"" would oppose adding this language.

North Carolina: Abortion is legal up to12 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 72-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian or grandparent (if the minor has lived with them for at least six months) must give permission.

North Dakota: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

In September 2024, North Dakota Judge Bruce Romanick declared North Dakota's total abortion ban ""unconstitutional"". Republican Attorney General Drew H. Wrigley said that he planned to appeal that decision, though, while the Republican-controlled legislature may try to enact another ban when it reconvenes in January 2025.

Ohio: Abortion is legal up to 22 weeks

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must give permission.

In November 2023, Ohio residents passed Ohio Issue 1, Right to Make Reproductive Decisions Including Abortion Initiative, which supported amending the Ohio Constitution to guarantee the right to abortion until fetal viability as well as the right to other reproductive health decisions. The Initiative passed with 57% support.

Oklahoma: Abortion is illegal as of May 25, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to save the pregnant person's life. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

Those seeking an abortion before six weeks have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive information from their abortion provider and when they can receive the abortion. (They don't have to receive that information in person.) For minors under 17, a parent/guardian or grandparent must give permission.

South Dakota: Abortion is illegal as of June 24, 2022.

The exceptions to this ban are to preserve a pregnant person's life. There are no exceptions for risks to the pregnant person's physical health, for fatal fetal anomalies, or for rape and/or incest.

Next month, residents will vote on South Dakota Constitutional Amendment G or the Right to Abortion Initiative. Voting ""yes"" would support providing a state constitutional right to abortion in South Dakota using a trimester framework. During the first trimester, the state would be prohibited for regulating abortion; during the second trimester, the state may regulate abortion but ""only in ways that are reasonably related to the physical health of the pregnant woman""; during the third trimester, the state may regulate or prohibit abortion, except ""when abortion is necessary, in the medical judgment of the woman's physician, to preserve the life and health of the pregnant woman"".

A group of Texas women who had serious pregnancy complications were the first in the country to testify in court about being denied abortions after Dobbs. And yet, the court has advised Texan physicians only that they should ""meticulously document"" their decision-making around abortions without any clarification about what actions - regardless of documentation - might put them at risk for prosecution.

Utah: Abortion is legal up to 18 weeks.

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 72-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian must be notified at least 24 hours before the abortion and give permission.

A state law that completely banned abortion in Utah went into effect on June 24, 2022 but was challenged in court by Planned Parenthood Association of Utah. On August 1, 2024, the Utah Supreme Court prevented this total ban from taking effect while the lawsuit continued.

Vermont: Abortion is legal with no limits on when the pregnancy can be terminated.

Those seeking an abortion have no waiting period. For minors, parental/guardian involvement isn't required.

West Virginia: Abortion is illegal as of September 16, 2022.

The exceptions are to preserve the pregnant person's life or physical health, for fetal anomalies, and for rape and/or incest. For the latter, abortions can be performed up to eight weeks (or up to 14 weeks for minors) as long as the assault has been reported to law enforcement.

Wisconsin: Abortion is legal up to 22 weeks

Those seeking an abortion before then have a 24-hour waiting period between when they receive in-person counseling from their abortion provider and when they can receive an abortion. For minors, a parent/guardian, grandparent, or a sibling or aunt or uncle who is at least 25 years old must give permission.

Abortion opponents have claimed that a law from 1849 bans abortion in all cases except when the pregnant person's life is in danger. Lower level courts have argued that the law in question applies only to infanticide and not consensual abortions. The Wisconsin Supreme Court will hear that case.

Wyoming: Abortion is legal up to fetal viability.

Those seeking an abortion before then have no waiting period. For minors, a parent/guardian must be informed at least 24 hours before the abortion.

The Wyoming Supreme Court received this case but dismissed it in April 2024, sending it back to the lower courts. Until a decision is made, abortion remains legal in the state up to fetal viability.

What is the status of abortion in your state? Do you Want to change it? If you're a resident of one of the 10 states voting on abortion-related measures next month and you're not yet a registered voter, you can register here. Many states still allow their residents to register to vote in the 2024 election and some states have even started their early voting."
What's The Hubbub About Racism Around The WNBA?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/susanmshaw/2024/10/04/whats-the-hubbub-about-racism-around-the-wnba/,2024-10-04T21:01:53Z,"If you pay attention to sports news at all, you've probably heard the recent outcry about the racist comments, posts, and treatment that's been aimed at many of the WNBA's top Black players this season. You may wonder how a league that's prided itself on its commitment to diversity has ended up here, but as someone who studies intersections between gender, race, and sports, I'm not terribly surprised.

The league has been growing in popularity and attendance the past few years, but most of its fan based until very recently has been longtime, diehard women's basketball fans. As the league's visibility grew, so did media attention and sponsorships, especially for white players.

In 2022, Las Vegas Aces star Kelsey Plum pointed out how white players received preferential treatment. Meanwhile unanimous 2024 Most Valuable Player A'ja Wilson of the Aces tried to compliment Plum and UConn player Paige Bueckers earlier this year by noting their awareness of their privilege as white women. The recently resurfaced video has generated a load of hate toward Wilson, accusing her of downplaying achievements in favor of race and attacking her for turning to ""victimhood."" In reality, Wilson was, as she explained later, just saying they were good allies.

Much of the current uptick in overt racism has come with Indiana Fever star Caitlin Clark's entry into the WNBA. Clark, who is white, was the league's most touted player coming out of college. The racism toward Clark's competitors started then as Clark and LSU's Angel Reese, who is Black, faced off in NCAA tournaments. What both Clark and Reese saw as intense and entirely appropriate competition and trash-talking became promoted on social media by racist fans as Reese's ""thug"" behavior. This approach to seeing Clark play against other Black players has continued into the WNBA as Clark's presence has grown the league's fanbase, creating sellout crowds and record-breaking attendance wherever Clark plays.

As retired Seattle Storm superstar Sue Bird pointed out recently, racism isn't new to the WNBA, but it has become much more blatant and threatening. Bird suggests racists have used Caitlin Clark as a pawn, and that's become a distraction from talking about the great basketball woman are playing. By pitting Clark against Black players and relying on traditional racist tropes, racist fans have created a narrative of Clark as somehow targeted and persecuted by Black players and a ""woke"" white league. Clark herself repudiates this narrative, but racists aren't listening.

What has happened to Black players has been a litany of name-calling and threats, to the point that some teams have had to increase security.

Connecticut Suns star Alyssa Thomas commented after her team eliminated the Fever from the 2024 playoffs, ""I think that in my 11-year career I never experienced the racial comments like from the Indiana Fever fan base.""

A'ja Wilson said that many days she hated being herself because of all the racist cruelty hurled her way.

To understand how Clark got pitted against Black players in the league and how racists have used their rivalry as an excuse for racist behavior toward Black players, we have to understand how certain process of racism work.

In societies that are hierarchical and binary (divide people into two groups such as white and Black, gay and straight, women and men), the group that is dominant is ""unmarked."" What that means is that the dominant group's characteristics are the society's norm, to the extent that these characteristics are practically invisible because they are assumed to be inherent and natural.

So, for example, men are an unmarked category. Women, then, are a ""marked"" category. In other words, they are defined primarily by their inclusion in the category, and we interpret their behaviors as a characteristic of the category. We have the National Basketball Association (notice how men are unmarked) and the Women's National Basketball Association (notice how women are marked). We have the PGA and the LPGA. We don't have to say the Men's NBS or the Men's PGA. We assume these are for men. We have to say WNBA and LPGA to distinguish that these are for women.

Certain behaviors become attributed to marked and unmarked categories. In terms of race, we call this process racialization, or the attributing of characteristics to race.

For example, Suns' guard Marina Mabrey is a very physical and aggressive player. When we see her throw a shoulder into an opposing player or knock an opposing player to the ground, our first thought isn't ""thug."" But when Angel Reese or Alyssa Thomas do the exact same behaviors, many white people do think, ""thug."" ""Thug"" is a word that has become racialized. Many white people apply that word in derogatory ways to behaviors by Black players but not white players, and, in fact, when many white people hear the word ""thug"" in any context, the image that first comes to mind is a Black person.

So, when racists saw Clark and Reese trash-talking or when they saw Black players and Clark playing each other aggressively, they did not see two basketball players doing the same thing. They saw a ""thug"" victimizing a white woman. Notice how these same people are not bothered by rough play by Black players against other Black players.

These racists were then able to spin a narrative about how Black players were picking on Clark, relying on all the racist stereotypes of Black people as dangerous, violent, and treacherous. That narrative then, to them, justified their name-calling and threats as a way to defend Clark's virtue and put ""uppity"" Black players back ""in their place.""

All white people can fall into the trap of seeing Black players through these racialized lenses if we're not attentive to how our own subconscious ideas of race have been shaped by white supremacy. Even if we're not overt racists who would ever engage in name-calling, we might, without even realizing it, judge Black players' behavior differently than white players or like Clark better than Reese because she's a ""cleaner"" player and not a ""dirty player"" like Reese. Notice how even those notions of ""clean"" and ""dirty"" draw on longstanding racist notions of Blackness. Racism doesn't have to be over to be racism.

Having used Clark, as Bird suggests, racists have heightened overt acts of racism in the WNBA. They've done harm to individual Black players, and they've tried to implicate Clark in their racism even as she rejects their framing of her rivals. In fact, Clark calls racists ""trolls"" not ""fans.""

These racist trolls have also taken the focus off women's basketball. We may not be talking about how pretty players are or aren't anymore or how feminine they look even though they're physical and strong. But we're still not talking about basketball, about their amazing shots or they're impenetrable defenses or their brilliant teamwork.

Bird laments that players aren't valued for their play. That's not surprising either. After all, in our society, they are women first. And, if they're Black, they're at even greater risk for mistreatment at the intersection of race and gender.

In one of their playoff games, the Suns' Dijonai Carrington hit Clark in the face leaving her with a black eye. Later, a USA Today reporter asked Carrington if she did it on purpose. Carrington responded, ""I don't even know why I would intend to hit anybody in the eye. That doesn't even make sense to me . . . I didn't know I hit her, actually. I was trying to make a play on the ball and I guess I followed through and I hit her, so obviously it's never intentional. That's not even the type of player I am.""

Many of the Fever's white fans didn't believe her. The hate was immediate and ugly. Carrington shared one vile post that used racist and sexist epithets and added, ""I hope someone rapes you and cuts your head off.""

The WNBA issued its own response on social media, decrying the abuse of its players. Yet when league commissioner Cathy Englebert had a chance to speak out against racism, she bungled her response, moving instead into talking about rivalry and financial benefits.

The WNBA has to do better defending and protecting its players and being proactive in educating fans. White fans also need to speak out and speak to other white fans about racism, whether it's subtle or overt. Maybe then we can finally start to talk about basketball."
Doja Cat Takes On Claymation In A New Chapter Of Artistic Expression,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kennethjwilliamsjr/2024/10/04/doja-cat-takes-on-claymation-in-a-new-chapter-of-artistic-expression/,2024-10-04T21:01:46Z,"Doja Cat may be one of the fiercest musicians with the discography and live performances to match, but more than that, she's an innovator. The entertainer's ability to write chart-topping hits while transforming them into visual masterpieces is an art form in itself. The rapper's affinity for visual storytelling is something she's leaning into alongside Brisk Iced Tea as part of the revival of its iconic claymation ads. As the first woman artist to be transformed into a clay state for the brand, this was the artist's first stint with claymation as well.

""I had full creative control over my character's clothing and found that intriguing. It's been a fun, creative process getting into that part of it. I have no experience with claymation or anything like that, but they were pretty quick and understood what I wanted, and the process was fairly smooth in the beginning. I was just very interested in seeing myself in that form and having the opportunity to voice act for the first time in my career, so that was an honor and a very exciting opportunity.""

Doja Cat's career continues to be a foundation in which self-expression is directly linked to her artistry. The musician feels that this campaign aligns with that due to its message of standing up for oneself.

""When you watch the commercial we've been putting together, it's about looking out for yourself and standing up for yourself. I noticed in the commercial that I asked for a sip of this tea, and then I kind of demanded it by magically summoning the forest. I think that is the poetry behind it: discovering the magic you have inside of you to achieve the things you wish for and the things that make you feel whole.""

Regarding the campaign itself, the Grammy-award-winning artist hopes her fans learn more about her and draw inspiration from it.

""I hope that it inspires the youth. I hope my fans can understand where I'm coming from and where I stand and maybe take a piece of that with them. I think it's important to express yourself, but sometimes people get caught up in the monotony and rigidity of adulthood and life. It's important to embrace the inner child and the creative aspect of your life in any way you can. It doesn't have to be as profound as picking up a guitar and learning to play it in five minutes. It doesn't have to be so demanding creatively. It's the little things that stimulate your brain in a way that doesn't make you feel like a hamster on a wheel.""

As the multihyphenate expands her portfolio of passion-driven projects, she assures that her future work will continue to align with her creatively and spiritually.

""I'm definitely interested in doing more projects in the future that involve acting and voiceover work. Choosing what fits right with my spirit is important, but those opportunities don't usually come that easily. I'm more artistically driven in a direction where I can be a little picky. I can be a bit picky with what I want to do, and I want to make the right decisions creatively. So it has to really be true. And I think I found that with Brisk, and that's something I'm definitely interested in in the future."""
Renegade Game Studios Welcomes Night Vale To Tabletop Gaming,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/robwieland/2024/10/04/renegade-game-studios-welcomes-night-vale-to-tabletop-gaming/,2024-10-04T20:54:03Z,"Spooky radio dramas have a long history of influencing pop culture. Shows like The Shadow featured a main character who used fear as a weapon to scare criminals into confessing or giving up. Modern shows like Evil or Interview With The Vampire can trace their lineage back to Lights Out and Inner Sanctum

Welcome To Night Vale revitalized the form in 2012 with a potent mix of surreal imagery and dark, absurd humor. Fans fell in love with the weird tales coming out of the small desert town and helped turn it into a pop culture sensation. The show is a foundational aspect of the narrative podcast genre and has become a brand that tours the world and sells merchandise to fans.

Renegade Game Studios is crowdfunding a new chapter in Night Vale's pop culture influence. Welcome To Night Vale: The Roleplaying Game hope to bring players together to tell their own strange stories about The Faceless Old Woman Who Secretly Lives in Your Home while also never, ever mentioning the Dog Park. The company gave me an advanced look at the game for this article.

The first book in the boxed set is The Citizen's Guide which illustrates how Renegade's Essence20 Roleplaying System was adapted for this setting. As the podcast is about exploring the mysteries surrounding the town, the game focuses on investigation over combat. Players can take on the roles of their favorite characters or create new citizens to get wrapped up in the strange goings on.

Game Masters will enjoy The Host's Guide thanks to its advice on how to tell stories that feel like the ones on the podcasy. It also has good general advice together such as how to run a fulfilling Session Zero that maks every one excited to play. The book finishes up with game mehcanics for some of the famous residents of Night Vale that can be used as allies, rivals or enemies in the stories told by the game.

The Visitor's Guide highlights many of the weird, memorable locations in and around the town. Fans will love the details on their favorite places and organizations, while players and Game Masters will find a lot of inspiration for their stories here. There are event ads, tickets and coupons that could get printed out and used as props in the pages of this book.

I won't get into too many spoilers for The Skeleton Gorge Incident, which is the full adventures included in the boxed set to kick off a campaign. It lets players interact with some of the most famous parts of the setting...even if that interaction might put them in mortal danger. The story gives fans a chance to experience one of the most dangerous jobs in the world: an internship at Night Vale Community Radio.

I really like how self contained this boxed set feels. This seems like it could be the perfect gift for someone that loves the show regardless of whether or not they are already into RPGs. It also is a great way to get Dungeons & Dragons players to branch out and try something different.

I like who quickly the boxed set moves to get players in the game. There are 11 pre-generated characters that are built to get into The Skeleton Gorge Incident quickly. While building your own character is fun and deeply rewarding, something picking up a character and making it your own is just as satisfying.

The materials were written by folks who have a clear passion for the show. Finding the balance between important game information and interesting media tie-in trivia can be tricky. The creators have nailed that here as I enjoyed reading it as a potential Host and as someone who enjoys the show.

Welcome To Night Vale: The Roleplaying Game is on BackerKit through October 30th, 2024. Backers get priority access to the game before it hits retailers as well as art prints and other Backerkit exclusives. The game is slated for a May 2025 release."
"TikTok User Goes Viral For Finding Buried Rug In Her Yard, Sparking Police Investigation -- But No Body Was Found",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/04/tiktok-user-goes-viral-for-finding-buried-rug-in-her-yard-sparking-police-investigation-but-no-body-was-found/,2024-10-04T20:29:03Z,"Columbus, Ohio resident Katie Santry posted a viral series of TikToks this week documenting how she found a rolled-up rug buried several feet below the ground in her backyard, prompting thousands of users to encourage her to try and dig it up and urge police to investigate -- though police said Friday afternoon there was no body found in the rug.

Santry said in a TikTok over the weekend she thinks her house is haunted, stating she woke up in the morning and found her home office disorganized and her laptop broken, around the same time she found a rug buried underground in her yard while she and her husband were building a fence. At the behest of TikTok users, Santry called the police about the rug, who initially dismissed the situation. She posted another video days later stating police called her back, telling her they had heard about her situation, and wanted to send more officers to investigate. Santry said the police would send cadaver dogs, and if the dogs seemed to detect something, the police would dig up the rug, but would otherwise leave it. Santry livestreamed their investigation and later posted a TikTok video of two different cadaver dogs sniffing the scene, both ultimately sitting at the hole she had dug containing the rug. After both dogs sat down, Santry audibly gasped. She said later in her video police told her the dogs sitting by the hole doesn't necessarily mean there's a body buried there and could instead indicate something else, like traces of blood. Police sent excavators to dig up the rug the following morning.

How Santry's laptop broke. Now that Santry knows there isn't a body buried in her backyard, that's her main question, she said in her Friday afternoon TikTok.

Santry's series on TikTok, which contains more than 30 parts, garnered millions of views per video, the latest example of TikTok users' appetite for longform, multi-part series. Other lengthy series have captivated users in recent months, like Tareasa Johnson's 50-part ""Who TF Did I Marry?"" series, which recently landed a television adaptation, and social media influencer Brooke Schofield's 14-part series about her breakup. Santry compared her situation throughout her video series to a true crime documentary. Thousands of users commented on each of Santry's videos, offering advice and creating their own theories -- with many trying to explain why the cadaver dogs stopped by the hole if there was no body.

ou're forgiven if you missed it amid the barrage of news about escalating violence in the Middle East, the vice presidential debate, the widespread devastation caused by Hurricane Helene and a historic dockworker strike that could have had significant economic implications, but this week marked the release of the annual Forbes 400 list, the definitive ranking of the richest of the rich in the U.S.

As my colleagues on the wealth team note, America's 400 richest individuals are ""having a rollicking time in the roaring 2020s; in all, they are worth a record $5.4 trillion, up nearly $1 trillion from last year."" And while the gender wealth gap among this cohort remains wide -- there are only 67 women among these 400 people -- it is narrowing, at least a little. Women now account for 17% of the list, up from 15% last year, and they hold 15% of the 400's total wealth, up from 14% in 2023. They are worth a combined $839 billion, up from the $621 billion that the 60 women on last year's list held.

The richest woman on the 400 is Alice Walton, a spot she's held for nine out of the last ten years. What IS new and notable about Walton is her charitable giving. According to a recently-released tax return -- which showed that her foundation distributed $390 million in the year ending on September 30, 2023 -- Walton reported her largest known philanthropic gift to date, $249 million in funding for a new medical school to be built in her name. This medical school is still seeking accreditation, but if all goes to plan, the school will open in 2025 and welcome an inaugural class of 48 students.

Cheers!

P.S. I'm pleased to say that the newest episode of ""The One Who Changed Everything"" came out this week and features author T.J. Newman! T.J. told us about how she went from being a bookseller and flight attendant into a three-time NYT bestselling author -- and how it all comes back to a manilla envelope she sent to agent Shane Salerno. I loved this conversation and hope you do, too!

As CEO of the $4.9 billion (revenue) electronic medical records giant Epic Systems, Judy Faulkner is one of the most powerful people in healthcare. With no plans to retire, she tells Forbes about her arrangement to ensure Epic remains independent and employee-owned in perpetuity. ""If you retire, you don't have a purpose in living much anymore,"" she says. ""[Working] keeps you alive and going. It's really good when what you do is bigger than yourself.""

In continued Forbes 400 coverage: Eren Ozmen's Sierra Nevada Corp. fought for years to land the $13 billion contract to build the next nuclear-ready Doomsday planes. Now the billionaire's reputation -- and her firm's finances -- hinge on whether she can pull off the most difficult maneuver in aerospace: executing a complex, top-secret government project on time and on budget.

Yang Qiumei, the widow of SenseTime cofounder Tang Xiao'ou, has inherited his stake in the Chinese artificial intelligence giant, according to a stock exchange filing. The stake is worth $1.6 billion as of Wednesday's close, Forbes estimates, and propels Yang, 59, to become the latest woman to join Hong Kong's three-comma club.

After more than 17 years as a beloved fixture on NBC's ""TODAY"" show, co-host Hoda Kotb is stepping down, signaling the end of an era. While fans and colleagues are sad to see her go, Kotb's departure serves as a critical reminder that it's never too late to take control of your career, especially if you feel like the time has come for a change -- or if you feel burned out, unfulfilled, or like you've hit a plateau.

1. Take an implicit association test. Studies show that women are subject to more negative stereotypes at work than their male counterparts. I discussed this with Mika Brzezinski and Huma Abedin today for a Know Your Value segment, and I'll share here what I said on air: To combat stereotypes at work, we should all become aware of our implicit biases, and we can do that by taking ForbesWomen contributor Lindsay Kohler's advice and doing an implicit association assessment.

A number of the biggest names in Hollywood came out in support of Biden before he dropped out of the race, before turning their support to Harris. Olivia Rodrigo, endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris by sharing a video of a speech the vice president gave promising to ""stop Donald Trump's extreme abortion bans."" Major Democratic fundraiser George Clooney, who used a New York Times essay to call for Biden to drop out of the race, lent his support to Harris and Barbra Streisand said she would support Harris because of her vow to fight for reproductive rights. Musician John Legend, who performed at the Democratic National Convention in 2024, posted he was ""so ready"" for a Harris presidency. Director Spike Lee, ""West Wing"" creator Aaron Sorkin and director Ken Burns hrew their support behind Harris, along with actresses Rosie O'Donnell and Jamie Lee Curtis. Robert De Niro, who narrated an advertisement for the Biden campaign, praised the president's ""selfless patriotism"" in a statement that did not mention Harris but said ""there is nothing more important for our country than defeating Donald Trump at the ballot box."" British pop artist Charli XCX brought Harris into the Gen Z fold by tweeting ""kamala IS brat,"" an endorsement that was met by Harris' team changing the background photo on her X account to the ""brat"" green color and using the same font used on Charli XCX's album of the same name. Rapper Cardi B, who in May said she wouldn't be endorsing Biden, tweeted ""AHAHAHAHA LETS GOOOOO I TOLD YALLL KAMALA WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THE 2024 candidate...."" Pop musician Kesha said she plans to support Harris in November and, when asked how she felt about Vance, responded ""f -- - that man."" Beyoncé has not made a public endorsement but did give the Harris campaign permission to use her song ""Freedom"" in a video of her first official visit to her campaign's headquarters, a rare approval from the superstar musician. Beyoncé's mom and businesswoman Tina Knowles endorsed Harris with an Instagram post. Former President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle and former President Bill Clinton and his wife, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, have also thrown their support behind Harris. Former President Jimmy Carter, 99, reportedly told his son last week he was trying to make it to his 100th birthday so he could cast his vote for Kamala Harris. ""Sex in the City"" actress and former New York gubernatorial candidate Cynthia Nixon threw her support behind Harris and her Vice Presidential pick, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz, in a post that read: ""I'm Walzing on air!"" Billionaire Mark Cuban, who previously said he was committed to voting for Biden, has also supported Harris and endorsed Walz as her running mate, calling him someone who ""can sit at the kitchen table and make you feel like you have know him forever."" Actor Tony Goldwyn, Republican political commentator Ana Navarro, comedian Mindy Kaling and actress Kerry Washington each supported the Harris-Walz campaign by hosting one evening of the Democratic National Convention. Nick Offerman, Jane Fonda, Ben Stiller, Kathy Griffin, John Stamos, Ed Helms, Tiffany Haddish and Ike Barinholtz were among those who appeared on a ""Comics for Harris"" virtual rally via Zoom, which reportedly raised close to half a million dollars for the Harris campaign. Over Labor Day weekend, a fundraiser for the Democratic ticket in Southampton, New York was hosted by Vogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour and fashion designer Tory Burch, among others. Actors Matt Damon and Lin-Manuel Miranda will attend fundraiser in New York City in September -- for which tickets are listed at $25,000 per person -- to support the Kamala Harris-Tim Walz ticket, Bloomberg reported. Actress Aubrey Plaza posted a photo of herself on Instagram holding Grumpy Cat -- the face of a famous meme -- with the caption ""HARRIS 🇺🇸 WALZ. Mel Brooks said he was ""all in"" for the Harris and Walz ticket in a post to social media holding his dog, adding ""I don't have a cat, so a dog will have to do!"" Stevie Nicks did not name a particular candidate when she encouraged her followers to vote in an Instagram post this week, but signed her message ""Childless Dog Lady."" Billionaire pop star Taylor Swift endorsed Kamala Harris in an Instagram post minutes after a debate between Harris and Donald Trump wrapped up, with a photo of her holding her cat that has since been recreated by several other celebrities. After declining to endorse a candidate in 2020, Martha Stewart said at the Retail Influencer CEO Forum she will supporting Kamala Harris in the election because she wants a president ""who doesn't hate New York"" and ""doesn't hate democracy,"" the Daily Beast reported. Pop star Billie Eilish and her brother Finneas, a songwriter and producer, made a video about National Voter Registration Day and Billie said they would both be voting for Harris and Walz ""because they are fighting to protect our reproductive freedom, our planet and our democracy."" Famous television scientist Bill Nye, in a video posted to the Kamala HQ TikTok account, called Trump a ""climate change denier"" and encouraged viewers to ""vote with the climate in mind."" Nye participated ""Geeks & Nerds for Harris"" fundraiser on Sept. 28 hosted by ""Wonder Woman"" star Lynda Carter that will also feature ""Star Trek"" actors LeVar Burton and Anthony Rapp, actor Misha Collins of ""Supernatural,"" Star Wars actor Mark Hamill and others.

Former pro wrestler Hulk Hogan ripped off his shirt while on stage at the Republican National Convention last month to reveal a Trump-Vance campaign shirt underneath, and called Trump his ""hero"" and the ""greatest president of the United States."" Musician Kid Rock has been vocal about his support of Trump in the past and at the RNC revamped his song ""American Bad Ass"" to include references to Trump. UFC President and personality Dana White called Trump the ""toughest, most resilient human being."" Rapper and reality TV star Amber Rose gave a speech at the RNC in support of Trump. Country music stars Chris Janson and Jason Aldean also appeared at the convention. Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy in January said voting for Trump over Biden was a ""no-brainer."" Public-facing billionaires like Elon Musk and Steve Wynn have also supported the former president. Actress Rosanne Barr, a longtime conservative supporter of Trump, clapped back at Cuban's endorsement of the Harris-Walz ticket and called the VP pick ""another reason Harris is a disaster."" Rapper Azealia Banks last year said she would vote for Donald Trump in Novemebr and she appeared at a rally in Florida this summer. Actor Jon Voight has defended Trump on multiple occasions. 50 Cent's 2023 song ""Many Men (Wish Death)"" started trending online after the assassination attempt of Trump last month. The rapper responded by putting Trump's face on the cover of his ""Get Rich or Die Tryin.'"" While it's hard to call the response an official endorsement, he did appear to support the president in 2020 before apparently backtracking. Other celebrities who have supported Trump in the past, but not outright endorsed him yet this election season, include Lil Wayne and ""Happy Days"" star Scott Baio. Trump thanked Brittany Mahomes, wife of NFL superstar Patrick Mahomes, for her ""defending him"" after she lashed out at social media users who criticized her for liking several pro-Trump posts last month (Mahomes has not formally endorsed a candidate). At a rally in Las Vegas, Trump thanked reggaeton star Nicky Jam for his endorsement, but apparently thought he was a she -- saying: ""Do you know Nicky? She's hot.

Inside The Superyachts Of America's Richest People,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/giacomotognini/2024/10/04/inside-the-superyachts-of-americas-richest-people/,2024-10-04T10:39:42Z,"For the first time ever, Forbes dug into how many superyachts are owned by America's 400 richest people and how much they're truly worth. Turns out it's a bigger share of all superyachts around the world, even though they are not necessarily the most valuable.

ometimes, the trappings of a multi-billion dollar fortune get old. Forbes 400 member Shahid Khan of auto parts supplier firm Flex-N-Gate decided in 2020 that his superyacht, Kismet, needed an update. So he splurged nearly $390 million on building a new 400-foot superyacht -- also named Kismet, which was delivered in April. The new floating pad features fireplaces, floor-to-ceiling glass windows and a bow shaped like a jaguar (presumably a nod to Khan's Jacksonville NFL team) plus all the usual yacht trimmings, from a helipad to a mosaic-lined swimming pool.

But first, he had to make room. Last September, he sold his previous yacht -- also named Kismet -- for $159 million to Eric Schmidt, the former Google CEO. Schmidt had been in the market for a new boat after his planned $67 million purchase of the 269-foot Alfa Nero fell through, reportedly due to concerns that the yacht's alleged owner, a sanctioned Russian oligarch, would sue to regain control. (The yacht, which had been frozen by U.S. authorities in 2022 and was sitting idle in the island nation of Antigua and Barbuda, eventually sold in July for $40 million to an unnamed buyer.)

Khan and Schmidt aren't the only American billionaires with a passion for yachts. While the largest -- and most valuable -- yachts in the world are owned by Middle Eastern royals and Russian oligarchs (in fact, all 17 of the longest yachts are owned by individuals from these two groups), Americans own the most, with roughly one out of four of all superyachts -- commonly defined as those larger than 40 meters (131 feet) -- belonging to an American. That's three times as many as Russians, the second-largest yacht owners, according to industry publication SuperYacht Times.

For the first time ever, Forbes has compiled a list of all of the yachts owned by America's 400 richest people. Collectively, Forbes estimates that 40 members of the Forbes 400 own at least 60 yachts worth more than $6 billion, according to yacht valuation experts VesselsValue. Some own multiple, while others focus on one extravagant build, which can cost in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

These ships range from the modest -- Igor Olenicoff's 118-foot, $2 million Rusalka -- to the grandiose, such as David Geffen's Rising Sun. The 18th largest yacht in the world at 453 feet and the biggest one owned by an American, it comes with a basketball court that converts to a helipad and has hosted celebrities like Leonardo DiCaprio and fellow billionaire Oprah Winfrey. The most valuable American-owned yacht is Jeff Bezos' Koru, a custom-built 417-foot sailing yacht that's worth an estimated $500 million.

While Geffen owns the biggest and Bezos the most valuable, it's Gabe Newell -- the cofounder of video game company Valve -- who owns the most. His six ships (plus several submarines), which he manages through his maritime research organization Inkfish, make up the largest fleet among America's richest people.

Newell is not the only American whose love of floating mansions seems to stem at least in part from a passion to better understand the ocean. Ex-Google CEO Schmidt bought the Falkor Too, a $75 million research vessel owned through the nonprofit Schmidt Ocean Institute, in 2021. Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, owns the $82 million OceanXplorer, a souped-up research vessel that has its own TV show on National Geographic.

Sometimes owning a superyacht can be a liability, or worse -- deadly -- as the August tragedy involving onetime billionaire Michael Lynch's yacht Bayesian illustrates. Lynch and six others perished when the yacht sank off the coast of Italy. That same month, Laurene Powell Jobs' 256-foot, $81 million yacht Venus collided with Lady Moura, a yacht owned by Mexican billionaire Ricardo Salinas Pliego. Fortunately, no one was hurt. In early 2020, hedge fund billionaire Daniel Loeb's 197-foot, $45 million yacht Samadhi damaged a coral reef in Belize, spurring an apology from Loeb, who committed to working with a local conservation group to restore the reef.

Here are the yachts owned by America's 400 richest people:

The custom-built sailing yacht is the second-largest of its kind in the world (behind Russian billionaire Andrey Melnichenko's SY A) Based on the word Koru in the Māori language of New Zealand, which means the spiral shape of an unfurling silver fern frond, it is a symbol of harmony and eternal movement. The yacht briefly stirred controversy when its Dutch builder, Oceanco, proposed partially dismantling a historic bridge in Rotterdam to allow it to sail through. (After local protests, the yacht was instead towed elsewhere.) It comes with its own ""support vessel"" named Abeona, worth $53 million, and the bow features a sculpture of a woman who many believe is modeled after Bezos' girlfriend, Lauren Sánchez -- a claim she has denied, stating it depicts the Norse goddess Freyja.

The third yacht named Kismet (which means fate or destiny) built for Khan, this newest version was codenamed Project Jag before it was delivered in 2024. (Previous iterations of Kismet hosted musical guests including Charli XCX and Oasis' Noel Gallagher.) The yacht is built for comfort, featuring a ""7-star wellness suite"" that comes with a hammam, sauna and cryotherapy chamber, plus a private treatment room with a massage table and a chromotherapy bathtub, according to the builder, Lurssen. The aquatic theme continues in the lower deck, which boasts a ""Nemo cinema"" with a 150-inch TV and an underwater seating area.

While Zuckerberg is relatively new to the yachting world, he started big. Feadship, one of the world's most popular superyacht builders, called Launchpad the largest yacht it had ever built when it was delivered in early 2024. (Originally named Katusha, the yacht was apparently intended to be built for Russian metals tycoon Vladimir Potanin.) With a dark navy hull and curving shapes, it has all the typical luxuries of a superyacht: two helipads, a swimming pool with a movable floor and a private outdoor deck with a jacuzzi.

The yet-to-be-delivered Project Y722 is the crown jewel in Gabe Newell's fleet of ships, a custom craft built by Netherlands-based Oceanco. The ""future-proofed"" megayacht comes with its own diesel-electric power plant and a battery energy storage system, allowing for ""extended periods of emission-free silent running"" according to the company. It is expected to be delivered in 2025.

Norn, a Lurssen-built yacht, resembles a U.S. Navy destroyer more than the typical superyacht, with sharp, angular corners and a military-style bow. Still, the builders didn't skimp on luxury for its owner Charles Simonyi, an early Microsoft employee who later sold a startup to his old firm: Norn has an outdoor cinema and a swimming pool with a liftable floor that turns into a dancefloor.

One of four ships in WhatsApp cofounder Jan Koum's fleet, Moonrise is a striking yacht with all-teak decks -- including the helipad -- drawing a sharp contrast with its white steel hull and aluminum structure. Its support vessel, Nebula, is the largest ever produced by its builder, Astilleros Armón, and features an air-conditioned helicopter hangar. When Koum gets bored, he can always step onto his $68 million, 241-foot yacht Mogambo with its own support boat, Power Play.

Kaos was famously defaced with graffiti by activists (twice) in Ibiza and Barcelona. Still, that hasn't stopped its owner, Walmart heiress Nancy Walton Laurie, from enjoying it. One of the largest superyachts built in the Netherlands at the time of its delivery in 2017, Kaos can fit 30 guests and features ""visual tricks"" in the shape of unusable deck areas and overhangs, which give a better sense of proportion, according to its builder, Oceanco. It was delivered to Laurie already outfitted with her own fine china, silverware, and even loose furniture.

The Dallas Cowboys owner's yacht, named in tribute of his wife, was considered a ""pioneer"" by its builder, Oceanco, for its sustainability and fuel efficient attributes when it was delivered in 2018. With ""waste heat recovery"" and ""integrated battery systems,"" the yacht floats ahead of its gas-guzzling sisters with (slightly) cleaner operations, consuming 30% less fuel than a standard vessel of its size, according to Oceanco's website. Part of that design is to help Jones accomplish a goal he told Yachts International in 2019: ""to see as much of the world as possible from the perspective of the sea."" More than 14 guests can coast efficiently in style, enjoying its sundry amenities like a sauna and movie theater. The yacht has gotten its moment in the spotlight, too, when in 2020, Jones called into the NFL draft from an ornate room on the yacht, as ESPN reporter Don Van Natta posted online.

Built in 2004, Rising Sun is much older than the rest of the yachts owned by America's richest, one reason its value has depreciated so much since Geffen bought it for a reported $590 million from fellow Forbes 400 member Larry Ellison in 2010. Still, it was refitted in 2011 and has more than enough features and amenities -- including a spa, beauty salon and specially built glass panels with heat-insulating foil -- to make Geffen and his celebrity guests comfortable. In March 2020, Geffen famously posted photos of a sunrise over the yacht on Instagram, telling his followers that he was isolating aboard Rising Sun while sailing in St. Vincent and the Grenadines. (He later deleted the posts after being criticized for being tone-deaf.)

With Viva, Frank Fertitta, who made the bulk of his fortune through mixed martial arts promoter UFC, sought a yacht that was as efficient as possible. The pearl-white ship, delivered in 2021, boasts an ""advanced hybrid propulsion system,"" or diesel-electric power system, that's more efficient than the standard yacht. Another Feadship creation, the vessel has a slim, sophisticated look that's only made clearer by its all-white coloring, with pops of teak on its fold-out beach club deck, poolside and decks."
How To Start A Successful Business At 50+,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/melissahouston/2024/10/04/how-to-start-a-successful-business-at-50/,2024-10-04T10:04:58Z,"It's no secret that women over 50 are redefining what it means to be an entrepreneur. More than ever, Gen X women are leaving behind traditional jobs, trading in the corporate ladder for the excitement and control that comes with owning a business.

In fact, women in this age group are starting businesses at an unprecedented rate, bringing experience, confidence, and a fresh perspective to the entrepreneurial world. It's time to harness your years of wisdom, skills, and drive to launch a business that's not just successful but fulfilling.

The entrepreneurial journey requires a specific mindset, especially if you're starting a business later in life. It's easy to feel intimidated by younger entrepreneurs who seem to have grown up in the fast-paced world of tech, but your age is your advantage. You've built resilience, adaptability, and problem-solving skills over decades.

What's key at this stage is to adopt a growth mindset. This means seeing every challenge as an opportunity to learn, grow, and evolve. You've got experience and wisdom, but business landscapes shift fast. Be prepared to learn new things and embrace change.

The best way to set yourself up for success is by starting a business in a niche where you have experience, skills, or a deep interest. You likely have decades of professional experience and you must leverage that! Whether it's consulting, coaching, or a product-based business, focus on a niche where your expertise gives you a competitive advantage.

At the same time, be mindful of market demand. Make sure your business idea solves a specific problem or serves a gap in the market. This blend of personal expertise and market demand is a winning formula for a thriving business.

One of the greatest assets you have at 50+ is your network. After years of working in various industries, you've likely built relationships with colleagues, mentors, and peers. Use these connections to spread the word about your new business, gain valuable advice, and even secure your first clients.

Don't hesitate to reach out and let people know what you're working on. You never know who might be looking for exactly what you're offering.

You don't need to have everything figured out from day one. Starting a business at 50+ can feel like a huge leap, but you can make the process less overwhelming by starting small. Consider launching as a side hustle while you're still working or starting with a simplified version of your business that can grow as you gain traction.

By starting small, you can test your ideas, learn what works, and refine your business without too much financial risk. Then, as your confidence and client base grow, you can scale your business into something more substantial.

A successful business isn't just about passion; it's also about making money. In your 50s and beyond, you likely don't have as much time to ""figure it out"" as younger entrepreneurs, so your focus should be on profitability from the get-go.

This means being strategic about your pricing, costs, and business model. Make sure you understand your financial goals and how your business will meet them. For example, you can use value-based pricing to ensure you're charging what you're worth and focus on offering services or products that people are willing to pay for.

While technology might feel intimidating, it's an essential part of running a modern business. From building an online presence to managing client relationships and marketing your services, digital tools are your best friend.

Thankfully, you don't have to be a tech expert to get started. There are countless user-friendly platforms to help with everything from setting up a website to automating marketing and managing finances. Don't let the fear of tech hold you back -- there are simple solutions out there to help you manage your business effectively.

Starting a business is a journey filled with ups and downs, and failure is part of that journey. Many successful entrepreneurs, regardless of age, will tell you that they learned their biggest lessons from their failures.

As a woman over 50, you've likely faced and overcome challenges in your personal and professional life, and starting a business will be no different. Keep going, and don't let the fear of failure stop you from building something incredible.

The bottom line is that starting a business after 50 is not just possible; it's a fantastic opportunity to create something that aligns with your values, skills, and experience. With the right mindset, a solid plan, and a focus on profitability, you can launch a business that not only thrives but also fulfills you."
How early support and systematic change can help close STEM gender gap,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/drkathmackay/2024/10/04/how-early-support-and-systematic-change-can-help-close-stem-gender-gap/,2024-10-04T09:58:22Z,"In recent years, the conversation around gender disparity in entrepreneurship and STEM has gained momentum, especially when data continues to show that only 18% of high-growth enterprises have at least one woman in their founding team, highlighting the urgent need for systematic change. A notable development in this ongoing discourse is Innovate UK's recent decision to honour its original commitment of awarding 50 grants for its 'Women in Innovation' funding competition. This decision reflects a broader acknowledgement of the necessity to support women in innovation, while also shedding light on the dynamic nature of public funding. However, this development is just one piece of a larger puzzle, revealing the complex and multifaceted nature of achieving gender equality in the sector.

Missed opportunities for female entrepreneurs often underscore the broader systemic challenges within the funding landscape. When grants or resources fall short, it reflects not just a financial setback but also highlights the enduring obstacles women face in accessing support and recognition. Such situations reveal the need for a more robust system that addresses these gaps and provides equitable opportunities for all entrepreneurs, regardless of gender. Ensuring consistent and fair access to resources is crucial for fostering a more inclusive and balanced entrepreneurial environment.

The importance of early-stage support

Addressing the gender disparity in STEM requires a deep dive into the roots of the issue. Despite advances in recent years, women remain underrepresented in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics workforce. The gender gap begins early in education and becomes more pronounced after GCSEs, with a noticeable decline in female participation in STEM subjects. This persistent imbalance is not merely a numbers game but a reflection of broader societal attitudes and structural barriers that continue to deter young women from pursuing these fields. It's something I've mentioned before, but getting engagement with schools back up and running this academic year is welcome, though only just the beginning of what needs to be a sustained effort.

Efforts to close this gap have often centred on increasing awareness and providing role models, but these approaches alone have not been sufficient. To effect meaningful change, we need comprehensive strategies that address both the immediate and systemic challenges faced by women in STEM. For example, tailored programmes that offer mentoring, funding opportunities, and skills development to women at various stages of their careers, such as incubators for early-stage entrepreneurs, form a crucial part of this broader approach.

Expanding from successful initiatives in Leeds and Manchester, the Female Founders Incubator at Alderley Park aims to bridge the gender gap in tech and entrepreneurship by offering tailored support to early-stage female founders. Such programmes are vital, not only for the practical support they provide but also for the message they send - that women's contributions to innovation are both valued and necessary.

Closing the gender gap

These initiatives highlight a crucial aspect of fostering gender equality in innovation: the importance of early-stage support. Research has consistently shown that women face unique challenges in securing funding and resources in STEM. Females often raise significantly less capital than their male counterparts. For instance, one study revealed that women researchers received an average of about £274k in grant awards, compared to £537k for men. This disparity reflects a broader trend of gender-based funding inequalities that affect women across various fields. Women were also less likely to secure second grants, with 9% fewer women receiving approval for re-applications compared to their male peers.

Support networks and programmes designed for women in science and technology are crucial in addressing these disparities and ensuring women have the opportunity to compete on a more level playing field. By providing targeted resources, mentorship, and opportunities for growth, such initiatives help level the playing field and promote a more equitable environment for innovation.

Yet, supporting female entrepreneurs is just one piece of the puzzle. True progress requires addressing the systemic issues within STEM education and beyond. Enhancing this education from an early age, showcasing female role models, and ensuring equitable access to opportunities are essential components of a broader strategy to close the gender gap.

Efforts to reform education in science and technology should focus on generating excitement and interest among young girls by debunking myths about these subjects and highlighting their relevance to real-world issues. Providing hands-on learning experiences and creating opportunities for girls to engage with technical fields from an early age can also play a significant role in closing the gender gap. Furthermore, showcasing successful women in STEM and providing mentorship opportunities can inspire and encourage the next generation of female innovators.

As we move forward, it is crucial to view initiatives like the Female Founders Incubator not as standalone solutions but as part of a comprehensive effort to drive systemic change. By addressing both the immediate needs of women in STEM and the broader structural issues within education and funding, we can work towards a more inclusive and innovative future. This holistic approach will not only benefit women but also enrich the entire field of innovation, leading to a more diverse and dynamic landscape of ideas and solutions."
'About Mannequin' Short Film Qualifies For Oscar Consideration,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/tomteicholz/2024/10/04/about-mannequin-short-film-qualifies-for-oscars/,2024-10-04T07:22:16Z,"Last year I traveled to the Republic of Georgia in November where my friends Giorgi Rtskhiladze and his wife Ayanat Ksenbai renewed their wedding vows in a beautiful ceremony in a 6 Century monastery. I returned shortly after, but Giorgi and Ayanat, who were originally scheduled to return after a brief visit to Ayanat's native Kazakhstan, stayed on for the next eight months.

Turns out what they were doing is making an almost 40-minute short film, About Mannequin, directed by 34-year-old director Aruzhan Dossymoka, and that was shot in Almaty, Kazakhstan's former capital with a Kazakh crew. The film, which has just opened in San Francisco and will soon be shown in New York and Los Angeles, has qualified for Oscar consideration in the short film category. And it could well win.

Produced by Ayanat Ksenbai and Marvin Peart in partnership with Foresee Films' Carr Bettis and Giorgi Rtskhiladze and WonderHill Studios, the film stars Ayanat, who is one of Kazakhstan's most beloved actors. As a teenager she worked with such revered directors as Milos Forman, Sergei Bodrov and Ivan Passer in Nomad, and Volker Schlondorff in Ulzhan. About Mannequin is Ayanat's return to the screen after raising her three young children and she delivers a mature and masterful performance that is as heart-wrenching as it is haunting.

About Mannequin is a striking film in many ways. From a story and script written by Ayanat and Giorgi, About Mannequin is a Black and White film with very little dialogue. It is a modern silent film that tells a mysterious story about a cursed wedding dress and the woman, played by Ayanat, who comes under its spell and must marshal her strength to break free and get revenge.

A drama, the film has surrealist moments where the viewer is not sure of what is real and what a dream. There are leaps of logic in the narrative which, as viewers, we come to accept. We never know what country, or what time period the film is set, and even what language is being spoken (this is actually one of the first films in the US to feature the Kazakh language). Strangely enough, this makes the film universal and able to be understood by people all over the world. The film resonates with echoes of Old Hollywood, while marrying them to Kazakh traditions of storytelling.

The moving score by Giorgi and Beka Gochiashvili and the haunting main song, sung by Lucia, add to the film's eerie spell as does Stephanie Michelle Bettis' production design and the stunning wedding dress designed by Aydana Omorova.

What is transcendent about the film is that at its core, About Mannequin is a story about a mother and the power of women to believe in things greater than themselves. It is a film whose power stays with you long after the credits end."

The 'Hawk Tuah' Creator's Podcast Ranks No. 5 On Spotify -- Here's How She Kept The Meme Going For Months,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/conormurray/2024/10/03/the-hawk-tuah-creators-podcast-ranks-no-5-on-spotify-heres-how-she-kept-the-meme-going-for-months/,2024-10-03T20:46:39Z,"Haliey Welch, the woman who achieved internet fame this summer for her sexually explicit ""hawk tuah"" catchphrase, has turned her viral moment into a successful podcasting venture as her new ""Talk Tuah"" show ranks in the top five on Spotify's top podcast chart.

Welch's ""hawk tuah"" phrase became an instantly viral meme in June when she was interviewed by TikTok user @DMarloww, who asks questions to passersby on the street. He asked her what ""move in bed makes a man go crazy,"" prompting Welch to say: ""You gotta give him that 'hawk tuah.'"" The phrase was instantly mimicked and remixed by users on TikTok, and the #hawktuah hashtag has been used in more than 250,000 posts to date. Within two weeks of her viral interview, Welch said she had already sold thousands of hats bearing the ""hawk tuah"" phrase.

Welch, a 21-year-old from the small town of Belfast, Tennessee, maintained her fame in the weeks since her viral TikTok moment, with a series of high-profile appearances and social media activity. She created an Instagram account in July, which now has 2.6 million followers, and has posted pictures with Matt Rife and JoJo Siwa. She appeared onstage with country singer Zach Bryan in June, threw out the first pitch at a New York Mets game in August and was parodied in a Saturday Night Live sketch last weekend, in which she was portrayed by Chloe Fineman. She signed to an agent in Nashville and founded a company, 16 Minutes LLC, under which she has registered trademarks for merchandise. Welch also sells ""Talk Tuah"" merch, including hoodies and hats with phrases like ""'Talk Tuah' Changed My Life"" and ""'Talk Tuah' '24."" Welch also said on Instagram she launched a foundation, Paws Across America, to raise funds and awareness for animal welfare charities. She has since posted several Instagram videos at various animal shelters, urging followers to make donations.

Marquette University journalism professor Patrick Johnson told Fast Company that Welch may be benefitting from a boom in the conservative podcasting space, even though Welch's podcast is not about politics and she has not stated her political views. He said she is a ""southern belle who is very visibly someone that conservatives would code as one of their own,"" and she has a ""shock jock edge to her that conservatives love.""

"One Year In, Amy Pope's Plan To Reshape The Conversation on Migration",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/stephaniefillion/2024/10/03/one-year-in-amy-popes-plan-to-reshape-the-conversation-on-migration/,2024-10-03T19:55:25Z,"When Amy Pope became director of the International Organization for Migration (IOM) one year ago, she took an unconventional route to leadership.

A Biden administration official, Pope had been IOM's deputy director general for management and reform and since 2021. When the time came to choose the organization's next leader, she decided to run against her boss, António Vitorino, a high-level Portuguese lawyer and politician

""I feel like within our organization, there was a real interest in having someone bring fresh ideas and fresh perspective made from silly things,"" Pope said in an interview on the sideline of the UN General Assembly in September, ""like bringing a style of leadership that's more inclusive, seeking the input of various IOM workers from around the world wherever they are... Being unafraid to be human, doing things like dancing with migrants when we go out and they're presenting to us or showing us things they've learned, or sitting down and talking to people one to one.""

Vitorino had been leading the organization since 2018, but in her campaign, Pope insisted IOM needed a new type of leadership because Vitorino had an ""older generation approach."" She also said the organization's leader should spend more time traveling to talk to communities served by IOM.

But in her campaign, Pope was not only bringing a new generation of leadership to the organization, she was also returning a top job to American hands. At the UN, some leadership jobs are dominated by specific, powerful countries, and in the case of the IOM, the United States had occupied the top job for 50 years until the Trump administration brought forward Ken Isaacs, a Christian charity executive with a history of anti-Islam comments. Vitorino then got the job, and Pope joined IOM as a deputy director shortly after Biden took office. With the support of the Biden administration, Pope ran a six-month campaign while on unpaid leave, visited over 40 countries, and ended up getting the job.

One year in, Pope said she has executed on many of her campaign promises. On the organizational front, she has pushed for more visits on the ground and closer work with IOM teams around the world. ""I felt it was really important to demonstrate to our workforce and to our member states that IOM work is out in the world,"" she said. ""It's not in Geneva.""

Pope has also appointed a new executive team; the organization's leadership is now mostly women, ""all representing different parts of the world, all who travel, and all who I hope will amplify the work we're doing,"" she said.

Pope herself has also implemented her campaign promise to spend more time in the field. So far, she's traveled to over 40 countries in a year and said she has visited 90 countries overall since campaigning for the top job. She believes that her leadership and generation are already proving successful in the organization's ""new"" culture. She also believes that being the first woman to lead IOM brings something different to the table.

""Wherever they are, from being unafraid to be human, doing things like dancing with migrants when we go out... they're presenting to us or showing us things they've learned, or sitting down and talking to people one to one,"" Pope said. ""So, I feel like what was maybe missing, or what has been welcomed, is just this very human perspective, which I think is more typical of a new generation of leaders. I also think, frankly, being a woman means I'm not afraid to be emotional.""

More than anything, Pope wants to focus on communications. With hard-right political parties becoming increasingly popular around the world, the topic of migration is often at the forefront of political debates and scapegoated by those parties.

In her own country, former President Donald Trump controversially repeated in the presidential debate a baseless story about Haitian migrants eating pets. While she won't get involved in specific political debates, Pope wants to emphasize the benefits of migration in many U.S. cities and throughout the world.

""If you look at the election politics, you would think migration is just this huge problem, and it has to be stopped,"" she said, ""but if you widen the scope a little bit, and you look, for example, at post- Covid economic recovery, the United States' strong economic recovery is in large part due to the fact that there has been a continued number of migrants who are coming in.""

Pope is also trying to change the way people talk and think about migration and wishes to make it more central to policy discussions.

""I think the mistake has always been to keep migration as an afterthought, as opposed to really bringing it into the strategic conversation,"" she said. ""That's what we're trying to do, whether it's how do we build more sustainable solutions to climate change, how do we deal with the demographic changes that are happening around the world. How do we deal with globalization of skills and labor?""

A year in, Pope feels good about how she's carried out her vision, but she's unsure if she can maintain the same pace for the rest of her term.

""It was really critical to just get out and hear from the members, to hear from the migrants themselves, to talk to our workforce, and it was critical in terms of setting my own agenda and priorities and the organizational reform,"" she said, ""I don't know that I need to do another 40 next year."""
'Joker: Folie A Deux' Review Scores Crash Ahead Of Release,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/03/joker-folie-a-deux-review-scores-crash-ahead-of-release/,2024-10-03T17:51:15Z,"While originally the new Joker sequel, Joker: Folie a Deux, seemed to be tracking a little bit behind the original, 61% critic scores compared to a 69% score, that has now changed drastically with more reviews pouring in for the sequel.

The film's scores have crashed all the way down to a 44% on Rotten Tomatoes one day ahead of its official release on October 4. It's rare to see scores fall that much as more reviews come in past the initial batch, but critics are really not enjoying what they're seeing, it seems.

The film has been criticized for its story, musical numbers and extremely controversial ending, but mainly that it doesn't feel like it needs to exist at all. Here's a sampling of that criticism:

This low of a score means that it is far, far below that majority of DC offerings over the last decade or so. Here's the bottom ten list in that regard:

So yes, that makes it the sixth worst film in recent DC memory, behind some of the worst offerings of the DCEU like Shazam: Fury of the Gods and Wonder Woman 1984. And behind both the original Joker (69%) and The Batman (85%) which are DC ""Elseworlds"" projects now.

When the Joker sequel was announced with Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn, it just didn't seem like it was necessary. Now, that seems to be explicitly clear, and it will get a lower box office result in turn, despite costing four times as much. It seems obvious this should not have been greenlit at all."

""There's no question the discussion around family life, childbearing and pronatalism has gotten a lot more popular and gotten media attention because of JD Vance,"" Brad Wilcox, the director of the National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia, told the Associated Press.

The total fertility rate in the United States fell to 1.62 births per woman last year, a 2% decline from the year before and the lowest recorded rate since at least the 1930s. Reasons for the declining birthrate are varied and plentiful -- women are getting married later and pushing off having children as they pursue careers and higher education; the rising cost of living has impacted the economic realities of starting a family; and the U.S. lacks affordable child care and universal paid family leave policies, to name a few. Both Democrats and Republicans have supported policies that encourage family growth -- Republican senators have drafted a plan for monthly cash benefits for working families and Vice President Kamala Harris has proposed a $6,000 tax credit to parents of newborns, for example -- though conservatives tend to be more vocal about the goal of boosting birth rates. Economists have warned that a declining birth rate, and aging population, could spell disaster for the nation's Social Security program -- without enough young, working people to counterbalance the number of Social Security dependents, the existing system isn't sustainable. The same is true of other economic institutions that need to continue to replace retiring workers with those of the next generations. Experts also say that a low birth rate demonstrates an overall decline in American stability -- people aren't expressing a desire to have fewer children, research shows, but they are more worried about the economic and social impacts that they are excited to start a family.

The United States isn't the only developed nation experiencing a decline in birth rates, and it's not the only one to be encouraging reproduction at the government level. France in 2023 had the lowest number of babies born in the country since 1946; the Japanese government has described the situation ""critical"" after years of a declining birth rates; and Italy's birth rate has declined more than 34% since 2008. Each country has implemented new policies to address the situation, including an Italian parental leave that can be taken until a child is six years old and Japan extending public insurance coverage to maternity expenses. Hungary's birth rate, once the lowest in the European Union, has started to increase over the last decade as the country implements policies like exempting women who have more than three children from income tax providing home buying and building subsidies that increase based on their marital status and the number of children per household.

Flora: Revolutionizing Fertility Coverage With Individually-Owned Insurance Policies,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/josipamajic/2024/10/03/flora-revolutionizing-fertility-coverage-with-individually-owned-insurance-policies/,2024-10-03T17:22:54Z,"Reproductive health and family planning are becoming the forefront of social discourse, and a promising InsurTech startup just closed a fresh $1.5M pre-seed funding round - led by Highline Beta with co-investment by Cartography Capital and Everywhere Ventures - bringing them a step closer to transforming the landscape of fertility coverage. Flora, co-founded by Laura McDonald and Dr. Christy Lane, is introducing the first individually-owned fertility insurance policy, aiming to bridge the significant gap in fertility treatment funding.

The fertility market has been a hotbed for private equity (PE) and venture capital (VC) investments in recent years. Dr. Christy Lane, one of Flora's Co-Founder, observes, ""We're seeing clinic roll-ups, particularly in the US, where PE is going in and rolling up those clinics. In some cases, it's a good thing where you're seeing better services, better access to care.""

However, despite these investments and advancements in fertility science, a critical issue persists: the funding gap for fertility treatments. According to the World Health Organization, infertility is a global health issue, affecting one in six to one in five people who may need some form of fertility treatment.

Laura McDonald, Flora's Co-founder, explains ""Depending on where you are, 60 to 80% of people still have no coverage through their work or health plans, or limited coverage."" This lack of coverage is particularly pronounced for individuals working in small to medium-sized businesses or those who are self-employed.

Flora's innovative approach centers on creating the first individually-owned fertility insurance policy. Lane elaborates, ""We've spent decades really understanding the clinical research and the claims patterns for infertility treatment. That's what's allowed us to be able to develop these individual risk underwriting models and actuarial or pricing models.""

This individual risk model sets Flora apart from traditional group insurance plans, which don't perform individual underwriting. As a result, Flora can provide more affordable coverage for individuals and small groups, a market segment previously underserved by existing fertility coverage options.

Flora is initially targeting women aged 20 to 34, a demographic increasingly concerned about their future fertility. Lane shares a striking statistic: ""50% of young women are concerned about their future fertility before even trying to conceive.""

This concern is particularly prevalent among women who are prioritizing career development or other life goals before starting a family. As McDonald notes, ""They don't want their biological clock to necessarily dictate their life journey. They want to focus on their career and other things.""

Flora's innovative approach extends beyond its insurance model to its technological infrastructure. Lane explains, ""What we're building is very unique, even in the InsurTech space, which is called a digital MGA (Managing General Agent)."" This digital platform allows for wide distribution through channels such as health apps and small to medium businesses.

The company has developed a proprietary underwriting engine that enables real-time quoting and fast coverage approvals. Moreover, the data collected through this process opens up exciting possibilities for AI and machine learning applications. McDonald adds, ""There are huge opportunities for AI, large language models in improving our ability to better understand risk, but also enable us to better understand how to help women mitigate their own risk through things like lifestyle changes.""

Dr. Christy Lane brings a wealth of experience to Flora's innovative approach to fertility. With a background that includes founding the Wearable Health Lab at Stanford, Lane has spent years investigating the intricate connections between lifestyle factors and fertility. ""Part of our value is our deep understanding of what predicts infertility, particularly lifestyle,"" Lane explains. Her research has delved into how physical activity, sleep patterns, nutrition, and even data from wearable devices and IoT can impact fertility. This expertise forms the foundation of Flora's unique offering: personalized lifestyle journeys for women. By collecting and analyzing data, Flora aims to provide tailored, non-clinical recommendations to improve natural conception chances. For women already on a fertility journey, the company offers practical advice on sleep optimization, physical activity, and nutrition. Lane emphasizes, ""We're not just providing insurance; we're offering a holistic approach to reproductive health."" This data-driven, lifestyle-focused strategy sets Flora apart in the fertility market, promising a more comprehensive and personalized approach to family planning.

Flora's coverage is designed to be comprehensive, including diagnostics, drugs, intrauterine insemination (IUI), and in vitro fertilization (IVF). But the company's vision extends beyond mere financial coverage.

Lane, drawing from her personal experience with fertility treatments, emphasizes the importance of community support: ""Part of what we want to do is create community within women who become members of the Flora community and policyholders to make sure that these women understand infertility, understand their potential risks, and also lifestyle changes and things that they can do to reduce their risk of infertility.""

The company plans to provide personalized lifestyle recommendations to help women improve their chances of conceiving naturally. They're also establishing partnerships with sexual health platforms, menstrual tracking apps, and clinics to create a holistic reproductive health ecosystem.

Flora positions itself as an alternative or an addition to egg freezing, a procedure that has gained popularity but comes with its own set of challenges and uncertainties. McDonald shares an anecdote that encapsulates their value proposition: ""This young woman came up to me... She said, 'We're being told that we have to freeze our eggs, that that's our insurance policy for our future fertility. But what you made me realize is that I actually just need an insurance policy, literally, I just need an insurance policy.'""

McDonald illustrates the cost-effectiveness of their approach with an example: ""My daughter Molly, who plans to go to law school, can freeze her eggs in her 20s for, say $10,000 or she can buy a Flora policy, and depending on the ages she buys it, it might be $20 a month.""

When addressing the common questions surrounding their fertility insurance product. ""Many people ask why this hasn't been done before, and why established insurance companies don't simply adopt our model,"" McDonald explains. The answer lies in the complex landscape of insurance and the unique challenges of fertility coverage. Traditional insurance relies heavily on established mortality tables and risk models for areas like death, disability, and natural disasters. However, fertility insurance requires the creation of entirely new models. ""We've spent over 18 months building out these risk models,"" McDonald reveals, highlighting the extensive work involved. This process combines decades of expertise from team members like Dr. Christy Lane, who has studied the field for over 20 years, with innovative approaches to data analysis and risk assessment, and Somil Jain, a leading actuary for transformational digital insurance models. McDonald points out that the insurance industry often relies on InsurTech companies like Flora to pioneer such new models and bring innovative products to market. The challenges extend beyond model creation to navigating regulatory environments and securing capacity partners for claim payouts. Despite these hurdles, Flora has succeeded thanks to their team's diverse background and support from partners like InsureTech NY. McDonald emphasizes the importance of domain expertise in finding and utilizing new data sets to create novel underwriting, risk, and pricing models. Additionally, Flora's strategic advantage in distribution positions them to rapidly reach millions of women, increasing their odds of becoming a pioneer in this untapped market of individual fertility insurance.

Flora's ambitions extend beyond fertility treatment coverage. The company envisions a long-term model that supports women throughout their reproductive journey and beyond. As McDonald explains, ""We can ideally stay with you before the baby, when you have the baby, whether you need treatment or not, and after.""

Future plans include expanding coverage to areas such as postpartum depression treatment, pelvic floor treatment, and even perimenopause and menopause support. This comprehensive approach aims to address the full spectrum of women's reproductive health needs.

Flora represents a significant shift in how we approach fertility and reproductive health insurance. By offering individually-owned policies based on personalized risk assessments, the company is making fertility treatment more accessible and affordable for a broader demographic.

As reproductive health continues to gain prominence in public discourse, innovations like Flora's individually-owned fertility insurance policies may well become a cornerstone of comprehensive healthcare coverage. With its blend of InsurTech innovation, data-driven risk assessment, and community-focused approach - Flora is poised to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of fertility coverage and women's health support.

In a world where reproductive autonomy and financial stability often seem at odds, Flora's approach offers a promising solution. By providing women with the financial tools to take control of their fertility journey, Flora is not just selling insurance - it's offering peace of mind and expanded reproductive choices to a generation of women balancing health challenges, emotional and career needs with family planning."
The Perfect Weekend Getaway:  A Guide To The Mystical  Energy Vortexes Of Sedona,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/ericawertheimzohar/2024/10/03/the-perfect-weekend-getaway--a-guide-to-the-mystical--energy-vortexes-of-sedona/,2024-10-03T16:27:20Z,"Sedona has been a dream destination of mine for years, and its allure goes far beyond just being a scenic getaway. Positioned between Phoenix and Flagstaff, this Arizona town has earned its reputation as a spiritual haven, revered for its dramatic landscapes, serene atmosphere, and its healing powers. The drive from Phoenix takes roughly two hours, but the final stretch is truly unforgettable. As you approach Sedona, the terrain changes from rolling hills to a stunning panorama of towering red rock formations, each more striking than the last. It's the kind of view that takes your breath away -- almost like entering another planet. If anywhere on Earth feels like Mars, Sedona might just be it.

The red rocks themselves are a marvel, their colors shifting through deep oranges and reds as the day goes by. It's a living canvas that is always changing, drawing you in with its sheer magnitude and natural beauty. In the evening, the landscape takes on an even more surreal quality, with the night sky so clear and vivid that it feels like you're standing beneath a blanket of stars.

Upon arriving in Sedona, you will quickly become familiar with the term ""vortex,"" which is central to the town's identity. Often referred to as ""America's third eye,"" Sedona is believed to house four of the most powerful energy vortexes in the world. Curious to understand their significance, I began researching these sites and the supposed influence they have on visitors.

The Sedona Visitor's Bureau defines vortexes as areas where the Earth's energy is thought to be highly concentrated, creating a unique environment that promotes healing, introspection, and personal transformation and move in a spiral-like up and down movement. Vortexes are located all over the world such as the Great Pyramid in Egypt, Machu Picchu in Peru, and Uluru/Ayers Rock in Australia to name a few. Visitors often describe feeling more grounded, spiritually aligned, or mentally clear after spending time at these sites. The Bureau identifies two primary types of vortexes:

Both types of vortexes are said to draw their power from Sedona's unique geological features, particularly the high concentration of quartz and iron oxides, which some believe contribute to the heightened energy sensations visitors experience. Sedona's known for having up to 15 energy vortexes throughout town, but there are four major ones that are to be the most powerful.

With my guidebook in hand, I embarked on a journey to visit all four of Sedona's major vortex sites over the course of my two-day stay.

Location: Airport Mesa is located near the Sedona Airport, just a short drive from the town center. A popular overlook, Airport Mesa offers 360-degree views of Sedona's red rock formations. Parking is easy and is offered for $3.

Energy: This vortex is known for its upflow or masculine energy (energy coming out of the earth).

Experience: The Mesa offers stunning panoramic views of Sedona's landscape, including Bell Rock, Courthouse Butte, and Cathedral Rock, and is the most popular for sunset viewing. There is a 3.2 mile hike, the Airport Mesa Loop Trail, that circles the mesa that is not too challenging but guarantees a view from every angle.

Best Time to Visit: Sunset is particularly popular, as the rocks take on a fiery glow and the expansive views become even more breathtaking. Be prepared for crowds, as many gather here to witness the spectacular Sedona sunset.

Location: Cathedral Rock, one of Sedona's most iconic formations and said to be the most powerful vortex, is located off Back O' Beyond Road. Parking is nearby and requires a Red Rock Pass which can be purchased for $5 here to cover parking.

Energy: Known for its inflow or feminine energy (energy entering the earth).

Experience: The Cathedral Rock Trail is a short 1.2 mile roundtrip hike and is a bit steep and moderately challenging hike/climb (not for everyone), but the views of the red rock landscape are worth it. The energy is said to help with releasing old emotional wounds, making it a popular spot for meditation and quiet contemplation. The higher you climb, the stronger the vortex energy is believed to become.

Best Time to Visit: One of the most photographed of the vortexes, Cathedral Rock is a great place to start the day and watch the sun come up. There are two parking lots which fill up fast - so get there early. Water and sunscreen are a must.

Location: Boynton Canyon is located to the west of Sedona, off Boynton Pass Road. It's one of the more secluded and lush vortex sites, offering a peaceful escape from the busier locations. Parking is nearby and requires a Red Rock Pass which can be purchased for $5 here to cover parking.

Energy: Known for its balanced energy, combining both the masculine and feminine energy.

Experience: The Boynton Canyon Trail is about 1.1 miles roundtrip and relatively easy. It takes you through a scenic canyon filled with towering red cliffs and lots of views of the surrounding pines, offering a peaceful contrast to the other more exposed vortex sites. Along the trail, you'll pass by Native American ruins, adding to the spiritual and cultural significance of the area. Once you arrive, you will see rock formations that are named ""Kachina Woman"" by the Hopi Tribe. Visitors often meditate here, seeking both reflection and inspiration in the balanced energies of the canyon.

Best Time to Visit: Because of its greenery and temperate weather, morning or late afternoon is most popular.

Location: Bell Rock is located just north of the Village of Oak Creek, along Highway 179. Its bell-shaped formation makes it easy to spot and one of the most visited vortex sites. Parking is nearby and requires a Red Rock Pass which can be purchased for $5 here to cover parking.

Energy: Known for its upflow or masculine energy (energy coming out of the earth). Visitors often report feeling an increased sense of vitality and creativity, as the vortex is believed to stimulate the body's energy flow.

Experience: There are several hiking trails around Bell Rock, from easy paths to more strenuous climbs. The Bell Rock Trail is relatively easy and there are many places to stop along the way and take in the views and feel the energy. The trail is almost a mile and ends midway to the top. It is not advised to go to the top unless you are an experienced hiker.

Best Time to Visit: A popular stop, it is recommended to come in the late afternoon to avoid the crowds and and take in the energizing vibrations.

The allure of Sedona's energy and stunning landscapes has not only attracted tourists but also drawn the attention of major brands looking to use it as a backdrop for their activations. In 2019, H&M chose Sedona's breathtaking scenery to unveil its Spring/Summer collection, hosting a three-day ""theater experience"" where models and influencers showcased the new line against the dramatic red rock landscape with lavish dinners, performances, and tours.

Recently, General Motors' Chevrolet division chose Sedona as the backdrop to showcase their new Equinox EV. Influencers were given the chance to experience the vehicle firsthand by driving it from Phoenix Airport to Sedona. The timing of the activation, coinciding with the Summer to Fall Equinox, was no accident, as it held symbolic significance for the event. This brand activation was layered with meaning, aligning both the vehicle and the location with themes of transition and new beginnings. The packed two-day itinerary treated guests to a seated dinner, a stargazing experience with a local astrologer, yoga by the creek, and time at the spa.

""We used the meaning of the autumnal equinox to shape the weekend in Sedona with the Equinox EV. We wanted everyone to experience the range and capability of the Equinox EV, but also lean in to balance, wellness and harmony.""

Companies are drawn to Sedona's dramatic red rock formations and serene atmosphere, using the location to create unique and memorable experiences. Whether it's fashion brands unveiling new collections or automotive giants showcasing their latest innovations, Sedona's natural beauty provides the perfect setting to enhance the impact of these events and allow influencers to create the perfect Instagram moment as well as have an authentic connection to the brand outside the showroom.

Celebrities have long sought out Sedona as a sanctuary to reconnect with nature and explore their spiritual side. With its extraordinary landscapes and mystical energy, Sedona has become a favored retreat for stars looking to escape the demands of fame. Lily Collins, Oprah Winfrey, and Justin and Hailey Bieber are just a few who have found the red rock oasis to be transformative, offering peace and clarity. For many, Sedona's energy vortexes, stunning hiking trails, and tranquil atmosphere provide a much-needed escape, allowing them to recharge both mentally and spiritually, making it a truly healing experience for the soul.

The only way I can describe Sedona is that it is nature's ultimate spa -- where the landscape itself offers rejuvenation. It bathes both your body and soul in its ancient, powerful energy, a force that has shaped the land for millions of years, long before humanity ever set foot here. I couldn't help feel like a fleeting moment in the grand timeline of this mystical place and was reminded that, like the sand beneath my feet and the stars in the sky above, we are just a small part of a much larger universe."
"Meta's Ray-Ban Smart Glasses Used To Instantly Dox Strangers In Public, Thanks To AI And Facial Recognition",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnkoetsier/2024/10/03/metas-ray-ban-smart-glasses-used-to-instantly-dox-strangers-in-public-thanks-to-ai-and-facial-recognition/,2024-10-03T13:12:44Z,"Two students at Harvard University have hooked Meta's Ray-Ban smart glasses up to a facial recognition system that instantly identifies strangers in public, finds their personal information and can be used to approach them and gain their trust. They call it I-XRAY, and have demonstrated its concerning power to get phone numbers, addresses, and even social security numbers in live tests.

""We stream the video from the glasses straight to Instagram and have a computer program monitor the stream,"" AnhPhy Nguyen says in a demo video on X. ""We use AI to detect when we're looking at someone's face, then we scour the internet to find more pictures of that person. Finally, we use data sources like online articles and voter registration databases to figure out their name, phone number, home address, and relatives names.""

Nguyen and fellow Harvard student Caine Ardayfio then stream that information to an app on their phones.

""Using our glasses, we were able to identify dozens of people including Harvard students, without them ever knowing,"" says Ardayfio.

The system is perfect for scammers, because it detects information about people that strangers would have no ordinary means of knowing, like their work and volunteer affiliations, that the students then used to engage subjects in conversation.

In the wrong hands, this could very easily lead to dangerous or compromising situations: imagine a sexual predator who gains the trust of a target by appearing to know them and claiming to have met them at an event in the past. Most of us have fairly hazy memories of years-ago events, so if someone claims to have met us, knows our name, and a few facts about us, we're likely to believe them and engage with them, offering them at least a little bit of trust.

That's exactly what the two Harvard students did with a woman affiliated with the Cambridge Community Foundation, saying that they met there. The woman buys it, engages, and shakes Ardayfio's hand. They also approach a man working for minority rights in India and gain his trust, and tell a girl they meet on campus her actual home address. For another woman, they guess her parents' names, and get them right.

The technology needed is fairly trivial and easily available:

Naturally, since this was just a demo of system capability, nothing further happened. But the potential for abuse is obvious.

""Are we ready for a world where our data is exposed at a glance?"" asks Nguyen.

Clearly, the answer is no: we typically have an expectation of anonymity in public places and crowds that is no longer warranted. If two students can hack together a doxxing technology this powerful in their spare time, what can national governments or even large corporations do?

""Initially started as a side project, I-XRAY quickly highlighted significant privacy concerns,"" the two students say. ""The purpose of building this tool is not for misuse, and we are not releasing it.""

Privacy in public is probably dead, but the students have some suggestions to restore at least some of it:

Realistically, that might protect you from two Harvard students who hacked together a solution. But it's probably not going to do much against large organizations or nations that have a strong interest in knowing far too much about each one of us in public."
Sasha Cohen On Why U.S. Women Skaters Have Not Medaled  Since 2006,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jimclash/2024/10/02/sasha-cohen-on-why-us-women-skaters-have-not-medaled--since-2006/,2024-10-02T20:00:04Z,"It's been nearly two decades since an American ladies individual figure skater has stood on the Olympic podium. Given America's past dominance in skating, why? We asked Sasha Cohen.

Believe it or not, it's been 18 long years since an American individual ladies figure skater has stood on the Olympic podium. The last was Sasha Cohen, at the Torino Winter Olympics in 2006, where she won the silver medal. Given America's prior dominance in ladies figure skating - Peggy Fleming, Dorothy Hamill, Kristi Yamaguchi, Tara Lipinski, Sarah Hughes, Nancy Kerrigan and Michelle Kwan, to name a few - the omission is hard to understand.

Cohen is about to turn 40 this month. A graduate of Columbia University with a BA in general studies, and working now for a major investment house with two young children - Dash and Paloma - she maintains a very different lifestyle from her intense athletic regimen two decades ago. We thought it would be interesting to drop in on her to get some perspective on her current life, and on the American ladies figure skating program in general. Following are edited excerpts from a longer conversation.

Jim Clash: You are the last individual American ladies skater to stand on the Olympic podium, and that was way back in 2006. Surprising?

Sasha Cohen: It's definitely surprising. Things change, training programs change and different countries tend to dominate at different periods of time. The U.S. still has amazing talent, excelling tremendously in dance and men's single skating but, as you say, we haven't been able to put a woman on the podium since 2006. It's sad as a former athlete and someone who roots for the U.S. I don't really have the answers.

Clash: It seems to me, as a layman, that the judging has become more about jumps, and less about style. Is that a fair assessment?

Cohen: You're not wrong. The sport has definitely shifted towards rewarding higher technical difficulty and certain types of moves, certainly quadruple jumps. Because of that, skaters don't have time to develop their choreography in a way that highlights their personalities and artistry. They have to pack in all kinds of technical things from the beginning to the end of their programs because that's what's reflected in the scores, which ultimately determines whether they are on the podium.

In the U.S. heyday, the whole package was considered, and the women had a chance to develop into mature figure skaters. It wasn't just about jumps, it was also the artistry on the ice that made it so much fun and dynamic to watch.

Clash: When you competed, how did you balance the attention that comes with fame - the autographs, photos and interviews - with the things you had to focus on - ie, the business of skating?

Cohen: It's helpful to have a coach or team leader that can be the one who says, ""No more autographs, let her focus."" Then you don't have to be the bad guy [laughs]. But it's hard because you see these people who've been following your career, and they finally have this chance to get an autograph.

When you're touring, the stakes are much lower, and it's really nice to have that one-on-one moment with someone who has been watching you since you were a young kid. What we do out there is not in a vacuum. It's not just a race, it's a performance to music with an emotional component. So it means a lot more to the audience and fans. It's a very dynamic experience.

Clash: Let's go back to the Salt Lake City Olympics in 2002. Didn't President George Bush sit next to you during opening ceremonies?

Cohen: After the ceremonial lap, all of the different countries began to take their respective spots on the benches to watch the opening ceremonies. Within two minutes of sitting down, two Secret Service agents came over, put down this blanket, and started telling people to scoot over. We're all like, ""What's happening?"" They said that the President was going to sit there. I called my mom and said, ""Mom, mom, President Bush is going to sit next to me!"" She laughed and said, ""Oh honey, I'm sure you're mistaken. I don't think so.""

Fifteen minutes later, when the President did sit beside me, I asked him, ""Can you talk to my mom, will you say hi? She doesn't believe that you were going to sit next to me."" He said, ""Sure,"" and actually chatted with her for a minute, minute and a half, saying how much he loved the opening ceremonies and how nice it was to chat with me. My mom later told me that she almost fell off of her chair watching from some restaurant bar in Salt Lake City. That was definitely a fun moment in those Games.

Clash: You're a mom yourself now. How do you balance that with your job and doing things like this interview?

Cohen: You have to do things quickly [laughs]. I go to yoga, and that helps me re-center, have a little peace, because it's pretty hectic the rest of the time. One thing that's really difficult is to meet all of the demands but never being able to fully do anything well. There's a quote I once read about motherhood: ""You can be great at your job, great with your kids, great at this and that, but not all at the same time."" You have to choose. That's hard, but knowing that many other women are in the same spot is comforting. It's a privilege to be a mother and to be involved in the world - a give-and-take, a balance.

But as my kids are getting older, I'm realizing how fast time is passing. It's becoming increasingly important for me to be there to influence them, to play with them, to learn from them. You show up every day and try to be as present as you can, listening to that inner compass which tells you what's really important."

We're not quite at the end yet, however, and so far this has been my favorite season of Slow Horses since the first. Gary Oldman's iconic Jackson Lamb remains the most delightful character on TV, and I think I've realized a bit more about him this season, especially as we learn more about his former boss, David Cartwright (Jonathan Pryce), who's made some dodgy deals with very bad people in the past.

Unraveling that past is difficult thanks to Cartwright's rapidly dilapidating mental state. He's easily confused. The past and the present blend together as his dementia quickly takes hold. Lamb has no love for the old man, but in this latest episode -- as he cruelly makes Cartwright believe that he killed his grandson, River (Jack Lowden) -- you can see his scorn for the old man thaw a little.

It turns out, Cartwright did kill his grandson. It just wasn't River.

The plot so far has focused on a handful of crucial questions. Who is behind the Westacres bombing? Who are these mysterious killers in France and are they connected in some way? Why did they come to kill Cartwright so soon after the attack? Who was River lookalike in the bathroom and why did he look so much like him? Now, at last, we have some answers.

Hugo Weaving's villain, Frank Harkness (no relation to Agatha) is ex-CIA. His diabolical plan, which he put into motion decades ago, was to impregnate various women, banish them from his French manor, and then raise his sons on his own to be killers -- brainwashed from birth, loyal to the death. He raised three sons (that we know of) in this manner. One of them, it turns out, was David Cartwright's daughter's. This would explain the resemblance. Cartwright traded guns and money with Harkness decades earlier in order to get his daughter back to England, though she didn't want to return. Harkness is a masterful manipulator.

The pieces keep falling together. After the bombing, Harkness needed to kill off anyone who could tie him (and his dangerous client) to the attack. Cartwright and Bad Bob Chapman were both ""in the know"" and had to be removed. Only, things went badly for the killers and River was quickly on the scent, faking his own death and hiding his grandfather with Standish (Saskia Reeves).

In this latest episode, River is in the custody of the Dogs, with their new chief Emma Flyte (Ruth Bradley) finally getting a win. River pleads with her to help save his grandfather's life, and she finally relents, sending a picture of Harkness and his sons to MI5 -- to both the analyst, Giti, who's been digging into the mystery of their identities, and to the new First Desk, Claude Whelan (James Callis). This small act puts an end to Whelan and Taverner's (Kristin Scott Thomas) attempts to cover the whole thing up -- a sneaky move to hide MI5's culpability.

Which brings me back to my earlier discussion: This episode helped me form a deeper understanding of Jackson Lamb and what drives his character. Lamb is, by all appearances, a terrible spy who's pretty much let it all go. He drinks. He farts. He hurls abuse at everyone. Between the cigarettes, the booze and the junk food, it's almost a miracle that he hasn't snuffed it yet. As far as anyone can tell, Lamb doesn't care about anything or anyone. Even River calls him a terrible boss. It's all a front, of course, though one he clearly enjoys. Lamb is playing a part, disguising his true cunning under a veneer of filth.

But it's not just cunning that's hiding beneath that whiskey-stained exterior. Lamb, you see, is fundamentally an honest man. This is at the heart of everything he does and, I suspect, everything he did that got him here in the first place. He knows that the powers that be at the Park and in the government will do whatever they can to cover things up, that they have no interest in the truth. This is why he's at Slough House. Not because he's a degenerate or bad at his job, but because he wouldn't play ball. Luckily for him -- and his team -- he's also brilliant, always one step ahead of everyone else, quick on his feet and willing to improvise. And despite all his barbs and mockery, he's fiercely loyal to his team.

This is one reason he's so thrown by David Cartwright's confession. Far from being some dastardly act of espionage and double-dealing, Cartwright made his fateful choice out of love.

But even love has consequences. Harkness tricks Molly -- the surly records room MI5 lady -- and takes her hostage in her home, using threats to force her to help him access MI5 databases and track the location of the Dogs. He's following River's progress to the Park, and sends his last remaining son to intercept them.

We'll refer to this killer as The Terminator from here on out, because Marcus (Kadiff Kirwan) is right: He's basically a T-800, very nearly unkillable. Harkness tells Molly ""Thank you Molly, but you've outlived your usefulness"" and we -- and she -- think she's done for, but just when we think he's going to pull the trigger, as the poor woman braces herself for the end, the door slams and Harkness is gone. His last word before departing: ""I need to send a message."" On the desk, Molly finds a handful of envelopes, each with a name on them. This was not the message we were expecting. What game is Harkness playing at? What message is he sending?

The final scene of the episode is one of its finest and one of the show's most intense action sequences so far. The Terminator drives a dump truck at full speed into a car just in front of the one Flyte and River are in, blocking their path. They try to turn the car around but find themselves blocked by traffic. River is cuffed to the car and there's no time to uncuff him before the killer is stalking toward them. He opens fire killing both agents as Flyte scrambles first to shut the door and then to fire back. She puts up a good fight but The Terminator knocks her unconscious and turns to River, who has been doing his level best to help with one hand cuffed to the car. The killer turns his gun on River and then -- much to our hero's surprise -- shoots the chain instead.

He grabs River, pulls him from the car and turns his gun on him, walking him steadily, with an icy calm, through the line of cars and their terrified drivers, before hijacking one and throwing River in the trunk. As the credits roll, we hear River's laboured breathing. It's an ominous ending to one of the show's very best episodes. A week is a long time to wait after a cliffhanger like this one.

I have one other very big question: Is Frank Harkness River Cartwright's father? If his mother was pregnant when she was taken back to London, this would explain a lot of things. Why she abandoned her son. Why David raised him. Why we've never heard about his dad at all. And why the man in the bathroom looked so much like him -- more than just a half-brother, but a full brother."
Did Tennessee's Impact Plastics Factory Ignore Hurricane Helene Warnings?

""I said 'Can we leave?' And the woman said 'no,'"" Robert Jarvis, one of the employees who survived the storm, told News 5 WCYB. ""About 10 minutes later she came back and said 'y'all can leave.' It was too late. We have one way in, one way out. When they told us we could leave, the one way out was blocked off so we were stuck.""

Parts of eastern Tennessee and western North Carolina were slammed by historic flash flooding after Hurricane Helene hit Florida as a Category 4 hurricane and moved north. North Carolina's governor Roy Cooper said entire communities ""were wiped off the map"" and at least 57 people died in and around Asheville. President Joe Biden will on Wednesday take an aerial tour of the Asheville damage but will not tour on the ground because of the extensive damage to roadways. Most of the city is without power or drinking water. More than 1.2 million people were still without power in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina, North Carolina, Virginia and West Virginia on Wednesday morning, according to PowerOutage.US.

The death toll in North Carolina is expected to rise, Cooper said.

Businesses and historic sites in North Carolina are still discovering how much damage the storm inflicted. The Gilded Age-era Biltmore Estate in Asheville is closed indefinitely as damage to the building and extensive grounds is assessed. The nearby Biltmore Village, a walkable shopping district with stores and restaurants, was inundated after Helene passed through. In the small town of Spruce Pine, two major quartz mines that provide essentially all of the ultra-pure quartz for semiconductor production across the world have shut down and don't know when they'll reopen."
How CMOs Can Work With Influencers And Preserve Brand Safety,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/meganpoinski/2024/10/02/how-cmos-can-work-with-influencers-and-preserve-brand-safety/,2024-10-02T16:26:34Z,"What is human authorship? A decade ago, that was a straightforward and easy question to answer. In the days of generative AI, the definition is becoming much murkier.

Board game designer Jason Allen used AI image generator Midjourney to create an elaborate illustration of women wearing Victorian dresses and space helmets, attending a futuristic looking royal court, writes Forbes' Rashi Shrivastava. The image was not something the AI platform conjured from a simple prompt, though. Allen says he spent more than 100 hours giving it specific information to create the image he wanted. But when Allen tried to copyright the image, the U.S. Copyright Office denied his application because it lacked ""human authorship."" After reconsideration of the application was again rejected by the office, Allen sued the Copyright Office, asking a federal court to decide if it could be copyrighted.

At the heart of this case is a question of what creative, as a noun, truly means. Are the questions and indicators that prompted a computer system creative, or is something creative when only human hands and eyes have directly manipulated it? Midjourney and other AI platforms did not respond to Forbes' requests for comment, but Midjourney's website states that artists own what they create, but it also reserves the right to reproduce,license and distribute works created on the platform.

This lawsuit is also an interesting turnabout for AI companies, many of which are dealing with copyright litigation of their own. Authors, journalists, musicians, photographers and artists have sued big AI companies in the last year, arguing that the AI companies are illegally taking their copyrighted works to train their systems. The input, the creators argue, is all copyrighted.

Whether the output is copyrighted hasn't been discussed much until now. This litigation may not force AI platforms to reckon with that issue, since it only involves the Copyright Office. But it's a reckoning that is coming at some point. Some experts have said that copyright protections of data are the most important thing to regulate: There need to be rules governing who can use what and how, and ensuring that owners of copyrights can be paid.

As more brands use influencer marketing, there are more hazards to brand safety. I talked to Kevin King and Nicholas Spiro, chief revenue officer and chief product officer of the agency Viral Nation, about what CMOs should think about before starting to work with influencers. An excerpt from our conversation is later in this newsletter.

While inflation is finally trending down and the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates last month, these trends aren't fully recognized in consumer prices and wages yet. As a result, consumer confidence continues to weaken, with many Americans saying jobs are ""hard to get."" That attitude extends to what consumers spend. Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger writes that the National Retail Federation saw a 5% drop in back-to-school spending, which was at $39 billion this year. There was a 7% decline in back-to-college spending, which tallied $87 billion. And NRF predicts a 5% decline in Halloween spending -- from $12.2 billion last year to $11.6 billion this year. Census Department retail figures show that non-food-service sales only advanced 1.5% last month. That could be because of the still-high prices. A Bankrate study found that prices are 21.2% more expensive today than in February 2020.

This all puts more pressure on the upcoming holiday season. Predictions for holiday spending are beginning to trickle out, but there are a lot of question marks in the air, including a massive port workers' strike that began Tuesday and has crippled all shipping container cargo on the East Coast.

The NCAA's NIL policy, allowing student athletes to be paid for use of their names, images and likenesses, is extremely complex in practice. These complexities came to the forefront last week when UNLV quarterback Matthew Sluka announced he was leaving the university's undefeated football team because of a $100,000 NIL payment he said he was promised, but never received. Sluka's agent has said the payment was offered to him verbally by an assistant coach. The payment in question would have come from an NIL collective, which is a nonprofit affiliated with a school that pools funds from donors, fans and businesses to pay student athletes for things like appearances.

The issue of payments from NIL collectives is already under legal scrutiny following an NCAA investigation into whether an $8 million payment from a NIL collective affiliated with the University of Tennessee for a high school recruit violated a rule barring NIL deals to attract students to certain schools. Attorneys general from Tennessee and Virginia filed for a temporary restraining order to stop enforcement of the rule, which was granted. Even though there does not seem to be proof of a concrete agreement in Sluka's case, it draws more attention to payments from NIL collectives -- especially because it's been criticized as an apparent state of permanent free agency, something that even professional athletes can't have.

Kate Spade New York has always represented luxury commercial fashion, but its clothing was only for relatively small sizes. The brand had some styles in XXL, but its size chart had a maximum waist circumference of 36 inches, less than the 39-inch waist of the average American woman. A new collaboration with online plus-size fashion brand Eloquii is extending Kate Spade to that market, writes Forbes senior contributor Pamela Danziger. The Kate Spade looks, which are sold online and will be showcased in Kate Spade stores in New York and Los Angeles, have so far been a hit with customers, Eloquii founder and brand lead Julie Carnevale told Danziger. The clothes in this collaboration, which will continue at least through Valentine's Day, are not just larger versions of Kate Spade's main clothing lines, and are custom designed for plus-sized customers, featuring fabrics, patterns and cuts that are popular with Eloquii customers.

As Americans spend more time on social media, brands often want to partner with influencers who can showcase their products -- but it's hard to know if those influencers are 100% the type of people brands want to associate with. Marketing agency Viral Nation has technology that helps determine and maintain brand safety in today's world of social media voices. I talked to the company's Chief Revenue Officer Kevin King and Chief Product Officer Nicholas Spiro about the issue of brand safety. This conversation has been edited for length, continuity and clarity.

What are companies looking for today in terms of brand safety with their influencers?

King: Brands are recognizing they've got blind spots in the way that they approach brand safety. Going back to the rise of social, every brand was monitoring media. They probably had a corporate and public affairs group that was monitoring what the government was doing, but nobody was doing social media monitoring. It was a blind spot in brands' overall safety and reputational approach. Flash forward to today, every brand's starting to realize they've got a huge blind spot in the influencer space. There weren't really tools for influencer monitoring.

No two brands are the same in what their red lines are. They are obviously concerned about political leanings. In some cases, they're concerned about gun usage. In some cases, they're concerned about foul language or drug use. There is definitely a common suite of things that brands are starting to pay attention to in their monitoring.

Spiro: Broadly, we see quasi-low adoption of influencer marketing. Not that many brands have tried it. One of the biggest blockers for CMOs that understand the power is brand safety. They want to know that this is safe before they establish a relationship. Brand safety on the platforms can take a few different aspects, but often it's content adjacency. You don't want an ad to appear next to risky content. It's even more in the influencer space, because that's a true brand partnership. You've actually thought about them as a representative of yours, you've signed some sort of agreement, they're your partner. The escalations you might see are actually even riskier for brands.

Have there been many situations where brands were unpleasantly surprised by something that happened in an influencer partnership?

King: It's settling down a little bit. The influencers that are interested in partnering with brands have gotten much better at being cognizant of the world. They're being more careful on their end in a lot of cases. Overall, the space is getting safer as the influencers are starting to recognize where those guardrails are naturally from watching it.

On the brand side, though, I do see a lot of unpleasant surprises. It's because of that blind spot on influencers. You might look at somebody's Instagram feed from last week and it looks great and you want to partner with them, and you miss that when they were in college, they posted a whole lot of really negative stuff. The speed that surfaces is astonishing. It happens within hours. The social communities will make that connection really darn fast.

Spiro: The years of history [are] only increasing. [The year] 2008 was the hallmark in social media. Let's pretend you're sitting there in 2017. That's only nine years of history. At that point, it would be easier for them to scrub it. The whole memory of social media is going to be so much longer, so this in my mind is an increasing need. I think we'll all come back and think, wow, this was actually just the beginning of this, to the point when entire lifetimes have a social media history, which introduces all sorts of risk vectors.

What advice would you give to a CMO who is struggling with the whole concept of influencers and brand safety?

King: Every brand has a suite of tools that they're leveraging to make intelligent decisions. It's not just specific to brand safety. It's on measurement, their brand score, perception, sentiment, everything else. In a lot of cases, those tools and technologies that companies are using to make those evaluations don't evolve as fast as the social or influencer space is moving. Brands are still using a suite of tools that was maybe relevant some years ago, and hasn't picked up with the speed of change. They've got to really be constantly reevaluating those tools in their arsenal. Some of those tools sit in PR. Some of those tools sit in marketing. Some of those tools sit in HR. Some of those tools are sitting in corporate and public affairs. They're not bringing all those data sets together. If I was a CMO, I'd be cognizant of what are the current suite of tools available to me within my organization, and then where do I have blind spots that I can supplement that with to get a holistic picture?

Spiro: Understand that your reputation is one of your greatest assets, and it can be gone in an instant. I know it can be hard to wrap your mind around because it's not revenue, it's not immediacy, but there's that risk element.

Brands are trying to do it with their thumbs. They're trying to just scroll through a couple feeds, and that's not really feasible without the use of technology. There's a big-level-of-effort play. When you leverage technology, you're replacing a workflow of humans that are doing it worse, covering less, costing you a ton of money, because it's all these people and lawyers trying to somehow understand the background of an influencer.

How Women Can Use Personal Branding To Accelerate Career Success,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamarruda/2024/10/02/how-women-use-personal-branding-for-career-success/,2024-10-02T16:01:56Z,"Building a strong personal brand has become important for all professionals who seek career advancement. For women, it's an absolute necessity. It's a powerful technique for defining their unique value, showcasing skills, and standing out in industries that, in many cases, remain male-dominated. Establishing a strong personal brand allows women to increase their visibility, control their narrative, combat unconscious bias, and open doors to new career opportunities.

McKinsey research confirms that although women represent a significant portion of the workforce, they're still underrepresented in senior leadership positions. Building a personal brand helps bridge this gap by increasing visibility. When women actively manage their reputations, they have greater control over how they're perceived, making it easier for others to recognize their expertise and leadership potential. A strong personal brand showcases a woman's skills, experience, and achievements.

Unconscious bias plays a role in how women are viewed in the workplace, with certain stereotypes influencing perceptions of their capabilities or leadership qualities. A carefully crafted, authentic personal brand allows women to challenge these stereotypes head-on by consistently presenting a clear message about who they are. By influencing external perceptions, women can push past preconceived notions and demonstrate that they belong at the table.

Confidence is a key byproduct of personal branding and a game-changer in career advancement. It empowers women to take ownership of their achievements and advocate for themselves. However, Jennifer Brown, author and Inclusive Leadership reminds us that, ""Many women struggle with imposter syndrome, a phenomenon defined by Dr. Valerie Young of the Imposter Syndrome Institute as the persistent internalized fear of being exposed as a fraud despite evident success."" In a recent interview with Dr. Young, they discussed her research. It shows that 70% of people will experience this at some point in their career, with women, particularly women of color, facing it at higher rates. Brown added, ""When women own their narratives, they're more likely to take on new challenges, speak up in meetings, and seek out opportunities for advancement.""

The first step in building a strong personal brand is defining what makes you unique. What are your strengths? What differentiated skills, experiences, or perspectives do you bring to your work? What values drive your behaviors? Take time to reflect on your professional journey and pinpoint what you excel at and what you're passionate about.

With a clear understanding of your unique promise value, you can communicate that message consistently across online and in-person interactions. Your unique promise of value becomes the core of your brand, helping others understand what makes you relevant and compelling.

Your personal brand exists across various platforms -- LinkedIn, other social media, professional associations, and professional networks. To build a strong brand, consistency is key. It's one of the three all-important Cs of powerful brands. Your messaging, tone, and image need to be cohesive across all platforms. If, for example, you're known for your expertise in project management and leadership, make that evident in your LinkedIn posts, public speaking engagements, and the way you interact with colleagues and senior leaders. This unified branding helps establish a strong and reliable professional identity.

A well-crafted personal brand opens doors to meaningful professional relationships. Networking is an essential part of career growth, and your personal brand helps make networking more strategic and impactful. Whether you're attending industry conferences, delivering powerful online presentations, or simply engaging on social media, your personal brand acts as your introduction before you even speak. Identify opportunities to connect with influencers, thought leaders, and peers. Cultivating these relationships positions you as someone who is well-connected and engaged.

Research from Harvard Business Review found that women are less likely to self-promote than men, even when they are equally qualified. Women often believe that hard work will be acknowledged and rewarded without having to actively tout their achievements. In contrast, men are comfortable with self-promotion. Founder & author of Ladies Get Paid, Claire Wasserman, suggests, ""Everything you share should be about the value you bring someone else, and your personal brand is the way you do that."" To self-promote without seeming boastful, write articles, share industry insights on social media, and speak at conferences to demonstrate your expertise and point of view, and position yourself as a thought leader.

Leading meetings and delivering impactful presentations are powerful ways to build your brand. That's because the people you seek to influence, impact and impress are there, you have valuable expertise or insights to share, and there's an opportunity to build and bolster important relationships. Focus specifically on virtual presentations because they are the most common form today and are the most challenging when it comes to keeping your audience engaged. They provide the best opportunity to stand out and get noticed.

Having the right support and connections will have a big impact on your career mobility. Brown says, ""Women also need to work smarter, not harder, on investing in and unleashing others as amplifiers of their brand. Like so much underrepresented talent, they are not only under-mentored but, importantly, under-sponsored, according to McKinsey and LeanIn's Women in the Workplace 2023 report. Finding and activating a sponsor who can speak to a woman's performance and potential and share their professional capital with her can further her brand exponentially.""

Authenticity is the foundation of successful personal branding and a core component of authentic leadership. Women often feel the pressure to conform to certain corporate or industry norms, but the most compelling personal brands are those that feel real. Don't try to be someone you're not. Instead, embrace your true self -- your values, personality, and professional style, even when that feels hard. Wasserman adds, ""As a way to move through any self-doubt, focus on service promotion and not self-promotion. That fosters trust, which is critical in building long-lasting professional relationships. When you show up as your authentic self, people are more likely to support you, advocate for you, and open doors to new opportunities.""

By defining your unique promise of value and living your brand actively in all that you do, women can leverage personal branding to advance their careers while breaking down barriers."
"Where One Of 2024's Best Horror Movies, Strange Darling, Is Now Streaming",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/10/02/where-one-of-2024s-best-horror-movies-strange-darling-is-now-streaming/,2024-10-02T15:09:29Z,"It is now October, and if you're looking for a great new horror movie to stream, one of 2024's best has now arrived, though you'll have to shell out a bit for it at the moment.

That movie is Strange Darling, the new horror thriller that clocks in at just 96 minutes for a quick watch. But it is one of 2024's best new horror films with a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes from 138 critics. It also boasts an 85% audience score. Here's a synopsis of the film:

""Set in rural Oregon, [Strange Darling] focuses on a man and woman who engage in a one-night stand that devolves into a cat-and-mouse game of murder. It is divided into six narrative chapters arranged in nonlinear order, and presented as a dramatization of the pinnacle of a serial killer's years-long murder spree in the Western United States. The director has neither confirmed nor denied if the film is actually based on real events, saying ""perhaps"" it is.""

The draw here is the somewhat Memento-like mixed-up chapter format which works really well for the narrative, if you can keep up. So where to watch it? Right now you have to buy it rather than rent, but given that it may have been hard to find in theaters near you, this is the first time many will be able to watch it, myself included. Here's the streaming locations:

If you wait a little while the ""rental"" price will probably be $15, before it sinks lower than that eventually. And if you want to wait until it's ""free"" on a service you may own, that's probably going to be at least a solid month, if not more. It's a Miramax film which is owned in part by Paramount, so it may make its way to Paramount Plus, though I don't think that's confirmed.

Strange Darling's score makes it one of the best-reviewed horror films of the year, and the year is almost over. Here's the top 10 list as it stands:

So that's even higher than the likes of higher profile horror films like The Substance and Longlegs, even if it didn't do that level of box office. Maybe it should have with a wider release. But now you can watch it at home."
Collapse Of Reproductive Rights In America On Exhibit In Dallas,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chaddscott/2024/10/02/collapse-of-reproductive-rights-in-america-on-exhibit-in-dallas/,2024-10-02T14:04:32Z,"Artists from around the South brought together to share stories of a national healthcare crisis.

Tens of millions of Americans found themselves asking that question in spring 2022 when news leaked that the Supreme Court would be throwing out 50 years of supposedly settled law and overturning the Roe v. Wade decision guaranteeing women access to abortion nationwide.

Dallas-based curators Emily Edwards and Sara Hignite were among those in disbelief.

Is it Real? Yes It Is! (1969), the title of Juanita McNeely's multi-panel painting depicting her harrowing illegal abortion experience in the permanent collection and presently on view at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.

The feeling and artwork gave name to an unprecedented exhibition from Edwards and Hignite, the first organized and mounted in the American South directly addressing abortion access and reproductive rights. The pair has assembled more than 30 artists, most from or connected to the South-where reproductive rights have suffered their greatest assault-most representing marginalized communities-those most at risk from the politicians' and judges' anti-woman cruelties.

Like 28-year-old Amber Nicole Thurman, a Black woman from Georgia who died during childbirth from a preventable infection after being denied life-saving healthcare by the state's draconian abortion laws. Art curators work their entire lives hoping shows intersect with current events, capturing lighting in a bottle, drawing crowds and media attention. Not in this case.

In the case of ""Is It Real? Contemporary Artists Address Reproductive Freedom,"" it's ""ripped from the headlines"" feel represents tragedy. Ongoing tragedy. Needless tragedy.

""The United States is experiencing a reproductive care emergency across the board, and the worst states are in the South, and that's why this exhibition is based in the South,"" Hignite told Forbes.com. ""That's why we're featuring and focusing on artists who have connections to the southern states. If you look at the numbers, potentially every state in the South has a ban on abortion because you've either got total bans or six-week bans. We're living it every single day.""

""Is it Real"" opens at Lagoon Studio in Dallas (1105 Lagoon Drive, Dallas, TX, 75207) on October 5 and runs through October 26, 2024, nine days before Election Day in America.

The symbolism of debuting the presentation in Dallas-where Roe v. Wade was first argued in 1970 before reaching the Supreme Court in 1973-and in Texas-where dogma and control trump safety for pregnant women-is not lost on the curators.

""Is it Real"" examines strategies contemporary artists employ to address the topic of reproductive freedom. Leading with empathy and fact, and challenging often deeply rooted misinformation, the exhibition seeks to destigmatize and humanize reproductive care.

""By transporting people who are experiencing the show into so many different perspectives, into, quite literally, the shoes of some of the experiences, (visitors) are able to see how multifaceted this reproductive freedom crisis is,"" Edwards told Forbes.com. ""(The artists) help foster empathy by rooting (issues) in emotion and in beauty.""

That's what artists can do. They can't wave a magic wand and change laws, but they can change minds.

""Sarah and I both believe in the soft power of art,"" Edwards added. ""If someone comes in and they want to protest the work, they're likely not leaving being like, 'I'm going to vote blue,' but there's a softening that happens, and I think that's the hope for everyone who comes in here who is either on the fence, isn't sure, maybe is not an activist, maybe is just not informed on these issues. I've seen people soften, including my own parents who do not view this topic the same way I do. They've come to every show, and I see them soften, and I see them care, and I see them ask questions, and those questions turn into people changing their minds over time.""

Minds do change. Ballot initiatives related to abortion access nationwide since the repeal of Roe have overwhelmingly gone in favor of more access.

""I have had conversations with people who have started having conversations with family members and friends or people in their community who didn't believe in the right to abortion and maybe we're moving the needle now as they're hearing about this project,"" Hignite said. ""I don't want to overstate it. Obviously, this exhibition is not changing the landscape of abortion access in the country, but if we can just start cracking the window to the idea of coming around to believing in everyone's right to self-determination and bodily autonomy, then we will be so proud.""

While abortion access draws most of the headlines in the contemporary struggle for reproductive rights in America, it's not the only issue, nor the only issue approached in the exhibition.

""It's about the mortality rate of pregnant women, particularly Black women,"" Edwards said. ""It's about rape and sexual assault. It's about trans men who are also experiencing these experiences, and so having these different stories coming together in the show that really all interwoven to show how widespread this is, how this impacts everyone.""

Maternal mortality is on the rise in America. Black women, Native American and Alaska Native people suffer disproportionately. The South, of course, leads the way. Restrictive abortion policies have always gone hand-in-hand with higher maternal mortality. Not that anywhere in America can brag. America ranks 55 globally for maternal mortality, worst of any developed nation.

Broadly speaking, the U.S. is experiencing a reproductive care emergency. From proposed total bans on abortion-including in the case of rape and incest-to threats against birth control, Plan B, and IVF. Abortion access serves as the flash point for a frightening regression of not only reproductive care in America, a subject always impacting women more gravely, but also a frightening regression in how women are viewed, treated, and respected societally.

In November, 70 million or so Americans will vote for Donald Trump for president. He was found liable for rape. His running mate J.D. Vance has verbalized insulting, denigrating, dehumanizing opinions related to women across a spectrum of subjects over many years that would have been cringe-worthy in the 1960s. Comments that would have immediately disqualified a candidate for local office, let alone national office, just 10 years ago.

""Is It Real?"" exposes the harsh realities of the current political climate and envisions a more just country in which every human has the basic right to control their own body and determine their own future.

That hardly seems radical, but in 2024, in Dallas, in Texas, across the South, it is. An advertising poster for the show featuring a Guerrilla Girls Broadband artwork was banned from Dallas Rapid Transit rail stations.

That's why Edwards and Hignite chose to finance and present their project themselves, not in a museum.

""We didn't have to worry about any of the institutional challenges and bureaucracy,"" Hignite explained. ""We wanted to make sure that we could fully realize our curatorial vision, and we decided early on that the best way to do that was to do it independently.""

They've bootstrapped all the fundraising themselves, every penny, grass roots style. They've been supported by The Goss-Michael Foundation, ACLU of Texas, Texas Abortion Advocacy Network, and more than 100 individual donors. ""Is It Real?"" will also be raising funds for Texas Equal Access Fund and The Afiya Center, two Texas-based mutual aid organizations providing essential support to people needing reproductive care and related services.

Programming will include a film series organized in partnership with Spacy DTX; wellness workshops; panel discussions; Get Out the Vote initiatives; a resource library; and a reflection space organized by Make Art with Purpose. Admission to the exhibition and related programs are free and open to the public.

The collapse of reproductive rights in America and its resulting consequences represent a tragedy. In the face of tragedy and crisis and inequality and barbarity, artists make work. Curators bring that work to the public. The public's role is to vote."
Starting A Side Hustle With An SBA Loan: The Hustlin' Woman's Guide,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/pattieehsaei/2024/10/02/starting-a-side-hustle-with-an-sba-loan-the-hustlin-womans-guide/,2024-10-02T13:01:52Z,"As women, we often juggle multiple roles -- professionals, caretakers, leaders, dreamers -- but somewhere deep down, many of us have a passion or a skill that could grow into something bigger. Whether it's crafting, consulting, baking, or designing, we often dream about turning that hobby into a side hustle. But let's be honest, the biggest hurdle in making that dream a reality is usually funding. And that's where the magic of SBA loans comes in.

Let me tell you, I was once in your shoes, thinking, ""How can I possibly start something on my own without a boatload of cash?"" Then I started working in the SBA business and realized something: you don't need a millionaire's bank account to start your own business. What you do need is an opportunity -- and SBA loans can be just that.

If you're unfamiliar, the Small Business Administration (SBA) is a government agency that helps small businesses and entrepreneurs (that's you!) get access to financing through different loan programs. And before you start panicking, let me assure you, SBA loans are designed to be accessible for people who don't have perfect credit or a huge stack of cash to start with. The SBA itself doesn't directly lend you money, but it works with banks and lenders to guarantee loans in case of a default. This means the bank has less exposure to loss and you have a better shot at getting approved.

For a woman thinking about starting a side hustle, the most relevant type of SBA loan is probably the SBA Microloan. These loans are usually for up to $50,000, and while that may not sound like a fortune, it's more than enough to get a side business off the ground. It can be the perfect way to get that capital infusion without feeling like you're drowning in debt.

Before we dive into how SBA loans work, let's talk about your side hustle idea. Whether it's making eco-friendly candles, starting a fitness coaching business, selling your artwork online, or offering freelance marketing services, the key is to have a clear vision. Don't overthink it. What do you love doing? What are you good at? That's your starting point.

The beauty of a side hustle is that it doesn't need to take over your life. You can still work your 9-to-5 while building something of your own on the side. The goal is to create a source of income that also aligns with your passions. Once know what that is, you're ready to move forward with financing. But understand that the key word is ""income."" You shouldn't turn a passion into a business if you can't monetize it -- that's what we call a hobby.

Now, you might be asking, ""Why an SBA loan? Why not just dip into my savings or max out a credit card?"" Sure, that's an option, but if you've ever dealt with the interest rates on credit cards, you know it's not pretty. SBA loans come with much lower interest rates than most personal loans or credit cards, which means you're not sinking in a sea of debt while trying to make your side hustle float. And while you can use some of your savings for your new side gig, draining your entire savings is not a smart financial decision.

Another great thing about SBA loans is that they have flexible repayment terms, which is important when you're starting something part-time and don't want the pressure of huge monthly payments right off the bat. Whether you need money to buy equipment, invest in materials, or build a website, an SBA loan can give you that cushion to get started.

Alright, so let's say you've got your side hustle idea ready to go and you're feeling inspired to apply for an SBA loan. Now what?

First things first -- you need to get your ducks in a row. The SBA, while helpful, is not a financial institution. Thus, you have to find a bank or an SBA lender to finance your business, and they'll want to see that you've got a plan. Here's what you'll need:

A business plan: This might sound intimidating, but it doesn't have to be. Your business plan should lay out what your side hustle is, who your customers are, how much money you need, and most importantly, how you plan to pay the loan back. Think of it as your roadmap, not just for the bank, but for yourself.

Financial projections: Even if you're just starting, the SBA will want to know how you plan to make money. Include estimated expenses, income, and growth potential. The more prepared you are, the better your chances.

If you have no idea how to do a business plan or financial projections, hire an independent contract from sites like Fiverr who will do the work for you. But make sure they are reputable with great ratings.

Personal credit: While SBA loans are more forgiving than traditional loans, they still take your credit history into account. If your credit score isn't perfect, don't stress -- it's not the only factor, but it's something to be aware of. Also be aware that SBA loans require a personal guarantee from all borrowers.

Collateral: Depending on the loan, you may need to offer collateral, like equipment or other assets if available. But don't worry, microloans often don't require collateral, making them a great option for a new side hustle.

Once you've secured your SBA loan, the fun part begins: building your business! Whether you're using the loan to purchase inventory, rent a workspace, or launch your online store, it's all about taking that first step. Money is a tool to help you grow, but the real success comes from your commitment to making it happen.

One piece of advice: spend wisely. It's tempting to splurge on everything you think you need, but focus on what will give you the best return on investment. If your business relies on marketing, invest in advertising or building a killer website. If it's product-based, use the loan to perfect your offering.

One thing you can't forget about side hustles- they requires time and energy, and it's a long-term game. Some days, you'll feel unstoppable, and other days, you might wonder why you're putting in the extra hours. The key is to stay consistent, keep learning, and remember that you're building something that could one day be your main source of income, or at least a significant contributor.

What's most empowering about using an SBA loan to start a side hustle is the independence it brings. This isn't just about making extra money -- though that's certainly a bonus -- it's about taking control of your financial future and becoming financially independent. You're investing in yourself, and that's something no one can take away. And with SBA backing, you're more likely to secure that loan and be on your way to financial freedom."
Forbes Daily: The Richest Woman In America Makes Largest Known Gift,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/daniellechemtob/2024/10/02/forbes-daily-the-richest-woman-in-america-makes-largest-known-gift/,2024-10-02T12:19:55Z,"This is a published version of the Forbes Daily newsletter, you can sign-up to get Forbes Daily in your inbox here.

Like many, I have watched in horror as countless friends in my former home of North Carolina have been unable to reach their loved ones.

Hurricane Helene wiped out communities and infrastructure in the Southeast, claiming more than 160 lives as one of the 10 deadliest storms in U.S. history, according to USA Today. AccuWeather estimates the damage will range between $95 billion and $110 billion.

It will be a long recovery, and the region is in need of support. To make sure your assistance gets to those who need it, be sure to check the credentials of potential organizations and use caution when donating to individuals to avoid any potential scams.

A few charities accepting Helene-specific donations include: the American Red Cross, World Central Kitchen and Airbnb.org, which helps people find a temporary place to stay.

Alice Walton, America's richest woman, just reported her largest known charitable gift to date, including $249 million to help fund a new medical school in her name in her family's hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. Forbes estimates that Walton, the only daughter of Walmart cofounder Sam Walton, has now given away $1.5 billion in her lifetime, making her one of the 30 biggest lifetime givers nationwide.

Iran fired rockets at Israel Tuesday, the Israeli military said, potentially escalating the war in the Middle East as Iran took responsibility for the attack and warned it is only a ""first wave."" In a statement read on state television, Iran said the attack was retaliation for the killings of multiple Hezbollah leaders, according to the Associated Press.

Aerospace and defense stocks reached all-time highs, a grim market reaction to the latest escalation of tensions in the Middle East, as the Israeli military reported missile strikes from Iran a day after Israeli ground forces entered Lebanon. Defense stocks typically see gains during times of heightened conflict as the companies' revenues rely heavily on U.S. government contracts.

Fred Thiel, the CEO of major bitcoin miner MARA, spoke with Forbes about how it is adapting to the wave of smaller miners gravitating towards artificial intelligence, as well as U.S. politics and the outlook for the crypto mining industry. He says that retail investors give small competitors too much credit for AI plays that will not pay off for years.

Since porn entrepreneur Leonid Radvinsky purchased OnlyFans in 2018, it has gone from being a little-known U.K.-based company to earning $485 million in profits on $1.3 billion in revenue in 2023. Its popularity unleashed a massive payday for Radvinsky, who debuted on this year's Forbes 400 list with an estimated net worth of $3.8 billion.

Microsoft cofounder Bill Gates has long ranked as either the richest or second-richest person on the annual Forbes 400 list, but even with his $107 billion fortune, he dropped to No. 9 this year, down from No. 6 a year ago. A major reason for his fall in the rankings is his 2021 divorce from Melinda French Gates, his wife of 27 years.

Less than 2,500 people live in the small town of Spruce Pine, North Carolina, but it's also home to several rare mines for ultra-pure quartz critical to semiconductor production. Operations have been shut down for more than five days due to impacts from Hurricane Helene, according to the News & Observer, but even when mines can reopen, extensive damage to surrounding roads and rail lines is expected to disrupt global supply chains.

In his latest feud with a government official, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk has taken issue with the Federal Aviation Administration over launch date delays and fines related to alleged SpaceX violations, escalating to direct attacks on agency administrator Michael Whitaker. The dustup could preview how Musk might tackle government efficiency while working in a possible Trump Administration, an idea the former president has floated.

Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz and Sen. J.D. Vance, R-Ohio, faced off in a mostly polite yet policy-heavy vice presidential debate Tuesday night. But one of the more tense moments was a heated back-and-forth related to the false claims Vance spread about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, leading CBS News to cut Vance and Walz's mics.

MORE: Forbes recently looked at how the two candidates compare on assets like real estate, pensions, salaries and more. Vance's earnings from his bestseller Hillbilly Elegy helped him amass an estimated $10 million compared to former public school teacher Walz's wealth of about $1 million.

A massive dockworker strike that began Tuesday comes ahead of the holiday season and as policy makers look to turn the page on inflation, but experts are split on whether it will have a major impact on the economy. The strike could cost the U.S. economy between $3 billion and $4.5 billion daily, according to estimates from Jefferies and JPMorgan, but significant fallout would only occur if the strike lasts more than the ""base case"" of a ""few days,"" Bank of America analysts led by Nathan Gee noted.

TOPLINE Palantir, which builds software to help other businesses gather, manage and analyze their data, at first with secretive government agencies like the CIA and now also with commercial customers, had a banner year.

Palantir took off, with annual revenue increasing more than 20% over the last year to $2.5 billion, and it flipped the switch on profitability -- going from a net loss of $50 million in June 2023 to net income of $400 million a year later. The record year was capped by its addition to the S&P 500 in September.

The company's growth is in part because many of its data software products meshed with the wave of AI hype.

No surprise then that shares are up 134% over the past year, making Palantir the most expensive stock in the S&P in terms of revenue multiples -- more so even than chip design darling Nvidia. Palantir's meteoric rise has earned CEO Alex Karp a spot on The Forbes 400 list of richest Americans for the first time, worth an estimated $3.6 billion, thanks to his Palantir stake and $1 billion or so in cash from stock sales as of September 1, the day we finalized net worths for our list.

But should it be that expensive, trading at a market valuation that's 36 times its annual revenue? Analysts aren't sure: only five of the 20 that cover Palantir give the company a ""buy"" rating, with the remainder split between hold and sell ratings.

D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria drew a parallel between the company and Tesla and CEO Elon Musk, when the EV company was trading at all-time highs in 2021. ""Tesla for a very long period of time traded well above any valuation or comparable metric that you could point to. The reason was people were really excited about the mission and about the prospects.""

WHY IT MATTERS ""The Forbes 400, the definitive ranking of America's richest people, is important because enormous wealth comes with immense power, and the public should know who is doing what with their power,"" says Forbes reporter Phoebe Liu.

""As such, Karp's addition to The Forbes 400 and Palantir's too-high valuation show that what he and his company stand for -- Western values, American defense and artificial intelligence -- are especially relevant in today's economic, cultural and geopolitical landscape. It's worth watching what happens with the ever-controversial, ever-secretive (despite being publicly traded!) firm in the coming months and years.""

LGBTQ+ people who undergo ""conversion therapy"" are more likely to experience poor mental health than those who haven't, a new study found. While scientifically discredited, the practice is still prevalent in some states:

149: The number of participants studied who had experienced conversion therapy aimed at altering their sexual orientation

23: The number of states that ban conversion therapy for minors, including Washington D.C.

1,320: The number of conversion therapy practices across 48 states and Washington, D.C., according to 2023 research from the Trevor Project

A slew of new retirement rules and changes to tax law will affect almost everyone. For instance, starting in 2026, employees 50 and older who are deemed 'high-earning' will only be able to make catch-up contributions to an after-tax Roth account. And if you have money left over in a 529 college savings plan, a law went into effect this year allowing penalty-free rollovers from 529 plans to a Roth IRA.

Where America's Richest People Live: Forbes 400 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicahunter-hart/2024/10/02/where-americas-richest-people-live-forbes-400-2024/,2024-10-02T10:14:02Z,"Almost a quarter of all the wealth on The Forbes 400 is held by residents of one state. Two others tie for second for the first time ever.

alifornia is a symbol of wealth, famous for the luxuries of Hollywood and the riches of Silicon Valley. So it's perhaps no surprise that the world's fifth-largest economy is home to more of the 400 wealthiest people in the U.S. than any other state by far -- and has been for 34 years, since overtaking New York in 1991.

The Golden State is home to 83 members of this year's Forbes 400 list, four fewer than last year and nine fewer than a decade ago, but the state is still home to more than one out of five 400 members. As a group, these Californians are worth around triple the $489 billion the state's 92 members were worth a decade ago. But it's not the only hub for the three-comma club. Ranking behind California are New York and Florida, with 54 list members each, followed by Texas, with 43. Those four states are the most populous in the country, holding a third of all Americans -- but nearly 60% of the richest ones. The combined fortune of their 234 billionaires totals $3.3 trillion.

California's days at the top may be numbered. Florida's rise continues; the Sunshine State has eight more Forbes 400 members this year -- enough to tie the Empire State for the first time. Some of the recent gains are due to folks leaving their higher-tax hometowns for Florida's lower rates, like former Seattle resident Jeff Bezos and onetime Chicagoan Ken Griffin. Five New Yorkers have moved to Florida in the past decade. Those transplants include the state's most famous resident, Donald Trump, who returns to the 400 list this year thanks to Trump Media & Technology Group, the social media company he took public in March. New York, meanwhile, has eight fewer 400 members than last year as the state's richest couldn't keep up. Among the drop-offs: Wesley Edens and Richard LeFrak.

A handful of states have only one Forbes 400 member, including Maine (Susan Alfond), Oregon (Phil Knight) and Kentucky (Tamara Gustavson). Ten states aren't represented at all on the 400, including Alabama, Minnesota and Vermont. It was harder than ever to make the list this year due to a record-high cutoff of $3.3 billion, up from last year's $2.9 billion and eons away from the median American family's net worth of $192,900, per the U.S. Federal Reserve. That was enough to bump Mississippi off the map as its richest residents, James and Thomas Duff, though richer than last year, barely missed the cut with net worths of roughly $3.25 billion each.

Net worths are as of September 1, 2024

Ernest Garcia II, the largest shareholder of online used car sales platform Carvana and Arizona's richest resident, wasn't born in the Grand Canyon State, but his ties there stretch back decades. He attended the University of Arizona and developed real estate in Phoenix in the 1980s (a job that later brought him a criminal fraud conviction, thanks to his small role in the scandal surrounding the collapse of one of his lenders, Lincoln Savings & Loan). Other prominent Arizona listees include U-Haul heir Mark Shoen ($5.2 billion) and Arturo Moreno ($5 billion), who owns the L.A. Angels baseball team in neighboring California.

Fidelity Investments, the Boston-based mutual fund behemoth, is responsible for three members of The Forbes 400: CEO Abigail Johnson, the state's wealthiest resident and America's sixth-richest woman, and her siblings Edward and Elizabeth Johnson. Their family frequently donates to Boston-area charities and to Harvard, where Johnson got an MBA. Other prominent Bay State listees include telecom billionaire and Massachusetts philanthropist Robert Hale Jr. ($5.8 billion) and Robert Kraft ($11.8 billion), who found fortune in paper and packaging, and fame as the owner of the NFL's New England Patriots.

S. Truett Cathy (d. 2014) founded Chick-fil-A in an Atlanta area mall in 1967; it's now spread to 48 states and his three children are Georgia's richest residents. The Peach State is also home to Atlanta Falcons owner Arthur Blank ($8.9 billion), private equity mogul and 400 newcomer Neal Aronson ($4.1 billion) and two more notable heirs: Gary Rollins ($6.8 billion), who chairs the pest control company his family founded in 1948, Rollins, Inc.; and Jim Kennedy ($6.6 billion), who chairs the media and automotive conglomerate his grandfather founded in 1898, Cox Enterprises.

The Silver State's highest roller hails, fittingly, from the Las Vegas Strip: Miriam Adelson, whose fortune comes from the Las Vegas Sands casino company that her late husband founded in 1988. Two other Nevada listees who hail from the gaming industry are brothers Lorenzo and Frank Fertitta, the UFC cofounders who also inherited their father's casino business Red Rock Resorts in 1993 and took it public in 2016. The state also boasts fortunes in sectors like aerospace-defense (Sierra Nevada Corp.'s Eren and Fatih Ozmen, $4 billion and $3.8 billion, respectively) and fast food (Panda Express' Andrew and Peggy Cherng, $3.7 billion each).

The richest Pennsylvanians are together worth $126 billion, roughly equal to the Keystone State's total annual government spending. Wealthiest resident Jeff Yass cofounded trading firm Susquehanna International Group, headquartered on the Main Line. It owns an estimated 15% of TikTok parent company ByteDance. Yass is a Republican megadonor who often opens his wallet for state and local elections, everything from county judicial races to Philly's city council election. His Susquehanna cofounder Arthur Dantchik ($12.3 billion) is also a Pennsylvania resident on The Forbes 400 list, as is Victoria Mars ($11.9 billion), heir to the Mars candy and pet food empire, and Jeffrey Lurie ($5.3 billion), owner of the NFL's Philadelphia Eagles.

Chicago is home to the youngest member of The Forbes 400, Lukas Walton, who is one of the eight grandchildren of Walmart cofounder Sam Walton. Aged 38, he's one of two listees under 40 (the other being New York-based venture capitalist Josh Kushner). Several list members from the Hyatt hotel brand's Pritzker family are also breezing around the Windy City, including J.B. Pritzker ($3.7 billion), the state's billionaire governor. Others in Illinois made their riches through industries like meat processing (Steve Lavin, $5.4 billion, and Joseph Grendys, $4.2 billion) and finance (Byron Trott, $3.7 billion, and Mark Walter, $6 billion).

Musk -- the richest person in the U.S. for the third year in a row -- is all-in on the Lone Star State, announcing this year that he's moving his companies SpaceX and X there from California. Texas is increasingly seen as a swing state, but Musk made his own political allegiances clear in July when he endorsed Donald Trump for president in a post on X. Texas produces more oil and natural gas than any other state, so perhaps unsurprisingly, nearly a third of its listees made their fortunes in energy, including Randa Duncan Williams ($8.6 billion; Enterprise Products Partners) and Kelcy Warren ($6.7 billion; Energy Transfer).

The Sunshine State keeps attracting big wealth. When Bezos recently relocated from Washington state, he spent $234 million on three homes on Indian Creek, the gated man-made island in Miami Beach dubbed the ""Billionaire Bunker."" Nearly 30% of Florida's listees made their fortunes in finance and investments, including the second-richest Floridian, Ken Griffin ($43 billion), who made headlines in 2022 for moving his family and the headquarters of his hedge fund Citadel there from Chicago. The second-most common industry that enriched the wealthiest Floridians is food and beverage, from which hails Subway's Elisabeth DeLuca ($8.6 billion) and LaCroix sparkling water's Nick Caporella ($4.1 billion).

The world's financial capital is still a finance billionaire hub. Nearly two-thirds of the Empire State's listees made their fortunes in the sector, including Michael Bloomberg, the former NYC mayor who started his career on Wall Street in 1966 at the investment bank Salomon Brothers, then made billions through financial information and media company Bloomberg LP. The state's second-richest resident, Julia Koch ($74.2 billion), is originally from Iowa and owes her fortune to Kansas-based conglomerate Koch, Inc., but has lived in the Big Apple for four decades. In June, she and her children bought a 15% stake in the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and WNBA's New York Liberty for nearly $700 million. Other notable New Yorkers on The Forbes 400 include George Soros ($7.2 billion), Ralph Lauren ($9.4 billion) and Bill Ackman ($9.1 billion).

Hollywood and Silicon Valley have made many Californians rich, but none more than Mark Zuckerberg, who officially resides in Palo Alto, though these days spends plenty of time at his 1,450-acre compound in Kauai, Hawaii. Nearly half of California's Forbes 400 wealth stems from tech moguls like Zuckerberg, including Google's Larry Page and Sergey Brin ($136 billion and $130 billion, respectively), Nvidia's Jensen Huang ($104 billion) and Broadcom's Henry Samueli ($16.9 billion). But entertainment moguls like David Geffen ($8.5 billion) and Steven Spielberg ($5.3 billion) also call the Golden State home, as do real estate barons such as Donald Bren ($18.9 billion) and Edward Roski Jr ($7.8 billion), and private equity moguls like KKR cofounder George Roberts ($15.5 billion) and Jim Coulter ($4.9 billion)."
Wife Of Chinese AI Giant SenseTime's Late Cofounder Becomes A Billionaire,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/zinnialee/2024/10/02/wife-of-chinese-ai-giant-sensetimes-late-cofounder-becomes-a-billionaire/,2024-10-02T09:36:48Z,"Yang Qiumei, 59, a managing director and advisor to the CEO at the Hong Kong stock exchange, inherited a $1.6 billion stake in SenseTime from Tang Xiao'ou.

Yang Qiumei, the widow of SenseTime cofounder Tang Xiao'ou, has inherited his stake in the Chinese artificial intelligence giant, according to a stock exchange filing. The stake is worth $1.6 billion as of Wednesday's close, Forbes estimates, and propels Yang, 59, to become the latest woman to join Hong Kong's three-comma club.

Yang inherited an almost 20% ownership in SenseTime through Amind, the personal holding company of her late husband and the largest shareholder of SenseTime, according to a Hong Kong stock exchange filing in August. Tang died in December at age 55 from an unspecified illness. He was survived by Yang and their son.

At the time of his death, Tang had an estimated net worth of $1.1 billion. He debuted on the Hong Kong's 50 Richest list in 2022, a few months after SenseTime went public in a $740 million initial public offering in Hong Kong in December 2021.

Tang cofounded SenseTime in 2014 and grew it into one of the largest Chinese AI software company from a base in Hong Kong, providing technologies for applications ranging from facial recognition, content generation to autonomous driving.

Yang doesn't hold any position at SenseTime. She is currently a managing director and advisor to the CEO at Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing since joining the stock exchange operator in 2022, overseeing its mainland China subsidiaries and activities of its highest-ranking executive. She was most recently the Asia Pacific CEO of Investment Company Institute, an industry association of investment funds, and had previously served as the deputy director general of the China Securities Regulatory Commission's investment fund supervision department. SenseTime didn't immediately respond to a comment request on Yang's fortune.

Coming from a humble background, Yang had to collect cinders to support her family when she was young, according to an interview she gave to state-backed financial publication China Fund in 2014. She eventually earned herself a place at China's Peking University, where she received bachelor's and master's degrees in economics, and went on to earn a Ph.D. from the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign in the U.S.

After graduation, Yang spent a brief time teaching in Latvia before joining the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) in Paris, according to the China Fund article. Yang returned to China in 2000 to join the China Securities Regulatory Commission, and started her journey in the finance world.

Over the past year, SenseTime's shares on the Hong Kong stock exchange surged more than 35% as the company became one of China's brightest hopes for its plan to take the lead in the AI field. After joining Chinese tech giants like Baidu in the AI race last year, SenseTime in July launched an upgraded large language model that it claims to be on par with OpenAI's most recent GPT-4o model in multiple capacities.

Mics Cut As Candidates Spar Over Springfield -- Ohio City Facing False Pet-Eating Claims,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/saradorn/2024/10/01/mics-cut-as-candidates-spar-over-springfield-ohio-city-facing-false-pet-eating-claims/,2024-10-02T02:14:21Z,"A heated back-and-forth in Tuesday's vice presidential debate related to the false claims Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio, spread about Haitian migrants eating pets in Springfield, Ohio, led CBS News to cut Vance and Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz's mics in one of the more tense moments from Tuesday's face off.

Vance doubled down on his claims, insisting on CNN that constituents reported to his office directly that their pets were being taken and eaten and accusing the media of downplaying the incidents. Vance has acknowledged the incidents might not be true, but has said they're indicative of a broader problem with the Biden administration's immigration policies: ""If I have to create stories so that the American media actually pays attention to the suffering of the American people, then that's what I'm going to do,"" Vance said.

Both Springfield Mayor Rob Rue and Ohio Gov. Mike DeWine rejected the claims in interviews in the days after Vance and Trump made the false allegations, which led to a series of threats against city officials and facilities, including a bomb threat that forced city hall to close and schools to evacuate. The bomb threat was one of 33 Springfield received in the weeks after Trump and Vance amplified the false rumors. The claim appeared to originate from a post in a Springfield Facebook group, according to the Springfield News-Sun, which reported that some viral posts in the Facebook group erroneously linked Springfield to an incident in August in Canton, Ohio, in which a woman was arrested and charged with killing and eating a cat.

A Haitian advocacy group, the Haitian Bridge Alliance, filed private criminal charges last month against Trump and Vance, asking a judge to order their arrest for allegedly disrupting public services and making false alarms for repeating the claims.

What Happened To Vicky And Casey White? The Crazy True Story Behind Netflix's 'Jailbreak',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/monicamercuri/2024/10/01/what-happened-to-vicky-and-casey-white-the-crazy-true-story-behind-netflixs-jailbreak/,2024-10-01T21:36:23Z,"Netflix's true-crime documentary Jailbreak: Love On The Run is now the platform's No. 1 film in the US. It recounts the real-life story of a corrections officer who fell for a convicted murderer and helped him escape, sparking a nationwide manhunt. What happened to Vicky and Casey White, and where are they now?

Directed by Dan Abrams and executive produced by Rachel Stockman, Jailbreak: Love on the Run revisits the shocking true events of 2022, when Vicky White, assistant director of operations at the Lauderdale County Detention Center in Florence, Alabama, fell in love with an inmate awaiting trial for murder and aided in his escape.

The inmate, Casey White, was a convicted felon when he was transferred to the Lauderdale County Detention Center in August 2020. He was already serving a 75-year sentence for a 2015 crime spree that included shooting a woman during an attempted carjacking and killing his ex-girlfriend's dog, among other offenses.

Before his escape, White was awaiting trial for the unrelated 2015 murder of Connie Ridgeway, a crime he confessed to before being sent to the Alabama detention center, where he met Vicky.

""Casey White was described as a 'romancer' by one of his former cellmates, and those who worked at the jail said he was a polite, even charming, prisoner,"" Stockman told Netflix's Tudum. Vicky, remembered by inmates in the documentary as compassionate and caring, was a victim in Casey's scheme.

""Vicky, who was used to doing things for others, fell for Casey's manipulation, especially when he claimed he was being framed for a murder he didn't commit. He made her believe in him,"" Stockman continued.

However, inmates at the detention center began to suspect a relationship between Vicky and Casey when they observed him giving her cards to mail that didn't have addresses on the envelopes.

Vicky White had reportedly been planning her and Casey White's escape for some time. Leading up to the escape, she announced plans to retire and sold her home for a price well below market value. The home was sold for $95,550, documents obtained by CNN show, while online records with Lauderdale County list the home's total parcel value at $235,600.

Vicky also recently wiped out her checking account and had a secret phone number, which had been in contact with Casey more than 1,000 times over two years. Lauderdale County Sheriff Rick Singleton said that Casey and Vicky had a ""special relationship"" that was confirmed by other inmates who told investigators that Casey White ""was getting extra food on his trays"" and ""was getting privileges no one else got. And this was all coming from her,"" per CNN.

On her last day at the job, April 29, 2022, Vicky told her fellow officers at her retirement party that she was bringing Casey to the Florence courthouse for a mental health evaluation. She left with Casey for the courthouse, but the two never returned, raising concerns.

According to Today.com, Vicky was tasked with arranging transports at the prison. ""She used her position, and I think she coordinated her transports, to ensure there were no transport deputies there,"" Singleton told NBC News.

Amid their escape, Vicky White abandoned her patrol car at a shopping center in Alabama and hopped in a Ford. The Ford was later found about two hours north in Williamson County, Tennessee after the officers received a tip, NBC News reported at the time.

A few days later, authorities traced the couple north in Indiana, where they received another tip that a Ford F-150 pickup had been spotted at a car wash in Evansville, Indiana. Surveillance footage shown in the documentary confirmed that the man seen next to the vehicle was Casey.

Vicky and Casey White evaded police for nearly two weeks, leading to an 11-day manhunt. Authorities finally tracked them down after spotting a gray Cadillac parked outside a Motel 6.

When the couple left the hotel, police pursued them, resulting in a high-speed chase that ended when their car crashed into a ditch. Casey was taken into custody immediately, while Vicky suffered a head injury and needed to be taken to the hospital.

Casey reportedly surrendered to U.S. Marshals after the crash, telling them: ""Please help my wife. She just shot herself in the head, and I didn't do it,"" according to NBC News. However, Vanderburgh County Sheriff Dave Wedding said the two were not married. Multiple wigs and about $29,000 in cash were also recovered from the crashed vehicle.

Vicky White was transported to the hospital with a head wound, and authorities said at the time that they believed she might have taken her own life. Vanderburgh County Coroner Steve Locklear confirmed that Vicky died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound, Newsweek reported at the time.

After his escape and capture, Casey White was sentenced to life in prison in June 2023 after pleading guilty to the escape. He is serving his life sentence at the William E. Donaldson Correctional Facility in Bessemer, Alabama, according to his inmate record from the Alabama Dept. of Corrections.

""We just wanted a new life together because she knew the truth. I can handle the truth because I know who I am,"" White said in the courtroom at his sentencing, according to NBC News. ""I chose this road. It's cost me my life and freedom.""

White pleaded guilty to escape in exchange for prosecutors dropping a felony murder charge involving Vicky White's death. He also agreed to the maximum sentence of life without parole.

Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett Implores Women To Own Their Political Power,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lydiatblanco/2024/10/01/congresswoman-jasmine-crockett-implores-women-to-own-their-political-power/,2024-10-01T20:33:44Z,"Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett (D-TX) is known for many things. Among them are her political fervor, organizing to protect the rights of marginalized people, and educating the masses on how politics impacts them on the local and national levels.

Congresswoman Crockett began her journey as a public defender and civil rights attorney. Now, she is the sole Black freshman and youngest Black lawmaker in Texas during the 87th Legislative Session.

Committed to public service, she represents portions of Dallas and Tarrant Counties. This includes the cities of Dallas, Grand Prairie, DeSoto, Cedar Hill, Lancaster, Duncanville, Glenn Heights, Hutchins, Wilmer, Arlington, Ovilla, and Seagoville.

As the United States braces for the 2024 presidential elect in November, Congresswoman Crockett has made it part of her duty to take centerstage across America to educate people and implore them to become politically engaged, daily.

Forbes spoke with Congresswoman Crockett in Atlanta, Georgia, as she prepared to be in conversation about the state of Black America and politics at REVOLT WORLD to discuss the significance of voting rights and the political climate.

Lydia T. Blanco: There is a lot of political pressure on everyone in the United States right now, but we know that Black women carry so much of that weight. There are women like you, Oprah Winfrey, and the Jotaka Eaddy's of the world organizing and raising money to ensure that the Black vote matters in November. How can Black women position themselves politically to win and move forward in life come the November election, and beyond?

Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett: One of the things that I get frustrated about is that we wait, and we do everything once the elections are upon us. Election day will come, but the work continues.

That's the attitude we must have when we look at all the rights we've lost. We (women) didn't lose them overnight. Especially when they went after our reproductive access. That was a 50-year fight that they waged. We have to be just as bullish about making sure that we are getting our seats at the table.

Congresswomen Crockett: If there is something that you aspire to be, then go and find someone who is in that space and ask them to mentor you. The worst they can say is no. If you don't ask, you definitely won't receive.

It's important to stay engaged. We need to show up at these school boards as they try to ensure that our history is written out of our children's education We need to make sure that we're showing up at the city council as we have rogue police departments that are going out and killing us and our children.

We need to make sure that we show up before there's a problem and that we show up consistently.

My charge to everybody is not to think that the fight is over once November 5 comes and goes. Stay engaged and demand your space at the table. We are always the most qualified in the room, and half the time, they want to try to act as if we should never have been there in the first place.

I think this is going to be a great opportunity for Black women. I want women to be proud, courageous, stand up for themselves, and demand that they do incredible things.

Blanco: There's an ongoing conversation about diversity, equity, and inclusion. You're often leading it. What is your call to action for White women as allies and civically responsible people?

Congresswoman Crockett: If you know anything about your history, you and I know very well as members of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority, Incorporated, that in 1913, when they went through the Suffrage Movement, Black women were not included in the number. But Black women stood firmly by White women in the fight.

We must understand, stop the divisiveness, and realize that their fight is also ours. And so long as we take on that particular attitude, we all will come up.

We know that there's a wage gap that exists whether you're a Black woman, an Asian woman, or a White woman. We know that the wage gap between women and men exists. So, we need to coalesce around one another.

One of the reasons I've been so proud of some of the women in Texas is because White women said they understand their privilege. That is why we decided we would go into court and make sure that we would start these court cases around abortion access. We know that some won't be able to do it.

So, I'm going to say and charge White women with understanding their privilege and making sure that they're looking out for the entire village of us. Just like we are always there to lift you up, even back in 1913, to make sure that you all had access to the ballot box.

Congresswoman Crockett: I'm not, but come November 6, I'm going somewhere people don't know what a politic is!"
How To Spend Two Nights With Two Teenagers In Venice,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanneobriencoffey/2024/10/01/how-to-spend-two-nights-in-venice-with-two-teenagers/,2024-10-01T18:28:40Z,"The 16-year-old learned an important lesson about overpacking when we stepped off the boat in Venice. According to Google maps, the walk from the dock to our hotel was just 15 minutes. But what Google maps does not tell you is that walk is primarily up and down bridges. While we were there for the canals that serve as streets in this spectacular city, we hadn't thought through what that means from a practical standpoint.

Turns out that meant dragging a suitcase up and over four bridges in 90-degree heat to get to our hotel. And as our daughter gamely bumped her stuffed suitcase up each set of stairs, then down the other side, she rethought some of her choices. And by the time she pulled her suitcase into the lobby of the NH Collection Venezia Grand Hotel Palazzo dei Dogi, her excitement over arriving in Venice had evaporated.

Traveling with teenagers is a joy - and a challenge. While you can track down multitudes of articles about travel with kids, the teen years are very much overlooked. True, the days of screaming tantrums, limited diets and afternoon naps were behind us, but with a 14-year-old and a 16-year-old, enforced togetherness can wear thin. And just try telling a teenager how to pack for a trip.

Luckily, our home for the next 48 hours was dripping with Venetian charm. The lobby was blessedly cool and regal, with massive Murano glass chandeliers, tapestries, and inlaid marble flooring. Built in the 17th century, but with a top-to-bottom renovation last year, it blends the old and new in an ideal fashion. For example, the beamed ceiling of our room was elaborately stenciled by hand, but the king-size bed was pure modern luxury.

Sitting in the quiet residential quarter of Sestiere Cannaregio, the hotel is about as far from the tourist-choked Piazza San Marco as one can get in the city -- about 30 minutes walking at a leisurely pace. The hotel has a complimentary daily shuttle to the famous square, but the timing didn't meet our desires for an afternoon siesta, so walking was really the only way to go. Public transportation is limited to water buses (called vaporetto) traveling the Grand Canal, which cuts through the center of the city, and those that circle the city from the exterior in the Venetian Lagoon. Private taxis are very expensive.

Cannaregio is a charming neighborhood for teenagers to wander on their own - bookstores, gelato windows, and canal-side cafes invite exploring. Our walk to the other side of the city only reinforced the delights of that neighborhood. The closer we got to Piazza San Marco, the more crowded the narrow alleyways became and the higher the prices climbed. At the famous Café Florian, right on the piazza, an affogato (vanilla ice cream with a shot of espresso) was 19 euro -- an investment for a family of four. Near our hotel, the same thing, granted without fancy service, a live orchestra or a view of the famous square, was only 5 euro.

The girls found touring St. Mark's Basilica eye-opening - both for the stunning Byzantine architecture and the oddly enforced dress codes. While men could stroll into the church in shorts, we watched as women with exposed knees or shoulders were routinely turned away at the gate. Fortunately, our family was dressed for the occasion.

Soaring ceilings and religious paintings could only hold their attention for so long, so on the recommendation of the concierge, we headed for the Home of the Human Safety Net, an organization dedicated to supporting people in vulnerable circumstances. The beautifully renovated building -never before open to the public - now houses an interactive exhibition called ""A World of Potential."" Hands-on exhibits encouraged us to concentrate to raise a ball in the air and work together to solve puzzles, while thinking about values like creativity, perseverance, gratitude, and hope. The tech-heavy exhibit was an air-conditioned respite to the kids' history-overload, as well as a chance to learn about people well beyond our daily experience.

After a snack in the exhibit's café, we were fortified to wander our way back to the hotel, stopping by famous bookstore Libreria Acqua Alta to visit the shop cats and climb the moldering tower of books out back. The kids were worn out, but there are few places to sit in Venice - security guards routinely shooed even small children who wanted to sit down in Piazza San Marco, and the city is so packed that there is very little green space. This made the garden at our hotel all the more appealing. Likely the largest intact green space in the city, it stretches from the Palazzo dei Dogi's lobby at the front all the way to the Venice Lagoon in the back, dotted with inviting places to sit in the shade. The garden, once considered to be ""one of the Venetian Singularities to be referred to by foreigners,"" offered a cool, serene escape from the constant motion of travel.

The next day, fortified by the hotel's lavish buffet breakfast, we set out to tick off another bucket list experience: a gondola ride. Gondola stations dot the islands of Venice, and all tours are about 30 minutes for up to five people, but the routes vary depending upon where you board. If spotting tourist attractions from the water is your thing, pick a boat near them or at one of the more famous stations. For a more serene experience, we chose a boat that left not far from our hotel, primarily gliding past quiet neighborhoods while our gondolier spontaneously burst into song. If singing is part of your vision, be sure to ask in advance.

Many of the shops in Venice adhere to the classic siesta, closing for a few hours in the afternoon. So after lunch, we followed suit, spending a few more hours in the garden before heading out again. Wandering the nearby Santa Croce neighborhood, we came across a friendly woman hand-painting masks and earrings -- she even encouraged us to try them on, something that was frowned upon in shops on the other side of the city. We also found a few thrift stores - a self-proclaimed Charity Shop where a grandmotherly woman pulled recommendations from the jumbled racks for us to examine, offering encouragement in Italian. And a carefully curated shop called Vintageria Venezia, packed with hip finds and designer bargains. Meandering the city's tiny alleyways is a time-honored tradition - and we had the modern assurance that if our kids got really lost, they could pull out Google maps on a phone and find their way back to us. They searched for a church basement thrift store they'd heard about, with piles of clothes to sort through, but the hours were limited and they never tracked it down.

That's okay though -- we had dinner plans across the lagoon. For a spectacular perspective on the islands of Venice, we traveled to the island of Giudecca, where you will find the Hilton Molino Stucky Venice in a beautifully restored flour factory. The hotel's restaurant Aromi sits at sea level, with a lovely outdoor terrace that offers a spectacular backdrop for its creative menu. After dinner, we headed up to the hotel's Skyline Bar- the highest rooftop bar in the city, for a thoughtful selection of fancy mocktails (as well as cocktails for the adults). The girls' favorite was a confection called Spiramisu, made with chai tea and mascarpone, topped with a Ladyfinger biscuit.

On our final morning in Venice, after another tour through the Palazzo dei Dogi's teen-pleasing buffet breakfast, we stored our bags and took advantage of the hotel's complimentary water shuttle to Murano, where we watched an octogenarian (who had been working in the island's famous glass-blowing factories since he was 12) magically pull a delicate galloping horse from a ball of blazing glass.

Heading back to the boat that would ferry us back to our car, once again dragging suitcases up-and-down four bridges, we vowed to return to Venice - hopefully next time with less baggage."
America's Richest Woman Donates $250 Million To Fund Medical School In Her Name,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2024/10/01/americas-richest-woman-donates-250-million-to-fund-medical-school-in-her-name/,2024-10-01T17:22:42Z,"Walmart heiress Alice Walton has given away an estimated $1.5 billion to charitable causes during her lifetime.

America's richest woman just reported her largest known charitable gift to date. According to a recently released tax return, Alice Walton's Fort Worth, Texas-based Art Bridges Foundation doled out $390 million during the year ended September 30, 2023, including $249 million to help fund the new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine in her family's hometown of Bentonville, Arkansas. Forbes estimates that the only daughter of Walmart cofounder Sam Walton (d. 1992) has now given away $1.5 billion during her lifetime, making her one of the 30 biggest lifetime givers in the country.

Walton now ranks as America's 26th-most generous philanthropist -- just behind cable TV pioneer Amos Hostetter Jr., who has given away an estimated $1.7 billion to causes including climate change, the arts and education -- though still far behind America's top giver, Warren Buffett.

The Alice L. Walton School of Medicine is currently seeking accreditation to offer a four-year MD program that will ""enhance traditional medical education with the arts, humanities, and whole health principles."" If all goes according to plan, the school will open in 2025 and welcome its inaugural class of 48 students to a 154,000-square-foot facility that is connected by woodland trails to the Waltons' highest-profile philanthropic endeavor to date: the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, which received $30 million from Alice Walton's Art Bridges foundation during 2023.

Alice Walton (estimated net worth: $91.3 billion) chaired Crystal Bridges' board for a decade, before handing the reins to her nephew Tom Walton's wife, Olivia Walton, in 2021. Alice is credited with founding the museum, which sits on 120 acres and features works by the likes of Andy Warhol and Georgia O'Keeffe, after realizing there wasn't anything like it within 300 miles of her family's hometown. But nearly all of the $1.6 billion it cost to open the facility in 2011 came from trusts in the names of her late brother John Walton (d. 2005) and mother Helen Walton (d. 2007).

Alice Walton has ramped up her own philanthropy over the past decade, however, pouring more than $5.7 billion into five family charitable foundations that have so far doled out nearly a quarter of that total. That includes an estimated $380 million gifted through the Walton Family Foundation (which her parents founded on Walmart's 25th anniversary in 1987) to organizations focused on education reform, the environment and the region surrounding Bentonville. It also includes more than $490 million that Alice's Art Bridges Foundation has spent acquiring and loaning out works of American art to more than 230 museums across the country -- including the Art Institute of Chicago, the MoMA in New York City and the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. -- since its founding in 2016.

It's possible that Walton's lifetime giving total should be at least a little higher. That's because she's made $2.3 billion of Walmart stock gifts over the last decade that Forbes was unable to track to their charitable recipients. Some of that stock may have gone to the Waltons' foundations after 2022 (the most recent year for which most of the nonprofits' tax returns are publicly available) -- or directly to operating nonprofits that are already using it to do good. But much of it likely ended up in another type of grantmaking vehicle that is commonly used by billionaires: donor advised funds (DAFs), which aren't required to disclose their contributors or to use their assets for philanthropic purposes within a specified period of time. For these reasons, Forbes excludes dollars flowing through DAFs from billionaires' lifetime giving totals, unless we're able to determine the details of how their money is being spent. (A representative for Walton declined to comment for this story.)

In any case, Walton appears to be just getting started with her personal philanthropy.

""Over the past several years, I've founded new organizations focused on the arts as well as health and well-being,"" Walton said in a press release announcing her retirement as chair of the Crystal Bridges museum in 2021. ""I'd like to focus more fully on my board chair roles at these entities."""
Bill Gates Falls To Lowest Rank On The Forbes 400 In Nearly 25 Years,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kerryadolan/2024/10/01/bill-gates-falls-to-lowest-rank-on-the-forbes-400-in-nearly-25-years/,2024-10-01T17:01:09Z,"The Microsoft cofounder, who long ranked as America's richest person, has dropped in part because of philanthropic giving, but also for another big reason.

or nearly two decades starting in 1990, Bill Gates ranked as either the richest or second richest person on the annual Forbes 400 list of America's wealthiest people.

Not anymore. Though Gates still has a massive fortune of $107 billion, his rank on the new Forbes list has fallen to No. 9 this year, down from No. 6 a year ago. His net worth is also $4 billion less than a year ago-after a year when U.S. stock indices like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq 100 rocketed up by 30%. Among all billionaires globally, Gates now ranks No. 12-the first time he's fallen out of the world's top ten richest people since 1991.

A big reason for the drop: his 2021 divorce from Melinda French Gates, his wife of 27 years.

When Melinda announced in May that she was resigning as co-chair of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation the following month, she also mentioned that she'd be getting an additional $12.5 billion for her philanthropic efforts. She didn't say where the funds were coming from or when she would get them. But Forbes has learned that those funds were not a transfer of Gates Foundation assets. They were coming from Bill. And it appears that he's made the transfer of these funds already.

In addition, Forbes has nearly tripled our previous estimate of the divorce settlement that Melinda French Gates received. Based on new information about Bill Gates' current fortune, we've boosted French Gates' net worth to an estimated $29 billion, up from $10.3 billion a year ago. That makes her the ninth-richest woman in the country, just behind casino heiress Miriam Adelson. Spokespeople for both Gates and French Gates declined to comment on the couple's divorce settlement.

In a wide-ranging discussion at the Forbes 400 Summit on Philanthropy in September 2022, Bill Gates predicted his own decline on the Forbes ranking. Gates said at the time that he planned to keep giving away more of his fortune and continue doing so until he dropped off the Forbes billionaires list. Gates also said there was ""a small chance"" that the former couple wouldn't keep working together while adding that the Gates Foundation would continue to operate for another 25 more years.

French Gates has staked her efforts, through her Pivotal Ventures investing and philanthropic arm, on ""working to get more power into the hands of more people-especially women,"" per its website, which says she's committed $2 billion to expand women's power and influence. In 2022 she created the Pivotal Philanthropies foundation and funded it with $674 million in publicly traded securities. In all likelihood, the foundation will land some of the $12.5 billion she has touted as well.

Now that Melinda no longer co-chairs the Gates Foundation, one question that's come up is whether the foundation will continue her focus on supporting women and families. At a Gates Foundation event about women's economic empowerment in Manhattan last week, CEO Mark Suzman raised that very question. His answer: ""Nothing about our commitment to gender equality is changing,"" he said. ""We have a deep, sustained focus on women's economic empowerment."""
Billie Jean King Serves Another Historical First For Women With Congressional Gold Medal,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/lizelting/2024/10/01/billie-jean-king-serves-another-historical-first-for-women-with-congressional-gold-medal/,2024-10-01T16:49:03Z,"September ended with a historic win for women's sports. As announced in a post made by the US Open's Instagram account last week, Billie Jean King is now the first individual woman athlete to receive the Congressional Gold Medal. This is no small feat -- the Congressional Gold Medal is one of the highest non-military honors presented by the U.S. Congress to those who've made outstanding achievements for American society.

The Congressional Gold Medal has been around since the American Revolution and includes notable recipients such as former NFL player Stephen Gleason, activist Rosa Parks, former president of South Africa Nelson Mandela, the Wright brothers and even George Washington. After President Joe Biden signed the ""Billie Jean King Congressional Gold Medal Act"" legislation into law last Thursday, that list now includes King.

This isn't the first time King has received a high governmental honor. In 2009, President Barack Obama bestowed King with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which is given to those who make significant contributions to U.S. national security, world peace or culture. The fact that King won not one, but two governmental honors in her lifetime isn't surprising. In fact, it's beyond well deserved. As King's Congressional Gold Medal Act cites, her historic defeat against Bobby Riggs, a former number one tennis player who sought to discredit women in sports, forever set the precedent that women can be just as -- and even more -- athletically skilled and competitive as men.

Of course, King went on to be the first tennis player and woman to be named Sports Illustrated's Sportsperson of the Year, but even more crucial is her role in progressing women's rights both on and off the court. King founded the Women's Tennis Association (an organization that is actively increasing funding for women's sports), successfully lobbied for women tennis players to be paid equally to men, and formed an independent women's professional tennis circuit. Moreover, other professional athletes, including former United States women's national soccer team captain Julie Foudy have cited King's advice as pivotal in their own fight for equal pay.

Though arguably her most profound accomplishment is her work to establish Title IX. One of the clauses in Title IX requires educational institutions to equally reward women and men athletes. Research from the International Journal of Physiology, Nutrition and Physical Education has shown that access to collegiate, and subsequently professional sports, has significantly increased because of the foundation of Title IX.

What's more, King's honor couldn't have come at a more momentous time for the business of women's sports. According to ESPN, during the Paris 2024 Olympics, women accounted for 26 gold medals -- the most won by a women's team in a single Olympics. The four most-watched days of the 2024 Games also coincided with the women's gymnastics events raking in around 35.4 million viewers. And it's not just the Olympics. From professional women's soccer to basketball, Nielsen has found that viewership for women's sports is progressively on the rise and according to PwC, 85% of experts forecast double-digit growth for women's sports revenues over the next three to five years.

King's fight for women in sports is far from over. She might be approaching 81 years in age this November, yet King continues to fight for women by investing in women's sports teams and women-founded companies. King and her wife, Ilana Kloss, fund several sports teams and startups through their investment firm Billie Jean King (BJK) Enterprises. Additionally, King continues to collaborate with companies to further inclusivity in Corporate America. For instance, King's campaign with E.L.F Beauty ""serves facts"" about the importance of having women and more diverse candidates on corporate boards.

There's no way around it -- King has made and keeps making history for women's rights in ways that will continue reverberating for generations to come.

New Book 'Hiding Mengele' Brings Unique Brazilian POV To Real-World Nazi Conspiracy,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joshweiss/2024/10/01/betina-anton-brings-brazilian-pov-to-real-world-nazi-conspiracy-with-new-book-hiding-mengele/,2024-10-01T16:40:51Z,"Even at the age of six-years-old, Betina Anton knew something strange was going on when her teacher, a woman lovingly referred to as ""Tante Liselotte,"" abruptly left the school in the middle of the semester, never to be seen again.

""It's one of my earliest memories,"" the award-winning Brazilian author/journalist recalls over Zoom, speaking to me from her home in São Paulo. ""I didn't have the notion it was something with a global impact. I didn't know that at the time, of course, but I knew that something very big happened. I could feel that.""

The year was 1985 and unbeknownst to the young Ms. Anton, authorities had just discovered that beloved ""Aunt Liselotte"" (real name: Liselotte Bossert) and her husband, Wolfram, had played a key role in hiding one of the most sought-after Nazi war criminals of all time; a man who skirted justice for over three decades.

His name? Josef Mengele.

Synonymous with the depravity of the Holocaust, Josef Mengele served as an SS doctor at the notorious Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp, where he sent countless victims to the gas chambers and performed sadistic medical experiments on inmates -- twins being his favorite test subjects. His methods were so cruel and callous, that Mengele earned himself the macabre nickname ""Angel of Death.""

Having escaped Allied capture in the confusion of post-World War II Europe, the unrepentant and racist physician eventually relocated to South America, living there until he drowned off the coast of Brazil in early 1979. Even in death, however, the Nazi remained anonymous, deliberately buried under a false name by Liselotte, who never once imagined the scandal would ever see the light of day. That assumption proved to be unfounded six years later when the truth came to light and Mengele's remains were exhumed for analysis by international experts.

But how, unlike Adolf Eichmann, was the man successful in evading ardent Nazi hunters like Simon Wiesenthal, Beate Klarsfeld, and the agents of Mossad?

That is the core focus of Anton's Hiding Mengele (on sale from Diversion Books today), a tremendous work of non-fiction and, perhaps, the most significant book on the subject to ever come out of Brazil. While Mengele had already been the focus of numerous historical works, a bestselling thriller, and even a mock trial in Jerusalem (ironically held just a handful of months before the Nazi's public exhumation), Anton had not seen an exploration rooted in the very place where the saga came to an end.

""I never read anything from someone in my community talking about this guy who lived very close to me. I wanted to know more,"" explains the author, who grew up in a Lutheran enclave of São Paulo founded by German immigrants at the turn of the 19th century. ""It's my view as an insider who lives in Brazil, who knows the German community, who knows many of the places where Mengele used to go.""

The process of putting the book together took around six years of intense research and interviews all over the world, with Anton tracking down invaluable respondents like Rafi Eitan, a former Mossad operative who took part in the kidnap of Eichmann and was also tasked with finding Mengele (to no avail). ""This is a 90-year-old guy who had lived five lives in one lifetime,"" she says of the ex-spy, who died in 2019. ""He was a Mossad commander, a businessman, a [government] minister, and he was still working. He had a wonderful memory and told me things that I'd never read before ... It was very interesting to talk to someone who really lived history firsthand.""

The Israeli operation to find and bring the Angel of Death in front of a war crimes tribunal was continually stymied by budgetary and geopolitical factors. Despite the fact that he always feared the same fate as Eichmann, Mengele turned out to be one lucky fugitive. The SS doctor's mythical, boogeyman-like status worked in his favor as the hunt intensified and led to many false leads, dead ends, and empty theories. ""They had too many clues and most of them were false,"" Anton says.

His spartan lifestyle, which stood in direct contrast to the public's imagination of Nazis hiding out in South America, also played a factor in his ability to remain a ghost for so long. Where the version of the concentration camp doctor in Ira Levin's The Boys from Brazil enjoyed a lavish lifestyle, the actual Mengele ""was poor, living in the periphery among humble people,"" Anton explains.

Moreover, he was not aided and abetted by the apocryphal Odessa network, but kept afloat by his affluent family and a small chain of ex-Nazis and their sympathizers. Not exactly the far-reaching cabal of Third Reich fanatics often depicted in popular media, but that doesn't mean the secrets and danger surrounding the conspiracy to hide Mengele were no less real. A year into her research, Anton managed to track down Liselotte Bossert (then in her early 90s) in the hopes of getting the full story. Instead, the veteran journalist received a cryptic warning. ""She started saying things you don't ever expect a former teacher to tell you: 'This is a very, very dangerous subject. I think you should research something else.' I was really scared.""

One can only guess why Bossert wanted her off the trail, but thankfully, Anton continued on, disregarding the old woman's vague threats, as well as personal doubts over what the community might think. ""Many people said, 'We are of German descent. Everybody says we are Nazis. Why are you going to reinforce this image?'"" she remembers. ""But [in the end] most people liked it. I'm very relived."""
Dozens Of Female Lamborghini Owners Light Up The Desert This Weekend,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/kristinshaw/2024/10/01/dozens-of-female-lamborghini-owners-light-up-the-desert-this-weekend/,2024-10-01T16:05:29Z,"Supercar builder Lamborghini hosted its first ""She Drives a Lambo"" event exclusively for female owners last fall. Thirty women and their roaring Lamborghini models showed up for the event in Connecticut for a three-day celebration of women who love their Raging Bulls.

This year's She Drives a Lambo event will take place in Sedona, Arizona this weekend in a similar format. A posh hotel, beautiful scenery, and lots of fast supercars are on the schedule, and the event is sold out with others from the wait list hoping for an opening to materialize.

The idea, says Automobili Lamborghini CEO for the Americas Andrea Baldi, is to fortify its woman-owned Lamborghini network. Charming and friendly, the executive understands the assignment and is eager to spread the word.

""In the last year, we have had more women approaching the brand and we felt we needed to find a way for them to bond,"" Baldi told me. ""It's a celebration of women. We want them to be confident and bring the car to the next level.""

Even the event curator is a woman at this high-end event, where attendees will spend three days and two nights steeped in Lamborghini culture. In the past, Baldi recognizes, Lamborghini used to be designed by men and for men.

""Today, our company is made up of a big percentage of women who are in design, engineering, and production,"" he says. ""It's the natural evolution from the heart of the company.""

Last year in Connecticut, Baldi heard his female customers talk about other events where they felt pressure from male clients to go faster and drive harder. By hosting an event for female Lamborghini owners only, the brand hopes to grow their confidence and provide an atmosphere that fosters community, not competition.

""I think sometimes [Lamborghini can be] a little intimidating, and that's applicable to all sportscar manufacturers,"" Baldi asserts. ""We are trying to make sure women know they are important to us and they count for our future. We want to have more and more opportunities to learn from women about the direction we need to take. We want them to know we are not a brand polarized around men.""

Introducing the Urus SUV was a huge move for the Raging Bull and became a key entry point for women. Today, Lamborghini is seeing interest from more women than ever before.

At the 2023 She Drives a Lambo meetup, the drivers and their guests had a chance to experience the Huracán STO, Huracán Tecnica, and Urus Performante, which may have whet their appetites for a second or replacement model.

This year's guest star is the new Revuelto, a fantastic track-ready hybrid that replaces the legendary Aventador. Boasting a 6.5-liter V-12 and a trio of electric motors for 1,001 horsepower, the Revuelto is a thrill ride; more than one driver will likely succumb to temptation to order one on the spot.

""Our hope is that they engage more with the brand and each other; word of mouth is such a strong sector to produce new clients,"" Baldi says. ""We want more and more women to drive a Lamborghini."""
"As Healthcare And Politics Intersect, Doctors Urge Patients To Vote.",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/adairalandry/2024/10/01/as-healthcare-and-politics-intersect-doctors-urge-patients-to-vote/,2024-10-01T16:05:11Z,"Five years ago, a young woman with stabbing abdominal pain arrived at my emergency department. Her blood pressure steadily dropped as she developed pale, clammy skin. We told her, ""You are bleeding into your abdomen. We see blood on your ultrasound. We are worried you are having an ectopic pregnancy."" Within minutes, she was in the operating room getting a life-saving surgical procedure for a ruptured ectopic pregnancy, a type of pregnancy that is considered non-viable for the fetus.

Remarkably, our pregnant patient survived. Yet, what stands out today is that the legality of our care, years ago, was never a concern. The team was centered only on providing the care she needed.

The Political Landscape of Healthcare

Today, the delivery of healthcare has become increasingly politicized. The recent overturn of Roe v. Wade reversed rights for pregnant people, leaving many vulnerable under recent state abortion bans. In states where exceptions for ectopic pregnancies exist within their abortion ban, women have still encountered hospitals that ""refused to treat their ectopic pregnancies."" This shift in regulation underscores the intersection of healthcare and politics, a reminder of how both physicians and patients should engage in the democratic process.

While a growing number of politicians have healthcare expertise, many lack a nuanced understanding of medical practice and healthcare delivery. This knowledge gap creates challenges when those who regulate medicine are not the ones providing it. ""Doctors and patients should be protected to make collaborative decisions -- without the intrusion of politics"" says Dr. Sharon Malone, physician, patient advocate, and author. The intertwining of politics and healthcare complicates efforts to address fundamental health issues. ""We haven't agreed on the most basic tenant: does everyone in this country deserve healthcare?"" she argues.

Aspects of healthcare influenced by politics extend beyond women's health. Insurance reimbursement, gun violence, criminalization of illicit substances, pharmaceutical cost-regulation are just a few active political issues that affect patient outcomes.

The Need for Voter Registration

As of 2022, there are approximately 162 million registered voters in the United States, leaving millions without a voice in upcoming elections. The journey toward change begins with voter registration. Politicians, like Elizabeth Warren, are working to streamline this process, recently announcing that patients filling out health insurance forms via HealthCare.gov will receive information about voter registration. ""The health of our democracy depends on Americans registering and exercising their right to vote,"" Warren stated.

In Minnesota and Pennsylvania, leaders have designated August as Civic Health Month to emphasize the importance of voting on healthcare. And yet, despite the clear push to increase patients' civic engagement, some critics -- including physicians -- oppose discussing voter registration in clinical settings.

Stanley Goldfarb MD, has been outspoken against doctors speaking with patients about voter-registration. He argues that ""leftists are making the doctor's office a major cog in their voter-registration and turnout machine."" Why the act of registering to vote at the encouragement of a doctor feels threatening or unwarranted is unclear to me, a physician who routinely witnesses the profound and direct impact politics has on patients. His organization, Do No Harm, states that they are focused on ""combating the attack on our healthcare system from woke activists.""

""Many believe that doctors should 'stay in their lane' and not become involved in the political process, as [patients] may see this as a conflict and not get care,"" Dr. Ayana Jordan, Associate Professor at NYU School of Medicine argues. She clarifies that our role is to be non-partisan and avoid swaying patients in our direction. ""Our role is to ensure that patients understand how to register to vote, make this process as easy as possible, and discuss issues most pertinent to them."" she adds.

Critics fear that doctors will abuse their power to sway patients towards their own individual political agenda. ""It's not just ""vote"". It is vote for Joe Biden, if we are honest. Inherently, the doctor's political bias is reflected in the encouragement. What happens if the patient's father is wearing a MAGA hat. Do you still remind them to vote?"" says one physician, Vinay Prasad MD MPH.

I do agree that physicians should certainly not impose their own beliefs onto patients. And that if they ask one patient to register to vote they should indeed ask all, when clinically appropriate. However, it is countercultural to see physicians grossly avoiding the empowerment and education of patients. A physician need only say, ""I'm sorry you can't afford your life-saving medication"" once for it to be clear there's no effective solution in that statement.

Why Clinicians Should Encourage Voting

In 2022, the AMA declared that voting is a social determinant of health. Dr. Alister Martin, physician, CEO and Co-Founder of A Healthier Democracy, a non-partisan organization that is determined to increase voter registration among patients, says that ""data demonstrates that across rural and urban regions, when voting rates are high, health outcomes are better."" While he believes the exact cause is hard to pinpoint, he suspects areas with high voter engagement are better able to pull in resources that help patients access healthcare. ""These communities have more specialty clinics, hospitals remain open, health centers are available. In the rural areas with less civic engagement, there are more hospital closures."" adds Martin.

Martin emphasizes that voting fosters a sense of agency among patients. ""Those who vote generally feel more empowered to effect change in their lives."" He also highlights a concerning statistic: 72 million eligible individuals are not registered to vote, a gap that can influence electoral outcomes and therefore healthcare related policies.

Encouraging voter registration is not only legal but also supported by leading healthcare organizations, such as the AMA. The encouragement should not be invasive, biased, or demanding. Martin advocates for integrating questions about voter registration into patient social histories, asking, ""Do you smoke? Drink? Are you registered to vote?"" He believes that by enabling patients to exercise their voting rights, we can all contribute to a healthier democracy."
"Amazon's Bizarre 'Reacher' Spinoff Is Officially Happening, And It's Still A Bad Idea",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/10/01/amazons-bizarre-reacher-spinoff-is-officially-happening-and-its-still-a-bad-idea/,2024-10-01T16:05:02Z,"Jack Reacher is a solitudinous guy. The massive-framed super-hobo likes to work alone. In every Lee Child book, Reacher is effectively a one-man army with a heart of gold. He tends to team up with side characters in every novel. Sometimes these are cops, almost always he finds himself in close proximity to a beautiful woman. Occasionally, a recurring character pops back into the story. Usually it's someone we haven't seen in awhile.

One of these characters is Frances Neagley, a partner at a private security firm who knows Reacher from their days as Military Policemen in the U.S. Army 110th MP Special Investigations Unit. She shows up in exactly four books, is mentioned in a fifth and has a role in a Reacher short story.

Amazon and the creators of the hit streaming Alan Ritchson-led show Reacher decided to expand Neagley's role in the series, having her appear in both of the first two seasons, with an expanded role in Season 2. In some ways, this makes sense for a TV show where viewers enjoy seeing familiar faces. This is especially true of a character like Reacher, always on the road meeting new people and facing new bad guys and other challenges.

The problems with this move, however, are also pretty obvious: For one thing, even in the books, the story is always weakest when Reacher is tied down by anyone or anything. This is a story about a singular -- and very single -- man. His girlfriend arc early in the series is painful, for instance. The charm of Jack Reacher is that he's a wandering warrior monk of sorts, a dharma bum, a man with no possessions except the shirt on his back and the toothbrush in his pocket. He's the Jack Kerouac of action heroes. If anything, Neagley's role in the series is way too big -- not because she isn't a good character, but because Reacher himself is a lone wolf and these stories aren't about his friendships, but rather about the people and places his drifter lifestyle brings him to with every new adventure. Maybe that will matter less in a spinoff, but there are other issues to think of which I'll get to in a moment.

A return from Neagley in Season 4 would have made sense, because there would have been a break as we met new characters along the way. As a major character -- in a full team of Reacher buddies, no less -- it felt forced. I'd argue that one of Season 2's biggest weaknesses was making Reacher just another guy in a team of badasses instead of showing himi as the force of nature that he was in Season 1 (where he also had a team, but they didn't all join in all the fist fights). That was just one of many problems with the hugely disappointing second season.

All this serves as preamble to news that a Reacher spinoff is now officially happening. My colleague Paul Tassi reported on this when it was just a ""maybe"" but now it's actually happening. Tassi noted at the time that Neagley isn't that popular of a character or that interesting of one, at least as far as leads go and I agree.

This brings us to the second big problem with this spinoff. I'm just not sure who this show would be for in the first place. Who is the intended audience here? Reacher appeals to a pretty obvious crowd: Men (and women) who enjoy action movies and Reacher books. I put ""women"" in parentheses because while I know many women enjoy male-dominant entertainment, the vast majority of viewers for this kind of show are men. This is not an opinion; it's a demographic reality. And while men also enjoy shows with female leads, I question whether there is a big enough Neagley fanbase in the Reacher community to bring decent numbers to a show that doesn't include Alan Ritchson's Reacher.

Will this be an action show geared towards women? Or a show that tries to bank on Reacher's popularity without actually including our titular tower of muscle? If so, good luck with that. Then again, as Tassi also pointed out, this will be a much cheaper spinoff than many of Amazon's big shows.

Currently, the spinoff is being referred to as ""The Untitled Neagley Project"" and will star Maria Sten who plays Neagley in Reacher. The series does have a blurb already:

""When she learns that a beloved friend from her past has been killed in a suspicious accident, she becomes hell bent on justice. Using everything she's learned from Jack Reacher and her time as a member of the 110 Special Investigators, Neagley puts herself on a dangerous path to uncover a menacing evil.""

A beloved friend from the past killed in suspicious circumstances? Isn't that the plot to Reacher Season 2?

The news was broken at the Prime Video Presents: Trailblazers event in London, where Sten told the audience: ""I love Neagley. She's so fun to play, she's so quirky and has so much complexity."" I do love that the star of the show is enthusiastic about her character. I just question whether that will translate to success. I hope I'm wrong and we get a compelling new action-mystery.

Reacher creator Nick Santora and Law & Order writer Nicholas Wootton developed the spinoff and will serve as co-showrunners. Amazon MGM Studios, Skydance Television and CBS Studios are producing the series. A release date has not been announced, though it seems likely it will land after Season 3 of Reacher when that returns for a third and hopefully much-improved season."
JD Vance Vs. 'Childless Cat Ladies': VP Candidate's Views Explained Ahead Of Tonight's Debate,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2024/10/01/jd-vance-vs-childless-cat-ladies-vp-candidates-views-explained-ahead-of-tonights-debate/,2024-10-01T16:04:55Z,"Sen. JD Vance, R-Ohio is likely to be asked at Tuesday's vice presidential debate about comments he made denouncing Vice President Kamala Harris and others as ""childless cat ladies"" who don't have a ""direct stake"" in the country's future, which reflects a worldview that has affected Vance's policy views as he stands to be a heartbeat away from the presidency.

Vance will face off against Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz at Tuesday's debate in Philadelphia. The debate comes as the Harris campaign and Walz -- a cat owner himself -- have repeatedly highlighted Vance's ""childless cat ladies"" comments on the campaign trail. Walz has posted videos with cats and said when Taylor Swift endorsed Vice President Kamala Harris, ""It's not as if I didn't warn these guys a few months ago: You mess with cat people, you will find out."" The governor attacked Vance for his comments even before he was named Harris' running mate in August, criticizing the senator for apologizing to cats instead of women for his comments and telling MSNBC, ""My god, they went after cat people ... It would be funny if it wasn't so sad.""

In comments to right-wing journalist Megyn Kelly about his ""childless cat ladies"" comments going viral, Vance said his remarks were ""obviously ... a sarcastic comment"" and he has ""nothing against cats,"" but defended his broader views. ""People are focusing so much on the sarcasm and not on the substance ... and the substance of what I said, Megyn -- I'm sorry, it is true,"" Vance said.

Vance's views that emphasize the importance of married families with children echo views espoused by the Heritage Foundation, a private right-wing organization with close ties to Vance that's recently come under fire for its 900-page policy agenda for a second Trump presidency known as ""Project 2025."" The Heritage Foundation has publicly called for ""encouraging marriage at the front end of a woman's childbearing years"" in order to increase the birth rate, and Project 2025 heavily emphasizes the importance of the nuclear family and imposing policies that strengthen it. The policy blueprint calls for ending ""LGBTQ equity"" initiatives and others in the Department of Health and Human Services and ""replacing such policies with those encouraging marriage, work, motherhood, fatherhood, and nuclear families,"" for instance, along with restricting abortion rights and eliminating federal healthcare mandates around contraception coverage. About the Heritage Foundation's proposals, Vance spokesperson Taylor Van Kirk told Forbes, ""The views of any outside group have zero effect on JD's policy positions -- full stop."" Vance's office also directed Forbes to comments Vance has made noting Project 2025 has no affiliation with the Trump campaign and saying he thinks ""there's some good ideas in there"" and ""there's some things that I disagree with.""

Vance's comments denouncing ""childless cat ladies"" have drawn widespread condemnation from the left, particularly from female voters. Actress Jennifer Aniston said in an Instagram post she ""truly can't believe that this is coming from a potential VP of the United States."" Addressing Vance, she added ""I pray that your daughter is fortunate enough to bear children of her own one day."" Swift's post endorsing Harris was accompanied by a photo of the singer holding her own cat. Former Rep. Gabby Giffords, D-Ariz., also criticized Vance on X, saying she is a ""proud mom"" of stepchildren -- like Harris -- and she and husband Sen. Mark Kelly, D-Ariz., were trying to conceive through in vitro fertilization before she was shot in 2011. ""To suggest we are somehow lesser is disgraceful,"" Giffords said. While Harris has not commented on his attacks directly, her stepdaughter Ella Emhoff posted an Instagram story saying, ""How can you be 'childless' when you have cutie pie kids like Cole and I,"" referring to her brother. ""I love my three parents,"" she added. Harris also garnered a significant amount of high-profile support from female voters in her campaign's opening days as Vance's comments first went viral, with more than 100,000 women joining a Zoom call Thursday to support the Harris campaign and fans of Taylor Swift mobilizing for the vice president.

How Vance's policy views would actually affect a potential Trump presidency. The vice presidential candidate is likely to fall in line with Trump's chosen policy agenda, and the ex-president has publicly espoused more moderate positions than Vance on issues like abortion, calling for the issue to be left up to the states. (Abortion rights advocates believe he may take harsher action if elected, however.) Trump has also publicly distanced himself from Project 2025 and its more extreme proposals, though many involved with his first presidential administration helped author the policy agenda.

Trump named Vance as his vice presidential candidate on July 15 as the Republican National Convention was underway, siding with allies like son Donald Trump Jr., who had pushed for Vance to be the nominee over more moderate choices like Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., and North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum. Vance was elected to the Senate in 2022 and was previously best known as the author of memoir ""Hillbilly Elegy."" He notably spoke out against Trump in the 2016 election before he ultimately claimed his views had changed and he now strongly supports the ex-president. Trump's selection of Vance has come under increasing scrutiny as his more extreme views have gone viral and as President Joe Biden dropped out of the 2024 presidential race and Harris replaced him, shaking up a contest that polling previously suggested could go more easily for Trump. The vice presidential candidate has struggled in the polls, with a FiveThirtyEight analysis finding he is the least popular non-incumbent vice presidential nominee since at least 2004, and The Hill reported even some House Republicans denounced him as Trump's running mate."
Why You Should Get Life Insurance Before You Develop A Chronic Illness,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/anne-lysengatta/2024/10/01/why-you-should-get-life-insurance-before-you-develop-a-chronic-illness/,2024-10-01T15:20:30Z,"More than half of Americans will develop a chronic illness at some point in their life according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

Life insurance should be a key part of your plans as it provides security for your loved ones in the event of your death. It is an important safety net to have, especially if you have people in your life that you help take care of financially like young children, or a spouse who is a homemaker.

However, it is harder to have life insurance after you have been diagnosed with a chronic illness. That's why life insurance is a wealth-building tool that you should have as early as possible.

I started carrying life insurance outside of my place of work in my late 20s. So, I'm paying a small amount for a significant policy. However, in late 2022, I wanted to increase my premium since it was still inexpensive for me.

Even though my life insurance policy should be enough, term life insurance is still very affordable for a healthy woman or man in their 30s, so I wanted to increase the policy.

While I knew that the premium rises yearly as you get older, life was busy and I didn't get around to doing it, which is something I truly regret.

However, in late 2023, like 39.5% of Americans, I developed a form of cancer. I was diagnosed with Stage 3 Triple Negative Breast Cancer, a very aggressive form of Breast Cancer at age 38. I have been receiving costly health treatments since.

According to Policy Genius, a cancer survivor under 45 years old may be able to get life insurance coverage through their workplace group life insurance policy, which will expire if they leave their job.

People older than 45 qualify for guaranteed issue life insurance, a form of whole life insurance, which is very expensive, and more beneficial to people who already have significant wealth and want to preserve it, as explained in a 2023 YouTube video.

For people like me who never had a serious or chronic illness until recently, suddenly everything changes. ""Now I'm considered ""a high-risk person"" by life insurance companies, even though my cancer is in remission. When I completely beat cancer, I will still be considered high-risk by the insurance company, like any cancer survivor. So, I will face a significant premium.

I have had solid life insurance for a decade and I am so thankful for that. If you don't already have a policy, I hope that you purchase one after reading this story.

Term-life insurance outside of your job makes sense because of its affordability, which gives you room to invest the difference that you would pay for a whole life policy. In addition, the fact that the policy doesn't expire when you switch jobs makes it a great option.

Life insurance increases by 5 to 8% each year in your forties and by 9% to 12 % if you're in your fifties according to Investopedia,

It is in your best interest to get a life insurance policy as early as possible. If you didn't sign up in your 20s or 30s to get the best rates, remember it is best to sign up now than later as the premiums keep increasing.

Life insurance is an inexpensive tool to help your family build wealth. It provides security to your loved ones. It allows them to function without the person who passed away, and without worrying about being able to stay in the same house, or the same school district, to pay for childcare, or to participate in the usual activities. Life insurance is the last gift you leave your loved ones to ensure that they have a good life."
"Signet Jewelers CEO Virginia C. Drosos To Retire, Successor Named",Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/anthonydemarco/2024/10/01/signet-jewelers-ceo-virginia-c-drosos-to-retire-successor-named/,2024-10-01T15:10:08Z,"Signet Jewelers, the world's largest retailer of diamond jewelry, said Tuesday that Virginia ""Gina"" C. Drosos is planning to retire as chief executive officer and as a member of the board of directors. Her 12-year tenue will end November 4.

Signet's board of directors has appointed retail industry veteran, J.K. Symancyk, to succeed Drosos. He will also join the Signet board at that time. Following her retirement, Signet said Drosos will continue as an advisor through the end of the company's fiscal year to support a smooth transition. Symancyk will be based at Signet's offices in Dallas.

Signet said in a statement the change in leadership is part of a planned long-term succession strategy.

Signet Jewelers, a publicly traded company based in Akron, Ohio, and domiciled in Bermuda is one of the largest jewelry retailers in the world with a market cap of $4.33 billion and sales in the 2024 fiscal year of $7.17 billion. Its businesses cover the breadth of jewelry retail in the U.S. Canada and U.K., with companies ranging from traditional jewelry retailers Kay, Zales, Jared to digital jewelry retailers, Blue Nile and JamesAllen.com. In the U.K. it owns H.Samuel and Ernest Jones and in Canada it owns Peoples Jewellers. It employs nearly 30,000 persons.

Drosos was appointed Signet CEO in July 2017 and has served as a director of Signet's board since 2012. Under her leadership, the company's market capitalization has quadrupled since the start of the pandemic, the company said. Signet has earned distinctions as a four-time Certified Great Place to Work, included for five consecutive years on the Bloomberg Gender-Equality Index and the number 12 company on the Fortune and Great Place to Work 2022 Best Workplaces in Retail. Under her watch, the company's board of directors and Signet's leadership team are the most diverse in its history.

Drosos has more than 30 years of executive leadership experience in the consumer goods, beauty and healthcare industries, as well as retail. She has been recognized by WWD x FN x Beauty Inc 50 Women in Power (2023), as one of the Top 50 Women CEOs by Women We Admire (2022), EY's Entrepreneur of the Year (2017), Cincinnati USA Regional Chamber of Commerce's Woman of the Year (2017), Ohio Venture Exit of the Year (2016), Fortune's 50 Most Powerful Women in Business (2010, 2011), the YWCA Career's Woman of Achievement (2008), and the Cosmetic Executive Women Achiever (2007).

""Gina led Signet in its transformation journey with strategic clarity, disciplined decision-making and a purpose-driven mindset,"" said Helen McCluskey, chair of Signet's Board of Directors. ""Under her leadership, in the last five years the company expanded its market share by nearly 50% and significantly grew its digital presence. During Gina's tenure as CEO, she and the team increased e-commerce sales fourfold and transformed the company's financial results, reducing gross debt outstanding by over 90%, nearly doubling liquidity, and over the last four years expanding adjusted operating margin more than 70% - all helping to drive Signet's Total shareholder return near the top of its retail peer group for the past one, three, and five years.""

Drosos said it is the right time for her retirement as the next phase of growth is planned.

""I am proud of and thankful for our team and partners. Together, we have delivered strong results and transformed Signet into a purpose-inspired and modern jewelry industry leader - creating a truly connected commerce shopping experience, a strong financial platform, and a diverse, inclusive and winning culture,"" Drosos said.

We are confident he is the ideal CEO to build on the team's progress in establishing Signet as the growth and innovation leader of the jewelry industry.""

Symancyk, in the company statement, talked about his passion for serving customers. ""Signet's position as a leading global jewelry retailer with a diverse portfolio of renowned brands provides a competitively advantaged foundation for continued growth,"" he said. ""One of the key attributes that drew me to Signet is its purpose-driven and agile culture and focus on putting its team members and customers first. I am focused on working with Gina and the executive team, along with the Board, through the transition and look forward to capturing the opportunities ahead.""

""We are also excited to recognize Joan Hilson's contributions, particularly in creating a strong financial foundation and growing services portfolio,"" McCluskey said. ""We look forward to her making an even larger impact in her expanded role."""
Which Countries Have Been Female-Led?,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/katharinabuchholz/2024/10/01/which-countries-have-been-female-led/,2024-10-01T14:32:01Z,"Claudia Sheinbaum takes office as Mexico's president today, thereby adding a country among the world's most populous to the nations that have been female-led. Sheinbaum will be Mexico's first female leader. She is also a decorated climate scientist and has been called the ""most scientifically experienced climate premier in history"". As a member of outgoing President Andrés Manuel López Obrador's party, she is expected to carry on many of her predecessor's populist left-wing policies.

Sheinbaum is 62 years old, of Jewish ancestry and has won a Nobel Peace Prize together with other participants of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 2007. She contributed to the panel's report that year as well as in 2013 after having received her doctorate in energy engineering and having served as Minister of the Environment for Mexico City. She was also the city's mayor from 2018 to 2023.

Mexico is the 11th largest country in the world by population and the seventh biggest that has been governed by a woman. Looking at a world map of all countries that have been female-led or repeatedly female-led since 1946, the American continent as well as Europe stick out as the places that have seen several female heads of state and government.

In Latin America, more countries have also become female-led recently. As seen in data by the Council on Foreign Relations, additions to the list include Honduras, where Xiomara Castro has governed since 2022, and Peru, where Dina Boluarte has been in power since the same year. In total, 12 countries in Latin America have been female-led, but only Argentina and Haiti have been so repeatedly.

In Europe, there are more countries which have been led by female politicians more than once. This includes Switzerland, which tops the list with five female heads of state, including current president Viola Amherd. The country has an advantage, however, as presidents' terms are limited to one year and are assigned on a rotating basis.

Finland comes second with four female prime ministers or presidents, including Sanna Marin, who was premier from 2019 to 2023. Iceland has also counted four female leaders, with Vigdís Finnbogadóttir having been world's first female elected president in 1980 and the current president, Halla Tómasdóttir, also being a women. Two more women, Jóhanna Sigurðardóttir and Katrín Jakobsdóttir, served as prime ministers.

Three females prime ministers each have led the country in the United Kingdom as well as in Poland and New Zealand. Lithuania saw one female president, who is the representative of the country abroad, and two female prime ministers, who share powers with the president. In India, Indira Gandhi was the country's face as prime minister from 1966 to 1977 and again from 1980 to 1984, while two of the country's representative presidents have also been women, including current officeholder Droupadi Murmu.

South Asia stands out as the most female-led place in Asia, with Bangladesh and Sri Lanka also having seen two female leaders each -- the same number as the Philippines. Southeast Asia and East Asia have seen fewer female leaders, as has Central Asia as well as the Middle and Near East. Africa has also not experienced many female leaders despite new additions including the current prime minister of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Judith Suminwa Tuluka, the current Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan, and the current representative President of Ethiopia, Sahle-Work Zewde."
Backyard Barometers To Blockchain And AI: The SkyX Weather Revolution,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/digital-assets/2024/10/01/backyard-barometers-to-blockchain-and-ai-the-skyx-weather-revolution/,2024-10-01T14:10:27Z,"Growing up, the weather wasn't just small talk in our house -- it was the main event. My dad's passion for meteorology -- he actually filmed for a major TV network -- turned our home into a mini weather station, complete with barometers, anemometers, and even a few strategically placed cameras to capture nature's most dramatic moments.

Little did I know that those childhood experiences would one day intersect with cutting-edge blockchain and AI technology in a way that could revolutionize how we understand and interact with the weather.

Enter Decentralized Physical Infrastructure Networks, or DePIN -- a concept taking the blockchain world by storm. And now, it's set to transform something as fundamental as weather forecasting. As someone who grew up pouring over wind directions before social media was a thing, this development is a compelling mix of nostalgia and innovation.

Think of DePIN as the Wikipedia of physical infrastructure. Instead of relying on centralized systems (like the weather stations I used to beg my dad to visit), DePINs harness the power of individuals. People like you and me can contribute data and maintain the network, earning rewards for our efforts. It's like if my dad could have earned crypto for all those hours he spent filming thunderstorms!

SkyX is bringing the DePIN model to weather data collection, and it's got me as excited as my dad used to get about an approaching cold front. Here's the lowdown:

Needless to say, Dad would have loved this! But it's not just for meteorological mavens. It stands to benefit everyone by transforming the accuracy of this famously unpredictable science.

As Frank Fang, the co-founder of Skyx said to me, ""The DePIN model has already proven its ability to crowdsource diverse and granular datasets quickly and at low costs. However, the result is raw, unprocessed data that requires further work to create actual value - a task that businesses may not have the funds or capacity for.""

""SkyX's platform takes care of that, offering software for generating industry-specific insights as its product. This way, we are building up on the concept of DePIN to make its value proposition even more immediate and palpable for both retail and enterprise users.""

I lost count of the times my dad used to (accurately!) predict rain for our street while the TV weatherman or -woman said it'd be sunny. This highlights a long standing problem with traditional weather forecasts: they only provide very broad-brush predictions. Watch the weather on TV, even today, and you'll see a rain or sun symbol covering your whole county or even state.

With SkyX's dense network, everyone can have an almost street-by-street-level of accuracy through hyperlocal forecasts. The weather station you've always wanted could now pay for itself through cryptoeconomic rewards, turning weather into a source of income.

From farmers to festival planners, everyone benefits from more precise weather data, making services smarter and more efficient. Better data also means better disaster preparedness, potentially saving many lives.

And with SkyX's AI interface (SkyXGPT), complex weather data could become as easy to understand as my dad's enthusiastic storm explanations, truly making weather accessible for all.

This isn't just about more accurate rain forecasts. It's about filling the gaps in our global weather monitoring system, especially in remote areas. It's the democratization of weather data -- something my dad always dreamed of when he talked about the importance of local observations.

Of course, such advanced capabilities are only possible through harnessing the most sophisticated back-end technology and infrastructure. SkyX picked peaq as their blockchain platform, and for good reason. Peaq's specialized features for DePIN applications, like robust identity management and secure data storage, are crucial for a network of verifiable weather stations. It's the solid foundation this sky-high ambition needs.

""SkyX's value proposition obviously exceeds that of an average earlier-generation data collection DePIN, which only had raw data to propose,"" said Leonard Dorlöchter, co-founder of peaq. SkyX leverages this community-contributed data to offer businesses actual analytical products ready to generate actionable insights while also rewarding the contributors. It's a sign that the wider DePIN space is maturing and is now beginning to offer the world increasingly advanced, enterprise-grade products - an offer that I am sure will be met with much interest.

Challenges and Limitations:

While promising, SkyX's approach isn't without challenges. Ensuring data quality from thousands of individual stations is a significant hurdle. There's also the question of standardization and calibration across diverse equipment types.

Additionally, regulatory frameworks for such decentralized data networks are still evolving. Privacy concerns and the potential for data manipulation are areas that SkyX and similar platforms will need to address as they grow.

As I reflect on those days spent watching the skies with my dad, I can't help but feel we're on the brink of something he could only have dreamed of. SkyX and DePIN aren't just changing weather forecasting; they're inviting all of us to become part of a global community of weather observers.

Imagine a world where every backyard weather enthusiast, every curious kid with a rain gauge, and every farmer with generations of weather wisdom can contribute to and benefit from a global weather network. It's a world where my dad's passion for local weather observations scales to a global level, powered by blockchain technology.

This isn't just about more accurate forecasts or earning crypto rewards -- though those are certainly exciting prospects. It's about creating a more connected, informed, and resilient global community. It's about empowering individuals to play a crucial role in understanding and preparing for the challenges posed by our changing climate.

With initiatives like SkyX, we're not just forecasting the weather; we're fostering a deeper, more participatory relationship with our environment. We're turning everyday weather watchers into custodians of crucial climate data, and in doing so, we're weaving a web of knowledge that spans the globe.

So, the next time you look up at the sky, remember: you're not just observing the weather. You're potentially part of a vast, decentralized network that's revolutionizing how we understand and interact with the atmospheric world around us. And who knows? The weather station you set up in your backyard today could be the source of tomorrow's life-saving forecast or groundbreaking climate research.

In the emerging horizons of blockchain-powered meteorology, we're all invited to become the weather heroes my dad always knew we could be. The future of weather forecasting isn't just in the clouds -- it's in our hands, our backyards, and our shared data. And that future? It's looking sunny with a high chance of innovation."
Katy Perry's New Album Debuts In The Top 10 On Five Charts At Once,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2024/10/01/katy-perrys-new-album-debuts-in-the-top-10-on-five-charts-at-once/,2024-10-01T14:10:23Z,"The rollout of Katy Perry's new album 143 has not gone as well as many had hoped -- likely including the singer herself. The set produced a trio of singles before it was released in full, and all of them underperformed to some extent. It looked for a time like the full-length might have been headed for a disappointing launch, but at least in the U.K., the set turned out to be a sales smash.

143 debuts inside the top 10 on no fewer than five charts in the U.K. this week. Sales powered the dance-pop project to a lofty start on all of them, though fans in the country also streamed the set in large numbers as well.

Perry's latest full-length starts its time highest on a pair of rankings, as it begins in the same position on both the Official Physical Albums and Official Vinyl Albums charts. 143 enters at No. 4 on those lists, which marks the title's loftiest placement on any roster in the United Kingdom.

Looking at all forms of purchases, 143 also reaches the Official Albums Sales chart, where it begins its time at No. 5. The studio effort is also new to the Official Albums Downloads list, as it enters that tally at No. 7.

Looking beyond just sales, Perry's 143 also manages to hit the top 10 on the U.K.'s main albums chart. On that competitive roster, which uses a methodology that combines purchase and streaming activity, the pop icon is back at No. 6.

143 reaches one more ranking in the U.K., though it's one that has nothing to do with purchases. Perry's first new full-length in several years blasts onto the Official Albums Streaming chart at No. 76. It's clear based on where the project starts on that roster that sales are largely responsible for the set's success.

As 143 debuts, the album's lead single ""Woman's World"" is on the rise, while the two more recent cuts spun off as potential hits don't succeed. That track returns to the Official Singles Sales chart at No. 97 this frame. It's also back inside the top 10 on both the Official Physical Singles (No. 7) and Official Vinyl Singles (No. 9) tallies."
Fashion Brands To Check Out This Fall 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/nadjasayej/2024/10/01/fashion-brands-to-check-out-this-fall-2024/,2024-10-01T13:34:43Z,"Fall fashion is here. Just as global fashion weeks are in full swing, setting trends for the upcoming Spring/Summe 2025 season, some fall trends never go out of style. Whether its tartan skirts, knee high boots, wide leg jeans or turtlenecks, some items remain timeless for your fall and winter closet.

This fall is all about neutral colors, laid back style, oversized cuts and blazers. Keep your caramel-colored wool coat and update your cozy sweater collection. Here are some brands to check out this fall, from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles, Australia, and beyond.

Luxury brand Oleada recently held a pop-up at the M.M.LaFleur in New York City, and has a whole 'back to school' vibe with their latest collection of bags, from mini bags to oversized totes and everything in between. It's really for the working woman. Some of the brand's favorites include the Reverie Tote, which has a thick, adjustable shoulder strap, and the Wavia Bag Plus, which can easily be transformed into a backpack (and is a perfect stylish bag for carryon luggage). On the brand's website, they have a work quiz that anyone can take to see what style of bag fits their work style and schedule the best.

Shoe brand Dolce Vita is becoming a fan favorite in New York City, especially since they opened their flagship store in Soho. Now, the brand just launched their new extra wide boots like, called Boots That Fit. The boots come in three different calf sizes, catering to all types of women (standard, wide, and extra wide). The boots are mainly knee-length boots, but others are shorter, too. Some of their latest styles include the Auggie Boot and the Graya boot, sized from size 6 to 13.

Artless was founded in February 2021 by creator and entrepreneur Madison Orlando, with an ode to 1990s minimalism. This brand's fall winter collection features cashmere sets in blue and purple hues -- adding an upscale touch to timeless items. ""The new collection was truly inspired by my own desire,"" said Orlando. ""I really thought about the pieces that I gravitate toward in the cooler months, focusing specifically on what I felt was missing in my own closet. I didn't own a cashmere polo and I had never really seen something like that before, so I created one. I love matching sets, so I designed a super-soft knit crewneck and pants set that is perfect for day-to-day wear, travel, or even a night out."" She adds that the Mercer Dress and matching Top are an evolution of the brand's best selling asymmetrical styles.

If any brand is an up-and-coming It Girl brand, it has to be Laud. Founded by Maddy Cloud, the brand has a deep respect of minimalistic design, comfort and quality garments. This environmentally conscious has closet staples, and offers inspiration on what to wear and how to wear it. This stylish brand recently celebrated their one year anniversary on September 26 with a limited-edition sequin mini skirt and created a fun, fabulous, pink-themed birthday campaign. Their latest items for fall include their oversized Blazer, available in black, brown and gray, their Trouser, their flowing Trenchcoat and their Perfect Long Sleeve Tee.

They're known for their minimalist chic, luxe fabrics and timeless items, like their hero Baby Tee, Mini Skirt, Tank, Maxi dress and more. ""It can all be paired with just about anything,"" notes Cloud. Stars like Natalie Suarez, Sophie Schwan, Vanessa Hudgens, Drew Afualo, Alex Cooper, Carmella Rose, and Shanina Shaik count themselves fans of Laud, which will continue to expand their collection this fall.

Nobody does ""relaxed glamor"" quite like Mint Velvet. For fall, the much sought-after brand has some delicious items in their new arrivals -- from the the British brand, which was co-founded by three friends, Liz Houghton, Jane Rawlings and Lisa Agar-Rea, in 2009. Stylish and understated is the name of their game, and all of their items are elevated and elegant. Even a few pieces will help transform your fall closet.

Some of the trendiest pieces that Mint Velvet has for fall is their Neutral Wool Blend Cable Knit Cardigan, which goes well with jeans, or the Leopard Print Ruffle Blouse, which ties into this year's comeback of animal prints. The blouse has a high neck, ruffle detailing and long sleeves, with buttoned cuffs.

If you need a gorgeous blouse to dress up an outfit for day or night, check out their Rust Ruffle Detail Blouse, which goes well with wide leg dress pants and statement jewelry. The blouse has a V-neckline, ruffle detailing and a cape-like overlay, that ties up in the front. It's a classy, fun and feminine casual look.

Another relaxed, glamorous look that Mint Velvet offers is simple, minimal looks, like the Black Knit Bardot Jumper, which goes well with a long jean skirt, dress pants. The bardot's scooped, off the shoulder loneckline is a French favorite (hence its name, after French actress Bridget Bardot), and a favorite to Kate Middleton, too, who has been spooted wearing this timeless style.

Semi-precious stone bracelets have come to gain popularity in recent years, thanks to the rise in spirituality. No longer do we just get our birthstone, but rather stones for symbolic purposes. In Los Angeles, Stepan Zhamkochyan hand makes gemstone bracelets, which are individually curated to each client's needs.

""The myth and lore around gemstones have been influenced over the years by a variety of cultures,"" said Zhamkochyan. ""Crystal healing was widely believed in acient Egypt, Greece and China -- philosophers and mystics have been inspired by their powers."" Get them here.

Damson Madder is a womenswear brand with an eye for quality. Their women-led team is based out of North London and makes small runs of items (up to 35 items per drop). Their latest collection includes fall-friendly items like their Rafe jeans in navy pinstripe, a wide leg jean with pockets which pairs up well with cozy sweaters for fall. Their red and blue Piarra mini smock dress is also a must have for fall, not to mention one of their wide collared shirts. Stars like Ella Emhoff and Ilana Glazer have been spotted wearing their garments, too.

Posse may have cute sets and fancy dresses, but don't underestimate the casual items from their latest collection, too. Their Hugo sweater in Stripe is a must-have cotton swater for fall. Their fall collection is called ""Volume II,"" and showcases intricate embroidery and vintage-inspired prints. Known for their feminine cuts and earthy hues, their latest collection of dresses, sets, and swimwear add a fun layer to a fall wardrobe.

Australian brands have been infiltering the American fashion market, and Viktoria & Woods is one of them. The brand, celebrating their 20 anniversary, takes the laidback Australian vibe and adds an edge, sometimes professional and sleek, other times bohemian. Their Aura collection showcases items like their Ridgemont blazer, their off-shoulder Velodrome dress and their Austin mules. Their approach to slow fashion fills a much-needed contrast to a fast-paced work life.

Since it was first founded in 1989, Calpak (short for California Pak) has climbed the ranks of the travel gear world to provide some of the most stylish suitcases around. Co-founded by Edward and Judy Kwon, they quickly grew as a small brand as a mainstay for stylish travel. As part of their new collection for fall travel, their Trnk Large Luggage in Trnk Almond is a vintage style roller trunk that stands 29 inches high and features a TSA-approved lock and an expandable design for travelers who love to shop (it offers an additional 2 inches of room).

Los Angeles-based luxury fashion label Rue Sophie is accessible, not just for its price point, but for their stretchy fabrics that help fit most of us.

Some of their key items for fall include their green wool pants, their black turtleneck and their simple black dresses. Rue Sophie believes in the power of minimalism, and their fall collection is full of silhouettes, slip dresses, blazers, wool coats, and silky camisoles.

The brand was born in Salt Lake City and was co-founded by Jon and ginger Parrish who felt there was a gap in the market for quality, stylish hats at an affordable price point. Their fall collection includes their Rowan hat in an autumnal green, which is an unlikely hue for a hat, but is attention grabbing and subdued simultaneously.

Native Shoes is celebrating their 15th anniversary by bringing back their popular shoe, the Apollo 10. This sneaker was launched in 2014 but is back by popular demand with eco-friendly materials, like their Sugarlite foam that uses less harmful chemicals) and a design revamp for extra added comfort. The brand partnered with pro skateboarder Sebo Walker for this launch, too.

A Conversation With Jessica Berman Commissioner NWSL,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/bradadgate/2024/10/01/a-conversation-with-jessica-berman-commissioner-nwsl/,2024-10-01T13:20:55Z,"Jessica Berman was named Commissioner of the National Women's Soccer League (NWSL) in 2022. Since stepping in to her role as Commissioner in 2022, the NWSL under Berman's leadership has seen skyrocketing franchise valuations and sales, partnership gains, the signing of the largest-ever media rights deal for a women's sports league and most recently, the signing of a historical collective bargaining agreement that makes the NWSL the first U.S. sports league to eliminate its draft and give players full control over where they play.

In 2023, Commissioner Berman announced landmark media partnerships for domestic media distribution with CBS Sports, ESPN, Prime Video and Scripps Sports, generating record breaking distribution and revenue for the NWSL and marking a key turning point for league viewership; As of 2024, there are over 120 games that can be watched on national broadcast platforms. The NWSL continues to build momentum under Commissioner Berman. Between the 2022 - 2023 season, game attendance increased by 32%, and crowds of 10,000+ more than doubled, setting the average attendance record in 22 years of women's professional soccer in the U.S. To date in 2024, social media followers are up 198% since 2023, and the January transfer window led to a record 22 players joining the NWSL from the world's best leagues.

Commissioner Berman led the league's expansion to 15 clubs, established record valuations and reset the enterprise value of the franchises by more than 10 times. She also navigated the NWSL through a comprehensive internal investigation into abuse allegations, resulting in substantial culture reforms. In 2024, Berman was named a CNBC Changemaker, and her leadership contributed to the NWSL being named number five on Fast Company's list of the World's 50 Most Innovative Companies of 2024. She was also recognized as Sports Business Journal's Best Hire in 2022 and was named Executive of the Year by Sports Business Journal in 2024, the first woman so honored in the history of the award.

Previously, Berman was Deputy Commissioner at the National Lacrosse League as the first female deputy commissioner of a men's professional sports league, and she spent 13 years at the National Hockey League, where she contributed to collective bargaining and drove community engagement and growth. Prior to that she was a labor lawyer at Proskauer Rose LLP. A University of Michigan alum and Fordham University law graduate, Berman sits on the University of Michigan Sport Management Advisory Board and the Fordham Sports Law Forum Board of Advisors. Berman also serves on the U.S. Soccer Board of Directors, the Sports Innovation Lab Women Executive Network, and the UJA Sports for Youth Committee; is a founding member of the Pro Sports Assembly, which is dedicated to promoting diversity & inclusion in the professional sports industry; and is the Vice Chair of the Sports Integrity Global Alliance (SIGA) Advisory Board that aims to create tangible DE&I changes within sports.

We asked Commissioner Berman about the recent growth under her stewardship and future of NWSL. Below are her responses.

The NWSL's new Collective Bargaining Agreement has been called the most ""player-centric"" of any U.S. professional sports league. What are the specifics of the new CBA and the reasoning? Do you foresee other professional leagues copying the NWSL?

Our new collective bargaining agreement grants NWSL players unprecedented agency in where they play, in addition to higher compensation and increased benefits.

On ""agency"", otherwise known as choice, most significantly, we are the first professional sports league to eliminate the Draft. That means that every new player who enters our league will be able to choose where to play. We made this decision, in large part, because we compete in a global labor market for talent and there is a global framework in soccer that forms a set of expectations that we have now embraced. There is nothing standing in the way of achieving our vision: we want to be the best league in the world that attracts, retains and develops top talent.

In addition, the agreement significantly raises the minimum salary, sets aggressive increases in the annual salary cap and creates incentive alignment for players and clubs by increasing the salary cap based on increases in league revenues.

The salary cap has been negotiated into the CBA in two parts: (i) a base salary cap at prescribed levels, and (ii) a supplement that will be determined in the prior year based on media and sponsorship revenue. The base salary cap for the NWSL will nearly double over the term of the agreement, from $3.3M (2025) to $5.1M (2030), with an expectation of further increases based on the revenue sharing model, further incentivizing a collective ambition to grow the NWSL's business. The NWSL also retained the unilateral ability to raise the Base Salary Cap further at its discretion.

There is no limit for an individual player's maximum annual salary, and the league-minimum salary will more than double over the course of the CBA, rising from $48,500 in 2025 to $82,500 in 2030.

Similarly, virtually all end-of-season competition bonuses will double their current value beginning in 2027, including those awarded for the NWSL Shield and Championship winners, Best 11, Rookie of the Year, Midfielder of the Year, Defender of the Year, Goalkeeper of the Year and the NWSL's Golden Boot. The NWSL's Most Valuable Player award will quadruple.

In a groundbreaking decision for a women's league, parental leave and fertility and childcare benefits will be further expanded under the new agreement, and mental health services and mental health leave policies will be broadened. We've introduced increases in benefits for family planning, which includes but isn't limited to, IVF, freezing eggs, and fertility treatments. In addition, we institute minimum standards for the number of health professionals utilized by each club, including physicians, athletic trainers, a physical therapist, a sports scientist, a licensed mental health provider, and a massage therapist.

When it comes to other leagues, we want to be a positive disruptor and the tip of the spear to help the industry think differently, particularly about women and women in sports. The rules that have governed men's sports for decades may not always make sense for our league, and we don't want to default into what everyone else has done without examining whether it makes sense for us. We want the takeaway for our industry to be that, in order to grow the business, we should continue to innovate, pressure test assumptions, and be willing to evolve.

The new CBA runs through 2030, how important was labor stability with the next round of media rights agreement beginning in 2028?

We negotiated a new 4-year media deal in 2023 which runs from 2024-2027; the prior CBA would have expired in 2026. We saw an opportunity entering a new media rights cycle, where we could create labor stability and incentive alignment with the players to grow our business.

Further, by negotiating the CBA proactively without an impending expiration, it gave us the opportunity to work together and imagine what's possible without any external pressure. In all CBA negotiations, there are compromises and trade-offs, and the manifestation of a good deal is when everyone feels like a winner. It was a unique negotiation because the driver for everyone at the table was the opportunity to align, ensuring readiness for this next phase of growth.

How does the NWSL retain top talent with such European competitive leagues such as the Women's Soccer League in England and Spain's Liga F?

We have massive respect for the European leagues who have compelling international rivalries and continually push us to raise the bar as the global standard for women's soccer continues to rise. When it comes to the NWSL, we believe strongly in our unique value proposition, including the elements of playing in the NWSL that do not exist in the rest of the world. For example, even the existence of a collective bargaining agreement which sets minimum standards for players is unique in the global women's soccer world, not to mention the fact that our minimum standards are the highest in the world through this new agreement. We are really proud of that.

We also believe that our structure is a unique differentiator - we are completely independent of any other institution, the federation or the men's league. That is quite different from the rest of the world. Practically speaking, that means our investors are making investments solely through the lens of what is in the best interest of our league, the NWSL.

Finally, we believe our country offers unprecedented opportunities for growing players' Name Image Likeness (aka NIL). Brands are investing in women and that creates incredible monetization opportunities for players outside of the NWSL as well.

The popularity of women's basketball and women winning 26 of 40 U.S. gold medals in the Paris Olympics including the USWNT, nonetheless, a study found women's sports receive only 15% of all sports media coverage. What must be done to get broader media coverage?

In short, a relentless continuation of the initiatives that have begun to change the tides.

There is finally recognition from the industry that there is an increasing demand for women's sports content, and it's rapidly changing how women's sports teams and leagues can and should be covered. Speaking to our media deal specifically, distribution is key in ensuring our matches, teams and players are reaching global fan bases. Our media deal with CBS, ESPN, Prime Video and Scripps has us reaching exponentially more fans and a consistent basis (new and existing) while maintaining our standards for economic growth. This deal expands our reach, revenue, and relevance.

With women's sports in particular, we have a fruitful and unique opportunity to really lean into the personal stories of our athletes and share each player's remarkable journey with our fans. Our athletes are fearless in their willingness to be authentic and vulnerable, and our media rights deal gives them the platform they deserve to educate and inspire a wider swath of fans.

With Robert Iger and Willow Bay acquiring a controlling stake in Angel FC for $250 million in July, the franchise is now the most valuable women's sports team in the world. Some professional leagues, including most recently the NFL, are allowing for private equity firms to invest in franchises. What ownership rules does the NWSL have with PE investors?

As we have seen an exponential increase in team valuations and the desire for institutional capital to invest in sports, we took steps earlier this year to establish clear guidelines around PE investors. Under our policy, no single PE fund can have passive ownership in more than 3 teams; a single fund can own minimum 5% and maximum 20% of a team, but no team can have more than 30% of equity from PE funds; and funds with multiple team investments need to have minimum capital. This provides clear guidance to the marketplace about the parameters under which we will consider institutional capital."
Son Na-Eun Explores Complex Family Dynamics In 'Romance In The House',Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/joanmacdonald/2024/10/01/son-na-eun-explores-complex-family-dynamics-in-romance-in-the-house/,2024-10-01T12:48:30Z,"When Mi-rae's father shows up years after his presumed death it's not a heartwarming reunion. Mi-rae, played by Son Na-eun in Romance In The House, has become even more protective of her mother and younger brother in the years since her parents' divorce and her father's disappearance. She remembers her father's well-intentioned but poorly-thought-out financial schemes that led the family to bankruptcy and divorce. Mi-rae watched her mother Ae-yeon, played by Kim Ji-soo, suffer because of his mistakes. So, when Moo-jin, played by Ji Jin-hee, tries to win over her mother, she's understandably wary.

""Mi-rae experiences a complex blend of love and hatred for her father, Moo-jin, stemming from the pain he caused her in childhood,"" said Son. ""Growing up without a father figure, she became a steadfast support for her mother, Ae-yeon, and a trusting big sister to her younger brother, Hyeon-jae. This environment forced her to mature quickly, transforming her into a Wonder Woman who lives and sacrifices for her family. As the story unfolds Mi-rae gradually untangles her feelings of resentment towards her father and I encourage audiences to pay close attention to how this emotional journey develops.""

Son was intrigued by the script for the SLL drama and the way the story evoked the complicated feelings that linger in a family after a divorce.

""Though Mi-rae's story revolves around her long-standing love-hate relationship with her father, it ultimately tells a tale of family,"" said Son. ""This dynamic is both compelling and captivating. Romance in the House is not your typical love triangle; instead, it's a melodrama featuring an ex-dad, a mother, and a daughter -- a refreshing take that feels new and inviting for me. As the eldest daughter in my own family, I found the script deeply relatable. I wanted to convey a range of emotions while embodying the character of Mi-rae, hoping to share this journey with viewers who might also find solace and connection within it.""

While filming the drama the cast quickly began to feel like family. Son became very close with her drama mother.

""Ae-yeon, Mi-rae's mother, is the one with whom she feels most at ease,"" said Son. ""Before filming began, we nurtured our bond by frequently strolling along the Han River and spending quality time together. This effort allowed me to genuinely see her as a real mom on set from a certain point. The drama also captures moments of tension and conflict between the father, Moo-jin, and the younger brother, Hyeon-jae. I believe that the relaxed and harmonious atmosphere we created on set enabled us to authentically convey the complex emotions of joy, sadness, and frustration that accompany family dynamics.""

One of the challenges Son found in playing Mi-rae was the range of emotions her character experiences toward her father. Son devoted considerable time to exploring those emotions.

""For a long time, she harbors deep resentment alongside love for him, but as she navigates various events, her feelings gradually soften,"" said Son. ""I carefully contemplated how to delicately convey this emotional journey, conducting research and engaging in in-depth discussions with the director. Above all, watching Moo-jin's performance on set allowed me to connect and synchronize with him, enriching our scenes together.""

Father and daughter take a while to reconnect and regain trust. That made it a rewarding role to play.

""As an actor, I find it fulfilling and rewarding to showcase different sides of myself through various characters, and portraying Mi-rae in Romance in the House has deepened my enjoyment of acting,"" said Son. ""I felt joy each time I connected with Mi-rae -- who is more relatable and grounded than glamorous -- and witnessed her growth as she became stronger step by step. I am especially grateful to hear that viewers fully empathized with Mi-rae and offered their unwavering support.""

Son, also known simply as Naeun, is both an actress and a singer, having debuted with the girl group Apink. Her recent dramas include Lost, Cinderella with Four Knights Dinner Mate, Ghost Doctor and Agency. The SLL drama Romance in the House also stars SHINee's Choi Min-ho as Mi-rae's love interest and Astro's Yoon San-ha as her younger brother. The drama airs on Netflix."
The 2024 Forbes 400 List Of Wealthiest Americans: Facts And Figures,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2024/10/01/the-2024-forbes-400-list-of-wealthiest-americans-facts-and-figures/,2024-10-01T10:03:24Z,"Inside Forbes' ranking of the richest billionaires in the United States.

Forbes calculated fortunes using stock prices from September 1, 2024.

's a record-smashing year for America's 400 richest people. After adding nearly $1 trillion to their fortunes over the past 12 months, The Forbes 400 are worth a collective $5.4 trillion, by far the most ever. It now takes a record $3.3 billion to make the list, up from $2.9 billion in 2023.

In general, the richer you were, the richer you got. Just 25 people -- a dozen of them worth $100 billion or more -- are responsible for $500 billion of the gains. These top 25 now holds more than $2.5 trillion in wealth, nearly half the list's total net worth.

The richest person in America, for the third straight year, is Elon Musk, who is worth an estimated $244 billion. Despite dropping $7 billion in wealth over the past year amid sputtering Tesla stock and an ongoing battle over his $56 billion stock options package, Musk remains some $47 billion ahead of No. 2 Jeff Bezos, the Amazon founder, who is worth an estimated $197 billion. Mark Zuckerberg (estimated net worth: $181 billion) climbed from No. 8 last year to No. 3 in 2024 thanks to the huge rebound in shares of Meta, the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.

Alice Walton continues her reign as the richest woman in the U.S., her ninth time in a decade. With shares of Walmart, which her father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962, up by 41% in the past year, she's worth an estimated $89.2 billion, good for No. 15 overall. Walton is one of just 67 women on The Forbes 400, up from 60 last year.

As a group, the list's women are worth a combined $839 billion, compared to $621 billion in 2023. Diane Hendricks ($21.9 billion) remains the wealthiest self-made woman in America, one of a record 13 women on the list who built -- rather than inherited -- their fortune.

Overall, 67% of The Forbes 400 is self-made, meaning they founded their own company or helped build one, though some traveled much longer and tougher paths to great wealth than others. Forbes once again assigned everyone on the list a self-made score, from 1 to 10, with 10 being the true rags-to-riches stories. Those remain rare -- just 25 out of the 400.

Despite it requiring more money than ever to make the list, 23 billionaires were able to elbow their way into the ranks this year. These newcomers include Todd Graves ($9.5 billion), who created the Raising Cane's fast food chain; Peter Cancro ($5.6 billion), who built and runs Jersey Mike's Subs; Jayshree Ullal ($4.4 billion), the CEO of cloud networking firm Arista Networks; Leonid Radvinsky ($3.8 billion), the owner of OnlyFans; and Alex Karp ($3.6 billion), the cofounder and CEO of data mining company Palantir.

Another 11 people who fell off a previous Forbes 400 list returned to the ranks this year. The most notable: Donald Trump ($4.3 billion), who has ridden the volatile stock price of Truth Social parent-company Trump Media & Technology Group back onto the list, part of a broader ploy to wring billions in wealth out of his political career.

These newcomers and returnees displaced several less-fortunate billionaires who lost their spot among the nation's richest people. Among this year's 30 drop-offs: Vince McMahon ($2.5 billion), who stepped down as executive chairman of WWE-parent company TKO Holdings in January amid sexual assault allegations, which he has denied. Aneel Bhusri ($3.2 billion) of software firm Workday, meanwhile, is one of ten 2023 400 members who got richer over the past year but were displaced by better-performing billionaires.

They join a growing list of American billionaires who are simply too poor to make the cut. For the first time ever, there are more American billionaires not on The Forbes 400 than there are on it: 415 and counting. That includes plenty of famous faces. Arnold Schwarzenegger ($1 billion) is not rich enough for this list. Neither are Jerry Seinfeld ($1.1 billion), Bruce Springsteen ($1.1 billion), Taylor Swift ($1.3 billion) or Oprah Winfrey ($3 billion).

The youngest member of the ranks is Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who is 38 years old and worth an estimated $33.9 billion. Venture capitalist and real estate mogul Josh Kushner ($3.8 billion), 39, is the only other listee under the age of 40. On average, the members of the 2024 Forbes 400 are 70 years old. The eldest is Dole Food Company's David Murdock ($3.7 billion), who is 101.

The richest Americans' net worths have skyrocketed, but their generosity has not. Forbes once again investigated the lifetime charitable giving of every member of the list. A third have donated less than 1% of their fortunes so far, earning a lowly 1 on the Forbes philanthropy score; only ten people -- 2.5% of the list -- have given away 20% of their riches or more, earning the highest mark, a 5."
The 2024 Forbes 400: The 25 Wealthiest People In America,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/chasewithorn/2024/10/01/the-2024-forbes-400-the-25-wealthiest-people-in-america/,2024-10-01T10:02:49Z,"was another great year to be rich, especially for the select few at the very top. With markets roaring, nearly all of the 25 wealthiest people in America got wealthier over the past 12 months -- some by billions, or even tens of billions, of dollars.

In all, the top 25 billionaires on The Forbes 400 list are worth a collective $2.5 trillion. They hold nearly half of the $5.4 trillion in total wealth of the entire 400.

This elite group is $471 billion richer than in 2023, with each of the top 25 up 31% on average, outpacing the 18% jump in wealth across list members overall and the S&P 500's 27% return.

Much of the gains come from two people: Meta's Mark Zuckerberg, who added $75 billion to his net worth thanks to rebounding Meta stock, and Nvidia's Jensen Huang, who has ridden the AI wave to $63.3 billion in additional wealth since the 2023 ranking. They're two of a record 12 members of The Forbes 400 who are also in the $100 Billion Club, the lucky group of tycoons whose fortunes stretch a dozen digits.

Most of these 25 were among the top 25 last year, too. But there are three fresh faces: traders Jeff Yass (who ranked No. 28 in 2023) and Thomas Peterffy (who was No. 27), plus Walmart heir Lukas Walton, who jumped from No. 31 last year to No. 25 in 2024 on the back of the retailer's rising stock. They replace MacKenzie Scott, the ex-wife of Jeff Bezos, who continues to give away her fortune; Miriam Adelson, whose shares of casino operator Las Vegas Sands have hit a cold streak; and investor Len Blavatnik, whose stock in Warner Music Group is worth less than a year ago. Zuckerberg jumped five spots, to No. 3; Huang jumped six, to No. 11.

Only three members of the top 25 got poorer over the past year: Elon Musk, whose fortune dropped by $7 billion but who remains the richest person in America; Bill Gates, after we increased our estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement with Melinda French Gates; and Phil Knight, following a rough run for Nike stock since last year.

Here are the top 25 members of the 2024 Forbes 400 list:

One of Sam Walton's eight grandchildren, he inherited an estimated 4% stake in Walmart from his father, John Walton, who died in a 2005 plane crash. Lukas, who survived childhood cancer, founded and runs Builders Vision, a sustainability-focused philanthropic and impact-investing platform that has doled out more than $3 billion since launching in 2021. He is one of just two Forbes 400 members under age 40 (the other: VC investor Josh Kushner, No. 347, who is 39). His mother, Christy Walton (No. 48), cosigned a letter urging President Biden to withdraw from the 2024 election in July and has been fundraising for Kamala Harris. Two members of the family's third generation still sit on Walmart's board: Jim's son Steuart Walton (Lukas' first cousin) and Rob's son-in-law Greg Penner, who is chairman.

""On the doorsteps of the Olympic Games,"" Knight wrote this summer in a letter to U.S. athletes, whose jerseys Nike designed, ""we need to reignite the passion, desire and the want to win."" His sportswear giant could use a pep talk, too. Nike stock is down 15% since last year, making Knight, who created the company with his University of Oregon track coach in 1964, one of just three in the Top 25 to be poorer than in 2023.

Peterffy is more than $10 billion richer than last year as shares of Interactive Brokers Group, the electronic trading firm he founded in 1993, rose 30%. The company booked $4.3 billion in revenue last year, a 42% year-over-year increase. Since he failed to persuade Virginia Governor Glenn Youngkin to enter the Republican presidential primary race, Peterffy, a longtime supporter of free-market policies, has kept quiet on Trump's reelection bid.

Griffin's hedge fund, Citadel, the most profitable of all time, raked in $8.1 billion in trading profits last year. Since then, Griffin, never one to leave money idle, has donated $50 million to the University of Miami, dropped $45 million on a Stegosaurus skeleton (a record price in the dinosaur auction business) and shelled out more than $90 million for an estate in Saint-Tropez, France.

In August, Schwarzman and his wife announced plans to open their Miramar estate in Newport, Rhode Island, to the public as a museum upon their deaths. They spent $27 million on the Gilded Age mansion in 2021 and have been restoring it ever since. In May, Schwarzman, the cofounder and CEO of $1 trillion (assets) investment firm Blackstone, announced he's backing Trump for president, two years after vowing to support someone else in 2024.

In August, their Mars Inc. announced it's gobbling up snack and cereal maker Kellanova (formerly Kellogg's) for $35.9 billion. The deal will put brands like Pringles, Pop-Tarts and Froot Loops under the Mars umbrella alongside Snickers, M&M's and Kind bars. It's the company's biggest acquisition since it bought Wrigley in 2008 for $23 billion. The Mars siblings own an estimated two-thirds of the $50 billion (2023 revenue) business but have no role in daily operations.

Yass' fortune nearly doubled after Forbes revalued his trading firm, Susquehanna International Group -- and Yass' share of profits -- based on tax returns leaked to ProPublica. With a potential TikTok ban threatening Susquehanna's estimated 15% stake in the social media app, Yass has made nearly $70 million of federal political contributions during the 2024 election cycle, including $20.5 million to the Club for Growth Action, a conservative super PAC that has publicly opposed the TikTok ban (but denies having been influenced by Yass).

In June, Koch Industries became Koch, Inc., as Charles rebranded the increasingly tech-focused $125 billion (revenue) conglomerate for the first time since taking over the family firm after his father's 1967 death. Julia Koch, the widow of his brother David (d. 2019), and her three children paid nearly $700 million that same month for 15% of BSE Global, which owns the NBA's Brooklyn Nets and the WNBA's New York Liberty and operates the Barclays Center in Brooklyn.

Rob Walton retired from Walmart's board in June after more than four decades as a director of the firm his father Sam Walton (d. 1992) cofounded in 1962. He and his siblings' estimated 35% stake in the retail giant is worth more than ever as shoppers flock to Walmart's ""Every Day Low Price"" strategy to escape high inflation, driving both its revenue and shares to all-time highs. Jim still chairs the family's $26 billion (assets) Arvest Bank Group. Alice, the richest woman in America for the ninth time in 10 years, reclaimed the title of the world's wealthiest woman in early September from L'Oréal heiress Françoise Bettencourt Meyers of France for the first time since May 2022.

Dell scored his biggest payday ever in November, when semiconductor giant Broadcom acquired his cloud computing spinoff VMware; Dell swapped his 39% stake for an estimated $33 billion in cash and Broadcom shares. Around that time, he put $3.6 billion in cash and stock into his family's charitable foundation and pumped at least $500 million into a donor-advised fund. Dell's net worth is up 40% this year, thanks to 90% and 64% jumps in Broadcom and Dell Technologies share prices, respectively.

Huang keeps climbing into rarer air: He has added $63.3 billion to his fortune, pushing him up six more notches on The Forbes 400 (he jumped 31 spots last year), on the back of a 162% rise in Nvidia shares. As his wealth grows, so does his celebrity: Paparazzi followed his every move on a trip to his native Taiwan this summer -- a phenomenon termed ""Jensanity."" Huang cofounded Nvidia, which designs and sells more chips used for artificial intelligence systems than any other company, in 1993 and has served as CEO and president since.

The former mayor of New York City and cofounder of financial-data and media firm Bloomberg LP was awarded the nation's highest civilian honor, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, by President Biden in May. Over the next three months, Bloomberg announced $1.6 billion of gifts to the medical schools of his alma mater, Johns Hopkins, and four historically Black colleges.

The Microsoft cofounder's rank is lower than it has been in 34 years, due mostly to a new Forbes estimate of his 2021 divorce settlement. In September, Netflix released a five-episode series called What's Next? The Future with Bill Gates, which tackles topics including AI and income inequality. In February 2025, he's set to publish a memoir, Source Code. TerraPower, the next-generation nuclear power company he cofounded in 2008, broke ground on a demonstration plant in Wyoming in June. That same month, his ex-wife, Melinda, resigned as co-chair of the couple's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and walked away with $12.5 billion for her own philanthropy.

""Damn, I'm fired up!"" exclaimed Ballmer in August at the grand opening of his Los Angeles Clippers' new 18,000-seat Intuit Dome stadium, which boasts a 38,000-square-foot circular scoreboard. He bought the Clippers a decade ago for a then-record $2 billion after running Microsoft as CEO for 14 years, and spent $2 billion of his own money on the new stadium; Forbes now values the team at more than $4.6 billion.

Net worth: $136 billion | Source of wealth: Google | Age: 51

A federal judge ruled in August that Page and Brin's Google acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in online search, which is responsible for 57% of parent company Alphabet's sales. (The tech giant reportedly plans to appeal.) Shares hit an all-time high in July thanks to Google's continued push into generative AI and cloud services, including a partnership with Oracle, before slipping in recent months.

More than seven decades in, the investing legend is staying plenty busy. In August, Berkshire Hathaway became America's first non-tech company to hit $1 trillion in market capitalization. In June, Buffett -- the nation's greatest philanthropist, with some $60 billion in lifetime giving -- donated $5.3 billion of Berkshire stock, with a twist: He clarified that the vast majority of his remaining fortune will go to a charitable trust run by his three children, instead of the Gates Foundation, as was previously assumed.

It was another banner year for the Oracle cofounder, chief technology officer and more than 40% shareholder, with the software firm's shares up 12% to record highs. He's spending accordingly: Ellison splashed out nearly $300 million on a Florida resort in August, adding to his $2 billion-plus real estate portfolio. He also plans to invest a reported $6 billion into the on-again-off-again merger between Paramount Global and Skydance, his son David's media production company.

No one got richer over the past year, in sheer dollar terms, than Zuck. He's $75 billion wealthier, and ranks five spots higher, following a 75% runup in Meta Platforms stock. Revenue has been growing more than 20% per quarter, and the social media giant repurchased $31 billion of its shares over the past year. Zuckerberg, who turned 40 in May, has taken on a new look, sporting a gold chain, letting his wavy hair grow out and ditching his uniform hoodie for a shearling jacket. He also surprised his wife, Priscilla, with a seven-foot-tall statue in her likeness.

Since last summer, Bezos has snapped up three homes on Miami's ""billionaire bunker"" island for $234 million. He has the cash: Since moving to tax-friendly Florida last November, the Amazon founder has offloaded more than $8 billion (pretax) of his shares; he still owns 9% of the e-commerce Leviathan, whose stock is up 29%. The Bezos Earth Fund, through which he has given $2 billion of a $10 billion pledge, will hand out up to $100 million to winners of an AI for Climate and Nature challenge beginning later this year.

Tesla's self-proclaimed ""technoking"" tops The Forbes 400 for the third straight year, despite losing $7 billion as shares of his electric vehicle maker fell 14% and a Delaware judge voided $56 billion of his stock options in January. In May, Musk's new AI startup, xAI, raised $6 billion at a $24 billion valuation. A month later, his rocket maker, SpaceX, launched a tender offer valuing the company at around $210 billion, up from nearly $180 billion. In an X post seen by 220 million, Musk endorsed Donald Trump within an hour of the assassination attempt on the former president. Trump now vows to name Musk to a new government efficiency commission if elected."
The Richest Woman In America 2024,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/mattdurot/2024/10/01/the-richest-woman-in-america-2024/,2024-10-01T10:02:35Z,"or the ninth time in a decade, Alice Walton-the only daughter of late Walmart founder Sam Walton-is the richest woman on this year's Forbes 400 ranking of the wealthiest people in America.

With shoppers flocking to Walmart's ""Every Day Low Prices"" to escape high inflation, the retailer's stock is up 41% since the 2023 Forbes 400, pushing the 74-year-old Walton's net worth to an estimated $89.2 billion, up from $66.5 billion. She is $15 billion richer than the second-richest woman in the U.S., Julia Koch -- who inherited 42% of privately held conglomerate Koch, Inc. (formerly known as Koch Industries) from her husband David Koch (d. 2019), and who briefly took Walton's title as America's wealthiest woman in 2022.

Walton, who ranks No. 15 on The Forbes 400 overall, is now within spitting distance of becoming the second-ever female centibillionaire. L'Oréal heiress Francoise Bettencourt Meyers, who is a citizen of France, joined the $100 billion club in June but fell to around $88 billion on September 4, when Walton briefly surpassed her to become the world's richest woman for the first time since May 2022. (Bettencourt Meyers reclaimed the title on September 26, with an estimated $92.6 billion fortune.)

Despite selling more than $28 billion of Walmart stock over the past decade -- and giving away more than $11 billion of the retailer's shares -- Sam Walton's heirs still own nearly 45% of the Bentonville, Arkansas-based behemoth, due to significant stock buybacks that have prevented the family's stake from being diluted. Forbes estimates that three-quarters of the clan's stock is split almost evenly between Alice Walton and her siblings Jim (No. 13 on this year's list, worth an estimated $95.9 billion) and Rob Walton (No. 14, $94.3 billion). Most of the rest of the Walton family fortune belongs to the heirs of their brother John Walton (d. 2005): his widow Christy Walton (No. 48, $16.4 billion) and their son Lukas Walton (No. 25, $33.9 billion).

The youngest of Sam Walton's four children, Alice Walton was 12 years old when her father opened the first Walmart store in Rogers, Arkansas in 1962. She worked briefly at the family retailer, as a buyer of children's clothes, after graduating from Trinity University in Texas in 1971, before taking a job in New Orleans as a stockbroker for E.F. Hutton. Walton returned to Bentonville during the 1980s to run investment operations at her family's Arvest Bank, before launching a lending and brokerage shop of her own called Llama with $19.5 million of family money. When Llama shut down in 1998, Walton moved back to Texas and shifted her focus to curating art.

She chaired the Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art in Bentonville for a decade, before handing the reins to her nephew Tom Walton's wife, Olivia Walton, in 2021. Alice is credited with founding the museum, which sits on 120 acres and features works by the likes of Andy Warhol and Georgia O'Keeffe, after realizing there wasn't anything like it within 300 miles of her family's hometown. Nearly all of the $1.6 billion it cost to open the facility in 2011 came from trusts in the names of her late brother John Walton and mother Helen Walton (d. 2007).

Alice Walton has ramped up her own philanthropy over the past decade, however, pouring more than $5.7 billion into five family charitable foundations that have doled out more than $1.1 billion of her funds to date. That includes an estimated $380 million gifted through the Walton Family Foundation (which her parents founded on Walmart's 25th anniversary in 1987) to organizations focused on education reform, the environment and the region surrounding Bentonville. It also includes more than $375 million that Alice's Art Bridges Foundation has spent acquiring and loaning out works of American art to more than 230 museums across the country -- including the Art Institute of Chicago, the MoMA in New York City and the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. -- since its founding in 2016.

Walton is also seeking accreditation for a new Alice L. Walton School of Medicine in Bentonville that will ""enhance traditional medical education with the arts, humanities, and whole health principles."" If all goes according to plan, the school will enroll its inaugural class of four-year MD candidates in 2025.

""Over the past several years, I've founded new organizations focused on the arts as well as health and well-being,"" Walton said in a press release announcing her retirement as chair of the Crystal Bridges museum in 2021. ""I'd like to focus more fully on my board chair roles at these entities."""
'Gyeongseong Creature' Season 2: What The Netflix K-Drama's Creators Want You To Know,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/reginakim/2024/09/30/gyeongseong-creature-season-2-what-the-netflix-k-dramas-creators-want-you-to-know/,2024-10-01T04:04:01Z,"Netflix has released the second season of Gyeongseong Creature, which sees Park Seo-joon's and Han So-hee's characters reunite in present-day Seoul to face off against supernatural evil forces once again.

Amid all the heart-pounding fight sequences, plot twists, and the introduction of both new and returning characters, there's admittedly a lot to keep up with in this seven-episode series, and audiences might be left with some lingering questions about the show.

To help viewers gain a deeper understanding of some of the key points in the second season of Gyeongseong Creature, I've included below some interesting insights that were shared with the press by the show's director Chung Dong-yoon and writer Kang Eun-kyung.

According to Kang, ""In Season 1, Najin appeared as a terrifying entity that transformed humans into monsters. In Season 2, Najin emerges as a force that stimulates and fulfills human desires. Najin's ability to provide absolute power and infinite vitality raises the question: is this a curse or a blessing for humanity?""

For Tae-sang specifically, najin empowers him to exact revenge. ""But in a more positive light, it could also be seen as his personal struggle,"" Chung noted.

In the final scenes, Chae-ok is seen leading a normal, najin-free life after Tae-sang breaks the water tank that she was trapped in.

Director Chung offered a possible rationale for Tae-sang's actions:

""Perhaps Jang Tae-sang wanted the woman he loved to lose all her dreadful memories and live a truly ordinary life. It's possible he gifted Chae-ok the mundane life she once dreamed of. Eventually, they meet on a street, and Chae-ok, while vaguely recalling distant memories, unknowingly smiles sadly. Tae-sang also smiles back at Chae-ok, who recognizes him. It seems that those who are destined to meet will eventually find each other.""

Gyeongseong Creature was originally intended to be a single-season show with 20 episodes that took viewers from 1940s Gyeongseong to present-day Seoul, but it ended up being split into multiple seasons.

""Seasons 1 and 2 were planned together from the beginning, and the fact that Season 2's story is set in the modern era is the part that sets this season apart,"" Chung noted. ""The elements I wanted to highlight in Season 2 were the remnants of Japanese imperialism and the romance between Master Jang and Yoon Chae-ok.""

""Despite the 79 years that have passed and the advancements we've seen, those who threaten, divide, and exploit the world for their own gain still exist. I wanted to highlight this persistence and encourage the audience to reflect on what must never be forgotten, and why remembering is so important,"" Kang commented.

Both Director Chung and Writer Kang stress the ""importance of remembering the past and the people who must never be forgotten.""

According to Kang, ""Gyeongseong Creature is not just about the historical pain of a particular time but about the pervasive fascism that has existed throughout history and still lingers today. The story explores how violence and power subjugate the weak, how sacrifices are falsely justified for the 'greater good,' and how the normalization of such sacrifices can turn anyone into a monster. Power without humanity has always left horrific scars on human history, and the creature in the series embodies this very message. The series focuses on the stories of those who confront these moral boundaries.""

While Netflix hasn't yet announced any plans to renew the show for a third season, the current enthusiastic response from audiences across the globe could bode well for fans who are hoping for another season. If that happens, hopefully the next installment will answer some burning questions like, will Chae-ok ever get her memories back? What will Seung-jo do with all those vials of najin? And what about that sneaky Detective Park who double-crosses Detective Yuh Myung-joon -- will we ever learn what might become of him?"
'Gyeongseong Creature' Season 2: What To Know About Its Mysterious Characters,Forbes,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/reginakim/2024/09/30/gyeongseong-creature-season-2-what-to-know-about-its-mysterious-characters/,2024-10-01T03:40:57Z,"The second season of the hit K-drama Gyeongseong Creature recently dropped on Netflix, landing in the streamer's list of the top 10 TV shows in the U.S. shortly after its release. Set in modern-day Seoul -- almost 80 years after the events of Season 1 -- this season starts off with a bang, packing in plenty of gore, action and suspense in its first 15 minutes.

After swallowing her mother's najin at the end of Season 1, Yoon Chae-ok (Han So-hee) continues her line of work as a private eye who tracks down missing people -- only now she's gifted with immortality and superhuman strength, speed and agility thanks to the najin. She runs into Jang Ho-jae (Park Seo-joon), who bears a striking resemblance to Jang Tae-sang, the pawnbroker from 1940s Gyeongseong that she fell in love with. Of course, that's because Ho-jae is Tae-sang -- it's just that he's lost his memory when Chae-ok encounters him in the streets of Seoul.

Over the course of seven episodes, Chae-ok and Ho-jae go up against Jeonseung Biotech and its army of najin-powered super soldiers. And like all those years ago, the pair learn that Lady Maeda is still pulling the strings behind the scenes, and that the evils of the past have carried on to the present.

This season introduces new characters alongside some returning ones, but given the intense and fast-paced storytelling, it might be hard to get a good sense of who they really are unless you're paying close attention throughout the show. So here are insights on some of the more mysterious figures from this season, based on answers provided to the press by the show's director Chung Dong-yoon and writer Kang Eun-kyung.

The leader of the Kurokos (played by Lee Mu-saeng) is a complex and mysterious character. According to the show's writer Kang, he's the son of Kato (the lieutenant colonel who was supervising the horrific human experiments in Season 1) and a Korean concubine -- meaning he's half-Japanese and half-Korean, just like Seung-jo. Meanwhile, his older half-brother Chairman Shin, who leads Jeonseung Biotech, is Kato's eldest son and born from a Japanese mother.

Due to his mixed heritage, the Kuroko Leader ""endured constant discrimination"" his entire life and ""was overshadowed by his elder brother, despite being superior in many ways. He voluntarily participated in Kato's experiments, seeking strength on his own terms to finally gain recognition as a valuable son,"" Kang noted. He worked his way up the corporate ladder at Jeonseung Biotech and was put in charge of running the underground laboratory, while Chairman Shin was named heir to the company.

Director Chung described the Kuroko Leader as someone who seems to be motivated by personal desires, as evidenced by his efforts to heal his disabled girlfriend using najin. ""On the surface, he seems to value order and control, but deep down, he resents both Maeda and his identity as Kato's son.""

Seung-jo (portrayed by Bae Hyeon-seong) is yet another complicated character who appears in Season 2. The son of the Japanese police commissioner Ishikawa and his Korean mistress Myeong-ja (who developed superhuman abilities and a taste for human brains after swallowing najin in Season 1), he struggles with his dual identity as a monster-human hybrid.

With his sweet, angelic face, Bae Hyeon-seong -- whom K-drama fans might remember from hit shows like Our Blues and Hospital Playlist -- seems like a rather interesting casting choice to play a villain, albeit a morally ambiguous one. ""Being naturally very kind and shy, we pondered how to make [Bae Hyeon-seong] appear more menacing,"" Chung noted. ""We decided that rather than forcing a false sense of malevolence, we should present our unique version of Seung-jo. His appearance with one eye covered in the final epilogue was truly striking. He did an excellent job portraying the darker side of Seung-jo.""

The malicious Lady Maeda makes a surprise return in Season 2, looking as youthful and radiant as ever thanks to her ingestion of najin. However, viewers are initially led to believe that she passed away or that perhaps the elderly Japanese woman played by Son Sook is Lady Maeda after all -- making the real Lady Maeda's entrance all the more shocking and dramatic.

""I wanted to keep Maeda hidden. Constantly keeping her hidden creates a sense of fear and shock about what isn't seen. That's why I initially had Son Sook play Old Lady,"" Chung stated. ""For Maeda, I thought it would be quite ironic for her to appear in bright white clothing. This was even more striking in the dark underground setting. I aimed to gradually bring Maeda into focus from blurry memories, creating a moment that would vividly imprint on Chae-ok's mind.""

Lady Maeda's appearance must've been a déjà vu moment for Chae-ok, who encountered her transformed mother in the same underground laboratory decades ago. And while Seung-jo and the leader of the Kurokos appear to be more morally ambiguous characters, Lady Maeda is the ultimate villain in this season -- just like what we saw in Season 1.

""Maeda does not feel true affection,"" Kang revealed. ""Her emotions are fueled by possessiveness, obsession, control, and self-righteousness. While some might mistake these for love, Maeda herself doesn't understand what love truly is or how to open up her heart. To her, both Tae-sang and Seung-jo were simply objects she desired to own. In the end, she remains the loneliest and most miserable character, having failed to possess anyone.""

The Kurokos are a group of najin-enhanced super soldiers that do Jeonseung Biotech's (and Lady Maeda's) bidding. They can easily climb up walls and move at lightning speed while always hiding in the shadows.

On crafting these creepy, stealthy warriors, Chung shared that he pictured them ""as a combination of ninjas and samurais dedicated to protecting the Maeda family.""

""We strived to depict them as unsettling, almost like large cockroaches. Their unique characteristics include making bizarre noises during their action sequences, attacking in groups, adhering to strict hierarchical obedience, and only appearing in dark places. In all, we aimed to show characters that move and flee like cockroaches, dislike light, and perform slightly grotesque actions,"" Chung stated. He added that Park Seo-joon helped conceptualize the Kurokos."
